\chapter{Results and Evaluation}
The end result of this project were risk topics generated from the potential emerging risk sentences, organized in different ways, this way providing a variety of results for evaluation.

\section{Experiment 1: Full}
The LDA was ran on the dataset consisted of documents with remaining emerging risk sentences, identified as such by the classification part (Section \ref{sec:classification}). The LDA was run with topic parameter set to 30 and 50.

\end{table}

Table \ref{table:allsetldatopics} illustrates the variety of topics retrieved from generating 50 topics using LDA on the filtered dataset. A lot of these topics are fairly specific and are suitable for labeling. For example, topic 3 is clearly speaking about flash memory storage, while topic 6 is related to emerging risks in media and advertising. However, some topics might be too specific, such as topic 8 which names specific states and companies ("Entergy"). Some other topics may be fairly generic and clash with existing constant topics (e.g. volatile stock price and topic 9).

\section{Experiment 2: First Mentions}
The LDA was run on the first occurences of similar sentences, in hopes of getting more diverse emerging risk topics. The attempt to generate 50 topics proved to be more informative.

\end{tabular}

\label{table:firstoccurencetopics}
\end{table}

Table \ref{table:firstoccurencetopics} gives an overview of the generated topics. Most of the topics are informative and could be labeled, but not all (Topic 0). Furthermore the topics include a lot of industry specific words, therefore possibly achieving the goal of specificity. Topics reagading media (Topic 7), offshore tax (Topic 8) and others can be idenfied.

\section{Experiment 3: Yearly}
Running LDA on every year reports was different from the other scenarios. It provided 10 topics for every year.

\caption{Unlabelled LDA Topics 2007}
\label{table:yearlylda2007}
\end{table}

As it can be seen from the examples of the results a lot of topics are difficult to label (e.g. Topic 0 in 2006 and Topic 6 in 2007), because they seem to be a mix of very different topics or the keywords might refer to very broad terms. It can also be noticed that some of the topics repeat throughout the years, just at different positions (e.g. clinical trials), which might indicate the change in importance of the topic or that they are no longer emerging. In general, the results from this LDA application method seem to be really difficult to interpret and make sense of. Therefore, this experiment does seem a little bit inefficient and not yielding satisfactory results.
