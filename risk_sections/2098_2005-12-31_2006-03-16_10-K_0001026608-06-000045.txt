Item 1A. Risk Factors The Company is subject to a number of significant risks that might cause the Company's actual results to vary materially from its forecasts, targets or projections, including: - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- o achieving planned revenue and profit growth in each of the Company's business segments; o changes in customer requirements and in the volume of sales to principal customers; o the timing of orders and shipments; o emergence of new competitors or consolidation of existing competitors; o industry demand fluctuations. Our expectations for both short- and long-term future net revenues are based on our own estimates of future demand. Orders from our principal customers are ultimately based on demand from end-users and such prospective end-user demand can be difficult to measure. Low end-user demand, would negatively affect orders we receive from distributors and other principal customers and this would mean that our revenues in any fiscal period could be adversely impacted. If our estimates of sales are not accurate and we experience unforeseen variability in our revenues and operating results, we may be unable to adjust our expense levels accordingly and our profit margins will be adversely affected. A number of our products are sold through distributors and large retailers. No assurances can be given that any or all such distributors or retailers will continue their relationship with us. Distributors and other significant retail customers cannot easily be replaced and the loss of revenues and our inability to reduce expenses to compensate for the loss of revenues could adversely affect our net revenues and profit margins. Loss of a Major Customer could result in a decrease in our future sales and earnings. - --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sales to our top three customers have accounted for approximately 41%, 43%, and 46% of total net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We anticipate that a limited number of customers may account for a substantial portion of our total net revenues for the foreseeable future. The loss of a major customer or a disruption in sales to such a customer could result in a decrease of our future sales and earnings. Reliance on foreign suppliers could negatively impact our business. - ------------------------------------------------------------------- We purchase the majority of our products from foreign manufacturing partners and, as a result, our business is exposed to increased risks due to: o Increases in transportation costs; o New or increased import duties; o Transportation delays; o Work stoppages; o Exchange rate fluctuations that could increase the cost of foreign manufactured goods. (5) The loss of key management could affect our ability to run our business. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Our success depends to a large extent on the continued service of our executive management team, operating officers and other key personnel. The Company must therefore continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and operating personnel sufficient to maintain its current business and support it projected growth. Our inability to meet our staffing requirements in the future could negatively impact our results of operations. Failure to protect our proprietary rights, or the costs of protecting these rights could negatively impact our business. - --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Company's success depends in part on its ability to obtain patents and licenses and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering its products and processes. The Company obtained certain domestic and foreign patents and intends to continue to seek patents on its inventions when appropriate. The process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that pending patents related to any of the Company's products will be issued, in which case the Company may not be able to legally prevent others from producing compatible competing products. If other companies were to sell compatible products, the Company's results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Company's efforts to protect its intellectual property will be successful. Any infringement of the Company's intellectual property or legal defense of such action could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company may need to raise additional capital to fund its operations. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The Company's management currently believes, under current conditions, that the Company's current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by operations, together with the borrowing availability under the Revolving Loan agreement, will be sufficient to fund planned operations for the next twelve months. However, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, we may be required to find additional funding sources. If adequate financing is unavailable or is unavailable on acceptable terms, we may be unable to maintain, develop or enhance our operations, products and services, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. We may not be able to maintain or to raise prices in response to inflation and increasing costs. - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Future market and competitive pressures may prohibit the Company from raising prices to offset increased product costs, freight costs and other inflationary items. The inability to pass these costs through to our customers could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments The Company had no unresolved Securities and Exchange Commission staff comments at December 31, 2005.
