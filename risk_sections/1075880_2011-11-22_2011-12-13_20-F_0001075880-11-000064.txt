Application of Critical Accounting Policies The significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 18 of this Annual Report. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. In determining the economic benefits, provisions are made for certain trade discounts and returned goods. Returns Over the last three years, returns and estimates of return liability were not considered material and are detailed below. Balance at Beginning of year Charged to Cost and Expense Actual Returns Balance at End of Year A$'000 A$'000 A$'000 A$'000 Allowance for Sales returns: Year ended June 30, 2009 47 277 288 36 Year ended June 30, 2010 36 75 110 1 Year ended June 30, 2011 1 126 127 0 34 Discounts Discounts are generally calculated as deductions off the Company’s invoice price and as such do not require significant judgment in determining accrual amounts. Over the last three years, the discounts and estimate of claims were not considered material and are detailed below: Balance at Beginning of year Charged to Cost and Expense Actual Discounts Balance at End of Year A$'000 A$'000 A$'000 A$'000 Allowance for Sales discounts: Year ended June 30, 2009 79 647 584 142 Year ended June 30, 2010 142 492 557 77 Year ended June 30, 2011 77 490 497 70 Inventory Adjustments Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company reviews the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales. The likelihood of any material inventory write-downs is dependent on rapid changes in customer demand or new product introductions by competitors. For additional information on significant accounting policies refer to Item 18 “Financial Statements” - Note 1 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”. Discontinued operations The Company looked at strategic alternatives for its consumer products business. The consumer products business was not part of the Company’s longer term focus of therapeutic drug development, which the Company is undertaking through its majority owned subsidiaries MEI and Glycotex. The Company commenced a planned process to dispose of this business and in April 2011 appointed a financial advisor to actively search for a buyer and complete the plan. This business has been classified as a discontinuing operation for the purposes of this report. On August 1, 2011 Novogen completed the sale of its consumer products business to Pharm-a-Care Laboratories Pty Limited for a total sale price of A$10.1 million in cash. 35 Results of Operations The following table provides a summary of revenues and expenses to supplement the more detailed discussions below: STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME for the year ended 30 June, 2011 Consolidated 2011 2010 2009 2011 A$'000 A$'000 A$'000 US$'000 Continuing Operations Revenue 2,025 1,784 2,504 2,173 Gross profit 2,025 1,784 2,504 2,173 Other income 512 7 - 549 Research & development expenses (3,902 ) (7,550 ) (18,138 ) (4,188 ) General and administrative expenses (9,562 ) (10,039 ) (6,286 ) (10,262 ) Finance costs (18 ) (15 ) (11 ) (19 ) Loss before income tax (10,945 ) (15,813 ) (21,931 ) (11,747 ) Income tax expense (1 ) (1 ) (1 ) (1 ) Loss after tax from continuing operations (10,946 ) (15,814 ) (21,932 ) (11,748 ) Profi/(loss) after tax from discontinuing operations 1,467 568 (1,855 ) 1,574 Loss for the period (9,479 ) (15,246 ) (23,787 ) (10,174 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) Net exchange difference on translation of financial statements of foreign controlled entities (net of tax 2011: Nil, 2010:Nil) (690 ) (1,079 ) 6,163 (741 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) (690 ) (1,079 ) 6,163 (741 ) Total comprehensive income (loss) (10,169 ) (16,325 ) (17,624 ) (10,915 ) 36 Operating Results – Fiscal 2011 compared to Fiscal 2010 Revenue The Group earned revenues from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2011 of A$2.0 million versus A$1.8 million in the previous corresponding period. The increase relates to additional royalty revenue recognised and dividend income received from a small investment the Company holds in Nox Technology, which was partially offset by a decrease in interest earned due to a reduction in cash balances held. The Company looked at strategic alternatives for its consumer products business. The consumer products business was not part of the Company’s longer term focus of therapeutic drug development, which the Company is undertaking through its majority owned subsidiaries MEI and Glycotex. The Company commenced a planned process to dispose of this business and in April 2011 appointed a financial advisor to actively search for a buyer and complete the plan. This business has been classified as a discontinuing operation for the purposes of this report. The group earned revenue from discontinuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2011 of A$11.4 million versus A$8.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2010. Consumer product sales Sales of consumer health care products for the year ended June 30, 2011 were A$10.8 million, an increase of A$2.8 million from A$8.0 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2010. The increase was primarily related to new distribution in Brazil and increased volume sold to the Company’s distributor in Italy. Other revenue from discontinuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2011 was A$0.5 million, an increase of A$0.4 million from A$0.1 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2010. The increase was as a result of signing an amended licence agreement with a European distributor to sell an alternate red clover product. This agreement replaces a previous licence agreement and included an upfront licence fee and an ongoing minimum royalty fee. Net loss The operating loss attributable to Novogen shareholders for the financial year, after allowing for losses attributable to non-controlling interests of A$3.0 million, reduced by A$5.8 million or 47% to A$6.5 million from a loss of A$12.3 million for the previous year. The net loss from continuing operations after income tax for the consolidated Group for the year ended June 30, 2011 reduced by A$4.9 million to A$10.9 million from A$15.8 million for the previous year. The reduction in the Group’s net loss for the year ended June 30, 2011 was primarily due to reduced research and development costs as the Company is refocusing on smaller clinical studies of its next generation drug candidates, representing savings from the large Phase III OVATURE study conducted in previous years. These savings have been partially offset by termination payments made in relation to the restructuring of the Australian business and the increased costs of developing the U.S. management team in MEI, to progress the Company’s oncology drug development program. 37 The net profit from discontinuing operations was A$1.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2011 compared to A$0.6 million for the previous year ended June 30, 2010. The increased profit was primarily as a result of the increased revenue earned from Brazil and Italy, combined with currency gains by this business segment, which are partially offset by corresponding currency movements in the Company’s other business segments. Operating Results – Fiscal 2010 compared to Fiscal 2009 Revenue The Group earned revenues from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2010 of A$1.8 million versus A$2.5 million in the previous corresponding period. The decrease was mainly due to lower interest receipts on lower cash balances, combined with unfavourable exchange rate impacts on royalty receipts. Consumer product sales Sales of consumer health care products for the year ended June 30, 2010 were A$8.0 million, a decrease of A$0.3 million from A$8.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2009. The decrease was related to a number of factors including discontinuing sales of the Aliten weight loss product in Australia and decreased consumer demand in the UK associated with the economic downturn. Sales were negatively effected by exchange rate movements as a result of a strengthening of the AUD compared to both the GBP and CAD. These decreases were partially offset by increased export sales from Australia to overseas distributor partners. Sales in Australia for the year ended June 30, 2010 was A$3.5 million, a decrease of A$0.2 million or 5% from A$3.7 million for the previous year. Sales in North America decreased A$0.3 million to A$1.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2010 compared to A$2.1 million for the previous year. Regulatory issues in Canada, which were resolved during the year, combined with the impact of negative exchange rate movements contributed to this decrease. Sales revenue in Europe remained constant at A$2.2 million for the year. Strong sales growth in Italy has offset declining sales in UK caused by the continuing economic downturn and negative exchange rate movements when converting sales denominated in GBP to A$. Costs and expenses Total expenses before interest and tax decreased by A$9.8 million to A$25.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2010 compared to A$34.9 million for the year ended June 2009. Cost of sales decreased A$0.3 million corresponding with reduced sales. 38 Cost of sales, which includes only costs associated with the sale of goods, decreased A$0.3 million corresponding with reduced sales from Australia and North America and improved gross margins on consumer product sales as a result of favorable currency movements on purchasing active ingredients from an overseas third party manufacturer. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales in fiscal year 2010 continued to decline due to the impact of the favorable currency movements on the cost of active ingredient in relative A$. Research and development expenses decreased by A$10.7 million reflecting cost savings following the termination of the Phase III Ovature clinical trial. Selling and promotional expenses decreased by A$2.4 million as a result of reduced marketing expenses associated with discontinuing sales of Aliten. General and Administrative Expenses increased by A$3.7 million primarily as a result of staff terminations described below. Net loss The operating loss attributable to Novogen shareholders for the financial year, after allowing for losses attributable to non-controlling interests of A$2.9 million, reduced by A$6.6 million or 35% to A$12.3 million from a loss of A$18.9 million for the previous year. The net loss from continuing operations after income tax for the consolidated Group for the year ended June 30, 2010 reduced by A$8.6 million to A$15.2 million from A$23.8 million for the previous year. The reduction in the Group’s net loss for the year ended June 30, 2010 was primarily due to costs savings related to the termination of the Phase III Ovature clinical trial, combined with reduced marketing expenses associated with discontinuing sales of Aliten. Other savings in administrative expenses were offset by the termination payments made to the Company’s CEO in December 2009 and termination payments for a number of other senior management staff as part of the Company restructure which took place in June, 2010, amounting in total to approximately A$3 million. This restructure is part of the continuing strategy to focus the Group’s resources towards oncology drug research and development. 39 Liquidity and capital resources Cash resources At June 30, 2011, the Group had total funds of A$6.0 million compared to A$15.1 million at June 30, 2010. During fiscal 2011, the Company had net cash outflows from operating activities of A$8.7 million compared to cash outflows of A$16.6 million in fiscal 2010. Cash was used to fund the Group’s operations including the drug development program undertaken by Novogen’s U.S. subsidiaries Marshall Edwards, Inc. (“MEI”), Glycotex, Inc. (“Glycotex”) and in connection with the restructuring of the Australian business following the transfer of the drug development program to MEI. The Company invests its cash and cash equivalents in interest bearing facilities with various maturity dates. At the end of fiscal 2011, term deposits amounting to A$0.7 million had a weighted average interest rate of 5.15% and cash deposits at call of A$5.3 million had a weighted average interest rate of 0.78%. The Company has a multi option facility with St George Bank Limited, an Australian commercial bank, of A$0.25 million, which was fully utilised to support the security deposit in place, required under the lease for the premises in North Ryde, at the end of fiscal 2011. As of June 30, 2011, the Group did not hold derivative financial instruments in managing its foreign currency, however, the Company may from time to time enter into hedging arrangements where circumstances are deemed appropriate. The Company believes that its current cash balance, which includes the cash received from the sale of its consumer business in August 2011, will provide sufficient cash resources to fund operations over the next twelve months. The Company’s subsidiaries will require additional funds in order to complete the planned clinical development programs. In order to obtain additional funding the Company’s subsidiaries may need to rely on collaboration and /or licensing opportunities. The Company cannot assure you that it’s subsidiaries will be able to raise the funds necessary to complete the planned clinical trial programs, or find appropriate collaboration or licensing opportunities. The Company has historically financed its operations primarily from equity capital. On August 1, 2011 the Company completed the sale of its consumer products business to Pharm -a-Care Laboratories Pty Limited for a total sale price of A$10.1 million in cash. 40 On September 30, 2011, the Company purchased 1,333,333 shares of common stock of MEI for an aggregate cash purchase price of US$2 million. The Company also committed to make an additional equity investment in MEI of US$2 million on or before June 30, 2012. During the three months ended September 30, 2011, MEI issued 1,294,000 shares of its common stock upon conversion of Series B warrants, for gross proceeds of US$1,269,000. The remaining Series B warants were exercised for 305,603 shares on a cashless basis pursuant to the Supplemental Agreement, dated September 28, 2011, to the May 2011 amended and restated securities purchase agreement. Also in connection with the Supplemental Agreements, MEI made cash payments to the private placement investors of US$365,000, and certain amendments were made to the Series A warrants to prevent further reduction in the exercise price of the Series A warrants upon the occurrence of certain events, including the subsequent sale or deemed sale by MEI of shares of common stock at a price per share below the exercise price of the Series A warrants, as amended. After giving effect to the Series B warrant issuances, no Series B warrants were outstanding and 2,250,564 Series A warrants were outstanding. In addition to the Series A warrants and the Series A convertible preferred stock of MEI held by the Company, as of September 30, 2011, there were outstanding warrants to purchase 248,003 shares of MEI’s common stock at exercise prices ranging from US$21.70 to US$36.00 per share, which expire at various dates in calendar years 2012 and 2013. Additionally, as of September 30, 2011 there were options outstanding to purchase 736,715 shares of MEI common stock at exercise prices from US$0.77 to US$6.30 per share, which expire at various dates in calendar years 2014 through 2016. There are no commitments for capital expenditure outstanding at the end of the financial year. See Note 15 to the Financial Statements “Financial Instruments” for disclosures about financial risk management including interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and liquidity risk. Research and Development Research and development policy Expenditure during the research phase of a project is recognised as an expense when incurred. Development costs are capitalised only when technical feasibility studies identify that the project will deliver future economic benefits and these benefits can be measured reliably. Development costs have a finite life and are amortised on a systematic basis matched to the future economic benefits over the useful life of the project. The Company spent A$4.4 million, A$8.1 million and A$18.8 million on gross research and development expenditure during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively. All of these costs have been recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income in the respective periods. 41 Due to the nature and uncertainty of the research and development projects being undertaken by the Company, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the cost and timing of project completion. The costs of research and development projects are not estimated on a project by project basis. An analysis of costs between projects may only be performed on an arbitrary and subjective basis. Trend Information The Company expects to consume cash and incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. The Company intends to continue its expenditure on the development of its subsidiaries’ oncology drug candidates. The impact on cash resources and results from operations will vary with the extent and timing of the future clinical trial program. It is not possible to make accurate predictions of future operating results. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Compensation Principles used to determine the nature and amount of remuneration Remuneration philosophy Remuneration is assessed for Directors and senior executives with the overall objective of ensuring maximum stakeholder benefit from the retention of a high quality executive team. The appropriateness and nature of remuneration is assessed by reference to employment market conditions. The financial and non-financial objectives of the Company are also considered when assessing the remuneration of Directors and other key management personnel. During the year the Company introduced a bonus scheme to assist with staff retention and financial performance. The scheme is aimed to reward all staff on the successful achievement of certain financial milestones. The Board has a Remuneration Committee which is responsible for determining and reviewing compensation arrangements for the key management personnel. Director’s fees The Constitution of the Company and the ASX Listing Rules specify that the aggregate remuneration of Non-executive Directors shall be determined from time to time by General Meeting. The last determination for Novogen Limited was at the Annual General Meeting held on October 28, 2005 when the shareholders approved an aggregate remuneration of A$560,000. The total Non-executive Director remuneration of Novogen Limited, including share based payments, for the year ended June 30, 2011 utilised A$415,000, (2010: A$212,000) of this authorised amount. The amount of aggregate remuneration sought to be approved by shareholders and the manner in which it is apportioned amongst Directors is reviewed periodically. Non-executive Director remuneration Fees to Non-executive Directors reflect the demands which are made on, and the responsibilities of the Directors. Non-executive Directors’ fees are reviewed periodically by the Board. In conducting these reviews the Board considers independent remuneration surveys to ensure Non-executive Directors’ fees are appropriate and in line with the market. 46 Each Non-executive Director receives a fee for being a Director of the Company. An additional fee is also paid for each Board committee on which a Director sits. The payment of additional fees for serving on a committee recognises the additional time commitment required by Non-executive Directors who serve on one or more committees. Due to the impact of the global financial crisis and the need for the Company to conserve cash, the Company’s Non-executive Directors voluntarily reduced Director’s fees by 20% with effect from February 1, 2009, this reduction was maintained for the year ended June 30, 2011. Executive Directors and other key management personnel remuneration The Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for determining and reviewing compensation arrangements for the key management personnel. The Remuneration Committee assesses the appropriateness of the nature and amount of remuneration of such Officers on a periodic basis by reference to relevant employment market conditions with the overall objective of ensuring maximum stakeholder benefit from the retention of a high quality executive team. Such officers are given the opportunity to receive their base remuneration, which is structured as a total employment cost package, in a variety of forms including cash and prescribed non-financial benefits. It is intended that the manner of payment chosen will be optimal for the recipient without creating undue cost for the Group. Employment Agreements Novogen Executive Directors and key management executives (standard contracts) It is the Remuneration Committee policy that employment contracts are entered into with each of the executives who are considered key management personnel. New contracts were entered into in March, 2010. Under the terms of the agreement remuneration is reviewed annually and any increases may be made at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. Key management executives are given the opportunity to receive their base remuneration, which is structured as a total employment cost package, in a variety of forms including cash and prescribed non financial benefits. The employment agreement continues until terminated by either party by giving six months notice in accordance with the terms of the contract or in the case of the Company by making a payment in lieu of six months notice to the employee. In the event of the Company terminating without cause, under the terms of the contract the amount payable on termination is a fixed dollar value for each key management personnel which at July 1, 2010 was of an amount equal to 4.66 months remuneration, in addition to any amount payable in lieu of notice. In September, 2010, an employment agreement was signed with the Chief Financial Officer. The employment agreement continues until terminated by either party by giving six months notice in accordance with the terms of their contract or in the case of the Company by making a payment in lieu of six months notice to the employee. In the event of the Company terminating without cause, under the terms of the contract the amount payable on termination is equal to 6 months remuneration, in addition to any amount payable in lieu of notice. 47 The Company may terminate the contracts at any time without cause if serious misconduct has occurred.

The elements of remuneration have been determined on the basis of the cost to the Company and the consolidated entity. Share Based Compensation Employee share option plan The Company established an Employee Share Option Plan which was approved by shareholders in October, 2007. The employee Share Option Plan provides for the issue of options to eligible employees being an employee or Director of the Company or related company. The number and timing of options issued under the terms of the Employee Share Option Plan is entirely at the discretion of the Board. 50 Each option issued under the Employee Share Option Plan entitles its holder to acquire one fully paid ordinary share and is exercisable at a price generally equal to the weighted average price of such shares at the close of trading on the Australian Stock Exchange Limited for the five days prior to the date of issue. Options generally vest equally over a four year period from the date of grant and expire five years after grant date. No performance conditions apply to the options granted, however, the unvested option lapses if the employee ceases to be an employee during the vesting period. Options are not transferable and can not be settled by the Company in cash. The Employee Share Option Plan provides that in the event of a change of control of the Company or in the event that the Company is taken over, outstanding options become exercisable regardless of vesting status. Remuneration options: granted and vested during the year During the financial year options were granted, by Novogen Limited, under the Employee Share Option Plan as equity compensation benefits to the Directors, following approval at an Extraordinary General Meeting held May 6, 2011 and to the Chief Financial Officer as disclosed below. The options were issued free of charge. Each option entitles the holder to subscribe for one fully paid ordinary share in Novogen Limited. The exercise price for these options is equivalent to the weighted average price of Novogen’s shares at the close of trading on the ASX for the ten days prior to the date of approval, plus an additional 10% premium added to this amount. The options expire four years after grant date and vest in two equal instalments over a two year period. No performance conditions apply to the options granted, however, should employment be terminated or if a Director ceases to be a director during the vesting period, all unvested options are immediately forfeited. Options are not transferable and cannot be settled by Novogen in cash. The option plan provides that if there is a change in control of Novogen outstanding options become exercisable regardless of vesting status. No performance conditions apply to the options granted to the Company’s Directors, who are a new group who have taken the responsibility and risk of repositioning Novogen for future success. The Company believes that it is important to provide an equity incentive to the Board members to fully align their investments with those of the shareholders. All Directors accepted to receive options, with the exception of Mr JT Austin who refrained from participating due to his existing significant shareholding. There were no alterations to the terms and conditions of options granted as remuneration since their grant date. There is no Board policy in relation to staff members limiting their exposure to risk as options vest subject to service criteria, not performance criteria. 51 The following table sets out options issued to Directors and key management personnel during the year: Terms and conditions for each grant Granted number Grant date Value per option at grant date Total value of options at grant date Exercise price per share First exercise date Last exercise date (A$) (A$) (A$) Non-executive Directors WD Rueckert 375,000 6/05/2011 0.185 69,375 0.297 1/07/2011 25/01/2015 P Scutt 375,000 6/05/2011 0.185 69,375 0.297 1/07/2011 25/01/2015 PR White 375,000 6/05/2011 0.185 69,375 0.297 1/07/2011 25/01/2015 R Youngman 375,000 6/05/2011 0.185 69,375 0.297 1/07/2011 25/01/2015 Executives M Hinze 250,000 6/05/2011 0.185 46,250 0.297 1/07/2011 25/01/2015 Total 1,750,000 323,750 There were no options issued by MEI to Key Management Personnel, directly employed by MEI, during the year. Of the options previously issued by MEI, 25% will vest one year from the effective date of the employees Employment Letter and, thereafter, the remaining 75% of options will vest in equal monthly instalments over the following thirty-six (36) months. The options do not have any performance conditions. There were no options forfeited and all options granted are available for future years. Shares issued on exercise of remuneration options No key management personnel or executives exercised options during the year ended June 30, 2011. Shares lapsed The value of options for key management personnel, which lapsed during the year ended June 30, 2011, was nil. 52 Fair values of options: The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model with the following assumptions used for grants made on: Novogen 6 May, 2011 Exercise price 0.2970 Share price at grant date 0.24 Dividend yield 0% Expected volatility 125% Historical volatility 125% Risk-free interest rate 5.20% Expected life of option 3.7 years Option fair value 0.19 Marshall Edwards 1 June, 2011 1 November, 2010 1 September, 2010 18 June, 2010 7 June, 2010 23 April, 2010 Exercise price US$1.28 US$1.15 US$0.77 US$1.52 US$1.86 US$5.05 Share price at grant date US$1.28 US$1.15 US$0.77 US$1.52 US$1.86 US$5.05 Dividend yield 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% Expected volatility 144% 137% 136% 136% 135% 132% Historical volatility 144% 137% 136% 136% 135% 132% Risk-free interest rate 1.60% 1.17% 1.41% 2.04% 1.95% 2.61% Expected life of warrant/option 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years Warrant/option fair value US$0.67 US$1.01 US1$.11 US$1.33 US$1.63 US$4.38 Glycotex 1 January, 2010 Exercise price US$15.13 Share price at grant date US$15.13 Dividend yield 0% Expected volatility 52% Historical volatility 52% Risk-free interest rate 2.34% Expected life of warrant 5 years Warrant fair value US$7.13 The dividend yield reflects the assumption that the current dividend payout, which is zero, will continue with no anticipated increases. The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome. 53 Further detail on the remuneration of Directors and Executives are also provided in Note 20 to the financial statements. Arrangements and Relationships There are no arrangements (other than standard employment remuneration arrangements) by which any Director or Executive Officer was appointed to his position. There are no family relationships between any of the Directors or Executive Officers. No Director has received or has become entitled to receive, during or since the end of the fiscal year ended 2011, a benefit because of a contract made by Novogen Limited, a controlled entity, or a related body corporate with a Director, a firm of which a Director is a member or an entity in which a Director has a substantial financial interest. Pension Benefits The Company has paid A$336,000 during fiscal 2011 for employee superannuation benefits and pension benefits.

M. Leppinus Director 2005 Retired October 29, 2010 Term of Directors The Company’s Constitution requires that at each Annual General Meeting of the Company, one third (or the number nearest to but not exceeding one third) of the Directors, (excluding a Director who is the Managing Director, and a director appointed to fill a casual vacancy) must retire from office provided that no Director may retain office for more than 3 years without offering himself/herself for re-election even though such submission results in more than one third of the Directors retiring from office. 54 The Board of Directors has the power to appoint any person to be a director either to fill a casual vacancy or as an additional Director (up to a maximum of 10). Any Director so appointed may hold office only until the next Annual General Meeting when he or she shall be eligible for election by the Company shareholders. Board of Directors The Board of Directors of Novogen Limited is elected by and accountable to shareholders. The Board monitors and directs the business and is responsible for the corporate governance of the Company. The Board is comprised of five Directors all of whom are non-Executive Directors. In addition, the Board has established an Audit Committee and a Remuneration Committee. Structure of the Board of Directors The skills, expertise and experience relevant to the position of Director held by each Director in office at the date of this Annual Report is included in Item 6 beginning on page 43. Directors are considered to be independent when they are independent of management and free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with, or could reasonably be perceived to materially interfere with, the exercise of their unfettered and independent judgement. In the context of Director independence, “materiality” is considered from both the Company and individual Director perspective. In determining whether a non-Executive Director is independent, he or she must not hold more than 5% of the Company’s outstanding shares. Also, the following qualitative factors, among others, are considered: · whether the director has been employed as an Executive of the Company within the last three years; · whether the director has been a principal of a material professional advisor or consultant of the Company; · whether the director has a material contractual relationship with the Company; · whether the director has served on the Board of Directors for a period which could be perceived to interfere with his or her ability to act in the best interests of the Company; and · whether the director has any business interests which could be perceived to interfere with his or her ability to act in the best interests of the Company. 55 In accordance with the definition of independence above, and the materiality thresholds set, the following Directors of Novogen Limited are considered to be independent: Name Position William D. Rueckert Non-Executive Director Peter Scutt Non-Executive Director Peter R. White Non-Executive Director Ross Youngman Non-Executive Director There are procedures in place, agreed upon by the Board of Directors, to enable Directors in the furtherance of their duties, to seek independent professional advice at the Company’s expense. For additional details regarding appointments to the Board of Directors please refer to the Company’s web site. Audit Committee The Board has an Audit Committee which comprises a majority of independent Non-executive Directors and operates under a charter approved by the Board. It is the Board’s responsibility to ensure that an effective internal control framework exists within the Group. This includes internal controls to deal with both the effectiveness and efficiency of significant business processes, the safeguarding of assets, the maintenance of proper accounting records and the reliability of financial information as well as non-financial considerations such as bench marking of operational key performance indicators. The Board has delegated the responsibility for the establishment and maintenance of a framework of internal control and ethical standards for the management of the Company to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is responsible for the selection and appointment of the external auditor. The Audit Committee reviews the performance of the external auditor on an annual basis and meets with it to discuss audit planning matters and statutory reporting requirements. The Audit Committee also assesses whether non-audit services provided by the external auditor are consistent with maintaining auditor independence. The Audit Committee also meets periodically with the auditor without management being present. The current external auditor, BDO Audit (NSW-VIC) Pty Ltd (“BDO”), attends the Annual General Meeting. BDO rotates its audit engagement partner for listed companies at least every five years. The Audit Committee also provides the Board with additional assurance regarding the reliability of financial information for inclusion in the financial reports. The Board is of the view that the skill and experience of its members are sufficient to enable the Committee to discharge its responsibilities within its charter. The members of the Audit Committee during the year were Geoffrey Leppinus (Chairman) (retired October 29, 2010), Paul Nestel (retired October 29, 2010), Philip Johnston (resigned October 18, 2010), William Rueckert (elected Chairman October 29, 2010), Josiah Austin (appointed October 29, 2010) and Peter White (appointed October 29, 2010). 56 Performance The performance of the Board of Directors and the key Executives is reviewed regularly against both measurable and qualitative indicators. The performance criteria against which Directors and Executives are assessed have regard to the financial and non-financial objectives of Novogen Limited. Remuneration Committee The Board has established a Remuneration Committee which is responsible for determining and reviewing compensation arrangements for the key management personnel. The Remuneration Committee operates in accordance with its charter which is available on the Company’s website. The Remuneration Committee comprises a majority of independent Non-executive Directors and has responsibility for reviewing and setting the remuneration of any Executive Directors and key management personnel by reference to independent data, external professional advice and the requirement to retain high quality management. Remuneration policies are established to attract and retain highly qualified Directors and senior management. The Remuneration Committee obtains independent advice on the appropriateness of remuneration levels. The members of the Remuneration Committee during the year were Philip Johnston (Chairman) (resigned October 18, 2010), Paul Nestel (retired October 29, 2010), Geoffrey Leppinus (retired October 29, 2010), William Ruekert (elected Chairman October 29, 2010), Josiah Austin (appointed October 29, 2010) and Peter White (appointed October 29, 2010). During the year the impact of the global financial crisis continued which, together with the disappointing results from the OVATURE trial, delayed the Company’s ability to raise significant new funds into the Group. In response to this situation the remuneration committee resolved to continue the Director fee reduction of 20% made in February 2009. In addition during the year, the number of Senior Management of Novogen was also reduced further to contain costs. 57 Employees The Group employed 21 people at June 30, 2011, 37 people at June 30, 2010 and 48 people at June 30, 2009 as follows: Category of Activity Number of People 2011 2010 2009 Research and development 3 14 17 Production 1 3 9 Sales and marketing 7 8 11 Finance and administration 10 12 11 Total 21 37 48 Geographic Location Number of People 2011 2010 2009 Australasia 10 31 43 North America 10 5 3 Europe 1 1 2 Total 21 37 48 Share Ownership Directors' holdings of shares and options in the Company The table below shows the number of ordinary shares and options to purchase Ordinary Shares held directly or indirectly by the Directors of the Company as of November 30, 2011.

Significant Changes After Balance Sheet Date Novogen Limited Novogen Limited received a letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market on July 21, 2011 notifying it that for the last 30 consecutive business days the bid price of the Company’s American Depository Receipts (ADR’s) closed below the minimum US$1.00 per share requirement for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Rule 5450(a)(1). According to Nasdaq’s letter, the Company will be afforded a grace period of 180 calendar days, or until January 17, 2012, to regain compliance in accordance with Nasdaq Rule 5810(c)(3)(A). In order to regain compliance, shares of the Company’s ADR’s must maintain a minimum bid closing price of at least US$1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during the grace period. The Company intends to actively monitor the bid price of its ADR’s between now and January 17, 2012. This notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market has no bearing on the Australian Stock Exchange listing of the Company’s common shares. On August 2, 2011 Novogen announced the completion of the sale of its consumer products business to Pharm-a-Care Laboratories Pty Limited for a total sale price of A$10.1million. The sale of the consumer business followed a review by the directors of the Company of the strategic alternatives for all of its businesses. While the consumer products business has grown over the past 12 months and is profitable, it did not fit with the Company’s longer term focus on therapeutic drug development programs primarily, through the Company’s majority owned subsidiaries Marshall Edwards, Inc. and Glycotex, Inc. 63 On September 30, 2011, pursuant to a definitive agreement with MEI, Novogen purchased common stock of MEI in a private placement for a total investment of US$2 million through the purchase of approximately 1.33 million shares of MEI common stock. Marshall Edwards, Inc. On July 25, 2011, MEI issued 375,000 shares following the conversion of Series B Warrants issued under the private placement in May, 2011. Gross proceeds received from the conversion of the warrants was US$341,000. On August 18, 2011, MEI issued a further 919,000 shares following the conversion of Series B Warrants issued under the private placement in May, 2011. Gross proceeds received from the conversion of the warrants was US$928,000. On September 28, 2011, MEI issued a further 305,603 shares following the conversion, on a cashless basis, of the remaining Series B warrants. On September 30, 2011, Novogen purchased 1.33 million shares of MEI common stock in a private placement. Novogen’s ownership following this share issue is 55.6%, excluding the potential common stock convertible under the preference shares issued to Novogen under IP assets sale to MEI. In the event that Novogen exercised these preference shares the resultant ownership interest in MEI would be 68.5%. On October 24, 2011 MEI announced that Charles Baltic, Managing Director and Co-Head of Healthcare at Needham & Company, was appointed to its board of directors. The appointment of Mr Baltic increases the number of board members to six and the number of independent directors to five.
