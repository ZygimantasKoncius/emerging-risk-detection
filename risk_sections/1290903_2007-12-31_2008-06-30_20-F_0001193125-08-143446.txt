Risk FactorsRisks Related to Doing Business in the Peoples Republic of ChinaFluctuation of the Renminbi may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measurement of fair value, and expands disclosures required for fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fair value measures already required or permitted by other standards for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. On February 12, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff position No. 157-2, Effective date of FASB Statement No. 157 which defers the effective date of SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. SFAS No. 157 is required to be adopted by the Group in fiscal year 2008. The Group does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected. SFAS No.159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and is required to be adopted by the Group in fiscal 43 Table of Contents year 2008. In connection with current period financial statements, the Group does not have items eligible for Fair Value Option under SFAS No. 159. The Group does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R (Revised), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141R). SFAS No. 141R establishes requirements for the recognition and measurement of acquired assets, liabilities, goodwill, and non-controlling interests (formerly minority interests). SFAS No. 141R also provides disclosure requirements related to business combinations. SFAS No. 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 141R will be applied prospectively to business combinations with an acquisition date on or after December 15, 2008. The Group is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS 141R on its consolidated financial statements. Item 6.

Employment and Termination Arrangements with Messrs. Chen and Zheng. We are party to employment agreements, dated and effective as of July 23, 2004, with each of Messrs. Richard Chen and Frank Zheng. Each 52 Table of Contents agreement had an initial three-year term which expired on August 4, 2007. On or about the expiration date of the initial term, we entered into a renewal agreement with Mr. Chen to extend the term of his employment agreement to December 15, 2007 and a renewal agreement with Mr. Zheng to extend the term of his employment agreement to January 31, 2008. Under the renewal agreements, their employments with us terminated at the expiry of their respective renewal periods. Under their initial employment agreements, each of Messrs. Chen and Zheng received an initial base salary of US$105,000 per year and was entitled to an annual discretionary bonus based on his individual performance, our performance, and other factors deemed relevant by the compensation committee, based upon a target bonus range of 15-50% of annual base salary. Under the renewal agreements, each of Messrs. Chen and Zheng received a salary at the annual rate of US$105,000 during the renewal period. Before and during the initial term of their employment agreements Messrs. Chen and Zheng were granted options to purchase our ordinary shares. Those options were subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable share option plan and any related stock option agreement in effect at the time we granted the options. We also granted performance units to Mr. Zheng. See sections Stock Options Granted under 2004 Plan and Performance Units Granted under the 2004 Plan for a description of stock-based compensation granted to Messrs. Chen and Zheng. The agreements provided that, in the event that either Mr. Chen or Mr. Zheng were to resign for good reason, or were terminated by us without cause (in each case, as defined in the agreements), with respect to options granted on or after July 1, 2004, Messrs. Chen and Zheng would be entitled to immediate vesting for an additional 12 months for the remaining options that were unvested as of the date of the termination. However, under their renewal agreements, Messrs. Chen and Zheng acknowledged and agreed that their termination at the expiry of the renewed term would neither be considered a termination for good reason nor a termination without cause and, accordingly, upon such termination, no acceleration of vesting of unvested options took place. If either Messrs. Chen or. Zheng, after the termination of his employment, violates or fails to materially comply with the restrictive covenant agreement or other arrangements described in the employment agreements, we will have the right to cancel the executives equity awards and shares purchased pursuant to the exercise of such equity awards or receive a refund of any amounts realized upon the sale or other transfer of such awards in the event that the executive engages in prohibited actions specified in the agreements. Each of Messrs. Chen or. Zheng entered into standard non-competition, non-solicitation, confidential information and work product assignment agreements with us and with our subsidiary eLong Information. The terms of such agreements are set forth below under Non-Competition Agreements with our Executives, except that Mr. Zhengs non-competition obligation will end on July 31, 2008 and Mr. Chens non-competition obligation will end on September 15, 2008. We will pay each of Messrs. Chen or Zheng a fee at an annual rate of $10,000 as compensation for his undertaking of non-competition obligation after his termination. Employment Agreement with other Senior Executive Officers. We have entered into our standard form employment agreements for senior executive officers with our other senior executive officers. The agreements provide for the opportunity for such executives to be granted stock-based compensation. See section above Compensation Arrangements with Executive Officers Fiscal 2007 for description of stock-based compensation granted to our senior executive officers in 2007. Each of the agreements requires that the relevant employee enter into standard form non-competition agreements with us and with our subsidiary eLong Information. The terms of such agreements are set forth below under Non-Competition Agreements with our Executives. Non-Competition Agreements with our Executives. We and our subsidiary eLong Information are parties to a restrictive covenant agreement with each of Messrs. Kjellberg, SooHoo, Tang, Chen, Zheng, Palaschuk, Fiske, and the other officers identified herein. The restrictive covenant agreements provide that during each executives employment and continuing until the later of: (1) 12 months after the termination of such executives employment and (2) three years after the effective date of such executives restrictive covenant agreement, the 53 Table of Contents executive will not compete with us or our subsidiaries or affiliates. In addition, for a period of two years after his employment, the executive will not solicit our employees or customers or the employees or customers of our subsidiaries or affiliates, and while employed and indefinitely thereafter will not disclose or otherwise use our confidential information or the confidential information of our subsidiaries or affiliates. The agreements also state that the executives work product will be assigned to us or eLong Information. Settlement and Termination Agreements. In addition, we have entered into settlement and termination agreements with our former senior executive officers, Messrs. SooHoo, Tang, and Palaschuk. The terms of these agreements are described in elsewhere in this annual report. We have also entered into settlement agreements with Messrs. Frank Zheng and Richard Chen, the terms of which settlement agreements are described in the section Employment and Termination Arrangements with Messrs. Chen and Zheng above. Resignation and Settlement Agreement with Derek Palaschuk. In July 2006, Derek Palaschuk resigned from his position as our CFO. We entered into a resignation and settlement agreement with Mr. Palaschuk pursuant to which he will receive, subject to certain conditions, base pay of US$105,000 per year through July 23, 2007, together with healthcare benefits through such date. We have also extended the period after Mr. Palaschuks resignation during which he and Capital Dragon Agents Limited, a company beneficially owned by Mr. Palaschuk, may exercise any options which were vested as of July 28, 2006. Such extension is for a reasonable period of time after the resolution of certain issues relating to any potential option exercises. Under the settlement agreement, Mr. Palaschuk remains subject to confidentiality, non-compete, non-disparagement, and other obligations. Termination and Settlement Agreement with Tom Soohoo. In May 2007, we entered into a termination and settlement agreement with Mr. SooHoo in connection with Mr. SooHoos resignation, effective as of April 16, 2007. Under such agreement, Mr. SooHoo provided us with a general release of any claims related to his employment with us. In addition, Mr. SooHoo agreed to remain our non-executive employee until July 12, 2007 (the Termination Date), and we agreed that Mr. SooHoo would continue to be paid his then-current annual base salary of US$120,000 per annum, pro rated, through the Termination Date and that he would receive, through the Termination Date, other employee benefits set forth in Section 4 of his December 19, 2005 Employment Agreement with us. As of the Termination Date, Mr. SooHoo had vested stock options to purchase 30,488 of our ordinary shares and 32,928 vested performance units which were to be settled in our ordinary shares pursuant to the terms of the termination and settlement agreement. As of April 30, 2008, all of the 30,488 stock options had expired without being exercised by Mr. SooHoo. Consulting Arrangements. We appointed Tony Shen to act as our Interim Chief Financial Officer, pursuant to a consulting contract with a start date of July 25, 2006 and with an initial term of four months. Pursuant to the contract, Mr. Shen was paid a gross monthly consulting fee of US$15,000, a housing allowance of US$1,000 per month, a home leave allowance of US$2,000 for each six week period, and reimbursement of expenses incurred in discharge of his duties.

Under the agreement, either party had the right to terminate the contract upon written notice. We and Mr. Shen agreed on February 23, 2007 to terminate the Interim CFO consulting arrangement, effective February 26, 2007, and pursuant to the terms of a settlement agreement with Mr. Shen, Mr. Shen remained available to provide transition services for a two month period from February 26 and received the US$16,500 base consulting fee during such period. Services Agreement for Interim CEO. We have agreed on an arrangement with Expedia for the services of Henrik Kjellberg in his role as our Interim CEO. Additional detail is provided under Related Party TransactionsCertain Other Business Arrangements with ExpediaArrangement between Expedia and eLong with respect to Services provided by our Interim CEO. Mr. Kjellberg resigned as our Interim CEO effective on October 8, 2007 and Mr. Guangfu Cui became our CEO on the same day. 54 Table of Contents Share Ownership Please refer to Item 7: Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions and to Stock-Based Compensation Plans and Options Grants below for a description of the share ownership of our executive officers and directors.

In addition, pursuant to the terms of the 2004 Plan, unless otherwise determined by our board of directors, if, during the one-year period following a change in control, such option holder incurs a termination of employment by us other than by reason of death, disability or cause or the option holder resigns for good reason, the option holder shall be entitled as of the termination of employment to an additional 12 months of vesting of the stock option to the extent unvested as of the termination of employment. (2) This option is currently fully vested and exercisable. (3) See discussion of Mr. Palaschuks options under the heading Resignation and Settlement Agreement with Derek Palaschuk. (4) Vests over a period of three years from the grant date, at the rate of 5,000 ordinary shares every six months. In the event that Expedia effects a going private transaction, as such transaction is described in Rule 13e-3(a)(3) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 of us, the portion of the stock option which is unvested prior to such transaction shall become vested as of the effective date of such going private transaction. (5) Vests over a five year period with 20% of the option vesting on each of the first, second, third, forth and fifth anniversary of the grant date. Performance Units Granted under the 2004 Plan Performance units are awards in the form of units that are denominated in a hypothetical equivalent number of our ordinary shares, which number of units are determined based on the fair market value of our ordinary shares on the date immediately preceding the grant date or the employment start date of a particular grantee and which, when vested, are settled, in our sole discretion, in either ordinary shares or cash. At the time of grant, our board of directors or the compensation committee determines if we will settle the performance units in cash, stock or both. Settlement terms of performance units, once established, may only be changed by approval of our board of directors or the compensation committee. Except with respect to the performance units granted to our independent directors which are to be settled in cash (and are not reflected in the table below) and except as 56 Table of Contents otherwise described in the footnotes to the table below, performance units granted to our employees and consultants are to be settled in ordinary shares. Those performance units granted during 2007 to our independent directors are to be settled upon vesting in cash in an amount equal to the number of the vested performance units multiplied by the fair market value of our ordinary shares on the applicable vesting date. The fair value of the performance unit is based upon the market value of our ordinary shares when the performance units vest. Our performance units are generally subject to service-based vesting where a specific period of continued employment must pass before an award vests. Typically, a portion of the performance units granted vest periodically over the term of the grant. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the 2004 Plan, unless otherwise determined by our board of directors, if, during the one-year period following a change in control, such Performance Unit holder incurs a termination of employment by us other than by reason of death, disability or cause or the Performance Unit holder resigns for good reason, such holder shall be entitled as of the termination of employment to an additional 12 months of vesting of the Performance Unit to the extent unvested as of the termination of employment. The following table summarizes, as of April 30, 2008, the outstanding performance units granted to Guangfu Cui, our Chief Executive Officer, certain of our current key employees and consultant and to our other employees as a group since our board of directors adopted the 2004 Plan. As of April 30, 2008, 19,406 performance units have been settled in ordinary shares.

One third of the performance units vest on January 1 of each of 2008, 2009 and 2010 and are payable upon vesting either in cash payment equal to the then fair market value of the underlying ordinary shares so vested or in the number of our ordinary shares that is equal to the number of performance units then vested. 3,333 performance units vested on January 1, 2008 and Mr. Tang received a cash payment upon vesting of such 3,333 performance units. 57 Table of Contents (3) Mr. Harford, one of the members of our board of directors, had been granted 10,000 performance units under the 2004 Plan.

Options Granted to Expedia Asia Pacific On August 4, 2004, we granted to Expedia Asia Pacific an option to purchase 711,429 ordinary shares at an exercise price of US$5.25 per share. The option mirrors the terms and conditions of the 1.66 million options granted to certain of our employees and officers on July 23, 2004 under our 2004 Plan. The option becomes exercisable by Expedia Asia Pacific each time any such officer or employee exercises any of such 1.66 million options. In connection with each exercise by an employee or officer, Expedia Asia Pacific is entitled to exercise a portion of its option such that Expedia Asia Pacific would receive (if Expedia Asia Pacific exercises to the fullest extent in connection with such employee or officer exercise) 30% of the aggregate ordinary shares issued to such employee or officer and Expedia Asia Pacific in connection with such employee or officer exercise. To the extent that any such officers or employees options terminate or expire without being exercised, an amount of Expedia Asia Pacifics option equal to 30% of (i) such officers or employees terminated or expired options divided by (ii) 0.70, will likewise terminate or expire. In addition, on October 1, 2004, we entered into a stock option agreement with Expedia Asia Pacific, pursuant to which, in exchange for Expedia Asia Pacifics giving its consent to the issuance of 250,000 options to Messrs. Chen or Zheng, we granted to Expedia Asia Pacific an option to purchase up to 260,204 of our ordinary shares at a purchase price of US$5.25 per ordinary share. The option mirrors the terms and conditions of the 250,000 options granted to Messrs. Chen or Zheng on October 1, 2004. The option becomes exercisable by Expedia Asia Pacific each time either of Messrs. Chen or Zheng exercises any of the 250,000 options. In connection with each exercise by either of Messrs. Chen or Zheng, Expedia Asia Pacific is entitled to exercise a portion of its option such that Expedia Asia Pacific would receive (if Expedia Asia Pacific exercises to the fullest extent in connection with such officer exercise) 51% of the aggregate ordinary shares issued to either Messrs. Chen or Zheng and Expedia Asia Pacific in connection with such officer exercise. To the extent that either of Messrs. Chens or Zhengs options terminate or expire without being exercised, an amount of Expedia Asia Pacifics option equal to 51% of (i) Messrs. Chens or Zhengs terminated or expired options divided by (ii) 0.49, will likewise terminate or expire. As of April 30, 2008, 487,339 options granted to Expedia Asia Pacific on August 4, 2004 had forfeited as a result of the expiration of certain employees options and 260,204 options granted to Expedia Asia Pacific on October 1, 2004 had expired as a result of the expiration of Messrs. Chens or Zhengs options. As of April 30, 2008, Expedia Asia Pacific held an option to purchase 224,090 ordinary shares. Employees As of December 31, 2007, we employed approximately 1,777 full-time and part-time employees. We believe we have good relationships with our employees, including relationships with employees represented by works councils or other similar organizations. 58 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the number of our employees categorized by function as of the dates indicated. As of December 31, 2005 2006 2007 General and administrative 199 206 203 Cost of services 706 870 957 Sales and marketing 718 459 365 (1) Services development 433 318 252 Total 2,056 1,853 1,777 (2) (1) This number includes our 224, 201 and 130 third-party sales agents in 2005, 2006 and 2007. The agents are individuals who signed commission agreements, not employment agreements, with us. The agents are independent contractors who control their work schedules and do not enjoy the employee benefits mentioned above. (2) This number includes 188, three and six part-time workers and 131, 50 and 115 interns in 2005, 2006 and 2007. In 2005, 170 of the part-time workers and 131 of the interns were contracted or hired by Raytime. The part-time workers are those who work less than four hours per working day. The interns consist of students and trainees who are hired under an intern or training contract. Once they complete the internship, they are eligible to be hired as our full-time employees. Both the part-time workers and the interns are independent contractors who control their work schedules and do not enjoy the employee benefits mentioned above. The decrease in our number of employees from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to the sale of the Raytime and online dating division businesses. The decrease in staff from 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to suspending the vacation package service business in July 2007 and exiting some traditional sales channels at the end of 2007. On January 1, 2008, we decided to transfer certain third-party sales agents into employment relationship. At the same day, we converted 89 such agents into our employees and signed the employment agreements with them. Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions Expedia, through its affiliates, holds 28,550,704 (or 100%) of our high-vote ordinary shares, each of which is entitled to 15 votes. Each of our ordinary shares is entitled to one vote. Our high-vote ordinary shares and our ordinary shares vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a shareholder vote, including the election of the members of our board of directors. As a result, Expedia controls approximately 95% of the voting power of all shares of our voting stock. In addition, certain other shareholders are parties to an investors agreement with Expedia Asia Pacific under which they have agreed to vote their ordinary shares in the election of directors designated by Expedia. Accordingly, Expedia generally is able to exercise control over all matters requiring approval by our board of directors or our shareholders. As of April 30, 2008, 22,040,232 of our ordinary shares were outstanding and 28,550,704 of our high-vote ordinary shares were outstanding, excluding shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and shares issuable upon the settlement of vested performance units. On that date, a total of 9,373,464 of our ADSs (equivalent to 18,746,928 ordinary shares) were outstanding.

Other Related Party Transactions In January 2006, we entered into a termination and settlement agreement with Justin Tang, our former President and Chief Executive Officer, in connection with the termination of Mr. Tangs employment with us, which was effective as of February 17, 2006. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Tang provided us with a general release of any claims related to his employment with the Company. We acknowledged that (i) under the terms of the 2001 Plan and the terms of his employment agreement, Purple Mountain Holding Ltd.s (an entity over which Mr. Tang has ultimate investment power and to whom Mr. Tang had previously transferred a portion of his options) option to purchase 2,875,000 ordinary shares had vested and (ii) under the terms of the 2004 Plan and the terms of his employment agreement, Mr. Tangs option to purchase 262,500 ordinary shares had vested. We also agreed that in consideration for the benefits provided by Mr. Tang under the termination and settlement 69 Table of Contents agreement, Purple Mountain Holding Ltd.s option would also vest with respect to an additional 31,250 ordinary shares and Purple Mountain Holding Ltd. would have until 60 days after Mr. Tang ceases to be our director for any reason to exercise the outstanding vested options. In addition, we agreed that Mr. Tangs option would vest with respect to an additional 43,750 ordinary shares, and that Mr. Tang would have until 60 days after he ceases to be our director for any reason to exercise the outstanding vested options. The accelerated options resulted in compensation expenses of RMB 410,800 being recognized in 2006. The remaining unvested option to purchase 393,750 ordinary shares was forfeited on February 17, 2006. Finally, we agreed to relax the sale restrictions placed on Mr. Tang and Purple Mountain Holding Ltd. to allow for the sale or transfer of enough ordinary shares to cover a cashless option exercise of such portion, as more fully described in the termination and settlement agreement, of the options held by Mr. Tang and Purple Mountain Holding Ltd. in the event Mr. Tang ceases to be our director as a result of being removed by our board of directors or our shareholders and not as a result of his resignation. See the descriptions of (i) the termination and settlement agreement with Thomas SooHoo, our former Chief Executive Officer and director and (ii) the resignation and settlement agreement with Derek Palaschuk, our former CFO, under the heading Employment Agreements with Executive Officers in Item 6 in this annual report. See also the description of our employment agreements with our executive officers under the heading Employment Agreements with Executive Officers in Item 6 of this annual report. In 2007, we paid RMB 750,000 (US$102,800) in rent for accommodations to related parties of our senior management. These payments included rental payments for the residence of our former CEO Thomas SooHoo, which residence is owned by his spouse. The payments were made pursuant to employment agreements with the relevant senior managers, and were at market rates. Lease Agreement for CEOs Residence. In June 2006, pursuant to Mr. SooHoos employment agreement, we entered into a 2-year lease agreement with Mr. SooHoos spouse whereby we paid RMB 70,000 (US$9,596) per month to lease Mr. SooHoos residence. The rental rate includes the cost of management fees and utilities and is at a market rate. The lease agreement has been terminated, effective June 15, 2007, in connection with Mr. SooHoos resignation from our company, with the final rent payment to be made through July 12, 2007. eLong-Match.com eDodo Sale. In September 2006, we (along with our subsidiary and affiliated Chinese Entity) entered into an asset purchase agreement and a cooperation agreement with Match.com (and two Match subsidiaries) for the disposition of our online dating division business operated under the name eDodo. The total purchase price for the disposition was US$ 14,625,000. The disposition was effective in October 2006 at which time the purchased assets and employees were transferred to the purchasers, and 90% of the purchase price was paid to us by Match.com. The remaining 10% of the purchase price was placed in escrow and will be released 18 months from the closing subject to satisfaction of agreed upon conditions. The agreements contain confidentiality and non-compete provisions. The cooperation agreement provides for general support services, including technology, human resources, finance, payroll, and legal, to be provided by us to the Match parties at market rates, based on time records to be provided by us. During 2007 the various service fees charged by us under the cooperation agreement were RMB 627,921 ($US 86,080) (2006: RMB 206,228). In addition, during the 18 month term of the cooperation agreement, we are obligated to provide, at no additional charge, to the Match parties billing support services. Match.com is a wholly owned subsidiary of InterActiveCorp (IAC). Barry Diller is the Chairman and chief executive officer of IAC. Through his own holdings and the stockholders agreement between Mr. Diller and Liberty Media Corporation, Mr. Diller generally has the ability to control the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of IACs stockholders (except with regard to certain specified matters). Expedia, through Expedia Asia Pacific, is the indirect owner of approximately 52% of our outstanding shares on a fully-diluted basis and holds approximately 95% of our voting power. Mr. Diller is Expedias Chairman and Senior Executive 70 Table of Contents and holds more than a 50% voting interest in Expedia through his holdings and a stockholders agreement between Mr. Diller and Liberty Media Corporation. The buyer (Match) and seller (eLong) in the project therefore are entities under common control, under US GAAP. The eDodo asset transfer to Match.com and subsidiaries is thus accounted for as transfer of assets to a company under common control. Accordingly, no gain is recognized as a result of the transfer and the excess of net sale proceeds over the carrying value of the net assets sold (RMB 94.17 million) are recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital. eLong-Match.com China Sublease. We entered into a 24-month sublease agreement with Match.com (Match) in June, 2006, in which eLong Information subleased to Matchs wholly foreign owned enterprise, or the Match WFOE, Five Star Marketing Information Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd., certain office space, located in Xingke Plaza, 10 Middle Jiuxianqiao Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, PRC. Under the sublease agreement, the Match WFOE shall pay RMB 33,396 per month of rent and utility fees to eLong Information. Such arrangement has been approved by our lessor and is consistent with market rates. eLong-Interval International Sublease. In June 2006, we entered into a 12 month extension of a June 2005 sublease agreement with Interval International Singapore (Pte) Ltd. (Interval International), an affiliate of IAC. Under this agreement, eLong Information subleased to Interval International certain minor office space, located in Xingke Plaza, 10 Middle Jiuxianqiao Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing. Under the sublease agreement, Interval International shall pay rent of US$500 per month (including utilities fees) to eLong Information. This arrangement has been approved by our lessor and is consistent with market rates. In June 2007, the sublease was renewed for an additional one year term. Item 8: Financial Information Consolidated Financial Statements See Item 18. Financial Statements and pages F-1 through F-33 of this annual report. Other Financial Information Legal Proceedings We are not a party to any material litigation or administrative proceedings, nor are we currently aware of any pending or threatened litigation or arbitration proceedings that could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations or financial condition. We may become subject to other legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, in the future. Any litigation involves potential risk and potentially significant litigation costs, and therefore there can be no assurance that any litigation which may arise in the future would not have such a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Dividend Policy Since our establishment, we have not declared or paid any dividends on our ordinary shares. We did not and do not intend to pay any dividends in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The timing, amount and form of future dividends, if any, will also depend, among other things, on our future results of operations and cash flow, our growth prospects, our capital requirements, the amount of distributions, if any, received by us from our subsidiaries in China and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Any future cash dividends on the outstanding shares would be declared by and subject to the discretion of our board of directors and must be approved at our companys annual general meeting of shareholders. Holders of ADSs would be entitled to receive dividends, if any, subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, to the same extent as holders of ordinary shares, less the fees and expenses payable under the deposit agreement, and after deduction of any applicable taxes. 71 Table of Contents Significant Changes since December 31, 2007 No significant change has occurred since December 31, 2007, the date of the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.

Material Contracts We have not entered into any material contracts other than in the ordinary course of business within the past two fiscal years, other than those described elsewhere in this annual report or listed in Item 19: Exhibits. We have terminated the following material contract in 2006: Sina eLongNet Information Technology and Beijing Sina Internet Information entered into a three year cooperation agreement (the Sina Contract) effective June 2005 under which we would pay approximately US$1 million per year to Sina for our advertising on Sinas website. Due to certain performance issues, on July 10, 2006 we terminated the Sina Contract pursuant to a termination and settlement agreement under which we agreed to enter into a contract with a third party advertising agency, appointed by Sina (the AdCo Contract). Under the AdCo Contract we are entitled to place advertisements on Sinas website following our payment to the advertising company. The AdCo Contract requires payments by us of RMB2 million (US$0.25 million) per year. Exchange Controls The principal regulation governing foreign currency exchange in China is the Foreign Currency Administration Rules (1996), as amended. Under these rules, the Renminbi is freely convertible for trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for direct investment, loans or investments in securities outside China without the prior approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of the Peoples Republic of China, or SAFE. In addition, the aggregate of (i) the balance of an FIEs short-term loans from outside China, (ii) the cumulative medium / long-term loans from outside China, and (iii) the balance of the loans guaranteed by any entity or individual outside China, shall not exceed the difference of the FIEs total investment and registered capital. Pursuant to the Foreign Currency Administration Rules, foreign-invested enterprises in China may purchase foreign exchange without the approval of SAFE for trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions by providing commercial documents evidencing these transactions. They may also retain foreign exchange, subject to a cap approved by SAFE, to satisfy foreign exchange liabilities or to pay dividends. However, the relevant Chinese government authorities may limit or eliminate the ability of foreign-invested enterprises to purchase and retain foreign currencies in the future. In addition, foreign exchange transactions for direct investment, loan and investment in securities outside China are still subject to limitations and require approvals from SAFE. Taxation The following discussion summarizes certain Cayman Islands tax and United States federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our ADSs or ordinary shares based upon laws and relevant interpretations thereof in effect as of the date of this annual report, all of which are subject to change. Although the following discussion does not purport to describe all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to a prospective purchaser of our ADSs or shares, this discussion summarizes certain Cayman Islands tax 73 Table of Contents consequences to a holder of ADSs or shares that is not resident (in the case of an individual) or domiciled (in the case of a legal entity) in the Cayman Islands (in either case, referred to herein as not resident or as a non-resident) and does not have a permanent establishment or fixed base located in the Cayman Islands through which such ADSs or shares are held, and certain material United States federal income tax consequences to a U.S. Holder (as that term is defined below) of ADSs or shares that is not resident (in the case of an individual) or domiciled (in the case of a legal entity) in the Cayman Islands (in either case, referred to herein as not resident or as a non-resident) and does not have a permanent establishment or fixed base located in the Cayman Islands through which such ADSs or shares are held. Cayman Islands Taxation The Cayman Islands currently levy no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains or appreciation and there is no taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty. There are no other taxes likely to be material to us levied by the Government of the Cayman Islands except for stamp duties that may be applicable on instruments executed in, or after execution brought within the jurisdiction of, the Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands are not party to any double taxation treaties. There are no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions in the Cayman Islands. United States Federal Income Taxation The following discussion is a summary of the material United States federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to the purchase, ownership or sale of our ADSs or ordinary shares. This discussion is general in nature and does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation which may be important to particular investors in light of their individual circumstances, including investors subject to special U.S. taxation rules, such as:  banks;  dealers in securities or currencies;  financial institutions;  insurance companies;  tax-exempt organizations;  persons holding ADSs or ordinary shares as part of hedging, conversion, constructive sale, straddle or other integrated transactions;  traders in securities that have elected the mark-to-market method of accounting;  persons who own 5% or more of our shares;  U.S. persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; or  Non-U.S. Holders (as defined below). This discussion is based in part on representations by the depositary and assumes that each obligation under the deposit agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms. Furthermore, the discussion below is based upon the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and U.S. Treasury regulations (including temporary and proposed regulations), rulings and judicial decisions thereunder as of the date hereof. Such authorities are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis, which may result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below. A U.S. Holder considering an investment in our ADSs or ordinary shares is urged to consult its own tax advisor concerning the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income and other tax consequences. 74 Table of Contents A U.S. Holder for purposes of this discussion is a beneficial owner of ADSs or ordinary shares that is a U.S. person. A U.S. person is:  a citizen or resident of the United States;  a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;  an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation, regardless of its source; or  a trust if it is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person. A beneficial owner of ADSs or ordinary shares that is not a U.S. Holder is referred to herein as a Non-U.S. Holder. If a partnership holds ADSs or ordinary shares, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partner of a partnership holding ADSs or ordinary shares is urged to consult its own tax advisor regarding an investment in our ADSs or ordinary shares. ADSs. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder of ADSs will be treated as the owner of the underlying ordinary shares that are represented by such ADSs. Deposits and withdrawals of ordinary shares in exchange for ADSs will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation. Distributions on ADSs or ordinary shares. Subject to the application of the passive foreign investment company rules, as discussed below, the gross amount of any distributions in respect of the ADSs or ordinary shares will be subject to tax as dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Subject to certain limitations, dividends paid to non-corporate U.S. Holders, including individuals, may be eligible for a reduced rate of taxation if we are deemed to be or will be treated as a qualified foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and provided that such holder satisfies certain holding period requirements with respect to the ownership of our ADS, or ordinary shares. Subject to the exceptions discussed below, dividends paid by a foreign corporation will be treated as being paid by a qualified foreign corporation if the corporation is:  a corporation incorporated in a possession of the United States;  a foreign corporation that is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States that includes an exchange of information program; or  a foreign corporation whose stock with respect to which a dividend is paid or whose ADSs backed by such stock are readily tradable on an established securities market within the United States. A foreign corporation (even if it is a corporation described above) does not constitute a qualified foreign corporation if the foreign corporation is a passive foreign investment company. Although we believe that dividends paid by us will be treated as being paid by a qualified foreign corporation, no assurance can be given in this regard. In addition, our status as a qualified foreign corporation may change. A U.S. Holder that exchanges its ADSs for ordinary shares may not be eligible for the reduced rate of taxation on dividends if the ordinary shares are not deemed to be readily tradable on an established securities market within the United States. Dividends will be includable in a U.S. Holders gross income on the date actually or constructively received by the depositary, in the case of ADSs or, in the case of ordinary shares, by such U.S. Holder. These dividends will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to U.S. corporations in respect of dividends received from other U.S. corporations. To the extent that the amount of any distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, the distribution will first be treated as a tax-free return of capital, causing a reduction in the adjusted basis of the ADSs or ordinary shares, and the balance in excess of adjusted basis will be taxed as capital gain. 75 Table of Contents Sale, exchange or other disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares. Subject to the application of the passive foreign investment company rules, as discussed below, upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale, exchange or other disposition and the adjusted tax basis of the U.S. Holder in the ADSs or ordinary shares. The capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if, at the time of sale, exchange or other disposition, the U.S. Holder has held the ADS or ordinary share for more than one year. Net long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. Holders, including individuals, are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any gain or loss that a U.S. Holder recognizes generally will be treated as gain or loss from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Passive foreign investment company rules. In general, we will be classified as a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year in which either (a) at least 75% of our gross income is passive income or (b) at least 50% of the value (determined on the basis of a quarterly average) of our assets is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income. For this purpose, passive income generally includes dividends, interest, royalties, rents (other than rents and royalties derived in the active conduct of a trade or business and not derived from a related person), annuities and gains from assets that produce passive income. If we own at least 25% by value of the equity shares of another corporation, we will be treated for purposes of the passive foreign investment company tests as owning a proportionate share of the assets of the other corporation, and as receiving directly a proportionate share of the other corporations income. We believe, based on the projected composition of our income and valuation of our assets, that we should not be classified as a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes, although no assurance can be given in this regard. Whether we are a passive foreign investment company for any particular taxable year is determined on an annual basis and will depend on the composition of our income and assets, including goodwill. The calculation of goodwill will be based, in part, on the then market value of our capital stock, which is subject to fluctuation. In addition, the composition of our income and assets will be affected by how we spend the cash we raised in our initial public offering. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will not be classified as a passive foreign investment company in the current or any future taxable year. If we are a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder has an equity interest in us, unless the U.S. Holder makes a mark-to-market election as discussed below, such U.S. Holder will be subject to special tax rules in any future taxable year, regardless of whether we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in such future years with respect to (a) excess distributions and (b) gain from the disposition of stock. Excess distributions are defined generally as the excess of the amount received with respect to the equity interests in the taxable year over 125% of the average annual distributions received in the shorter of either the three previous years or a U.S. Holders holding period before the taxable year and must be allocated ratably to each day of the U.S. Holders holding period. Taxation of Holders of ADSs or Shares in Other Countries Holders or potential holders of our ADSs who are resident or otherwise taxable in countries other than the United States are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the overall tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our ADSs. Documents on Display We have previously filed with the SEC our registration statement on Form F-1, as amended, and prospectus under Securities Act with respect to our ADSs. We are subject to the periodic reporting and other informational requirements of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act.

The SEC also maintains an Internet site at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding registrants that make electronic filings with the SEC using its EDGAR system. Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Unless otherwise required by Nasdaqs Marketplace Rules or the rules and regulations of the Exchange Act, we will make available our annual reports on Form 20-F (which will include annual audited consolidated financial statements) to our shareholders by posting the annual reports on our website, provided that a hard copy of our annual reports will be provided to shareholders upon request, free of charge.

PART II Item 13. Defaults, Dividend Arrearages and Delinquencies Not applicable. Item 14. Material Modifications to the Rights of Security Holders and Use of Proceeds Use of Proceeds The following discussion relates to the initial public offering our ADSs by us and certain selling shareholders, pursuant to a registration statement on Form F-1 (File No. 333-119606), which was completed on November 2, 2004. The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on October 27, 2004.

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, Guangfu Cui and our CFO, Chris Chan, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2007. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the material financial and non-financial information required to be disclosed in this annual report on Form 20-F and filed with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner. Based on this evaluation, our management, including our CEO and CFO, concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007. Our management has reviewed its assessment with our audit committee. Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. The report on the audit of internal control over financial reporting appears in this Form 20-F. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders eLong, Inc.: We have audited eLong, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). eLong, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 78 Table of Contents A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, eLong, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of eLong, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007, and our report dated June 24, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. /s/ KPMG Hong Kong, China June 24, 2008 Limitations on Controls. Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all misstatements, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the sound control procedures. Any control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within eLong have been detected. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. As required by Rule 13(a)-15(d), under the Exchange Act, our management, including our CEO and CFO, also conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, it has been determined that there has been no such change during the period covered by this annual report. Item 16A. Audit Committee Financial Expert.

We have not yet been fully billed by KPMG for audit fees in relation to the year ended December 31, 2007. Our audit committee is responsible for the retention of our independent registered public accounting firm, which currently is KPMG. Our audit committee has adopted its own rules of procedure, in the form of an audit committee charter. The audit committees rules of procedure provide for a process with respect to the prior approval of all non-audit services to be performed by our independent auditors. Our audit committee reports to our board of directors regarding the scope and results of our annual audits, compliance with our accounting and financial policies and managements procedures and policies related to the adequacy of our internal accounting controls. Our audit committee was formed during 2004. In 2007 our audit committee pre-approved all of the audit services provided by KPMG.

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers In December 2004, Expedia Asia Pacific exercised its warrant and on January 7, 2005, purchased 17,362,134 of our high-vote ordinary shares for an aggregate cash purchase price of US$107.8 million, or US$6.21 per share (the equivalent of $12.42 per ADS). We used approximately one-half of the proceeds from 80 Table of Contents Expedia Asia Pacifics warrant exercise, or US$53,909,426.07, or US$6.21 per share, to purchase 8,681,067 ordinary shares from certain of our existing shareholders. The repurchase from existing shareholders were made pursuant to the agreements entered into with these shareholders in July 2004 in connection with Expedia Asia Pacifics initial investment in us and the issuance of the warrant to Expedia Asia Pacific. In April 2006, a post-closing adjustment was made such that the warrant exercise price and share repurchase price was adjusted to $6.20434 per share (the equivalent of $12.40868 per ADS). The warrant exercise price and share repurchase price are no longer subject to any adjustments. Notwithstanding the adjustment in the warrant exercise price, we did not repurchase any of our equity securities during the year ended December 31, 2006 or the year ended December 31, 2007. On February 27, 2008, we announced the approval by our board of directors of a share buy back of up to US$20 million.

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of eLong, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As discussed in Note 2(h) and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2006, the Company changed its method of accounting for employee share-based arrangements as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-based Payment. Further, as discussed in Note 2(w) to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2007, the Company changed its presentation of business tax and surcharges as permitted by Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No.06-3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That is, Gross versus Net Presentation). We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), eLong, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated June 24, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. The accompanying consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 have been translated into United States dollars solely for the convenience of the reader. We have audited the translation and, in our opinion, such financial statements expressed in Renminbi have been translated into United States dollars on the basis set forth in Note 2(d) to the consolidated financial statements. /s/ KPMG Hong Kong, China June 24, 2008 F-1 Table of Contents eLong, Inc.

F-6 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (1) ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS ELong, Inc. (the Company through its consolidated subsidiaries and variable interest entities (VIEs) (collectively the Group), is principally engaged in the provision of travel services, including hotel information and reservation services, airline reservations and ticketing, and to a lesser extent, packaged-tour services, Internet-related advertising and other related services in the Peoples Republic of China (the PRC). The Company, through its subsidiaries, conducts its operations in the PRC through a series of agreements with various VIEs. These VIEs are designed and used solely to facilitate the Companys participation in Internet content provision, short messaging, call center services, advertising business, travel agency and air-ticketing services, which are industries in the PRC in which foreign ownership is restricted. The Company does not have any direct equity interest in the VIEs. However, pursuant to certain agreements and arrangements with its VIEs, the Company has the economic controlling interest over and is the primary beneficiary of these entities. The Company has an economic controlling interest over the VIEs through a series of related agreements, including exclusive technical services agreements, equity pledge agreements, operating agreements and loan agreements. Through these agreements, the Company is the primary beneficiary of these entities as it absorbs a majority of the VIEs expected losses and receives a majority of the VIEs expected residual returns. As a result, the financial position and results of the VIEs have been consolidated in the Companys consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2007, Expedia Inc. controls approximately 95% of the Companys voting power and has the ability to control substantially all of the Companys management and business operations. (2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (a) Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and VIEs. All significant transactions and balances between the Company, its subsidiaries and VIEs have been eliminated upon consolidation. (b) Basis of presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). (c) Use of estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management of the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual financial results could differ significantly from these estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include allowances for doubtful accounts and deferred income tax assets, provision for loyalty points, stock-based compensation, the allocation of the purchase price for the Companys business acquisitions, useful lives and residual values of property and equipment and intangible assets, and the recovery of the carrying values of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets. F-7 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (d) Foreign currencies The Groups functional and reporting currency is the Renminbi (RMB.) Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the RMB are translated into RMB using the applicable exchange rates quoted by the Peoples Bank of China (PBOC) at the balance sheet dates. All such exchange gains and losses are included in foreign currency exchange loss, net in the consolidated statements of operations. Translations of amounts from RMB into United States dollars (U.S. dollars) are solely for the convenience of the reader and are calculated at the rate of US$1.00 = RMB7.2946, representing the noon buying rate in the City of New York for cable transfers of RMB, as certified for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on December 31, 2007. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted, realized or settled into U.S. dollars at that rate on December 31, 2007, or at any other rate. (e) Commitments and contingencies In the normal course of business, the Group is subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business, that cover a wide range of matters. Liabilities for such contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. (f) Revenue recognition The Groups revenues are principally derived from providing hotel reservations, air-ticketing and other related travel services. The Group recognizes revenues when all of the following have occurred: persuasive evidence of arrangement with the customer, services have been performed, fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility of the fees is reasonably assured. These criteria as related to the Groups revenues are considered to have been met as follows: Hotel reservation services The Group receives commissions from travel suppliers for hotel room reservations booked through the Group. Commissions from hotel reservation services rendered are recognized after hotel customers have completed their stay at the applicable hotel. The Group presents revenues from such transactions on a net basis in the statements of operations, as the Group acts as an agent, does not assume any inventory risk, and has no obligations to the hotel for cancelled hotel reservations. Contracts with certain travel suppliers contain escalating commissions that are subject to achieving specific performance targets. Such escalating commissions are recognized when the performance targets have been achieved. Air-ticketing services The Group receives commissions from travel suppliers for air-ticketing services booked through the Group. Commissions from air-ticketing services rendered are recognized upon the delivery of the ticket to the customer, net of estimated cancellations. Estimated cancellations were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007. The Group presents revenues from such transactions on a net basis in the statements of operations, as the Group acts as an agent, does not assume any inventory risk, and has no obligations for cancelled airline ticket reservations. Contracts with certain airlines contain discretionary escalating commissions that are paid to the Group subject to achieving specific performance targets. Such discretionary escalating commissions are recognized on a cash basis because the Group cannot reasonably estimate such commissions. F-8 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Other travel services The Group receives commissions from travel product providers for vacation package products and services booked through the Group. Commissions are recognized as revenue upon the delivery of the air ticket to the customer, net of estimated cancellations. Cancellations were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007. The Group presents revenues from such transactions on a net basis in the statements of operations, as the Group acts as an agent and does not assume any inventory risk for cancelled vacation package bookings. The Group suspended its vacation package service in July 2007. The Company also provides Chinese hotel inventory procurement, rating and availability negotiating service to Travelscape LLC (Travelscape), which is controlled by Expedia Inc. and recognizes revenue when Travelscape confirms the revenue sharing amount which is based on pre-agreed commission sharing rate. Non- travel services Non-travel services primarily comprise wireless services and Internet-related advertising services. Revenue from Internet-related advertising contracts, which is paid in cash, is recognized over the contractual advertisement display period. Revenue from the provision of wireless services is recognized when the services have been rendered, the amount can be reliably measured and there is no uncertainty of settlement with the telecom operators. The Companys subsidiaries and VIEs, are subject to business tax and surcharges on the revenues generated from services rendered in China. Commencing January 1, 2007, business tax and surcharges are recorded on a net basis (excluded from revenues) in the consolidated statement of operations. Amounts for all prior periods presented have been reclassified for comparative purpose. (g) Income taxes Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates or change in tax status is recognized in income in the period the change in tax rates or the tax law is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the amount of deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes, the tax benefits associated with the utilization of pre-acquisition net operating losses carryforwards for which a valuation allowance was established at the date of the acquisition are recognized in the consolidated financial statements after the acquisition date as follows: (i) first to reduce to zero any goodwill related to the acquisition; (ii) second to reduce to zero other non-current intangible assets related to the acquisition; and (iii) third to reduce income tax expense. On January 1, 2007, the Group adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 gives guidance related to the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, and requires that an entity recognize in its financial statements the impact of a tax position, if that F-9 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) position is more likely than not to be sustained upon an examination, based on the technical merits of the position. The adoption of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007 did not have any effect on the Groups consolidated financial statements. The Group records interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and records related penalties in general and administrative expenses in the Groups consolidated statements of operations. (h) Share-based compensation Prior to January 1, 2006, the Group accounted for employee share-based arrangements using the preferable fair value recognition provision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123). Effective January 1, 2006, the Group adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R), which replaced SFAS No. 123 and superseded APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees(APB No. 25). The Group adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective approach, and accordingly, prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of SFAS No. 123R. In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, all grants of stock options and Performance Units are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their grant date fair values. The valuation provisions of SFAS No. 123R apply to new awards granted after the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, to awards granted to employees before the adoption of SFAS No. 123R whose related requisite services had not been provided, and to awards which were subsequently modified or cancelled. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107 (SAB No. 107) relating to SFAS No. 123R. The Group has applied the provisions of SAB No. 107 in its adoption of SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the date of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates. Share-based compensation cost was recorded net of estimated forfeitures such that expense was recorded only for those share-based awards that are expected to vest. Previously under SFAS No. 123, to the extent awards were forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense was reversed in the period of forfeiture. Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Group recorded a cumulative effect of RMB 282,072 to account for the expected forfeitures of share-based awards granted prior to January 1, 2006 for which the Group previously recorded as an expense. As required by SFAS No. 123R, a balance of RMB 27,618,582 of deferred compensation on January 1, 2006, date of adoption, was eliminated against additional paid-in capital. Under SFAS No. 123R, the Group applies the Black-Scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of options granted. Risk-free interest rates are based on US Treasury yield for the terms consistent with the expected life of award at the time of grant. Expected life is based on historical exercise patterns, which the Group believes are representative of future behavior. Expected dividend yield is determined in view of the Companys historical dividend payout rate. The Group estimates expected volatility at the date of grant based on a combination of historical volatilities and volatilities of comparable companies. The Group recognizes compensation cost on all share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical forfeiture and adjusted to reflect consideration for foreseeable future changes in facts and circumstances, if any. Compensation cost related to 2006 and 2007 employee Performance Units, which are awards in the form of units that are denominated in a hypothetical equivalent number of the Companys ordinary shares, which number of units are determined based on the fair market value of the Companys ordinary shares on the date immediately preceding the grant date and which, when vested, are settled in either ordinary shares or cash. At the time of grant, the Companys board of directors or the compensation committee determines if the Company will settle the Performance Units in cash, shares or both. Settlement terms of Performance F-10 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Units, once established, may only be changed by approval of the Companys board of directors or the compensation committee. Except with respect to the Performance Units granted to the Companys independent directors which are to be settled in cash, shares or both, Performance Units granted to staff during 2006 and 2007 are to be settled in ordinary shares. Those Performance Units granted during 2006 and 2007 to the Companys independent directors are to be settled upon vesting by shares or cash that is equal to the fair market value of the vested ordinary shares on the vesting date. Forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical forfeiture and adjusted to reflect consideration for foreseeable future changes in facts and circumstances, if any. Share-based compensation awards which are settled in cash upon vesting are classified as liabilities and included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Compensation cost related to liability-classified awards is determined based on the current share price and other pertinent factors at the balance sheet date, and the proportionate amount of the requisite service that has been rendered to date. Changes in fair value of the liability-classified awards after the requisite service period has been completed are immediately recognized as compensation cost in the period in which the change in fair value occurs. The Group accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R and Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services. All transactions in which goods or services are received in exchange for equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date of the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the date on which the counterpartys performance is completed. (i) Loyalty points provision Cardholders of the VIP, regular, and co-branded cards issued by the Group earn loyalty points based on their usage of the cards. The Group provides travel awards and other non-cash gifts to the cardholders upon redemption of loyalty points that are accumulated based on cardholders transactions with the Group. Due to the limited history of the loyalty points reward program, the Group cannot make reasonable and reliable estimates of the forfeiture levels of the loyalty points. Therefore, the Group recognizes estimated costs to provide free travel and other non-cash gifts based on historical redemption rates. The liabilities for loyalty points are reduced upon the redemption or expiration of the loyalty points. The estimated costs are included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations. (j) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and demand deposit placed with banks or other financial institutions. The Group considers highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and with original maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. (k) Short-term investment Short-term investment represents a held-to-maturity debt security reported at amortized cost with a maturity of less than one year. The Company assesses declines in the value of the investment to determine whether such decline is other-than-temporary and thus the investment is impaired. This assessment is made by considering available evidence including changes in general market conditions, specific industry and F-11 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) individual company data, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the individual company, and the Companys intent and ability to hold the investment. (l) Accounts receivable Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are non-interest bearing. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Groups best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Groups existing accounts receivable. The Group reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts periodically and determines the allowance based on historical write-off experience, the aging of the accounts receivable balance and the customers credit worthiness. Specific accounts are reviewed individually for collectibility. Accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Group does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers. (m) Property and equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Group also capitalizes certain costs incurred during the application development stage related to the development of internal-use software in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) No.98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, and EITF Issue No. 00-2, Accounting for Web Site Development Costs. Costs incurred related to the planning and post-implementation phases of development are expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives, taking into account any estimated residual value: Capitalized software development cost 3 years Computer equipment and system software 3-5 years Furniture, fixtures and office equipment 5 years Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over 2 to 5 years which represents the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the assets. (n) Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired. The Group follows the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if certain circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist. The Group completes its annual impairment assessment for goodwill and intangible assets in December of each year. The Group evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. In the first step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined based upon a combination of multiple of earnings and future cash flows. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the book value of the goodwill. In determining the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill, the fair values of F-12 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) the tangible net assets and recognized and unrecognized intangible assets are deducted from the fair value of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and is written down to its implied fair value. The impairment test on an intangible asset that is not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. (o) Impairment of long-lived assets The Group evaluates for impairment of its long-lived assets to be held and used, including equipment and software, separately identifiable intangible assets which are subject to amortization and other non-current assets, when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in managements judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of carrying amount or estimated fair value less the cost to sell, and are no longer depreciated. (p) Employee benefit plans As stipulated by the regulations of the PRC, the Group participates in various defined contribution plans pursuant to which certain retirement, medical and other welfare benefits are provided to employees. The Group is required to make contributions to these plans at a stated contribution rate based on monthly basic compensation of qualified employees. The Group has no other obligation for the payment of employee benefits associated with these plans beyond the contributions described above. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, the Group contributed RMB 12,557,754, RMB16,212,136 and RMB17,820,361, respectively to these plans. (q) Statutory reserves Under PRC law, the Companys wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries are required to provide for certain statutory reserves, namely a general reserve, an enterprise expansion fund and a staff welfare and bonus fund. These subsidiaries are required to allocate at least 10% of their after tax profits on individual company basis as determined under PRC GAAP to the general reserve and have the right to discontinue allocations to the general reserve if such reserve has reached 50% of registered capital on individual company basis. Appropriations to the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund are at the discretion of the Board of Directors of these subsidiaries. The Companys VIEs in the PRC are also subject to similar statutory reserve requirements. These reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to the Company in the form of loans, advances, or cash dividends. (r) Earnings (loss) per share Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of ordinary and dilutive ordinary equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Ordinary equivalent shares consist of the ordinary shares issuable upon F-13 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) the exercise of outstanding stock options, stock warrants and the settlement of Performance Units. Ordinary equivalent shares in the diluted earnings (loss) per share computation are excluded in net loss periods as their effect would be anti-dilutive. Ordinary shares include high-vote ordinary shares. (s) Advertising expense The Group incurs advertising expense consisting of radio, magazine and SMS advertising, and online internet advertising expense to promote the Groups brands and products. The Group expenses the production costs associated with advertisements in the period in which the advertisement first takes place. The Group expenses the costs of communicating the advertisement as incurred each time the advertisement is shown. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006, and 2007, the advertising expense was RMB13,237,247, RMB12,393,014 and RMB18,742,438. As of December 31, 2006 and 2007, the Group had RMB154,699 and RMB941,711 of prepaid marketing expenses which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. (t) Segment reporting The Group operates and manages its business as two reportable segmentsHotel and Air. In accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segment of an Enterprise and Related Information (SFAS No. 131), the Groups chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the CEO, who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Group. The Group does not allocate any operating expenses or assets to its hotel and air segments as management does not use this information to measure the performance of the reportable segments. The Group generates substantially all revenues from customers in the PRC. Accordingly, no geographical segments are presented. (u) Operating leases The Group leases office space under operating lease agreements with original lease periods up to five years. Rental expenses are recognized from the date of initial possession of the leased property on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain lease agreements contain rent holidays, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease renewal periods are considered on a lease-by-lease basis and are generally not included in the initial lease term. (v) Financial instruments Financial instruments of the Group are primarily comprised of cash and cash equivalents, restricted assets, accounts receivable, investment securities, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other payables. As of December 31, 2006 and 2007, their carrying value approximated their fair value due to their short term nature. (w) Reclassification Prior to 2007, the Group recorded revenue gross of business tax and surcharges. In 2007 upon the adoption of EITF Issue No.06-3 How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation), business tax and surcharges are recognized as a reduction of revenue. Management believes that net presentation is F-14 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) preferable because such presentation presents the benefit to be retained by the Group. In 2007 business tax and surcharges have been presented on a net basis in the consolidated statement of operations. As a result of the change business tax and surcharges of RMB10,487,647 and RMB 14,702,612 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006 were reclassified from operating expenses to a reduction of revenue to conform with the current year presentation. Further, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified with no effect on net earnings or retained earnings to conform to the 2007 financial statement presentation. (x) Recently issued accounting pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measurement of fair value, and expands disclosures required for fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fair value measures already required or permitted by other standards for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. On February 12, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff position No. 157-2, Effective date of FASB Statement No. 157 which defers the effective date of SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. SFAS No. 157 is required to be adopted by the Group in fiscal year 2008. The Group does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected. SFAS No.159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and is required to be adopted by the Group in fiscal year 2008. In connection with current period financial statements, the Group does not have items eligible for Fair Value Option under SFAS No. 159. The Group does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R (Revised), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141R). SFAS No. 141R establishes requirements for the recognition and measurement of acquired assets, liabilities, goodwill, and non-controlling interests (formerly minority interests). SFAS No. 141R also provides disclosure requirements related to business combinations. SFAS No. 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 141R will be applied prospectively to business combinations with an acquisition date on or after December 15, 2008. The Group is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS 141R on its consolidated financial statements. (3) CORRECTION OF IMMATERIAL ERRORS The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006 have been adjusted from previously issued financial statements to correct the following immaterial errors: 1) As of December 31, 2006, the Group accrued income tax and business tax liabilities in relation to expenses for which, based on the Groups estimate and then available information, the related tax-qualified invoices were not expected to be collected and therefore the expenses were not deductible for tax purposes. Subsequent to December 31, 2006 and prior to the issuance of the 2006 financial statements, the Group F-15 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) collected the majority of the tax qualified invoices and therefore such expenses were deductible for tax purpose as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006. The effect of this adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2006 is to decrease income tax expense by RMB1.6 million, decrease income taxes payable by RMB2.0 million, and decrease by RMB 0.4 million each of the following: statement of operations line item, business tax and surcharges, and balance sheet line items, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and accrued expenses and other current liabilities. 2) In 2007, the Group re-evaluated its accounting for the mirror options granted to Expedia Asia Pacific, an entity controlled by Expedia, Inc., and concluded that the Expedia Asia Pacific options should be classified as a liability and re-measured to their fair value each reporting period until settlement. As a result, the Group revised the previously issued financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006 to correct an immaterial error corresponding to its accounting for 260,204 Expedia Asia Pacific mirror options. The effect of this correction is to decrease general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 by RMB0.14 million (2005: RMB 1.71 million), increase accrued expenses and other current liabilities by RMB1.99 million as of December 31, 2006, and decrease shareholders equity by RMB 2.13 million as of December 31, 2006 as compared to the Groups previously issued financial statements. (4) ACQUISITIONS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Shanghai Xinwang Computer Technology Co., Ltd. (Fortune Trip) and Bravado Investments Limited (Bravado) On July 7, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding equity interests of Fortune Trip and Bravado. The total purchase price for Fortune Trip and Bravado was RMB 21,981,392, plus capitalized acquisition costs of RMB1,394,134. The results of Fortune Trip and Bravado have been included in the consolidated statements of operations since July, 2005, the date of acquisition. Raytime In May 2006, the Group sold Raytime BVI and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Golden VIP, and ZM VIP (collectively, Raytime) for RMB 1,500,000 to the original selling shareholders of Raytime. The sale proceeds was not received in cash, but reduced the remaining RMB 4,000,000 payable by the Group to the original selling shareholders of Raytime by RMB 1,500,000. The Group recorded a gain on disposal of RMB 2,649,682 in May 2006, representing the excess of the selling price over the carrying amount of the Groups investment in these entities on the date of sale. As a result of the sale, all remaining contingent consideration payable was cancelled. Online Dating Division During the third quarter of 2006, the Group sold the interactive online dating community business to an entity, whose controlling shareholder is also the controlling shareholder of the Group for US$14,625,000 (RMB 114,780,017). As this transaction was between entities under common control, the proceeds in excess of the carrying value of the net assets sold of RMB 94,170,501 was recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital. The financial results of Raytime and the interactive online dating community businesses have been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and related disclosures for all periods presented. As a result, the footnote disclosures have been revised to exclude the amounts related to the financial results of the Raytime and interactive online dating community businesses for all periods presented. The consolidated statements of cash flows include both discontinued operations for all periods presented through the date of disposition. F-16 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The following table displays summarized information for discontinued operations: Year ended December 31, 2005 2006 2007 Revenues 21,554,483 13,173,371  Earnings (loss) before income tax (16,934,889 ) 1,226,768 112,260 Income tax expense 298,236 24,302 8,420 (5) RESTRICTED ASSETS In 2006, US$1,462,500 was deposited in an Escrow bank account as guarantees to meet the requirements of disposal of the online dating division. With an original maturity of 18 months it was included in other non-current assets as of December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2007, the US$1,543,434 was due within one year and therefore classified as current restricted assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. (6) ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE Accounts receivable consists of the following: December 31, 2006 2007 Accounts receivable 32,429,569 42,933,362 Allowance for doubtful accounts (4,192,172 ) (1,795,120 ) Account receivable, net 28,237,397 41,138,242 The following table presents movement of the allowance for accounts receivable: Year ended December 31, 2005 2006 2007 Balance at the beginning of year 1,730,738 4,128,344 4,192,172 Additions charged to bad debt expense 3,618,713 809,147 1,596,659 Write-offs charged against the allowance (1,221,107 ) (745,319 ) (3,993,711 ) Balance at the end of year 4,128,344 4,192,172 1,795,120 (7) PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment consists of the following: December 31, 2006 2007 Computer equipment 30,276,346 36,147,057 Furniture and office equipment 7,047,429 7,860,456 Leasehold improvements 6,649,282 7,608,024 Computer system software 12,866,362 20,177,194 Capitalized software development 4,215,194 6,446,696 61,054,613 78,239,427 Less: Accumulated depreciation and amortization (24,925,111 ) (37,324,263 ) Projects in process 1,679,736 3,046,420 Property and equipment, net 37,809,238 43,961,584 F-17 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) As of December 31, 2006 and 2007, the Groups capitalized software development costs, including projects in progress, net of accumulated amortization, were RMB4,608,006 and RMB5,929,193 respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006, and 2007, the Group recorded amortization of capitalized software development costs of RMB114,342, RMB1,066,682 and RMB1,785,945, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Group suspended offering vacation package products. As a result the vacation package business property and equipment was written down to its fair value and the Group recognized a charge of RMB545,216 during the year ended December 31, 2007, which is included in write-down of property and equipment and intangible assets in the consolidated statement of operations. (8) GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill and intangible assets consists of the following: December 31, 2006 2007 Goodwill 30,000,019 30,000,019 Intangible assets with definite lives, net 3,345,944 1,792,265 Intangible assets with indefinite lives 400,000 400,000 Total intangibles, net 3,745,944 2,192,265 The Groups intangible asset with indefinite lives relates to a trade name acquired in the acquisition of Fortune Trip. In 2005, the Group operated as one operating segment. Raytime BVI, Golden VIP and ZM VIP comprised the Raytime reporting unit which is one level below the Groups operating segment. The goodwill arising from these acquisitions and the related assets and liabilities, including intangible assets, were allocated to the Raytime reporting unit. Based on the lower than estimated performance of Raytime, the Group determined the definite lived intangible related to Raytime might be impaired. Accordingly, the Group performed an impairment analysis. As a result of the impairment tests undertaken of identifiable goodwill and the Raytime definite lived intangible asset, the Group recorded impairment charges, which are included in earnings from discontinued operations before income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations, of RMB 14,462,720 and RMB3,081,943 respectively for the year ended December 31, 2005. No impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2006 or 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Group recorded impairment charges of RMB 493,680 in relation to customer list in relation to Fortune Trip, which is included in write-down of property and equipment and intangible assets in the consolidated statement of operations. The impairment mainly resulted from a significant decline in forecasted sales and cash flows from Fortune Trip due to its inability to maintain active customers that contribute revenue to the Group. These factors resulted in the carrying value of the customer list being greater than its fair value, and therefore a write-down to fair value was required. The fair value of the customer list was calculated by estimating the present value of future cash flows associated with the customer list. F-18 Table of Contents eLong, Inc.

Cayman Under the current laws of Cayman Islands, the Company is not subject to tax on their income or capital gains. In addition, no Cayman Islands withholding tax is imposed upon any payments of dividends. China Prior to January 1, 2008 the Companys subsidiaries and VIEs were subject to enterprise income tax (EIT) at a rate of 33%. As described below, certain of the Companys subsidiaries and VIEs were subject to preferential rates ranging from 15% to 27% and income tax holidays ranging from 100% to 50%. eLongNet Information Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (eLong Information), a subsidiary of the Group, obtained the status of a High New Technology Enterprise in November 2006 was entitled it to a preferential EIT rate of 15% from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2007. Beijing eLong Information Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing Information), a VIE of the Group, obtained the status of a High New Technology Enterprise that entitles it to a preferential EIT rate of 15% from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2008. Beijing Information has also been granted a tax holiday for exemption of EIT for three years from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2003, and a 50% reduction in the EIT rate (i.e. 7.5%) from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2006. Further, certain branches of these VIEs are taxed at 27% of deemed taxable income, which is determined based on revenue. In March 2007, the Chinese government enacted the Corporate Income Tax (CIT) law and promulgated related regulations which were effective January 1, 2008, which imposes a unified income tax rate of 25% for both domestic and foreign invested enterprises. High New Technology Enterprise will still enjoy a preferential CIT rate of 15%, and the qualifying criteria under the CIT law was released in April 2008. The Group is in the process of evaluating eLong Information and Beijing Informations qualification as High New Technology F-20 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Enterprises under the new rules. Commencing January 1, 2008 eLong Information and Beijing Information will be subject to an income tax rate of 25%. However, if eLong Information and Beijing Information obtain a certificate of a High New Technology Enterprises, they can enjoy the preferential tax rate of 15%. There is no assurance that eLong information and Beijing Information will meet the qualifying criteria of High New Technology Enterprise. The Group expects that eLong Information and Beijing Information will apply for the High New Technology Enterprise status that will allow these entities to enjoy a 15% preferential tax rate under the CIT law. To comply with SFAS.No.109, measuring a deferred tax liability or asset using the enacted tax rate, the Group must use income tax rate of 25% in its calculation of its deferred tax balances as of December 31, 2007 until the Group receives official approval for High New Technology Enterprises status. The effect of change in rate will then be recorded as a reduction in deferred tax assets with a corresponding debit to deferred tax expense in the period in which the approval is obtained. Furthermore, prior to January 1, 2008, the Company was exempted from withholding tax on dividends it received from its PRC subsidiaries. Under the CIT law and its Implementing Rules, enterprises incorporated in a foreign country or region are classified as either a non-resident enterprise or a resident enterprise. Non-resident enterprises without an institution or establishment inside PRC, or whose income has no connection with its institutions and establishment inside PRC, are subject to withholding tax at the rate of 10% with respect to their PRC-sourced dividend income distributed from earnings accumulated after January 1, 2008. The 10% withholding tax rate is subject to applicable tax agreements or treaties between PRC and other tax jurisdiction. The undistributed earnings generated before January 1, 2008 shall be exempted from withholding tax when they are distributed to the foreign investor in the year 2008 or thereafter. The Group has not yet determined if it will be subject to the 10% withholding tax. The Chinese tax system is subject to substantial uncertainties and has been subject to recently enacted changes, the interpretation and enforcement of which are also uncertain. There can be no assurance that changes in Chinese tax laws or their interpretation or their application will not subject the Groups PRC entities to substantial Chinese taxes in the future.

The statute of limitations will be extended to five years under special circumstances, which are not clearly defined. In the case of transfer pricing issues, the statute of limitations is three years, and will be extended to ten years under special circumstances, which are not clearly defined. There is no statute of limitations in the case of tax evasion. The Groups 2003 to 2007 tax returns remain subject to examination by the PRC tax authorities. The Group did not have any unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2007, and it does not expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly within the next 12 months. No interest or penalty related to unrecognized uncertain tax positions was recorded in the 2007 consolidated financial statements. F-22 Table of Contents eLong, Inc.

Such amounts were RMB453,384, RMB(387,167), and RMB598,915 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006, and 2007, and is primarily due to certain allowances for doubtful accounts that were deemed nondeductible. The gross amount of operating loss carryforwards which will expire in 2008 to 2012 as follows: RMB1,146,621 in 2008, RMB2,376,516 in 2009, RMB4,122,083 in 2010, RMB751,724 in 2011, and RMB295,240 in 2012. Goodwill was reduced by nil, RMB4,083,112 and nil for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively, for the utilization of acquired tax benefits that were previously reduced by the valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2007, the amount of valuation allowance associated with pre-acquisition net operating losses of RMB 610,584 will be recorded as a reduction of goodwill if recognized in future years. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible or utilized. The Group considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon an assessment of the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible or can be utilized, management has provided a valuation allowance of RMB1,594,808 and RMB1,675,617 as of December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively. After reducing the F-23 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) deferred tax assets by the valuation allowance, the deferred tax assets were RMB1,281,053 and RMB1,309,323 as of December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively, represent the deferred tax assets of entities that have been profitable and therefore are more likely than not to be realized. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced. (12) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCY The Group has several non-cancelable operating leases, primarily for office rent. Payments under operating leases, including periodic rent escalation and rent free period, are charged as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases (with initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year) as of December 31, 2007 are: Minimumleasepayment 2008 8,984,340 2009 912,786 2010 131,600 2011  2012  Total 10,028,726 Rental expenses incurred under operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007 amounted to RMB 5,672,598, RMB9,643,785 and RMB 11,183,306 respectively.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The aggregated intrinsic value of stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2007 was calculated based on the closing price of the Companys ordinary shares on December 31, 2007 of $4.14 per share. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006, and 2007 was $9.5 million, $1.4 million and $0.6 million, respectively. As of December 2007, there was RMB 21.16 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of 4.1 years. Total unrecognized compensation cost may be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures. Expedia Options On October 1, 2004, the Company entered into a stock option agreement with Expedia Asia Pacific pursuant to which, in exchange for Expedia Asia Pacific giving its consent to the issuance of 250,000 options to certain of the Companys officers, the Company granted Expedia Asia Pacific an option to purchase up to 260,204 of the Companys ordinary shares at a purchase price of US$5.25 per share. The option mirrors the provisions of 250,000 option granted to the Companys officers on October 1, 2004. The option becomes exercisable by Expedia Asia Pacific each time any such officer exercises any of the 250,000 options. In connection with each exercise by an officer, Expedia Asia Pacific is entitled to exercise a portion of its option such that Expedia Asia Pacific would receive (if Expedia Asia Pacific exercises its option to the fullest extent in connection with such officer exercise) 51% of the aggregate ordinary shares issued to such officer and Expedia Asia Pacific in connection with such officer exercise. To the extent that any of the officers options terminate or expire without being exercised, an amount of Expedia Asia Pacifics option equal to 51% of (i) such officers terminated or expired options divided by (ii) 0.49 will likewise terminate or expire. Prior to January 1, 2007, the Group accounted for the 260,204 Expedia Asia Pacific options in a manner similar to employees options and the fair value as determined on the grant date was recognized over the vesting period of the 250,000 officer options In 2007, the Group re-evaluated its accounting for the Expedia Asia Pacific mirror options agreement and concluded that the Expedia Asia Pacific options should be classified as a liability and re-measured to its fair value each reporting period until settlement. The Group made an immaterial correction of an error and revised the previously issued financial statements to reflect the revised accounting method in prior periods. As a result of the re-measurement the Group recognized income (expense) of RMB50,647, RMB(1,408,475) and RMB1,871,083 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006, 2007. Further as of December 31, 2006 and 2007 the liability corresponding to the Expedia Asia Pacific options was RMB1,985,933 and RMB114,850, respectively.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) Performance Units Performance Units are rights to receive the Companys ordinary shares, or in some cases, a cash award linked to the Companys ordinary share value. Performance Units vest ratably over a five-year period, are not entitled to dividends or voting rights, and are generally converted to ordinary shares upon vesting on a one-for-one basis. When the Performance Unit grants are settled in cash, the cash amount is set at the equivalent of the fair market value of the number of the Companys ordinary shares that the grantee would have received on a particular vesting date, had the grant been settled in shares. The cost of the Performance Units awards was determined using the fair value (based on the fair value of the underlying ordinary shares on the date immediately preceding the grant date) of the Companys ordinary shares on the date of grant, net of expected forfeitures, and compensation cost was recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting term. A summary of Performance Units activity under the 2004 Plan for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007 is as follows: Number of Shares Weighted averagegrant date fair value Balance at December 31, 2005 104,895 US$ 5.00 Granted 304,545 US$ 6.94 Settled   Forfeited (84,516 ) US$ 5.20 Expired   Balance at December 31, 2006 324,924 US$ 6.83 Granted 565,880 US$ 4.84 Settled (17,154 ) US$ 6.46 Forfeited (304,088 ) US$ 5.95 Cancelled (1,856 ) US$ 7.12 Balance at December 31, 2007 567,706 US$ 4.90 The Group recorded stock-based compensation cost of RMB 14,801,571 and RMB 12,221,421 and RMB 6,002,062 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively, with respect to the stock options and Performance Units granted under the 2001 and 2004 Plans. Warrants In August 2003, the Company issued warrants to purchase 600,000 of the Companys ordinary shares at an exercise price of US$0.75 per share to Broadband Capital Management LLC (Broadband), and two outside consultants, in consideration for investment banking services provided to the Company in respect of the private placement of US$15 million aggregate principal amount of Series A preferred shares in August 2003. The Company accounted for the warrants issued to Broadband and the two consultants in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and EITF Issue No. 96-18. The fair value of the warrants granted was RMB4,818,960 on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model (excluding a volatility assumption as the Company was a non-public entity at the date the warrants were issued). The assumptions used in determining the fair value of the warrants were as follows: expected dividend yield 0%, risk free interest rate of 2.9%, and a contractual life of 10 years. The estimated fair value of the warrants of RMB4,818,960 was charged against the gross proceeds of the Series A preferred shares as such costs were incremental and specifically and directly attributable to the actual placement of such securities.

(14) PREFERRED SHARES Series B Preferred Shares On August 4, 2004, the Company issued and sold 11,188,570 Series B preferred shares to Expedia Asia Pacific, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Expedia, Inc. (or Expedia) for an aggregate purchase price of US$58,690,062 (RMB485,777,647), or US$5.25 per Series B preferred share. Pursuant to the Expedia Asia Pacific purchase agreements, the Company used the proceeds from the sale of the Series B preferred shares to repurchase from existing shareholders an aggregate of 4,012,411 of its ordinary shares and 1,581,874 of the Companys Series A preferred shares. After the share repurchase, the Company retained US$29,345,033 (RMB242,888,916) of the aggregate purchase price. Of that amount US$4,401,754 (RMB 36,433,318) was deposited into an escrow account which was subject to (i) possible claims by Expedia Asia Pacific for indemnification under the agreement between the Company and Expedia Asia Pacific for representations, warranties and covenants provided by the Company, and (ii) payment to Expedia Asia Pacific for certain post-closing matters. On August 4, 2005 and April 30, 2006, 25% and 75% of the escrow funds were released to the Company, respectively. Also in connection with the sale of the Series B preferred shares, on August 4, 2004 the Company granted Expedia Asia Pacific a warrant which was exercisable by Expedia Asia Pacific during the first 30 business days following the completion of the Companys initial public offering. Expedia Asia Pacifics warrant entitled it to purchase that number of the Companys high-vote ordinary shares which would result in Expedia Asia Pacifics holding 51% of the Companys outstanding ordinary shares on a fully-diluted basis after giving effect to the repurchase from existing shareholders of a number of ordinary shares equal to one-half of the shares purchased by Expedia Asia Pacific pursuant to its warrant. In December 2004, Expedia Asia Pacific, which is now controlled by its ultimate parent, Expedia, exercised the warrant and, on January 7, 2005, purchased 17,362,134 of the Companys high-vote ordinary shares for an aggregate cash purchase price of US$107,818,852 (RMB 892,362,729). As a result of Expedia Asia Pacifics exercise of its warrant, the Company is controlled by Expedia, and Expedia has the power to control substantially the Companys management and business operations. The Company used the proceeds from Expedia Asia Pacifics warrant exercise to repurchase 8,681,067 ordinary shares from certain of the Companys existing shareholders. Out of the total proceeds of US$53,909,426 retained by the Company, US$8,086,414 was deposited into an escrow account which was subject to (i) possible claims by Expedia Asia Pacific for indemnification under the agreement between the Company and Expedia Asia Pacific for representations, warranties and covenants provided by the Company, and (ii) payment to Expedia Asia Pacific for certain post-closing matters. As of December 31, 2005, as a result of the adjustments made on March 31, 2006 to the warrant purchase price and the share repurchase price, the Company recorded US$98,270 (RMB766,909) due to Expedia Asia Pacific with a corresponding reduction to additional paid-in capital, and recorded US$49,135 (RMB383,454) due from certain of the Companys existing shareholders with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital. On April 2006, US$9,527,365(RMB74,352,509) of the escrow funds was released to the Company, net of the above amounts due to Expedia and due from shareholders. F-28 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) On December 17, 2004, the Series B preferred shares were converted, on a one-to-one basis, into 11,188,570 high-vote ordinary shares in conjunction with Expedia Asia Pacifics exercise of the warrant to purchase high-vote ordinary shares.(See note 15) (15) ORDINARY SHARES Ordinary Shares On August 4, 2004, in connection with the issuance of the Series B preferred shares, the Company purchased from certain existing shareholders 4,012,411 ordinary shares (inclusive of the 150,500 shares described above) and 1,581,874 of the Companys Series A preferred shares. Such ordinary shares and Series A preferred shares were subsequently cancelled. 1,585,750 Series A Preferred Shares were converted into an equal number of ordinary shares effective upon the completion of the Companys initial public offering on November 2, 2004. These ordinary shares were sold by the selling shareholders to the public in the initial public offering. On the same day, 6,619,870 Series A Preferred Shares were automatically converted into an equal number of ordinary shares. Immediately prior to the closing of Expedia Asia Pacifics warrant purchase on January 7, 2005, the Company issued an aggregate of 98,973 ordinary shares to certain warrant holders at US$0.75 per share (US$74,229.75 or RMB 614,363) upon the exercise of the warrants. The Company subsequently repurchased these ordinary shares in connection with the issuance of the high-vote ordinary shares (See below). During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, the Company issued 1,718,250, 319,922 and 209,872 ordinary shares to certain of its option and Performance Units holders for an aggregate exercise price of US$1,387,922 (or RMB 11,462,361), US$772,628 (or RMB 6,094,307) and US$76,625 (or RMB 579,339), respectively. Since 2006, to facilitate the employee stock option exercise process, the Company issued depositary shares to its brokers. These shares are not considered outstanding until issued to the employees as a result of the exercise of stock options. As of December 31, 2006 and 2007, 915,042 and 755,170 depositary shares were issued to brokers and not to the shareholders. High-Vote Ordinary Shares Expedia Asia Pacific or its affiliate, Expedia, held 11,188,570 high-vote ordinary shares as a result of the automatic conversion on December 17, 2004 of all outstanding Series B Preferred Shares. Expedia Asia Pacific beneficially holds 28,550,704 high-vote ordinary shares, which constitute all of the Companys outstanding high-vote ordinary shares and, as a result, controls approximately 95% of the voting power of all shares of the Companys voting stock. In addition, certain other shareholders are parties to an investor agreement with Expedia Asia Pacific under which they have agreed to vote their ordinary shares in the election of directors designated by Expedia Asia Pacific. Expedia Asia Pacific has the ability to control the composition of the Companys Board of Directors, including the right to select six of the thirteen members of the Board, the ability to nominate the remaining directors and vote their shares to elect them and the right to vote their shares to remove members of the Board of Directors. The rights of the ordinary shares and high-vote ordinary shares are the same except that each high-vote ordinary share is entitled to 15 votes, whereas each ordinary share is entitled to one vote.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (16) EARNINGS (LOSS) PER ORDINARY SHARE Potentially dilutive securities that could potentially dilute basic earnings per ordinary share include stock options and Performance Units granted to employees, directors and non-employees and stock warrants granted to non-employees. In 2005 and 2007, ordinary equivalent shares in the diluted loss per ordinary share computation are excluded as their effect would be anti-dilutive. Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per ordinary share have been calculated as follows: For the year ended December 31, 2005 2006 2007 Net earnings (loss) applicable to ordinary shareholders (60,517,659 ) 1,040,411 (25,587,611 ) Denominator for basic earnings (loss) per share: Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding 49,637,963 50,391,885 50,756,869 Denominator for diluted earnings (loss) per share: 49,637,963 53,749,470 50,756,869 Basic earnings (loss) per share (1.22 ) 0.02 (0.51 ) Diluted earnings (loss) per share (1.22 ) 0.02 (0.51 ) (17) CONCENTRATION OF RISKS Credit and concentration risks The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and other receivables represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets. As of December 31, 2006 and 2007, substantially all of the Groups cash and cash equivalents were held in major financial institutions located in the PRC, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the United States, which management believes are of high credit quality. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and denominated in RMB, and are derived from revenues earned from operations arising in the PRC. The Group performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable. The Group maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts and actual losses have been within managements expectations. The Group has a diversified base of customers. No individual customer contributed to more than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2006 and 2007. The Group does not have concentrations of available sources of labors, services, franchises, licenses or other rights that could, if suddenly eliminated, severely impact its operations. Business and economic risks The Groups business is subject to certain risks and concentrations including dependence on relationships with travel suppliers, primarily airlines and hotels, dependence on third-party technology providers, exposure to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud. The Group conducts its principal operations in the PRC and accordingly is subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated with investments in equity securities of United States and Western European companies. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic, legal environment and social uncertainties in the PRC, influence of the China National Tourism Administration over certain aspects of the Groups operations and competition in the travel agency industry. F-30 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) The Group is currently targeting the Chinese market. The Chinese government regulates Internet access, the distribution of online news and other information, the provision of online commerce and provision of travel agency services through strict business licensing requirements and other governmental regulations. These regulations include limiting foreign ownership in Chinese companies providing Internet access, information and other online Internet services and travel agency services. Management, after consultation and advice from PRC legal counsel, is of the opinion that the Groups business complies with existing Chinese laws and regulations. However, the interpretation and application of current or proposed requirements and regulations may have an adverse effect on the Groups business, financial condition and result of operations. (18) SEGMENT INFORMATION Since the year of 2006, the Group has operated two reportable segments: Hotel and Air. These reportable segments are business units that offer different products that are managed separately because each requires different service provision and marketing strategies. The Hotel segment mainly provides the services to customers for the reservation with hotels and the Air segment provides the services to customers for the air tickets booking with airline companies. Other segment provides internet-related advertising services. In 2007 the Group started to recognize business tax and surcharges as a reduction of revenue and use revenue net of business tax to measure operating performance.

Opening Term (18 months) a) ECT, operating through one or more affiliates (ECT China), will pay eLong 33% of supplier-generated air revenues and 20% of supplier-generated hotel revenues. The term supplier-generated revenues shall mean those revenues received by ECT China and that are attributable to an ECT China clients purchase of (i) domestic air tickets and / or lodging in China; or (ii) China outbound air tickets. For the purposes of this Agreement, China shall mean mainland China only, excluding Hong Kong and Taiwan. b) eLong will waive the existing non-compete term stated in Article 5 of the July 23, 2004 Transaction Agreement among eLong and ECTs predecessor-in-interest, IAC (the Non-Compete) to allow ECT China or its affiliates to operate in the China corporate travel market. The waiver shall be subject to ECT China abiding by the terms of the Agreement during any period that this Agreement remains in effect. If a court of competent jurisdiction has issued a final decision, judgment, decree or other order finding that ECT China has materially breached the Agreement, and failed to cure the breach in a reasonable period following written notice from eLong, then the Agreement shall terminate and the Non-Compete shall be reinstated and shall apply to the parties. c) Commencing on the date of this Agreement, eLong and ECT China will, in good faith, negotiate a contract (the Initial Contract) on industry-standard terms and conditions pursuant to which eLong shall provide fulfillment services to ECT China, these include: processing transactions for travel by ECT customers; providing daily data on the details of these transactions; and processing change requests. For the avoidance of doubt, the Initial Contract shall (i) terminate not less than eighteen months from the date of this Agreement (the Opening Term), and (ii) require that eLong meet mutually agreed SLAs, which shall be negotiated in good faith. During the Opening Term, ECT China will pay no additional revenue to eLong outside that set forth in Section I (a) above, but will cover costs previously agreed in advance, as set forth in Section I (f) below. d) eLong shall, in partnership with ECT China, provide online tools including a simple white label version of the current eLong website by which customers can view available flights, hotels etc. but not book. They will be directed to the ECT China call center for booking. e) If eLong is unable to meet the agreed SLAs, ECT China shall provide eLong written notice of the service shortcoming, and if eLong fails to promptly cure the shortcoming to ECT Chinas satisfaction, ECT China may contract with a separate fulfillment provider (the date of the transfer of the fulfillment contract to be called the Transition Date). In that event, ECT China will continue to pay eLong 33% of supplier-generated air revenues and 20% of supplier-generated hotel revenues during the Opening Term. f) During the Opening Term of the Agreement, ECT China will compensate eLong for reasonable additional costs incurred in the delivery of the ECT China fulfillment relationship. The parties anticipate that such costs may include reasonable expenses incurred by eLong in the development and provision of the online tools and website set forth in Section I (d) above, and reasonable staff training costs, if any. These costs will be mutually agreed in writing in advance of their being borne by ECT China. Costs not agreed to in writing in advance will not be paid. The current estimate of the salary costs to be incurred by eLong for an exclusive staff of 3 experienced agents is 3,000 RMB/agent/month, totaling up to 108,000 RMB per year, with lower sums for less experienced agents. g) ECT China will provide full-time management for their business in addition to a bi-lingual call center to take reservations in Mandarin and English. Each party will appoint a primary senior-level contact person responsible for facilitating day-to-day cooperation between ECT China and eLong throughout the term of this Agreement. ECT China will provide, if reasonably necessary and requested by eLong, on-site training and ECT management responses to reasonable inquiries designed to improve service. eLong will provide access to its operations and management to facilitate similar requests from ECT China. ECT China clients will not be directed to call eLong directly and eLong will not be responsible for marketing to ECT China clients. h) Subject to eLongs lessor providing permission, eLong will sub-lease ECT China space in its Shanghai office for a team of approximately 6-8 people at an annual cost of up to 50,000 RMB, assuming costs of 1.5RMB/sq meter/day. eLong will provide ECT China with a written sub-lease. i) For the avoidance of doubt, ECT China will cease paying eLong 33% of supplier-generated air revenues and 20% of supplier-generated hotel revenues at the end of this Opening Term.
