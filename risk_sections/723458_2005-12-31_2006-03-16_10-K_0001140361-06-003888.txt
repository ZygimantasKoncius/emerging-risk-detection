PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS General State Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”), a one-bank holding company, was formed on June 24, 1986. The Company operates as the parent for its wholly owned subsidiary, State Bank of Long Island and subsidiaries (the "Bank"), a New York state-chartered commercial bank founded in 1966 and its unconsolidated wholly owned subsidiaries, State Bancorp Capital Trust I and II, entities formed in 2002 and 2003, respectively, to issue Trust Preferred securities. These Trust Preferred securities are classified as junior subordinated debentures in the financial statements. The Bank is a New York state chartered commercial bank conducting a general banking business focused on the small to mid-sized business, municipal and consumer markets in Long Island and Queens, New York. The Bank, through a strategy of measured, orderly growth emphasizing high-quality personal service, has grown to be the largest independent commercial bank headquartered in Nassau County. The income of the Company is derived through the operations of the Bank and its subsidiaries, SB Portfolio Management Corp. (“SB Portfolio”), SB Financial Services Corp. (“SB Financial”), New Hyde Park Leasing Corporation (“NHPL”) and its subsidiaries, P.W.B. Realty, L.L.C. (“PWB”) and State Title Agency, LLC, Studebaker-Worthington Leasing Corp. (“SWLC”) and SB ORE Corp. At December 31, 2005, the Company, on a consolidated basis, had total assets of approximately $1.6 billion, total deposits of approximately $1.4 billion, and stockholders' equity of approximately $56.4 million. Unless the context otherwise requires, references herein to the Company include the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. The Bank provides a full range of banking services to customers located primarily in Nassau, Suffolk and Queens Counties. The Bank serves its customer base through sixteen full-service branches in those counties and a lending center in Jericho, NY. The Bank’s deposit products include checking, savings, time, money market and IRA accounts. The Bank offers secured and unsecured commercial and consumer loans. Additional credit services offered include commercial mortgage loans, construction mortgage loans, letters of credit, equipment leasing, other commercial installment loans and lines of credit, home equity lines of credit, residential mortgage loans and auto and other personal loans. In addition, the Bank provides safe deposit services, merchant credit card services, access to annuity products and mutual funds and a consumer debit card with membership in a national ATM network. Through an alliance with U.S. Trust Company, the Bank also offers its customers access to financial planning and wealth management services. The Bank also offers its customers on-line banking, bill payment and cash management services. The Bank’s strategy of establishing and maintaining long-term customer relationships has contributed to the Bank’s relatively stable core deposit base. The Bank considers its business to be highly competitive in its market areas. The Bank vies with local, regional and national depository financial institutions and other businesses with respect to its lending services and in attracting deposits, including commercial banks, savings banks, insurance companies, credit unions, money market funds and affiliates of consumer goods manufacturers. Although the Bank is considerably smaller in size than many of these institutions operating in its market areas, it has demonstrated the ability to compete effectively with them. The Bank has various operating subsidiaries. NHPL owns 51% of PWB, which was formed in 2002 to own the Bank’s branch premises located in Port Washington, New York. It also owns 51% of State Title Agency, LLC, formed in 2004, to provide an opportunity for the Bank to offer title insurance for commercial transactions. NHPL, PWB and State Title Agency, LLC, are not material in terms of contributions to the Company’s results of operations. The Bank owns 100% of SB ORE Corp., formed in 1994 to hold foreclosed property. In 1998, the Bank established SB Portfolio and SB Financial, two wholly owned Delaware-based subsidiaries. SB Portfolio holds and manages a portfolio of fixed income investments while SB Financial provides balance sheet management services such as interest rate risk modeling and asset/liability management reporting along with general advisory services to the Company and its subsidiaries. The Bank’s leasing activity is primarily conducted by SWLC (acquired in 2001) which has a thirty year history of nationwide equipment leasing. Table of Contents Neither the Company nor any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers. No material amount of deposits is obtained from a single depositor. The Bank does not rely on foreign sources of funds or income and the Bank does not have any foreign commitments, with the exception of letters of credit issued on behalf of several of its customers. The Bank's nature and conduct of business have remained substantially unchanged since year-end 2004. The Company expects that compliance with provisions regulating environmental controls will have no material effect upon the capital, expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company. The Company operates in the banking industry and management considers the Company to be aggregated in one reportable operating segment. The Bank has not experienced any material seasonal fluctuations in its business. The Company has not had material expenditures for research and development. The Company employed 368 full-time and part-time officers and employees as of December 31, 2005. The Company’s Internet address is www.statebankofli.com. The Company makes available on its website its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments thereto as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company files such material with, or furnishes such material to, the Securities and Exchange Commission, as applicable. Supervision and Regulation The Company is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHCA”), and is therefore subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board ("FRB"). The Bank’s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). The Bank is subject to the regulation and supervision of the New York Banking Department (the "Banking Department") and the FDIC. The following summary discussion sets forth certain of the material elements of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to banks and bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. The regulation of banks and bank holding companies is extremely complex and this summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable statutes, regulations and regulatory guidance. Management believes the Company is in compliance in all material respects with these laws and regulations. A change in applicable statutes and regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on the business of the Company and/or the Bank. Bank holding companies and banks are prohibited by law from engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices. Federal and New York State banking laws, regulations and policies extensively regulate the Company and the Bank including prescribing standards relating to capital, earnings, dividends, the repurchase or redemption of shares, loans or extension of credit to affiliates and insiders, internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, asset growth, impaired assets and loan to value ratios. Such laws and regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, other customers and the federal deposit insurance funds and not for the protection of security holders. Bank regulatory agencies have broad examination and enforcement power over bank holding companies and banks, including the power to impose substantial fines, limit dividends and restrict operations and acquisitions. As a bank holding company, the Company may not acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company, including a bank, without the prior approval of the FRB, except as specifically authorized under the BHCA. Under the BHCA, the Company, subject to the approval of or notice to the FRB, may acquire shares of non-banking corporations, the activities of which are deemed by the FRB to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. A bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit all available resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy. Consistent with this “source of strength” policy, the FRB takes the position that a bank holding company generally should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders is sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Table of Contents The Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring "control" of a bank holding company unless the FRB has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the FRB, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, would, under the circumstances set forth in the presumption, constitute acquisition of control of the Company. In addition, any entity is required to obtain the approval of the FRB under the BHCA before acquiring 25% (5% in the case of an acquirer that is a bank holding company) or more of the Company's outstanding common stock, or otherwise obtaining control or a "controlling influence" over the Company. The New York Banking Law (the “Banking Law”) similarly regulates a change in control affecting the Bank and requires the approval of the New York State Banking Board or Superintendent of Banks. The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended (the “Interstate Banking Act”) generally permits bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state, and preempts all state laws restricting the ownership by a bank holding company of banks in more than one state. The Interstate Banking Act also permits a bank to merge with an out-of-state bank and convert any offices into branches of the resulting bank if both states have not opted out of interstate branching; permits a bank to acquire branches from an out-of-state bank if the law of the state where the branches are located permits the interstate branch acquisition; and permits banks to establish and operate de novo interstate branches whenever the host state opts-in to de novo branching. Bank holding companies and banks seeking to engage in transactions authorized by the Interstate Banking Act must be adequately capitalized and managed. The Banking Law authorizes interstate branching by merger or acquisition on a reciprocal basis, and permits the acquisition of a single branch without restriction, but does not provide for de novo interstate branching. Bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks are also subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”). Under the terms of the CRA, the FDIC (or other appropriate bank regulatory agency) is required, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess such bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by that bank, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Furthermore, such assessment is also required of any bank that has applied, among other things, to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of a federally regulated financial institution or to open or relocate a branch office. In the case of a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or bank holding company, the FRB will assess the record of each subsidiary bank of the applicant bank holding company in considering the application. The Banking Law contains provisions similar to the CRA which are applicable to New York state chartered banks. Bank holding companies and their affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of certain services, such as extensions of credit, to other services offered by a holding company or its affiliates. The Company’s primary source of income is dividends from the Bank. Certain regulatory agencies impose limitations on the declaration of dividends by the Bank. Under these limitations, at December 31, 2005, no dividends could be declared by the Bank without prior approval of those regulatory agencies. The Federal banking regulators have adopted risk-based capital and leverage guidelines that require the Company’s capital-to-assets ratios meet certain minimum standards. The risk-based capital ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet financial instruments into four weighted categories, with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk. For a further discussion, see the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Government Monetary Policies and Economic Control The earnings of the Company and the Bank are affected by the policies of regulatory authorities including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the FDIC. An important function of the Federal Reserve System is to regulate the money supply and interest rates. Among the instruments used to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. Government securities, changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits and changes in the Federal discount rate. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits and their use may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits. Changes in government monetary policies and economic controls could have a material effect on the business of the Bank.

Management's review includes monthly analyses of past due and nonaccrual loans and detailed, periodic loan-by-loan analyses. Based on current economic conditions, management has determined that the current level of the allowance for probable loan losses is adequate in relation to the probable incurred losses present in the portfolio.

RISK FACTORS The following are certain risks that management believes are specific to the Company’s business. This should not be viewed as an all inclusive list or in any particular order. Changes in economic conditions or interest rates may negatively affect the Company’s earnings, capital and liquidity. The results of operations for financial institutions, including the Bank, may be materially and adversely affected by changes in prevailing local and national economic conditions, including declines in real estate market values, rapid increases or decreases in interest rates and changes in the monetary and fiscal policies of the Federal government. The Company’s profitability is heavily influenced by the spread between the interest rates it earns on investments and loans and the interest rates it pays on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Substantially all of its loans are to businesses and individuals in the New York State counties of Nassau, Suffolk and Queens and any decline in the economy of this area could adversely affect the Company. Like most banking institutions, the Company’s net interest spread and margin will be affected by general economic conditions and other factors that influence market interest rates and its ability to respond to changes in such rates. At any given time, the Company’s assets and liabilities may be such that they are affected differently by a given change in interest rates. The Company’s credit losses could increase and the Company’s allowance for probable loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses. The risk of nonpayment of loans is inherent in all lending activities and nonpayment, if it occurs, may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s earnings and overall financial condition as well as the value of its common stock. A downturn in the economy or the real estate market in its market areas or a rapid change in interest rates could have a negative effect on collateral values and borrowers’ ability to repay. The Company makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of its loan portfolio and provides an allowance for potential losses based on a number of factors. If the Company’s assumptions are wrong, the allowance for probable loan and lease losses may not be sufficient to cover its losses, thereby having an adverse effect on operating results, and may cause an increase in the allowance in the future. The actual amount of future provisions for loan losses cannot now be determined and may exceed the amounts of past provisions. Additionally, Federal banking regulators, as an integral part of their supervisory function, periodically review the allowance for probable loan losses. These regulatory agencies may require the Company to increase its provision for probable loan losses or to recognize further loan or lease charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may be different from those of the Company. Any increase in the allowance for probable loan losses could have a negative effect on net income, financial condition and results of operations. Litigation may have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition. Item 3 of this Form 10-K includes detailed information about litigation arising out of the Bank’s deposit relationship with Island Mortgage Network, Inc. (“IMN”) and its affiliates. The Company has recorded the full $74.2 million nonrecurring expense for the awarded compensatory damages and prejudgment interest in its 2005 financial statements. The Company expects to continue to devote significant time and resources to defending itself, including costs related to a post-verdict motion to the District Court and if that motion is unsuccessful, the costs of pursuing an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, including the accrual of post-judgment interest during the pendency of such an appeal. The Bank believes it has a number of meritorious arguments for the post-verdict motion and a possible appeal and will pursue its rights vigorously; however, the ultimate outcome of the IMN lawsuits cannot be predicted with certainty. It also remains possible that other parties may pursue additional claims against the Bank related to the Bank’s dealings with IMN and its affiliates. The Company’s success is dependent on its ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry. The Company faces competition in attracting and retaining deposits, making loans, and providing other financial services throughout its market area. Many of its competitors have been in business for many years, have established customer bases, are larger and have higher lending limits. The Company’s competitors include other community banks, larger banking institutions and a wide range of other financial institutions such as credit unions, mutual fund and insurance companies and other non-bank businesses. Some of the financial institutions and financial services organizations with which it competes are not subject to the same degree of regulation. The Company is subject to extensive state and Federal legislation, supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of its operations. The impact of any changes to laws or regulations or their interpretations and/or financial accounting and reporting standards could be materially adverse to the Company and its shareholders. Table of Contents The Company’s ability to pay dividends is limited by law and contract. The Company is a holding company and substantially all of its assets are held by the Bank. Its ability to continue to make dividend payments to its shareholders will depend primarily on available cash resources at the holding company and dividends from the Bank. Dividend payments or extensions of credit from the Bank are subject to regulatory limitations, generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings, imposed by regulatory agencies with authority over the Bank. The ability of the Bank to declare dividends is also subject to its profitability, financial condition, capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements. Currently, based on its capital levels and current and retained earnings, the Bank is prohibited from declaring dividends without regulatory approval and it is unknown whether such approval will be granted. The Bank presently intends to make application for permission to declare dividends when deemed appropriate. However, the Company cannot make any assurances that the Bank will be able to declare dividends at any specific time in the future. The Company is also prohibited from declaring dividends on its common stock if the required payments on its subordinated debentures have not been made. Although the Company may be dependent on Bank dividends to pay the trust preferred interest, and the Bank may not be able to declare dividends, the subordinated debentures allow for up to two extension periods of 20 consecutive months each during which time payment of interest may be deferred by the Company. The Company continually encounters technological change, and may have fewer resources than its competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements. The banking industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. The Company’s future success will depend, in part, on its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in its operations. Many competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to its customers. The market price for the Company’s common stock fluctuates. The market price for the Company’s common stock fluctuates, ranging between $16.56 and $23.58 for 2005. There may be significant impact on the market price for the Company’s common stock due to, among other things: · Variances in the Company’s anticipated or actual operating results or the results of its competitors; · Changes in investors’ or analysts’ perceptions of the risks and conditions of its business; · The Company’s announcements of developments related to its business; · Regulatory developments; · News reports of trends, concerns and other issues related to the financial services industry; · Market or general economic conditions. The overall market price of the Company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future, and those fluctuations may be unrelated to the Company’s performance. General market price decline or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of its common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices.
