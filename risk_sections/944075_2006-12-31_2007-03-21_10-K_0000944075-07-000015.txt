1A. Risk Factors We have a history of operating losses and may not achieve ongoing profitability. We were unprofitable in each of the quarters in fiscal 2006. We were profitable in two quarters in 2005, but unprofitable for fiscal year 2005. Fiscal year 2004 was the first profitable year in our history, but only to the extent of $288,000. Prior to 2004, we incurred significant operating losses in each financial period since our inception. To achieve ongoing profitability, we must accomplish numerous objectives, including growth in our business and the development of successful new products. We cannot foresee with any certainty whether we will be able to achieve these objectives in the future. Accordingly, we may not generate sufficient net revenue to achieve ongoing profitability. If we cannot achieve ongoing profitability, we will not be able to support our operations from positive cash flows, and we would use our existing cash to support operating losses. If we are unable to secure the necessary capital to replace that cash, we may need to suspend some or all of our current operations. We may require additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, or on terms that would not cause substantial dilution to your stock holdings. Although we do not anticipate the need to raise additional capital during the next twelve months to fund our operations, we may incur operating losses in future quarters and may need to raise capital to fund these losses. Our forecasts are highly dependent on factors beyond our control, including market acceptance of our products and sales of handheld computers. If capital requirements vary materially from those currently planned, we may require additional capital sooner than expected. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, the availability of our bank line is dependent upon our meeting certain covenants, including a tangible net worth covenant. Future operating losses could cause us to lose the availability of our bank line as a result of becoming non-compliant with these covenants. If third-parties do not produce and sell innovative products with which our products are compatible, or if our line of handheld computers is not successful, we may not achieve our sales projections. Our success has been dependent upon the ability of third-parties in the mobile personal computer industry to complete development of products that include or are compatible with our technology and then to sell these products into the marketplace. Even if we are successful in marketing and selling our new line of handheld computers, our ability to generate increased revenue depends significantly on the commercial success of Windows-mobile handheld devices, particularly the Pocket PC and other devices such as the line of handhelds with expansion options offered by Palm, and the adoption of handheld computers for business use. If manufacturers are unable or choose not to ship new products such as Pocket PC and other Windows-mobile devices or Palm devices on schedule, or experience difficulties with new product transitions that cause delays in the market as we experienced in 2005 and 2006, or if these products fail, including our new line of handheld computers, to achieve or maintain market acceptance, the number of our potential new customers would be reduced and we would not be able to meet our sales expectations. 15 (Table of Contents) If we fail to develop and introduce new products rapidly and successfully, we will not be able to compete effectively, and our ability to generate sufficient revenues will be negatively affected. The market for our products is prone to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and short product life cycles. If we are unsuccessful at developing and introducing new products and services on a timely basis that include the latest technologies conforming to the newest standards and that are appealing to end users, we will not be able to compete effectively, and our ability to generate significant revenues will be seriously harmed. The development of new products and services can be very difficult and requires high levels of innovation. The development process is also lengthy and costly. Short product life cycles expose our products to the risk of obsolescence and require frequent new product introductions. We will be unable to introduce new products and services into the market on a timely basis and compete successfully, if we fail to: identify emerging standards in the field of mobile computing products; enhance our products by adding additional features; invest significant resources in research and development, sales and marketing, and customer support; maintain superior or competitive performance in our products; and anticipate our end users' needs and technological trends accurately. We cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to make adequate investments in research and development or that we will be able to identify trends or make the technological advances necessary to be competitive. Beginning January 1, 2006 we began to expense options granted under our employee stock plans as compensation, and as a result our net income and earnings per share were negatively affected, we may continue to have net losses as a result of the requirement to expense options, and may find it necessary to change our business practices to attract and retain employees. Historically, we have used stock options as a key component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock options provide an incentive to our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the use of vesting, encourage valued employees to remain with us. The expensing of employee stock options adversely affected our net income and earnings per share in fiscal 2006, will continue to adversely affect future quarters, and will make profitability harder to achieve or make our net losses worse. In addition, we may decide in response to the effects of expensing stock options on our operating results to reduce the number of stock options granted to employees or to grant options to fewer employees. This could adversely affect our ability to retain existing employees and attract qualified candidates, and also could increase the cash compensation we would have to pay to them. A significant portion of our revenue currently comes from two distributors, and any decrease in revenue from these distributors could harm our business. A significant portion of our revenue comes from two distributors, Tech Data Corp. and Ingram Micro, Inc., which together represented approximately 40 percent, 42 percent, and 43 percent of our worldwide revenue in fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. We expect that a significant portion of our revenue will continue to depend on sales to Tech Data Corp. and Ingram Micro, Inc. We do not have long-term commitments from Tech Data Corp. or Ingram Micro, Inc. to carry our products. Either could choose to stop selling some or all of our products at any time, and each of these companies also carries our competitors' products. If we lose our relationship with Tech Data Corp. or Ingram Micro, Inc., we would experience disruption and delays in marketing our products. Revenues related to these two major distributors fell markedly in the third quarter 2006 to 32 percent, due primarily to a reduction in the level of corporate handheld deployments by one of our key North American channel partners. 16 (Table of Contents) If the market for mobile computers experiences delays, or fails to grow, we will not achieve our sales projections. Substantially all of our products are designed for use with mobile personal computers, including handhelds, notebook computers, tablets and smartphones. If the mobile personal computer industry does not grow, if its growth slows, or if product or operating system changeovers by mobile computer manufacturers and partners cause delays in the market, as we experienced in 2006 and 2005, or if the markets for our mobile handheld computers do not grow, we will not achieve our sales projections. Our sales will be hurt if the new technologies used in our products do not become widely adopted, or are adopted slower than expected. Many of our products use new technologies, such as 2D bar code scanning and RFID, which are not yet widely adopted in the market. If these technologies fail to become widespread, or are adopted slower than expected, our sales will suffer. We could face increased competition in the future, which would adversely affect our financial performance. The market for handheld computers in which we operate is very competitive. Our future financial performance is contingent on a number of unpredictable factors, including that: some of our competitors have greater financial, marketing, and technical resources than we do; we periodically face intense price competition, particularly when our competitors have excess inventories and discount their prices to clear their inventories; and certain original equipment manufacturers of personal computers, mobile phones and handheld computers offer built-in functions, such as Bluetooth wireless technology, Wi-Fi, or bar code scanning, that compete with our products. Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins, and loss of market share. Our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. 17 (Table of Contents) If we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, our operating results will suffer. The demand for our products depends on many factors and is difficult to forecast. We expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support more products and as competition in the market for our products intensifies. If demand increases beyond forecasted levels, we would have to rapidly increase production at our third-party manufacturers. We depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components, and suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand. Even if we were able to procure enough components, our third-party manufacturers might not be able to produce enough of our devices to meet our customer demand. In addition, rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses. These higher costs could lower our profit margins. Further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing yields could decline, which may also lower operating results. If demand is lower than forecasted levels, we could have excess production resulting in higher inventories of finished products and components, which could lead to write-downs or write-offs of some or all of the excess inventories. Lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity at our third-party manufacturers and in our failure to meet minimum purchase commitments, each of which may lower our operating results. We rely primarily on distributors, resellers, and original equipment manufacturers to sell our products, and our sales would suffer if any of these third-parties stops selling our products effectively. Because we sell our products primarily through distributors, resellers, and original equipment manufacturers, we are subject to risks associated with channel distribution, such as risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products. Our distribution channels may build up inventories in anticipation of growth in their sales. If such growth in their sales does not occur as anticipated, the inventory build up could contribute to higher levels of product returns. The lack of sales by any one significant participant in our distribution channels could result in excess inventories and adversely affect our operating results. Our agreements with distributors, resellers, and original equipment manufacturers are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated on short notice by them without cause. Our distributors, resellers, and original equipment manufacturers are not within our control, are not obligated to purchase products from us, and may offer competitive lines of products simultaneously. Sales growth is contingent in part on our ability to enter into additional distribution relationships and expand our sales channels. We cannot predict whether we will be successful in establishing new distribution relationships, expanding our sales channels or maintaining our existing relationships. A failure to enter into new distribution relationships or to expand our sales channels could adversely impact our ability to grow our sales. We allow our distribution channels to return a portion of their inventory to us for full credit against other purchases. In addition, in the event we reduce our prices, we credit our distributors for the difference between the purchase price of products remaining in their inventory and our reduced price for such products. Actual returns and price protection may adversely affect future operating results, particularly since we seek to continually introduce new and enhanced products and are likely to face increasing price competition. 18 (Table of Contents) We depend on alliances and other business relationships with a small number of third-parties, and a disruption in any one of these relationships would hinder our ability to develop and sell our products. We depend on strategic alliances and business relationships with leading participants in various segments of the communications and mobile personal computer markets to help us develop and market our products. Our strategic partners may revoke their commitment to our products or services at any time in the future or may develop their own competitive products or services. Accordingly, our strategic relationships may not result in sustained business alliances, successful product or service offerings, or the generation of significant revenues. Failure of one or more of such alliances could result in delay or termination of product development projects, failure to win new customers, or loss of confidence by current or potential customers. We have devoted significant research and development resources to design activities for Windows-mobile products, Palm devices, smartphones using Windows Mobile and Symbian System 60 and 80 operating systems, handheld computers from Research-in-Motion, and more recently, to developing our own family of handheld mobile computers. Such design activities have diverted financial and personnel resources from other development projects. These design activities are not undertaken pursuant to any agreement under which Microsoft, Palm, Symbian or Research-in-Motion is obligated to continue the collaboration or to support the products produced from the collaboration. Consequently, these organizations may terminate their collaborations with us for a variety of reasons, including our failure to meet agreed-upon standards or for reasons beyond our control, such as changing market conditions, increased competition, discontinued product lines, and product obsolescence. Our intellectual property and proprietary rights may be insufficient to protect our competitive position. Our business depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret laws, and other restrictions on disclosure to protect our proprietary technologies. We cannot be sure that these measures will provide meaningful protection for our proprietary technologies and processes. We cannot be sure that any patent issued to us will be sufficient to protect our technology. The failure of any patents to provide protection to our technology would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products. In connection with our participation in the development of various industry standards, we may be required to license certain of our patents to other parties, including our competitors, that develop products based upon the adopted standards. We also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, distributors, and strategic partners, and generally control access to our documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third-party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products, services, or technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently, or design around our patents. Effective copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries. Furthermore, certain of our customers have entered into agreements with us which provide that the customers have the right to use our proprietary technology in the event we default in our contractual obligations, including product supply obligations, and fail to cure the default within a specified period of time. 19 (Table of Contents) We may become subject to claims of intellectual property rights infringement, which could result in substantial liability. In the course of operating our business, we may receive claims of intellectual property infringement or otherwise become aware of potentially relevant patents or other intellectual property rights held by other parties. Many of our competitors have large intellectual property portfolios, including patents that may cover technologies that are relevant to our business. In addition, many smaller companies, universities, and individuals have obtained or applied for patents in areas of technology that may relate to our business. The industry is moving towards aggressive assertion, licensing, and litigation of patents and other intellectual property rights. For example, in January 2007, the Washington Research Foundation filed a patent lawsuit against Nokia, Samsung, and Panasonic, alleging these wireless device makers of using infringing Bluetooth microprocessors in their products. Socket has not been named in the lawsuit, and we do not plan to make any changes to our current business at this time. The outcome of this lawsuit may result in future changes to our business. If we are unable to obtain and maintain licenses on favorable terms for intellectual property rights required for the manufacture, sale, and use of our products, particularly those products which must comply with industry standard protocols and specifications to be commercially viable, our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely impacted. In addition to disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of other parties' rights, we may become involved in disputes relating to our assertion of our own intellectual property rights. Whether we are defending the assertion of intellectual property rights against us or asserting our intellectual property rights against others, intellectual property litigation can be complex, costly, protracted, and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Plaintiffs in intellectual property cases often seek injunctive relief, and the measures of damages in intellectual property litigation are complex and often subjective or uncertain. Thus, any adverse determinations in this type of litigation could subject us to significant liabilities and costs. New industry standards may require us to redesign our products, which could substantially increase our operating expenses. Standards for the form and functionality of our products are established by standards committees. These independent committees establish standards, which evolve and change over time, for different categories of our products. We must continue to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards so that our products are interoperable and we remain competitive. Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers. Should any major changes, even if anticipated, occur, we would be required to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time, we would miss opportunities to sell our products for use with new hardware components from mobile computer manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers, thus affecting our business. 20 (Table of Contents) Undetected flaws and defects in our products may disrupt product sales and result in expensive and time-consuming remedial action. Our hardware and software products may contain undetected flaws, which may not be discovered until customers have used the products. From time to time, we may temporarily suspend or delay shipments or divert development resources from other projects to correct a particular product deficiency. Efforts to identify and correct errors and make design changes may be expensive and time consuming. Failure to discover product deficiencies in the future could delay product introductions or shipments, require us to recall previously shipped products to make design modifications, or cause unfavorable publicity, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which could cause our stock price to decline. We expect to experience quarterly fluctuations in operating results in the future. We generally ship orders as received, and as a result we may have little backlog. Quarterly revenue and operating results therefore depend on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Historically, we have often recognized a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of the quarter. This subjects us to the risk that even modest delays in orders may adversely affect our quarterly operating results. Our operating results may also fluctuate due to factors such as: the demand for our products; the size and timing of customer orders; unanticipated delays or problems in our introduction of new products and product enhancements; the introduction of new products and product enhancements by our competitors; the timing of the introduction of new products that work with our connection products; changes in the proportion of revenues attributable to royalties and engineering development services; product mix; timing of software enhancements; changes in the level of operating expenses; competitive conditions in the industry including competitive pressures resulting in lower average selling prices; and timing of distributors' shipments to their customers. Because we base our staffing and other operating expenses on anticipated revenue, delays in the receipt of orders can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter. As a result of any of the foregoing factors, or a combination, our results of operations in any given quarter may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors, in which case the market price of our common stock would be adversely affected. 21 (Table of Contents) The loss of one or more of our senior personnel could harm our existing business. A number of our officers and senior managers have been employed for ten to fourteen years by us, including our President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technical Officer, Vice President of Marketing, and Senior Vice President for Business Development/General Manager Development Services. Our future success will depend upon the continued service of key officers and senior managers. Competition for officers and senior managers is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing senior personnel. The loss of one or more of our officers or key senior managers could adversely affect our ability to compete. If we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled sales and marketing and product development personnel, our ability to develop new products and product enhancements will be adversely affected. We believe our ability to achieve increased revenues and to develop successful new products and product enhancements will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled sales and marketing and product development personnel. Our products involve a number of new and evolving technologies, and we frequently need to apply these technologies to the unique requirements of mobile connection products. Our personnel must be familiar with both the technologies we support and the unique requirements of the products to which our products connect. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain such key personnel. In addition, our ability to hire and retain such key personnel will depend upon our ability to raise capital or achieve increased revenue levels to fund the costs associated with such key personnel. Failure to attract and retain such key personnel will adversely affect our ability to develop new products and product enhancements. We may not be able to collect revenues from customers who experience financial difficulties. Our accounts receivable are derived primarily from distributors and original equipment manufacturers. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial conditions but generally require no collateral from our customers. Reserves are maintained for potential credit losses, and such losses have historically been within such reserves. However, many of our customers may be thinly capitalized and may be prone to failure in adverse market conditions. Although our collection history has been good, from time to time a customer may not pay us because of financial difficulty, bankruptcy or liquidation. We may be unable to manufacture our products, because we are dependent on a limited number of qualified suppliers for our components. Several of our component parts, including our serial interface chip, our Ethernet chip, and our bar code scanning modules, and our new line of handheld computers, are produced by one or a limited number of suppliers. Shortages could occur in these essential components due to an interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. If we are unable to procure certain component parts, we could be required to reduce our operations while we seek alternative sources for these components, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. To the extent that we acquire extra inventory stocks to protect against possible shortages, we would be exposed to additional risks associated with holding inventory, such as obsolescence, excess quantities, or loss. 22 (Table of Contents) Our operating results could be harmed by economic, political, regulatory and other risks associated with export sales. Export sales (sales to customers outside the United States) accounted for approximately 32 percent, 35 percent, and 37 percent, of our revenues in fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Accordingly, our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in export sales, including: longer payment cycles; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, import and export restrictions and tariffs; difficulties in managing foreign operations; the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws; greater difficulty or delay in accounts receivable collection; potentially adverse tax consequences; and political and economic instability. Our export sales are primarily denominated in United States dollars and in Euros for our sales to European distributors. Accordingly, an increase in the value of the United States dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore potentially less competitive in foreign markets. Declines in the value of the Euro relative to the United States dollar may result in foreign currency losses relating to collection of Euro denominated receivables if left unhedged. Our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, and other events beyond our control. Our corporate headquarters are located near an earthquake fault. The potential impact of a major earthquake on our facilities, infrastructure, and overall business is unknown. Additionally, we may experience electrical power blackouts or natural disasters that could interrupt our business. Should a disaster be widespread, such as a major earthquake, or result in the loss of key personnel, we may not be able to implement our disaster recovery plan in a timely manner. Any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business. Failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price. We have evaluated and will continue to evaluate our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires an annual management assessment of the design and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly. 23 (Table of Contents) The sale of a substantial number of shares of common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price for our common stock. The market price of our common stock could also decline if one or more of our significant stockholders decided for any reason to sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market. As of February 28, 2007, we had 31,883,886 shares of common stock outstanding. Substantially all of these shares are freely tradable in the public market, either without restriction or subject, in some cases, only to S-3 prospectus delivery requirements and, in other cases, only to manner of sale, volume, and notice requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. As of February 28, 2007, we had 9,440,364 shares subject to outstanding options under our stock option plans, and 1,484,994 shares were available for future issuance under the plans. We have registered the shares of common stock subject to outstanding options and reserved for issuance under our stock option plans. Accordingly, shares underlying vested options will be eligible for resale in the public market as soon as the options are exercised. As of February 28, 2007, we had warrants outstanding to purchase a total of 989,712 shares of our common stock at exercise prices ranging from $0.722 to $2.73. All such warrants may be exercised at any time, and the shares issuable upon exercise may be resold, either without restrictions or subject, in some cases, only to S-3 prospectus delivery requirements, and, in some cases, only to manner of sale, volume, and notice requirements of Rule 144. Volatility in the trading price of our common stock could negatively impact the price of our common stock. During the period from January 1, 2005 through February 28, 2007, our common stock price fluctuated between a high of $2.04 and a low of $0.72. The trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and the outlook of securities analysts and investors on our industry. In addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for high technology stocks in particular, have experienced high volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
