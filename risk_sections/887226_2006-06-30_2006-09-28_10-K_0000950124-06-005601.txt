ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS An investment in our Common Stock involves numerous risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the following information about these risks. Any of the risks described below could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our future results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that adversely affect our business in the future. We believe that the most significant of the risks and uncertainties we face are as follows: OUR REVENUES ARE PRINCIPALLY DERIVED FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS FOR USE IN THE GLOBAL AUTOMOTIVE MARKET, PARTICULARLY BY MANUFACTURERS BASED IN THE UNITED STATES AND WESTERN EUROPE. THESE MANUFACTURERS HAVE EXPERIENCED PERIODIC DOWNTURNS IN THEIR BUSINESSES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THEIR LEVEL OF PURCHASES OF OUR PRODUCTS. Our revenues are principally derived from the sale of products for use in the automotive industry, particularly to manufacturers based in the United States and Western Europe. As a result, our ability to sell our systems and solutions to automotive manufacturers and suppliers is affected by periodic downturns in the global automotive industry. New vehicle tooling programs are the most important selling opportunity for our automotive related sales. The number and timing of new vehicle tooling programs can be influenced by a number of economic factors. Our customers only launch a limited number of new car programs in any given year because of the time and financial resources required. From a macro perspective we continue to assess the global economy and its likely effect on our automotive customers and markets served. We continue to view the automotive industry's focus on introducing new vehicles more frequently to satisfy their customers' changing requirements, as well as their continuing focus on improved quality, as positive indicators for new business. However, because of the current economic downturn being experienced by our principal United States and Western Europe based customers, those customers could determine to reduce their number of new car programs. We are experiencing continued pricing pressures from our customers, particularly our automotive 6 customers, because of the current economic downturns in their operations. These pricing pressures would adversely affect the margins we realize on the sale of our products and, ultimately, our profitability. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT OUR LONG-TERM GROWTH STRATEGY. We realize that we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the global automotive industry. Our future success is dependent upon our ability to implement our long-term strategy to expand our customer base in our automotive markets and to expand into new markets. Currently, we are focusing on the successful introduction of our two newly released Automated Systems products, AutoFit(R) and AutoScan(R), which are designed to expand our product offerings in our worldwide automotive markets, and the continued development of enhanced versions of our ScanWorks(R) product line for sale within and outside the automotive markets. We have also initiated plans to achieve sales growth in largely untapped geographic sales areas, including emerging automotive markets in Asia and Eastern Europe and the expansion of our business with current customers in Japan. We also continue to explore opportunities for expansion into non-automotive markets. However, there are a number of uncertainties involved in our long-term strategy over which we have no or limited control, including: - The quality and cost of competitive products already in existence or developed in the future. - The level of interest existing and potential new customers may have in our existing and new products and technologies. - Our ability to resolve technical issues inherent in the development of new products and technologies. - Our ability to identify and satisfy market needs. - Our ability to identify satisfactory distribution networks. - General product development and commercialization difficulties. - Rapid or unexpected technological changes. - General product demand and market acceptance risks. - Our ability to successfully compete with alternative and similar technologies. - Our ability to attract the appropriate personnel to effectively represent, install and service our products. - The effect of economic conditions. Even if we are able to expand our customer base and markets, the new revenues we derive may not offset declines in revenues from our current products, especially our AutoGauge(R) products. We also may not be able to generate profits from these new customers or markets at the same level as we generate from our current business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to expand our customer base and markets or successfully execute our strategies in a fashion to maintain or increase our revenues and profits. WE HAVE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW LINE OF PRODUCTS FOR SALE IN A NEW MARKET. WE COULD EXPERIENCE UNANTICIPATED DIFFICULTIES IN BRINGING THIS PRODUCT TO MARKET THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OPERATION AND DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF OUR MANAGEMENT. We recently announced the execution of a long term supply agreement for the sale of a new line of electronic inspection products to retail consumers. In addition to the uncertainties inherent in introducing new products discussed above, we also face uncertainties resulting from the fact that this would be the first time we have produced products for the consumer market, manufactured products in China through subcontractors, and distributed products through a retail distribution network. As a result, we could experience unforeseen difficulties in bringing these products to market, including: - Product quality problems and costs to correct those problems resulting form design or manufacturing defects. - Warranty claims at greater levels than anticipated. - Product orders at significantly greater volumes than our subcontractors' current manufacturing capabilities. - The speed at which competitors' products will be brought to market. - The need and cost to revise our product offerings to respond to competitors' product introductions or unanticipated consumer preferences or negative reactions to our products. Handling such unforeseen difficulties could require significant management time and divert their attention from our core business operations. In that event, these unforeseen difficulties and management diversions could adversely affect our operating results. OUR REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM A SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS CONCENTRATED IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY, SO THAT THE LOSS OF ANY ONE OF THESE CUSTOMERS COULD RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN OUR REVENUES AND PROFITS. We sell a majority of our systems and solutions to a small number of customers that consist primarily of automotive manufacturers and suppliers in North American and Western Europe. 7 With such a large percentage of our revenues coming from such a small and highly concentrated group of customers, we are susceptible to a substantial risk of losing revenues if these customers stop purchasing our products or reduce their purchases of our products. In addition, we have no control over whether these customers will continue to purchase our systems and solutions in volumes or at prices sufficient to generate profits for us. OUR FUTURE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGICAL POSITION IN OUR MARKETS, WHICH ARE CHARACTERIZED BY CONTINUAL TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. Technology plays a key role in the systems and solutions that we produce. Our ability to sell our products to customers is directly influenced by the technology used in our systems and solutions. With the rapid pace at which technology is changing, there is a possibility that our customers may require more technologically advanced systems and solutions than what we may be capable of producing. Technological developments could render actual and proposed products or technologies of ours uneconomical or obsolete. There also is a possibility that we may not be able to keep pace with our competitors' products. In that case, our competitors may make technological improvements to their products that make them more desirable than our products. Due to the evolving shift in focus from automotive end-of-line gauging to solutions that service process centers factory-wide, we expect that sales of our AutoGauge(R) systems, designed for end-of-line gauging, will slow. Our near-term focus for growth has been on the successful introduction of our two newly released automated systems products, AutoFit(R) and AutoScan(R), which are designed to expand our product offerings in our worldwide automotive markets, and the continued development of enhanced versions of our ScanWorks(R) product line. Our growth and future financial performance depend upon our ability to introduce new products and enhance existing products that include the latest technological advances and customer requirements. We may not be able to introduce new products successfully or achieve market acceptance for such products. Any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences, or any significant delays in product development or introduction, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Accordingly, we believe that our future commercial success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce new cost-effective products and maintain a competitive technological position. WE ARE DEPENDENT ON PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY. IF OUR COMPETITORS DEVELOP COMPETING PRODUCTS THAT DO NOT VIOLATE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGE THOSE RIGHTS, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. Our products contain features that are protected by patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and contractual rights. Despite these protections, there is still a chance that competitors may use these protected features in their products as a result of our inability to keep our trade secrets confidential, or in violation of our intellectual property rights or following a successful challenge to those rights. The prosecution of infringement claims against third parties and the defense of legal actions challenging our intellectual property rights could be costly and require significant attention from management. Because of the small size of our management team, this could result in the diversion of management's attention from day-to-day operations. There also is a chance that competitors may develop technology that performs the same functions as our products without infringing upon our exclusive rights. It is possible that competitors may "reverse engineer" those features of our products that are not protected by patents, trademarks and trade secrets. If a competitor is able to "reverse engineer" an unprotected feature successfully, the competitor may gain an understanding of how the feature works and introduce similar products to compete with our products. Because our new retail consumer products will be manufactured in China, we are at a greater risk of competitors misappropriating our intellectual property included in those products or reverse engineering those products. As a result, we may have a more limited ability, and significantly greater costs, to enforce our intellectual property rights in those products. Constant technological improvement of those products will be particularly important to keep the products competitive in their markets. WE COULD BECOME INVOLVED IN COSTLY LITIGATION ALLEGING PATENT INFRINGEMENT. We have been informed that certain of our customers have received allegations of possible patent infringement involving processes and methods used in our products. Certain of these customers, including one customer who was a party to a patent infringement suit relating to this matter, have settled such claims. We believe that the processes used in our products were independently developed without utilizing any previous patented process or technology. Because of the 8 uncertainty surrounding the nature of any possible infringement and the validity of any such claim or any possible customer claim for indemnity relaying to claims against our customers, it is not possible to estimate the ultimate effect, if any, of this matter on our financial position. The defense of patent infringement litigation could be costly and require significant attention from management. Because of the small size of our management team, this could result in the diversion of management's attention from day-to-day operations. A NUMBER OF NEW COMPETITORS HAVE RECENTLY ENTERED OUR MARKETS, OR ARE DEVELOPING PRODUCTS TO COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN OUR REVENUES THROUGH LOST SALES OR A REDUCTION IN PRICES. We are aware of a number of companies that have recently entered a number of our markets selling products using similar or alternative technologies and methods. We believe that there may be other companies, some of whom may be substantially larger and have substantially greater resources than us, which may be engaged in the development of technology and products for some of our markets that could prove to be competitive with ours. We believe that the principal competitive factor in our markets is the total capability that a product offers as a process control system. In some markets, price and value added are the principal competitive factors. While we believe that our products compete favorably, it is possible that these new competitors could capture some of our sales opportunities or force us to reduce prices in order to complete the sale. We believe that certain existing and potential customers may be capable of internally developing their own technology. This could cause a decline in sales of our products to those customers. OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL. Our success depends in large part upon the continued service of our executives and key employees, including those in engineering, technical, sales and marketing positions, as well as our ability to attract additional such employees in the future. At times and in certain geographic markets, competition for the type of highly skilled employees we require can be intense. The loss of key personnel or the inability to attract new qualified key employees could adversely affect our ability to implement our long-term growth strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPLETE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND ACQUISITIONS AND OUR PROFITS COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY OPERATE THOSE THAT WE DO COMPLETE. We will evaluate from time to time business opportunities that fit our strategic plans. There can be no assurance that we will identify any opportunities that fit our strategic plans or will be able to enter into agreements with identified business opportunities on terms acceptable to us. There is also no assurance that we will be able to effectively integrate businesses that we may acquire due to the significant challenges in consolidating functions and integrating procedures, personnel, product lines, technologies and operations in a timely and efficient manner. The integration process may require significant attention from management and devotion of resources. Because of the small size of our management team, this could result in the diversion of management's attention from day to day operations and impair our relationships with current employees and customers. We intend to finance any such business opportunities from available cash on hand, existing credit facilities, issuance of additional stock or additional sources of financing, as circumstances warrant. The issuance of additional equity securities could be substantially dilutive to our stockholders. In addition, our profitability may suffer because of acquisition-related costs, debt service requirements or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets. If we are not successful in generating additional profits from these transactions, this dilution and these additional costs could cause our common stock price to drop. WE ARE EXPANDING OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS, INCREASING THE POSSIBILITY THAT OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. We have significant operations outside of the United States and are currently implementing a strategy to expand our operations outside of the United States, especially in Eastern Europe and Asia. Our foreign operations are subject to risks customarily encountered in such foreign operations. For instance, we may encounter fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, differences in the level of protection available for our intellectual property, the impact of differences in language and local business and social customs on our ability to market and sell our products in these markets and transportation delays from our Chinese subcontractors. In addition, we may be affected by U.S. laws and policies that impact foreign trade and investment. Finally, we may be adversely affected by laws and policies imposed by foreign governments in the countries where we have business operations or sell our products. These laws and policies vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. 9 BECAUSE OF OUR SIGNIFICANT FOREIGN OPERATIONS, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITS CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY AS A RESULT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES. Products that we sell in foreign markets are sometimes priced in currency of the country where the customer is located. To the extent that the dollar fluctuates against these foreign currencies, the prices of our products in U.S. dollars also will fluctuate. As a result, our return on the sale of our products may vary based on these fluctuations. We may use, from time to time, a limited hedging program to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. These transactions involve the use of forward contracts, typically mature within one year and are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions. We may use forward exchange contracts to hedge the net assets of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to offset the translation and economic exposures related to our investment in these subsidiaries. There is no guarantee that these hedging transactions will protect against the fluctuations in the value of the dollar. BECAUSE A LARGE PORTION OF OUR REVENUES ARE GENERATED FROM A LIMITED NUMBER OF SIZEABLE ORDERS, OUR REVENUES AND PROFITS MAY VARY WIDELY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER AND YEAR TO YEAR. A large portion of our revenues are generated from a limited number of sizeable orders that are placed by a small number of customers. If the timing of these orders is delayed from one quarter to the next, or from one year to the next, we may experience fluctuations in our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results. The amount of revenues that we earn in any given quarter may vary based in part on the timing of new vehicle programs in the global automotive industry. In contrast, many of our operating expenses are fixed and will not vary from quarter to quarter. As a result, our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR STOCK HAS BEEN VOLATILE. The following factors may affect the market price of our Common Stock, which can vary widely over time: - announcements of new commercial products by us; - announcements of new commercial products by our competitors; - variations in our operating results; - market conditions in the electronic and sensing industry; - market conditions and stock prices in general; and - the volume of our common stock traded. BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED TRADING IN OUR COMMON STOCK, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO DISPOSE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME OR AT THEN CURRENT PRICES. Because of the limited number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding and the limited number of holders of our Common Stock, only a limited number of shares of our Common Stock trade on a daily basis. This limited trading in our Common Stock makes it difficult to dispose of a large number of shares in a short period of time. In addition, it is likely that the sale by a shareholder of a large number of shares of our Common Stock over an extended period would depress the price of our Common Stock. WE DO NOT PLAN ON PAYING DIVIDENDS AND ARE RESTRICTED UNDER OUR LOAN AGREEMENT FROM PAYING DIVIDENDS. Our Board of Directors does not intend to declare or pay cash dividends on our Common Stock. Instead, the Board intends to retain future earnings to finance the development of our business. Furthermore, cash dividends are not permitted under our bank credit agreement. AS PERMITTED UNDER MICHIGAN LAW, OUR DIRECTORS ARE NOT LIABLE TO PERCEPTRON FOR MONETARY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THEIR ACTIONS OR INACTIONS. Under our articles of incorporation, as permitted under the Michigan Business Corporation Act, members of our Board of Directors are not liable for monetary damages for any negligent or grossly negligent action that the director takes, or for any negligent or grossly negligent failure of a director to take any action. However, a director will remain liable for: - intentionally inflicting harm on Perceptron or its shareholders; - distributions that the director makes in violation of the Michigan Business Corporation Act; and - intentional criminal acts that the director commits. However, we or our shareholders may seek an injunction, or other appropriate equitable relief, against a director. Finally, liability may be imposed against members of the Board of Directors under the federal securities laws. 10 WE ARE REQUIRED TO INDEMNIFY OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS IF THEY ARE INVOLVED IN LITIGATION AS A RESULT OF THEIR SERVING AS OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS OF PERCEPTRON, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITS AND CASH AVAILABLE TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. Our by-laws require us to indemnify our officers and directors. We may be required to pay judgments, fines, and expenses incurred by an officer or director, including reasonable attorneys' fees, as a result of actions or proceedings in which such officers or directors are involved by reason of being or having been an officer or director of Perceptron. Funds paid in satisfaction of judgments, fines and expenses would reduce our profits and may be funds we need for the operation of our business and the development of products. This could cause our stock price to drop. OUR PROFITS WILL BE REDUCED AS A RESULT OF OUR COMPLIANCE WITH NEW SEC RULES RELATING TO OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. Beginning with our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008, we will be required by SEC rules to include a report of management on Perceptron's internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports. In addition, the independent registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements will be required to provide an attestation report on management's assessment of our internal controls. We will expend significant resources in developing the necessary documentation and testing procedures required by these new rules, which could adversely affect our profitability. IF MANAGEMENT IS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE A POSITIVE REPORT ON OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM IS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE A POSITIVE ATTESTATION ON MANAGEMENT'S REPORT, SHAREHOLDERS AND OTHERS MAY LOSE CONFIDENCE IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DROP. Because of our relatively small size, we have a limited number of personnel in our finance department to handle their existing responsibilities, as well as compliance with the SEC's new rules relating to our internal controls over financial reporting. Accordingly, there can be no positive assurance that management will provide a positive report on our internal controls or that we will receive a positive attestation on that report from our independent registered public accounting firm. In the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls that we cannot remediate in a timely manner or we are unable to receive a positive attestation from our independent auditors with respect to our internal controls, investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. This could cause our stock price to drop. IF THE SUBCONTRACTORS WE RELY ON FOR COMPONENT PARTS DELAYED DELIVERIES OR FAILED TO DELIVER PARTS MEETING OUR REQUIREMENTS, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN A TIMELY FASHION AND OUR REVENUES AND PROFITS WOULD BE REDUCED. We rely on subcontractors for certain components of our products, including outside subcontracting assembly houses to produce the circuit boards that we use in our products. As a result, we have limited control over the quality and the delivery schedules of components purchased from third parties. In addition, we purchase a number of component parts from single source suppliers. If our supplies of component parts meeting our requirements are significantly delayed or interrupted, we would not be able to deliver products to our customers in a timely fashion. This would result in a reduction in revenues and profits for these periods. It is also possible, if our delay in delivering products to our customer is too long, the customer will cancel its order, resulting in a permanent loss of revenue and profit from that sale. From time to time, we have experienced significant delays in the receipt of certain components, most recently for our ScanWorks(R) systems. Finally, although we believe that alternative suppliers are available, difficulties or delays may arise if we shift manufacturing capacity to new suppliers. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS THE RIGHT TO ISSUE UP TO 1,000,000 SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK WITHOUT FURTHER ACTION BY SHAREHOLDERS. THE ISSUANCE OF THOSE SHARES COULD CAUSE THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DROP SIGNIFICANTLY AND COULD BE USED TO PREVENT OR FRUSTRATE SHAREHOLDERS' ATTEMPTS TO REPLACE OR REMOVE CURRENT MANAGEMENT. Although no preferred stock currently is outstanding, we are authorized to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by the Board of Directors, without further action by shareholders, and may include voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), the dividends payable thereon, liquidation payments, preferences as to 11 dividends and liquidation, conversion rights and redemption rights. In the event that preferred stock is issued, the rights of the common stockholders may be adversely affected. This could result in a reduction in the value of our Common Stock. The preferred stock could be issued to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of Perceptron. This may be beneficial to our management or Board of Directors in a hostile tender offer or other takeover attempt and may have an adverse impact on shareholders who may want to participate in the tender offer or who favor the takeover attempt. OUR COMMON STOCK RIGHTS PLAN COULD BE USED TO PREVENT OR FRUSTRATE HOSTILE TENDER OFFERS. We maintain a common stock rights plan. Under the plan, if any person acquires 15% or more our outstanding Common Stock, our shareholders, other than the acquirer, will have the right to purchase shares of our Common Stock at half their market price. The common stock rights plan discourages potential acquirers from initiating tender offers for our Common Stock without the approval of the Board of Directors. This may be beneficial to Perceptron's management or Board of Directors in a hostile tender offer or other takeover attempt and may have an adverse impact on shareholders who may want to participate in the tender offer or who favor the takeover attempt. ITEM 1B: UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable.
