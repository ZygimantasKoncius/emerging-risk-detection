Item 1A. Risk Factors. In analyzing whether to make or to continue an investment in our securities, investors should consider, among other factors, the following risk factors. There are increased risks involved with commercial real estate and construction lending activities. Our lending activities include loans secured by commercial real estate and multi-family residential mortgage loans. In addition, we originate loans for the construction of residential and commercial use properties, although at December 31, 2009 there were no construction loans in our loan portfolio. Commercial real estate, multi-family residential and construction lending generally is considered to involve a higher degree of risk than single-family residential lending due to a variety of factors, including generally larger loan balances, the dependency on successful completion or operation of the project for repayment, the difficulties in estimating construction costs and loan terms which often do not require full amortization of the loan over its term and, instead, provide for a balloon payment at stated maturity. As a result of the larger loan balances typically involved in these loans, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. As of December 31, 2009, our 10 largest commercial real estate, multi-family residential and land loans had an aggregate outstanding balance of $17.8 million, or 30.5% of total commercial real estate, multi-family residential and land loans and 11.1% of our total loan portfolio at such date. In addition, our portfolio of these loans is significantly weighted with loans which have been originated relatively recently and are not well seasoned, and thus, are generally perceived to be more susceptible to adverse economic conditions than older loans. Construction loans generally have a higher risk of loss than single-family residential mortgage loans due primarily to the critical nature of the initial estimates of a propertys value upon completion of construction compared to the estimated costs, including interest, of construction as well as other assumptions. If the estimates upon which construction loans are made prove to be inaccurate, we may be confronted with projects that, upon completion, have values which are below the loan amounts. During 2009, we had a $1.0 million participation interest in a $170.0 million construction loan for a mixed-use development located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana that was deemed to be an in substance foreclosure and transferred to other real estate owned. At the time of transfer the Bank recorded a $396,000 charge-off against its recorded investment in the asset. See Item 1, BusinessAsset QualityDelinquent Loans, for additional information. The loss of our President and Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer could hurt our operations. We rely heavily on our President and Chief Executive Officer, Lawrence J. LeBon, III, and our Chief Financial Officer, John LeBlanc. The loss of either of these executive officers could have an adverse effect on us. Mr. LeBon is central to virtually all aspects of our business operations and management. Mr. LeBlanc is critical to our financial reporting function, and he also works closely with Mr. LeBon on virtually all other aspects of our operations. In addition, as a small community bank, we have fewer management-level personnel who are in position to succeed and assume the responsibilities of either Messrs. LeBon or LeBlanc. However, we have entered into three-year employment agreements with Messrs. LeBon and LeBlanc. We do not maintain key man life insurance on either Mr. LeBon or Mr. LeBlanc. Our business is geographically concentrated in southern Louisiana, which makes us vulnerable to downturns in the local economy. Most of our loans are to individuals and businesses located generally in southern Louisiana and, more particularly, metropolitan New Orleans. Regional economic conditions affect the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans. The concentration of our business operations in 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements southern Louisiana makes us vulnerable to downturns in the local economy. Declines in local real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for the loans we make. The regional economic outlook remains uncertain after Hurricane Katrina and no assurance can be given that, given the geographic concentration of our business, we will not suffer from future adverse developments in the region. The region is susceptible to hurricanes and tropical storms. Any new hurricanes or storms could severely test the infrastructure of the markets we operate in, negatively affect the local economy or disrupt our operations, which would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operations. The operations of financial institutions such as us are dependent to a large extent on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and investment securities and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income by affecting the difference between the weighted average yield earned on our interest-earning assets and the weighted average rate paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, or interest rate spread, and the average life of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Our net interest spread was 2.62% for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2.50% for the year ended December 31, 2008. During 2009, the rate at which our weighted average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities declined outpaced the decrease in the weighted average yield of our interest-earning assets resulting in an increase in the net interest spread. We may not be able to further decrease the weighted average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities in a rising rate environment. Changes in interest rates also can affect our ability to originate loans; the value of our interest-earning assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets; our ability to obtain and retain deposits in competition with other available investment alternatives; and the ability of our borrowers to repay adjustable or variable rate loans. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Our results of operations are significantly dependent on economic conditions and related uncertainties. The operations of savings associations are affected, directly and indirectly, by domestic and international economic and political conditions and by governmental monetary and fiscal policies. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, volatile interest rates, real estate values, government monetary policy, international conflicts, the actions of terrorists and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our results of operations. Changes in interest rates, in particular, could adversely affect our net interest income and have a number of other adverse effects on our operations. Adverse economic conditions also could result in an increase in loan delinquencies, foreclosures and nonperforming assets and a decrease in the value of the property or other collateral which secures our loans, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations. We are particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions and related uncertainties in the metropolitan New Orleans area because we derive the vast majority of our loans, deposits and other business from this area. Accordingly, we remain subject to the risks associated with prolonged declines in our local economy. Our allowance for losses on loans may not be adequate to cover probable losses. We have established an allowance for loan losses which we believe is adequate to offset probable losses on our existing loans. There can be no assurance that any future declines in real estate market conditions, general economic conditions or changes in regulatory policies will not require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, which would adversely affect our results of operations. We are subject to extensive regulation which could adversely affect our business and operations. We are subject to extensive federal governmental supervision and regulation, which are intended primarily for the protection of depositors. In addition, we are subject to changes in federal and state laws, as well as changes in regulations, governmental policies and accounting principles. The effects of any such potential changes cannot be predicted but could adversely affect the business and our operations in the future. 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We face strong competition which may adversely affect our profitability. We are subject to vigorous competition in all aspects and areas of our business from banks and other financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, savings banks, finance companies, credit unions and other providers of financial services, such as money market mutual funds, brokerage firms, consumer finance companies and insurance companies. We also compete with non-financial institutions, including retail stores that maintain their own credit programs and governmental agencies that make available low cost or guaranteed loans to certain borrowers. Certain of our competitors are larger financial institutions with substantially greater resources, lending limits, larger branch systems and a wider array of commercial banking services. Competition from both bank and non-bank organizations will continue. Any future Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance premiums or special assessments will adversely impact our earnings. On May 22, 2009, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation adopted a final rule levying a five basis point special assessment on each insured depository institutions assets minus Tier 1 capital as of June 30, 2009. We recorded an expense of $126,000 during the year ended December 31, 2009, to reflect the special assessment. Any further special assessments that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation levies will be recorded as an expense during the appropriate period. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation increased the general assessment rate and, therefore, our Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation general insurance premium expense will increase compared to prior periods. On November 12, 2009, the FDIC adopted regulations that require insured depository institutions to prepay on December 31, 2009 their estimated assessments for the fourth calendar quarter of 2009, and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012. The new regulations base the assessment rate for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for 2010 on each institutions total base assessment rate for the third quarter of 2009, modified to assume that the assessment rate in effect on September 30, 2009 had been in effect for the entire third quarter, and the assessment rate for 2011 and 2012 on the modified third quarter assessment base, adjusted quarterly for an estimated 5% annual growth rate in the assessment base through the end of 2012. Under the prepaid assessment rule, we made a payment of $646,000 to the FDIC on December 30, 2009, of which $37,000 was expensed as our fourth quarter 2009 deposit insurance premium, and the remaining $609,000 was recorded as a prepaid expense, which will be amortized over the next three years.
