ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS This Form 10-K contains or incorporates by reference statements concerning future results and other matters that may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. ServiceMaster intends that these forward-looking statements, which look forward in time and include everything other than historical information, be subject to the safe harbors created by that legislation. ServiceMaster notes that these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could affect its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in a forward-looking statement include the following, among others: Weather conditions and seasonality affect the demand for ServiceMasters services. The demand for ServiceMasters services is affected by weather conditions. The business of ServiceMaster is 6 also affected by the seasonal nature of its lawn care and landscape maintenance services; termite and pest control services; home warranty and home inspection services; and disaster restoration services. For example, droughts and late spring or fall snow storms can affect the demand for lawn care and landscape maintenance services; extreme weather conditions could result in increased service calls in the home warranty business; and cooler temperatures could impede the development of the termite swarm and lead to lower termite swarm activity. Competition could reduce ServiceMasters market share and hurt its financial performance. ServiceMaster operates in highly competitive markets. Changes in the source and intensity of competition in the markets served by ServiceMaster impact the demand for its services and may result in additional pricing pressures. For example, the entry of national home-improvement retailers into ServiceMasters service lines may impact its financial performance. The principal methods of competition in ServiceMasters businesses include quality and speed of service, name recognition, pricing, customer satisfaction and reputation. No assurance can be given that ServiceMaster will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and that the competitive pressures that ServiceMaster faces will not result in reduced market share and negatively impact its financial performance. ServiceMasters future success depends on its ability to attract and retain trained workers. ServiceMasters future success and financial performance depends substantially on its ability to attract, retain, and train workers. ServiceMasters ability to expand its operations is in part impacted by its ability to increase its labor force. In the event of a labor shortage, ServiceMaster could experience difficulty in delivering its services in a high-quality or timely manner and could be forced to increase wages in order to attract and retain employees, which would result in higher operating costs. Increases in operating costs affect ServiceMasters financial performance. ServiceMasters financial performance is affected by factor costs, such as labor, health care, vehicle, fuel, self-insurance, and insurance premiums. In particular, ServiceMasters financial performance is affected by increases in operating costs, such as the increased fuel costs experienced in 2006. Changes in the types or mix of service offerings affect ServiceMasters financial performance. ServiceMasters financial performance is affected by changes in the types or mix of service offerings. For example, offering both liquid and bait termite services requires additional equipment and training and results in different pricing and post-sale monitoring activities. Changes in laws and regulations applicable to ServiceMasters businesses affect ServiceMasters financial performance. ServiceMasters businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations. These federal and state laws include laws relating to consumer protection, wage and hour restrictions, permit and licensing requirements, workers safety, environmental regulations, employee benefits and telemarketing. It is difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting ServiceMasters businesses. The laws and regulations applicable to ServiceMasters businesses will likely change in the future and affect ServiceMasters operations and financial performance. In addition, if ServiceMaster were to fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, ServiceMaster could be subject to fines or penalties that may affect how a business is operated. Future acquisitions affect ServiceMasters financial performance. ServiceMaster plans to continue to pursue opportunities to expand through acquisitions. Acquisition activity includes tuck-in acquisitions in existing service lines and may include acquisitions in new service lines (e.g., InStar). ServiceMasters ability to continue to make acquisitions at reasonable prices and to integrate the acquired businesses are important factors in ServiceMasters future growth. ServiceMaster cannot assure that it will be able to manage or integrate acquired businesses successfully. Any inability on ServiceMasters part to consolidate and manage growth from acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on ServiceMasters financial performance. Changes in general economic conditions and consumer confidence affect the demand for ServiceMasters services. Changes in general economic conditions and consumer confidence affect the demand for ServiceMasters services. Unfavorable general economic conditions, including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, fuel and oil prices, and unemployment rates could reduce consumer confidence and related spending levels and, in turn, reduce the demand for ServiceMasters services. Consolidation of corporate offices could affect financial performance. ServiceMasters future success and financial performance depends substantially on its ability to attract and retain skilled employees and senior executive leaders within the Company. On October 30, 2006, the Company announced that it will consolidate its corporate headquarters into its operations support center in Memphis, Tennessee. The Companys current headquarters in Downers Grove, Illinois, will be closed with the transition to Memphis scheduled to be completed by November, 2007. ServiceMaster could experience difficulty in immediately filling job vacancies created by employees and executives deciding not to relocate to Memphis, or effectively training and transitioning the new employees, which could affect ServiceMasters success and financial performance until replacements are hired and trained. Compliance with subsidiary environmental plan could affect financial performance. The plea agreement entered into between InStar Services Group, Inc. and the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida will require ongoing monitoring and compliance by InStar for up to 7 five years, violation of which could potentially result in further fines, loss of licenses, loss of certain federal grants and procurement contracts, and possible criminal sanctions. As part of InStars plea agreement with the Untied States Attorneys Office, InStar has agreed to implement a comprehensive environmental compliance plan. The environmental compliance plan requires, among other things, mandatory training for all InStar employees on the proper identification, handling and management of hazardous substances, internal monitoring and audits of the compliance plan, and third-party auditing and reporting of compliance with the plan. If the compliance plan is not fulfilled and the plea agreement is violated, potential risks to the Company include additional and substantial fines, expanded investigation and prosecution by the United States Attorneys Office, loss of certain key contractor licenses currently held by InStar, loss of federal grants and procurement contracts for InStar, negative media exposure and damage to the Companys reputation that could result in loss of business for InStar and other business units within the Company, and possible criminal sanctions. ServiceMaster is subject to a number of risks that might cause ServiceMasters actual results to differ materially from its expressed or implied forecasts, targets or projections, including:  Litigation against ServiceMaster, particularly any class action litigation;  Changes in senior management;  Legislation or other governmental action that detrimentally impacts ServiceMaster;  Unexpected outcome of any Internal Revenue Service audit;  New accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting policies; and  Impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets.
