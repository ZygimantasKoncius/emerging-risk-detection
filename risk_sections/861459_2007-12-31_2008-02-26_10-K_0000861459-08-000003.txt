Item 1A. RISK FACTORS Set forth below and elsewhere in this Report and in other documents we file with the SEC are various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in the Report or otherwise adversely affect our business. · Our success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel in a competitive environment. The single largest factor in our ability to profitably execute our work is our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel particularly as we grow. Our success in attracting qualified people is dependent on the resources available in individual geographic areas and the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions as well as our ability to provide a competitive compensation package and work environment. · Reductions in government funding could have a negative impact on our business. A substantial majority of our revenues are derived from contracts that are funded by federal, state and local government agencies. Our ability to obtain future public sector work at reasonable margins is highly dependent on the amount of work that is available to bid, which is largely a function of the level of government funding available. 8 Table of Contents · Our commercial and residential site development work may be affected by economic downturns. The availability of private sector work can be adversely affected by economic downturns in the residential housing market, demand for commercial property or the availability of credit. To the extent these events occur, our operating results will be adversely affected. · Our fixed price and fixed unit price contracts subject us to the risk of increased project cost. As more fully described under “Contract Provisions and Subcontracting” above, the profitability of our fixed price and fixed unit price contracts can be adversely affected by a number of factors that can cause our actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time of our original bid. · Accounting for our revenues and costs involves significant estimates. As further described in “Critical Accounting Estimates” under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation,” accounting for our contract related revenues and costs, as well as other cost items, requires management to make a variety of significant estimates and assumptions. Although we believe we have sufficient experience and processes to enable us to formulate appropriate assumptions and produce reasonably dependable estimates, these assumptions and estimates may change significantly in the future, and these changes could result in the reversal of previously recognized revenue and profit and have a material adverse effect on our financial position and the results of our operations. · Many of our contracts have penalties for late completion. In some instances, including many of our fixed price contracts, we guarantee that we will complete a project by a scheduled date. If we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled we may be held responsible for cost impacts resulting from any delay, generally in the form of contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages. To the extent that these events occur, the total costs of the project could exceed our original estimates and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project. · Weather can significantly impact our quarterly revenues and profitability. Our ability to perform work is significantly impacted by weather conditions such as precipitation and temperature. Changes in weather conditions can create significant variability in our quarterly revenues and profitability, particularly in the first and fourth quarters of the year. Additionally, delays and other weather impacts may increase a project’s cost and decrease its profitability. · Our Granite Land Company is greatly affected by the performance of the real estate industry. Our real estate development activities are subject to numerous factors beyond our control, including local real estate market conditions, substantial existing and potential competition, general national, regional and local economic conditions, fluctuations in interest rates and mortgage availability and changes in demographic conditions. If our outlook for a project’s forecasted profitability deteriorates, we may find it necessary to curtail our development activities and evaluate our real estate assets for possible impairment. If our real estate assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment would result in a charge to income from operations in the year of the impairment with a resulting decrease in our recorded net worth. · We work in a highly competitive marketplace. As more fully described under “Competition” above, we have multiple competitors in all of the areas in which we work. During economic down cycles or times of lower government funding for public works projects, competition for the fewer available projects intensifies and this increased competition may result in a decrease in our ability to be competitive at acceptable margins. · An inability to secure and permit aggregate reserves could negatively impact our future operations and results. Tighter regulations for the protection of the environment and the finite nature of property containing suitable aggregate reserves are making it increasingly challenging and costly to secure and permit aggregate reserves. Although we have thus far been able to secure and permit reserves to support our business, it is likely to become increasingly difficult to do so and there is no assurance that we will be able to secure and permit reserves in the future. · We are subject to environmental and other regulation. As more fully described under “Government and Environmental Regulations” above, we are subject to a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, workplace safety and a variety of socioeconomic requirements, the noncompliance of which can result in substantial penalties, termination or suspension of government contracts as well as civil and criminal liability. While compliance with these laws and regulations has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past, there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change and that compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future. 9 Table of Contents · Strikes or work stoppages could have a negative impact on our operations and results. We are party to collective bargaining agreements covering a portion of our craft workforce. Although our results and operations have not been significantly impacted by strikes or work stoppages in the past, such labor actions could have a significant impact on our operations if they occur in the future. · Unavailability of insurance coverage could have a negative impact on our operations and results. We maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall risk management strategy and pursuant to requirements to maintain specific coverage that are contained in our financing agreements and in most of our construction contracts. Although we have been able to obtain insurance coverage to meet our requirements in the past, there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future. · An inability to obtain bonding would have a negative impact on our operations and results. As more fully described in “Insurance and Bonding” above, we generally are required to provide surety bonds securing our performance under the majority of our public and private sector contracts. Our inability to obtain surety bonds in the future would significantly impact our ability to obtain new contracts, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. · Our joint venture contracts with project owners subject us to joint and several liability. If a joint venture partner fails to perform we could be liable for completion of the entire contract and, if the contract were unprofitable, this could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. · We use certain commodity products that are subject to significant price fluctuations. Diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based products are used to fuel and lubricate our equipment and fire our asphalt concrete processing plants and also constitute a significant part of the asphalt paving materials that are used in many of our construction projects and sold to outside parties. Although we are partially protected by asphalt or fuel price escalation clauses in some of our contracts, many contracts provide no such protection. We also use cement, steel and other commodities in our construction projects that can be subject to significant price fluctuations. We have not been significantly adversely affected by price fluctuations in the past; however, there is no guarantee that we will not be in the future. · As a part of our growth strategy we expect to make future acquisitions and acquisitions involve many risks. These risks include difficulties integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies, diversion of management’s attention from our ongoing operations, potential difficulties and increased costs associated with completion of any assumed construction projects, insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions and the potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired companies. Acquisitions may also cause us to increase our liabilities, record goodwill or other non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to subsequent impairment testing and potential impairment charges and incur amortization expenses related to certain other intangible assets. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could harm our business and operating results significantly. · Failure of our subcontractors to perform as anticipated could have a negative impact on our results. As further described under “Contract Provisions and Subcontracting” above, we subcontract a portion of many of our contracts to specialty subcontractors and we are ultimately responsible for the successful completion of their work. Although we seek to require bonding or other forms of guarantees, we are not always successful in obtaining those bonds or guarantees from our higher risk subcontractors, and there is no guarantee that we will not incur a material loss due to subcontractor performance issues. · We may be unable to identify qualified Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (“DBE”) contractors to perform as subcontractors. Certain of our government agency projects contain minimum DBE participation clauses. If we subsequently fail to complete these projects with the minimum DBE participation we may be held responsible for damages due to breach of contract including restrictions on our ability to bid on future projects and monetary damages. To the extent that these events occur, the total costs of the project could exceed our original estimates and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project. 10 Table of Contents · A significant portion of our revenue is from government funded contracts. Approximately 70% of our consolidated revenue in 2007 was derived from contracts funded by federal, state and local government agencies and authorities. These government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations, contract provisions and a variety of socioeconomic requirements relating to their formation, administration, performance and accounting. Many of these contracts include express or implied certifications of compliance with applicable laws and contract provisions. As a result of our government contracting, claims for civil or criminal fraud may be brought by the government for violations of these regulations, requirements or statutes. We may also be subject to qui tam (“Whistle Blower”) litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government under the Federal Civil False Claims Act, which could include claims for up to treble damages. Further, if we fail to comply with any of these regulations, requirements or statutes, our existing government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended from government contracting or subcontracting, including federally funded projects at the state level. If our government contracts are terminated for any reason, or if we are suspended from government work, we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenue. · Our long-term debt and credit arrangements contain restrictive covenants and failure to meet these covenants could significantly harm our financial condition. Our long-term debt and credit arrangements and related restrictive covenants are more fully described in Note 10 of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in this report. In most cases, failure to meet the restrictive covenants would result in an immediate repayment of all amounts due and cancellation of open lines of credit. Additionally, failure to meet restrictive covenants related to our debt and credit agreements would trigger cross-default provisions that would cause us to also be in default of our surety agreements. Although we have not had difficulty meeting these covenants in the past, failure to do so in the future could have material adverse effects on our business and financial condition. · Our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and could be an uncertain indicator of our future earnings. We cannot guarantee that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. Projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time. In addition, project cancellations or scope adjustments may occur, from time to time, with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog. Backlog reductions can adversely affect the revenue and profit we actually receive from contracts reflected in our backlog. Future project cancellations and scope adjustments could further reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenues and profits that we actually receive. The foregoing list is not exhaustive. There can be no assurance that we have correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting our business or that the publicly available and other information with respect to these matters is complete and correct. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact us. These developments could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For these reasons, the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
