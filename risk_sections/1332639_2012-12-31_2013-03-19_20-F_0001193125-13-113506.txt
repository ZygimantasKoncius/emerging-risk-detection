Memorandum and Articles of Association Our Articles of Incorporation have previously been filed as Exhibit 3.1 to Amendment No. 2 to Form F-1 (File No. 333-126762), filed with the SEC on August 4, 2005 and are hereby incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. Our Bylaws are filed as Exhibit 1.2 to this Annual Report. In connection with our Series A Preferred Share Offering, Series B Preferred Share Offering, Series C Preferred Share Offering and Series D Preferred Share Offering, we filed Statements of Designation with respect to our Series A Preferred Shares, Series B Preferred Shares, Series C Preferred Shares and Series D Preferred Shares with the Registrar of Corporations of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. In connection with our shareholder rights agreement, we filed a Statement of Designation with respect to our Series R Participating Preferred Stock. Under the BCA, the Statements of Designation are deemed amendments to our Articles of Incorporation. The Series A Statement of Designation was previously filed as Exhibit 3.1 to our Report on Form 6-K filed on February 2, 2009 and is hereby incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. The Series B Statement of Designation was previously filed as Exhibit 3.1 to our Report on Form 6-K filed on June 4, 2010 and is hereby incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. The Series C Statement of Designation was previously filed as Exhibit 3.3 to our Report on Form 8-A12B filed on January 28, 2011 and is hereby incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. The Series D Statement of Designation was previously filed as Exhibit 3.3 to our Report on Form 8-A12B filed on December 13, 2012 and is hereby incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. The Series R Statement of Designation is part of Exhibit 4.1 to our Report on Form 8-A12B filed with the SEC on April 19, 2011. The necessary actions required to change the rights of shareholders and the conditions governing the manner in which annual general meetings and special meetings of shareholders are convoked are described in our Bylaws. We have in place a shareholder rights agreement that would have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Seaspan. We entered into the original shareholder rights agreement in August 2005. In April 2011, we amended and restated the shareholder rights agreement. The amended and restated shareholder rights agreement, including the Series R Statement of Designation, has been filed as Exhibit 4.1 to our Report on Form 8-A12B filed with the SEC on April 19, 2011. In connection with acquisition of our Manager in January 2012, we amended the amended and restated shareholder rights agreement. Amendment No. 1 to the amended and restated shareholder rights agreement has been filed as Exhibit 4.6 to our Report on Form 6-K filed with the SEC on January 30, 2012. Amendment No. 2 to the amended and restated shareholder rights agreement has been filed on Form 8-A12B filed with the SEC on December 27, 2012. The amended and restated shareholder rights agreement, as amended, is hereby incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. Pursuant to the shareholder rights agreement, our board of directors declared a dividend for each outstanding Class A common share of one common share purchase right, or a Right, to purchase following a 96 Table of Contents Distribution Date (as defined in the shareholder rights agreement) for $25.00, or the Exercise Price, subject to certain exceptions and adjustments, a fraction (1/1000th) of one share of our Series R Participating Preferred Stock, which fraction has similar economic terms as one Class A common share. If (i) a person or a group of persons beneficially owns 20% or more of our common shares or (ii) Dennis R. Washington (our largest shareholder), Kyle R. Washington (our Co-Chairman), Kevin L. Washington, and certain members of their families and their affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially own 70% or more of our Class A common shares (excluding certain shares issued under our dividend reinvestment plan as described below), then each Right will entitle the holder (other than such 20% or more or 70% or more shareholders) to purchase a number of our Class A common shares with a fair market value equal to twice the product of the Exercise Price multiplied by the number of 1/1000th of Series R Participating Preferred Stock for which such Right could have been exercised. If after such 20% or more or 70% or more ownership threshold has been met, we merge into another company, or we sell more than 50% of our assets or earning power, then each holder of a Right, other than such 20% or 70% or more shareholders, will be entitled to purchase at the Exercise Price, a number of common shares of the surviving entity which has a then current market value of twice the Exercise Price. The Rights will expire on August 8, 2015, unless we extend the expiration date or unless the Rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by us. The Rights dividend was paid on August 12, 2005 to the shareholders of record on that date and attaches to all subsequently issued Class A common shares. For the Washington family and affiliates, Class A common shares acquired following January 1, 2013 pursuant to their participation in our dividend reinvestment plan with respect to any cash dividends paid on the Class A common shares or Series A Preferred Shares through and for the quarter ending March 31, 2015 are excluded from the percentage ownership calculation described above. The Washington family has agreed to fully participate in the dividend reinvestment plan until March 15, 2015. There are no limitations on the rights to own securities, including the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or exercise voting rights on the securities imposed by the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands or by our Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws.

Exchange Controls We are not aware of any governmental laws, decrees or regulations in the Republic of The Marshall Islands that restrict the export or import of capital, including foreign exchange controls, or that affect the remittance of dividends, interest or other payments to non-resident holders of our securities. 100 Table of Contents We are not aware of any limitations on the right of non-resident or foreign owners to hold or vote our securities imposed by the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands or our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. E. Taxation Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to our shareholders. This discussion is based upon the provisions of the Code, legislative history, applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial authority and administrative interpretations, as of the date of this Annual Report, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, or are subject to different interpretations. Changes in these authorities may cause the U.S. federal income tax considerations to vary substantially from those described below. This discussion applies only to beneficial owners of our shares that own the shares as capital assets (generally, for investment purposes) and does not comment on all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be important to certain shareholders in light of their particular circumstances, such as shareholders subject to special tax rules (e.g., financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, insurance companies, traders in securities that have elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, persons liable for alternative minimum tax, broker-dealers, tax-exempt organizations, or former citizens or long-term residents of the United States) or shareholders that hold our shares as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion, constructive sale or other integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, all of whom may be subject to U.S. federal income tax rules that differ significantly from those summarized below. If a partnership or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds our shares, the tax treatment of its partners generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partners in partnerships holding our shares should consult their own tax advisors to determine the appropriate tax treatment of the partnerships ownership of our shares. No ruling has been requested from the IRS regarding any matter affecting us or our shareholders. Accordingly, statements made herein may not be sustained by a court if contested by the IRS. This discussion does not address any U.S. estate, gift or alternative minimum tax considerations or tax considerations arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. jurisdiction. Shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state, local, non-U.S. and other tax consequences of owning and disposing of our shares. U.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S. Holders As used herein, the term U.S. Holder means a beneficial owner of our shares that is: (i) a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien; (ii) a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that was created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust that either is subject to the supervision of a court within the United States and has one or more U.S. persons with authority to control all of its substantial decisions or has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person. Distributions Subject to the discussion of passive foreign investment companies, or PFICs, below, any distributions made by us to a U.S. Holder generally will constitute dividends, which may be taxable as ordinary income or qualified dividend income as described in more detail in the paragraph below, to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits allocated to the U.S. Holders shares, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits allocated to the U.S. 101 Table of Contents Holders shares will be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the U.S. Holders tax basis in our shares and thereafter as capital gain, which will be either long-term or short-term capital gain depending upon whether the U.S. Holder has held the shares for more than one year. U.S. Holders that are corporations generally will not be entitled to claim dividends received deductions with respect to any distributions they receive from us. For purposes of computing allowable foreign tax credits for U.S. federal income tax purposes, dividends received with respect to our shares will be treated as foreign source income and generally will be treated as passive category income, or in the case of certain types of U.S. Holders, general category income. Under current law, subject to holding-period requirements and certain other limitations, dividends received with respect to our publicly traded shares by a U.S. Holder who is an individual, trust or estate, or a U.S. Individual Holder, generally will be treated as qualified dividend income that is taxable to such U.S. Individual Holder at preferential capital gain tax rates (provided we are not classified as a PFIC for the taxable year during which the dividend is paid or the immediately preceding taxable year). Special rules may apply to any extraordinary dividend paid by us. Generally, an extraordinary dividend is a dividend with respect to a share of stock that is equal to or in excess of 10% of a common shareholders, or 5% of a preferred shareholders, adjusted tax basis (or fair market value upon the shareholders election) in such share. In addition, extraordinary dividends include dividends received within a one year period that, in the aggregate, equal or exceed 20% of a shareholders adjusted tax basis (or fair market value). If we pay an extraordinary dividend on our shares that is treated as qualified dividend income, then any loss recognized by a U.S. Individual Holder from the sale or exchange of such shares will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of the amount of such dividend. Certain U.S. Individual Holders are subject to a 3.8% tax on certain investment income, including dividends. Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Our Shares Subject to the discussion of PFICs, below, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss upon a sale, exchange or other disposition of our shares in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized by the U.S. Holder from such sale, exchange or other disposition and the U.S. Holders tax basis in such shares. Subject to the discussion of extraordinary dividends above, gain or loss recognized upon a sale, exchange or other disposition of our shares will be (i) treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holders holding period is greater than one year at the time of the sale, exchange or other disposition, or short-term capital gain or loss otherwise, and (ii) generally treated as U.S. source income or loss, as applicable, for foreign tax credit purposes. Certain U.S. Holders, including individuals, may be eligible for preferential rates of U.S. federal income tax in respect of long-term capital gains. A U.S. Holders ability to deduct capital losses is subject to certain limitations. Certain U.S. Individual Holders are subject to a 3.8% tax on certain investment income, including gain from the disposition of our shares. Consequences of Possible CFC Classification If CFC Shareholders (generally, U.S. Holders who each own, directly, indirectly or constructively, 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our outstanding shares entitled to vote) own directly, indirectly or constructively more than 50% of either the total combined voting power of all classes of our outstanding shares entitled to vote or the total value of all of our outstanding shares, we generally would be treated as a controlled foreign corporation, or a CFC. CFC Shareholders are treated as receiving current distributions of their respective share of certain income of the CFC without regard to any actual distributions and are subject to certain burdensome U.S. federal income tax and administrative requirements but generally are not also subject to the requirements generally applicable to shareholders of a PFIC (as discussed below). In addition, a person who is or has been a CFC Shareholder may 102 Table of Contents recognize ordinary income on the disposition of shares of the CFC. Although we do not believe we are a CFC, U.S. persons purchasing a substantial interest in us should consider the potential implications of being treated as a CFC Shareholder in the event we become a CFC in the future. The U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. Holders who are not CFC Shareholders would not change in the event we become a CFC in the future. Consequences of Possible PFIC Classification Special and adverse U.S. federal income tax rules apply to a U.S. Holder that holds stock in a non-U.S. corporation classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, we will be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year in which either (i) at least 75% of our gross income (including the gross income of certain of our subsidiaries) consists of passive income (e.g., dividends, interest, gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and rents and royalties (other than rents and royalties that are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business) or (ii) at least 50% of the average value of our assets (including the assets of certain of our subsidiaries) is attributable to assets that produce passive income, or are held for the production of passive income. For purposes of determining whether we are a PFIC, income earned, or deemed earned, by us in connection with the performance of services would not constitute passive income. There are legal uncertainties involved in determining whether the income derived from our time chartering activities constitutes rental income or income derived from the performance of services, including the decision in Tidewater Inc. v. United States, 565 F.3d 299 (5th Cir. 2009), which held that income derived from certain time-chartering activities should be treated as rental income rather than services income for purposes of a foreign sales corporation provision of the Code. However, the IRS stated in an Action on Decision (AOD 2010-01) that it disagrees with, and will not acquiesce to, the way that the rental versus services framework was applied to the facts in the Tidewater decision, and in its discussion stated that the time charters at issue in Tidewater would be treated as producing services income for PFIC purposes. The IRSs statement with respect to Tidewater cannot be relied upon or otherwise cited as precedent by taxpayers. Consequently, in the absence of any binding legal authority specifically relating to the statutory provisions governing PFICs, there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court would not follow the Tidewater decision in interpreting the PFIC provisions of the Code. Nevertheless, based on the current composition of our assets and operations (and that of our subsidiaries), we intend to take the position that we are not now and have never been a PFIC. Further, although we intend to conduct our affairs in a manner to avoid being classified as a PFIC with respect to any taxable year, there can be no assurance that the nature of our operations, and therefore the composition of our income and assets, will remain the same in the future. Moreover, the market value of our stock may be treated as reflecting the value of our assets at any given time. Therefore, a decline in the market value of our stock (which is not within our control) may impact the determination of whether we are a PFIC. Because our status as a PFIC for any taxable year will not be determinable until after the end of the taxable year, there can be no assurance that we will not be considered a PFIC for any future taxable year. As discussed more fully below, if we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year, a U.S. Holder generally would be subject to one of three different U.S. income tax regimes, depending on whether the U.S. Holder makes certain elections. Taxation of U.S. Holders Making a Timely QEF Election If we were classified as a PFIC for a taxable year, a U.S. Holder making a timely election to treat us as a Qualified Electing Fund for U.S. tax purposes, or a QEF Election would be required to report his pro rata share of our ordinary earnings and our net capital gain, if any, for our taxable year that ends with or within the U.S. Holders taxable year regardless of whether the U.S. Holder received distributions from us in that year. Such pro rata share would not exceed the income allocable to dividends payable on our shares, although ordinary earnings could be allocated to a shareholder in the taxable year before the dividend is paid. Such income inclusions would 103 Table of Contents not be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income. The U.S. Holders adjusted tax basis in our shares would be increased to reflect taxed but undistributed earnings and profits, and distributions of earnings and profits that had previously been taxed would not be taxed again when distributed but would result in a corresponding reduction in the U.S. Holders adjusted tax basis in our shares. The U.S. Holder generally would recognize capital gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our shares. A U.S. Holder would not, however, be entitled to a deduction for its pro-rata share of any losses that we incurred with respect to any year. A U.S. Holder would make a QEF Election with respect to any year that we are a PFIC by filing IRS Form 8621 with his U.S. federal income tax return and complying with all other applicable filing requirements. However, a U.S. Holders QEF Election will not be effective unless we annually provide the U.S. Holder with certain information concerning our income and gain, calculated in accordance with the Code, to be included with the U.S. Holders U.S. federal income tax return. We have not provided our U.S. Holders with such information in prior taxable years and do not intend to provide such information in the current taxable year. Accordingly, you will not be able to make an effective QEF Election at this time. If, contrary to our expectations, we determine that we are or will be a PFIC for any taxable year, we will provide U.S. Holders with the information necessary to make an effective QEF Election with respect to our shares. Taxation of U.S. Holders Making a Mark-to-Market Election Alternatively, if we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year and, as we believe, our shares are treated as marketable stock, then a U.S. Holder would be allowed to make a mark-to-market election with respect to our shares, provided the U.S. Holder completes and files IRS Form 8621 in accordance with the relevant instructions. If that election is made, the U.S. Holder generally would include as ordinary income in each taxable year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of our shares at the end of the taxable year over the U.S. Holders adjusted tax basis in our shares. The U.S. Holder also would be permitted an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the U.S. Holders adjusted tax basis in our shares over the fair market value thereof at the end of the taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election). The U.S. Holders tax basis in our shares would be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss recognized. Gain realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our shares would be treated as ordinary income, and any loss realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our shares would be treated as ordinary loss to the extent that such loss does not exceed the net mark-to-market gains previously included in income by the U.S. Holder. Because the mark-to-market election only applies to marketable stock, however, it would not apply to a U.S. Holders indirect interest in any of our subsidiaries that were also determined to be PFICs. Taxation of U.S. Holders Not Making a Timely QEF Election or Mark-to-Market Election Finally, if we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year, a U.S. Holder who does not make either a QEF Election or a mark-to-market election for that year would be subject to special rules resulting in increased tax liability with respect to (i) any excess distribution (i.e., the portion of any distributions received by the U.S. Holder on our shares in a taxable year in excess of 125% of the average annual distributions received by the U.S. Holder in the three preceding taxable years, or, if shorter, the U.S. Holders holding period for our shares), and (ii) any gain realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our shares. Under these special rules:  the excess distribution or gain would be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holders aggregate holding period for our shares;  the amount allocated to the current taxable year and any taxable year prior to the year we were first treated as a PFIC with respect to the U.S. Holder would be taxed as ordinary income in the current taxable year;  the amount allocated to each other taxable year would be subject to tax at the highest rate of tax in effect for the applicable class of taxpayers for that year, and 104 Table of Contents  an interest charge for the deemed deferral benefit would be imposed with respect to the resulting tax attributable to each such other taxable year. If we were treated as a PFIC, a U.S. Holder would be required to file Form 8621 annually with the IRS and would be required to comply with all other applicable filing requirements with respect to the U.S. Holders shares. In addition, if the U.S. Holder is an individual who dies while owning our shares, such shareholders successor generally would not receive a step-up in tax basis with respect to such shares. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the applicability, availability and advisability of, and procedure for, making QEF Elections, mark-to-market elections and other available elections with respect to us, and the U.S. federal income tax consequences of making such elections. U.S. Return Disclosure Requirements for U.S. Individual Holders U.S. Individual Holders who hold certain specified foreign financial assets, including stock in a foreign corporation that is not held in an account maintained by a financial institution, with an aggregate value in excess of $50,000, may be required to report such assets on IRS Form 8938 with their U.S. federal income tax return. Penalties apply for failure to properly complete and file Form 8938. Investors are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible application of this disclosure requirement to their investment in our shares. U.S. Federal Income Taxation of Non-U.S. Holders A beneficial owner of our shares (other than a partnership or an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is not a U.S. Holder is referred to herein as a non-U.S. Holder. Distributions In general, a non-U.S. Holder is not subject to U.S. federal income tax on distributions received from us with respect to our shares unless the distributions are effectively connected with the non-U.S. Holders conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, are attributable to a permanent establishment that the non- U.S. Holder maintains in the United States). If a non-U.S. Holder is engaged in a U.S. trade or business and the distribution is deemed to be effectively connected with that trade or business, the non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on that distribution in the same manner as if it were a U.S. Holder. Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Our Shares In general, a non-U.S. Holder is not subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain resulting from the disposition of our shares unless (i) such gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. Holders conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment that the shareholder maintains in the United States) or (ii) the shareholder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year in which those shares are disposed (and certain other requirements are met). If a non-U.S. Holder is engaged in a U.S. trade or business and the disposition of shares is deemed to be effectively connected with that trade or business, the non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the resulting gain in the same manner as if it were a U.S. Holder. 105 Table of Contents Backup Withholding and Information Reporting In general, payments of distributions or the proceeds of a disposition of our shares to a non-corporate U.S. Holder will be subject to information reporting requirements. These payments to a non-corporate U.S. Holder also may be subject to backup withholding if the U.S. Holder:  fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number;  is notified by the IRS that the U.S. Holder has failed to report all interest or corporate distributions required to be shown on the U.S. Holders U.S. federal income tax returns; or  in certain circumstances, fails to comply with applicable certification requirements. Non-U.S. Holders may be required to establish their exemption from information reporting and backup withholding on payments made to them within the United States by certifying their status on an IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI or W-8IMY, as applicable. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, a shareholder generally may obtain a credit for any amount withheld against the shareholders liability for U.S. federal income tax (and obtain a refund of any amounts withheld in excess of such liability) by timely filing U.S. federal income tax return with the IRS. Marshall Islands Tax Considerations Because we do not, and we do not expect that we will, conduct business or operations in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and because all documentation related to this offering will be executed outside of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, under current Marshall Islands law you will not be subject to Marshall Islands taxation or withholding on distributions, including upon a return of capital, we make to you as a shareholder. In addition, you will not be subject to Marshall Islands stamp, capital gains or other taxes on the purchase, ownership or disposition of shares, and you will not be required by the Republic of the Marshall Islands to file a tax return relating to the shares. Each prospective shareholder is urged to consult its tax counsel or other advisor with regard to the legal and tax consequences, under the laws of pertinent jurisdictions, including the Marshall Islands, of its investment in us. Further, it is the responsibility of each shareholder to file all state, local and non-U.S., as well as U.S. federal tax returns that may be required of it. Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations The following discussion is a summary of the material Canadian federal income tax consequences under the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the Canada Tax Act), as of the date of this Annual Report, that we believe are relevant to holders of shares who are, at all relevant times, for the purposes of the Canada Tax Act and the Canada-United States Tax Convention 1980 (the Canada-U.S. Treaty), resident only in the United States who are qualifying persons for purposes of the Canada-U.S. Treaty and who deal at arms length with us (U.S. Resident Holders). Holders that are United States limited liability companies should consult their own tax advisors. Subject to the assumptions below, under the Canada Tax Act no taxes on income (including taxable capital gains and withholding tax on dividends) are payable by U.S. Resident Holders in respect of the acquisition, holding, disposition or redemption of our shares. This opinion is based upon the assumptions that we are not a resident of Canada and such U.S. Resident Holders do not have, and have not had, for the purposes of the Canada-U.S. Treaty, a permanent establishment in Canada to which such shares pertain and, in addition, do not use or hold and are not deemed or considered to use or hold such shares in the course of carrying on a business in Canada. We will not be resident in Canada in a particular taxation year if our principal business in that year is the operation of ships that are used primarily in transporting passengers or goods in international traffic, all or substantially all of our gross revenue for that year consists of gross revenue from the operation of ships in 106 Table of Contents transporting passengers or goods in that international traffic, and we were not granted articles of continuance in Canada before the end of that year.
