Our Cricket service offerings provide customers with unlimited nationwide wireless services for a flat rate without requiring a fixed-term contract or a credit check.Cricket service is offered by Cricket, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Leap. Cricket service is also offered in South Texas by our joint venture, STX Wireless Operations, LLC, or STX Operations, which Cricket controls through a 75.75% membership interest in its parent company STX Wireless, LLC, or STX Wireless. For more information regarding this venture, see "Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Expenditures, Significant Acquisitions and Other Transactions.”Leap was formed as a Delaware corporation in 1998. Leap's shares began trading publicly in September 1998, and we launched our innovative Cricket service in March 1999. Leap conducts operations through its subsidiaries and has no independent operations or sources of income other than interest income and through dividends, if any, from its subsidiaries.Cricket Business OverviewCricket ServiceAs of December 31, 2012, Cricket service was offered in 48 states and the District of Columbia across an extended area covering approximately 292 million POPs. As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately 5.3 million customers, and we owned wireless licenses covering an aggregate of approximately 136.7 million POPs (adjusted to eliminate duplication from overlapping licenses). The combined network footprint in our operating markets covered approximately 96.2 million POPs as of December 31, 2012. The licenses we own provide an average of 23 MHz of coverage in our operating markets. In addition to our Cricket network footprint, we have entered into roaming relationships with other wireless carriers that enable us to offer Cricket customers nationwide voice and data roaming services over an extended service area. We have also entered into a wholesale agreement, which we use to offer Cricket services in nationwide retailers outside of our current network footprint. Cricket Business Strategy •Deliver Superior Customer Experience. Because we offer monthly services without a fixed-term contract, we are required to earn our customers' business every month. As a result, we are focused on improving the experience we provide customers so that they choose to remain a Cricket customer for a longer period. We are improving our device activation process, spending more time with customers to help ensure that they understand and are comfortable with the device they are purchasing. We have also significantly improved the quality of our device portfolio in recent years, including introducing higher-end smartphones such as the iPhone® and Samsung Galaxy handsets. In addition, we are introducing improvements to the in-store experience we and our dealers provide our customers. We are also working to improve ways that we resolve customer service issues, including by introducing more self-service alternatives and improving the quality of call center services we provide. •Retain and Expand Our Customer Base by Providing Value. The foundation of our business is to provide unlimited, nationwide wireless services, and we design and market our products and services to appeal to customers seeking increased value. We continually update our product and service offerings to better meet the needs of our current customers and to attract and retain new ones, including customers who may have previously entered into contract-based service plans with other nationwide carriers. The new service offerings we have introduced in recent years include Muve Music®, an unlimited music download service we developed specifically for mobile handsets, which is now offered for no additional cost in service plans for our Android-based smartphones. We have also introduced Lifeline service offerings in a number of states, which provide qualifying low-income customers with a subsidized discount on their wireless service. We offer current and new customers a diverse handset line-up, ranging from higher-end smartphones to lower-cost feature phones. In addition, through a third party we have introduced a device leasing program in certain of our markets to help customers manage the cost of purchasing a handset, and we plan to expand the availability and type of handset financing programs we offer in 2013. We plan to continue to develop our product and service offerings in 2013 and beyond. •Focus on Smart Investments. Our strategy is to be disciplined in pursing investment initiatives and to remain focused on our position as a low-cost provider of wireless telecommunications. During the third quarter of 2012, we increased 2pricing on our devices in an effort to better manage device subsidies and promote the addition of longer-tenured customers. We also plan to streamline and reduce our number of direct and indirect dealer locations in 2013 to attempt to increase the productivity of more attractive locations. In 2012, we continued to enhance our network to allow us to provide customers with high-quality service. We are also exploring cost-effective ways to deliver LTE services to additional customers, including by deploying facilities-based coverage and by entering into partnerships or joint ventures with other carriers. We have deployed LTE across approximately 21 million POPs in our network footprint and may deploy the service across up to an additional approximately 10 million POPs in 2013. In addition, we have recently entered into LTE roaming and wholesale arrangements and may enter into additional partnerships or joint ventures with other carriers. We intend to be disciplined as we pursue delivery of additional LTE services to our customers and to remain focused on our position as a low-cost provider of wireless telecommunications. Cricket Business OperationsCricket Products and ServicesCricket Wireless. Our Cricket Wireless service plans are designed to attract customers by offering simple, predictable and affordable nationwide voice and data services that are a competitive alternative to traditional wireless and wireline services. We offer service on a flat-rate, unlimited usage basis, without requiring fixed-term contracts, early termination fees or credit checks. Our most popular Cricket Wireless service plans bundle unlimited voice and data services, which include local and U.S. long distance, text messaging, mobile web, 411 services, navigation, data back-up and other features. The service plans we currently offer are “all-inclusive,” with telecommunication taxes and certain fees included within the service plan price. We also offer a flexible payment option, BridgePayTM, which gives our customers greater flexibility in the use of and payment for our Cricket Wireless service and which we believe helps us to retain customers.Muve Music. We also offer Muve Music, an unlimited music download service designed specifically for mobile handsets. We launched Muve Music in 2011 and the service is now offered for no additional cost in service plans for our Android-based smartphones. Muve Music was available to more than 1.1 million Cricket customers as of December 31, 2012 and is currently among the largest on-demand music subscription services in the U.S. as measured by the number of paid users.Cricket Lifeline. We participate in the federal government's Lifeline program, which provides support from the federal universal service fund, or USF, to subsidize discounted telecommunications services for qualified low-income consumers. Through our Cricket Lifeline program, we provide qualified customers with a monthly credit that they can apply to their phone service with us. In order to participate in the Lifeline program in any given state, a carrier must be designated as an eligible telecommunications carrier, or ETC, in that state. As of December 31, 2012, Cricket had been designated as an ETC in 27 states and the District of Columbia. We plan to continue to develop and expand the Lifeline service offerings we provide and to launch the program in additional states. Cricket PAYGoTM. Cricket PAYGo is a pay-as-you-go, unlimited prepaid wireless service designed for customers who prefer the flexibility and control offered by traditional prepaid services. Monthly pay-as-you-go versions of our Cricket PAYGo product are available in all Cricket markets as well as through nationwide retailers. In October 2012, we stopped selling a daily pay-as-you-go version of our Cricket PAYGo product to new customers in order to focus on our more successful monthly service offerings.Cricket Broadband. Cricket Broadband is our unlimited mobile broadband service offering and allows customers to access the internet through their computers for low, flat rates that vary depending upon the targeted amount of data that a customer expects to use during the month. These service plans are also "all-inclusive" and do not require long-term commitments or credit checks. The service is available in all Cricket markets as well as through nationwide retailers. As a result of strong customer adoption of our smartphones and other new handsets and devices, we have deemphasized our Cricket Broadband service and have experienced a substantial reduction in the number of customers subscribing to this service. We expect to continue to develop our product and service offerings in 2013 and beyond to better meet our customers' needs.3Devices.Our current device portfolio includes a wide spectrum of devices ranging from higher-end smartphones to lower-cost feature phones. Our portfolio of devices provides features that include full web capabilities, mobile web browsers, picture-enabled caller ID, high-resolution cameras with digital zoom and flash, integrated FM radio and MP3 stereo, USB, infrared and Bluetooth connectivity, on-board memory and other features to facilitate digital data transmission.During 2012, we continued to introduce higher-quality, higher-priced devices in our portfolio, including devices manufactured by Samsung, HTC, LG and others. We also introduced the iPhone 4, 4S and 5 to our device line-up in markets that utilize PCS spectrum. We currently offer three LTE-compatible devices and expect to launch additional LTE devices in 2013.Beginning in the second half of 2012, we increased the average out-the-door selling price for our devices as part of our strategy to manage the amount we spend to subsidize devices we sell to new and current customers. In addition, through a third party we have introduced a device leasing program in certain of our markets to help customers manage the cost of purchasing a device, and we plan to expand the availability and type of device financing programs we offer in 2013.Customer Care and Billing We outsource our call center operations to multiple call center vendors to manage the cost of providing care to our customers, while still maintaining the quality of our customer care. One of our strategic priorities is to continue to improve ways that we resolve customer service issues, including by introducing more self-service alternatives for customers and improving the quality of the call center services we provide. We are focused on improving the experience we provide our customers so that they choose to remain a Cricket customer for a longer period. We outsource our billing, device provisioning and payment systems to external vendors and also outsource bill presentment, distribution and fulfillment services. In recent years, we have upgraded a number of our significant, internal business systems, including implementing a new inventory management system, a new point-of-sale system and a new customer billing system. We believe that these new systems have improved customer experience, increased our efficiency, enhanced our ability to provide products and services, enabled us to better scale our business operations and reduced our operating costs. Sales and Distribution Our sales and distribution strategy is designed to increase our market penetration, while minimizing expenses associated with sales, distribution and marketing, by focusing on improving the sales process for customers, and by offering easy-to-understand service plans and attractive device pricing and promotions. We sell our Cricket devices and service through direct and indirect channels of distribution. Our direct channel is comprised of our own Cricket retail stores. As of December 31, 2012, we had 195 direct locations, which were responsible for approximately 15% of our gross customer additions in 2012. In addition, we and third-party retailers also sell Cricket services over the internet. Our indirect channel consists of our authorized dealers and distributors, including premier dealers and local market authorized dealers. Premier dealers are independent dealers that sell Cricket products exclusively in stores that look and function similar to our company-owned stores, enhancing the in-store experience and the level of customer service and expanding our brand presence within a market. Premier dealers tend to generate significantly more business than other indirect dealers. As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately 4,350 indirect dealer locations, of which approximately 2,700 were premier dealer locations.Our indirect channel also includes national retail locations. Beginning in 2011, we began to significantly expand our nationwide sales presence by offering Cricket products and services in thousands of nationwide retail locations. Since that time, we have determined to focus our efforts on those retailers that we believe provide the most attractive opportunities for our business, which currently include Walmart and Radio Shack. As a result, we expect to reduce our total presence in the nationwide retail channel from approximately 13,000 locations at June 30, 2012 to approximately 5,000 locations by early 2013. As of December 31, 2012, Cricket products and services were offered in approximately 8,000 nationwide retail locations. “Top-up” cards for our Cricket Broadband and Cricket PAYGo services are also available in approximately 4,300 convenience stores and other indirect outlets.We are focused on improving the productivity of our distribution system. We strategically select our direct and indirect retail locations to enable us to focus on our target customer demographic and provide the most efficient market coverage while 4minimizing cost. As part of this strategy, we plan to streamline and reduce our number of direct and indirect dealer locations in 2013 to attempt to increase the productivity of more attractive locations. In addition, we are focused on building and maintaining brand awareness in our markets. We combine mass and local marketing strategies to build brand awareness for Cricket service within the communities we serve. In order to reach our target segments, we advertise primarily on television, radio and online and also use out-of-home marketing (such as billboards). We also maintain the Cricket website (www.mycricket.com) for informational, e-commerce and customer service purposes. Network Operations and Partnerships As of December 31, 2012, Cricket service was offered in 48 states and the District of Columbia across an extended area covering approximately 292 million POPs.Network OperationsWe offer Cricket service, in part, through a network footprint in our operating markets that covered approximately 96.2 million POPs as of December 31, 2012. We believe our success depends upon utilizing a network that provides customers with high-quality coverage, capacity and data speeds and that can be readily upgraded to support enhanced capacity. We have deployed a high-quality network with CDMA2000® 1xRTT (referred to as CDMA 1xRTT) and CDMA2000 1xEV-DO (referred to as EvDO) capability that delivers outstanding quality, capacity and high-speed data services. We continued to enhance network capacity in many of our markets in 2012, and we plan to continue to maintain and develop our network and other business assets to allow us to continue to provide customers with high-quality service.We have deployed next-generation 4G LTE network technology across approximately 21 million POPs in our network footprint, and we are exploring cost-effective ways to deliver LTE services to additional customers. We may deploy LTE across up to an additional approximately 10 million POPs in our network footprint in 2013. In addition, we have entered into LTE roaming and wholesale arrangements, described below, and we may enter into partnerships or joint ventures with other carriers. We intend to be disciplined as we pursue delivery of additional LTE services to our customers and to remain focused on our position as a low-cost provider of wireless telecommunications.As of December 31, 2012, our wireless network consisted of approximately 9,700 cell sites (most of which were co-located on leased facilities) and 27 switches in 23 switching centers. A switching center serves several purposes, including routing calls, supervising call originations and terminations at cell sites, managing call handoffs and access to and from the public switched telephone network, or PSTN, and other value-added services. These locations also house platforms that enable services including text messaging, picture messaging, voice mail and data services. In operating our network, we monitor quality metrics, including dropped call rates and blocked call rates. We rely upon a network operations center, or NOC, to provide dedicated monitoring capabilities 24 hours a day, every day of the year, to ensure highly reliable service to our customers. We have outsourced the operation of our NOC to a third party in order to improve monitoring and reporting functions and to reduce costs associated with these operations. Our switches connect to the PSTN through fiber rings leased from third party providers, which facilitate the first leg of origination and termination of traffic between our equipment and both local exchange and long distance carriers. We have negotiated interconnection agreements with relevant exchange carriers in each of our markets. We use third party providers for long distance services and for backhaul services carrying traffic between our cell sites and switching centers.Roaming and Wholesale ServicesIn addition to utilizing our Cricket network footprint, we provide Cricket voice and data services through roaming and wholesale relationships that have enabled us to offer enhanced Cricket products and services, strengthen our retail presence in our existing markets and expand our distribution nationwide. We have entered into roaming relationships with national and regional wireless carriers that enable us to offer Cricket customers nationwide voice and data roaming services over an extended service area. We currently rely on one key carrier for 3G data roaming services and recently entered into an agreement with that carrier for 4G LTE roaming services. We have also entered into a wholesale agreement with an affiliate of Sprint Nextel, which we use to offer Cricket voice and data services in nationwide retailers outside of our current network footprint. We recently amended that agreement to enable us to offer 4G LTE services.5CompetitionThe wireless telecommunications industry is very competitive. In general, we compete with national facilities-based wireless providers and their prepaid affiliates or brands, local and regional carriers, non-facilities-based mobile virtual network operators (or MVNOs), voice-over-internet-protocol (or VoIP) service providers, traditional landline service providers, cable companies and mobile satellite service providers. Many of our competitors have greater name and brand recognition, larger spectrum holdings, larger network footprints, access to greater amounts of capital, greater technical, sales, marketing and distribution resources and established relationships with a larger base of current and potential customers. These advantages may allow our competitors to provide service offerings with more extensive features and options than those we currently provide; offer the latest and most popular devices through exclusive vendor arrangements; market to broader customer segments and offer service over larger geographic areas than we can; offer bundled service offerings that include landline phone, television and internet services that we are not able to duplicate; and purchase equipment, supplies, devices and services at lower prices than we can. As device selection and pricing become increasingly important to customers, any restriction on our ability to offer customers the latest and most popular devices as a result of exclusive dealings between device manufacturers and our larger competitors could put us at a significant competitive disadvantage and make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers. In addition, some of our competitors are able to offer their customers roaming services at lower rates. As consolidation in the industry creates even larger competitors, advantages that our competitors may have, as well as their bargaining power as wholesale providers of roaming services, may increase. For example, in connection with the offering of our nationwide voice and data roaming services, we have encountered problems with certain large wireless carriers in negotiating terms for roaming arrangements that we believe are reasonable, and we believe that consolidation has contributed significantly to some carriers' control over the terms and conditions of wholesale roaming services. In addition, national wireless providers have recently entered into a number of strategic transactions that could lead to further competitive pressures. In August 2012, Verizon Wireless acquired significant amounts of spectrum from SpectrumCo, a consortium of cable companies. In October 2012, Deutsche Telekom and MetroPCS entered into an agreement to combine T-Mobile and MetroPCS. In October 2012, Softbank agreed to acquire an approximately 70% ownership position in Sprint Nextel, followed in December 2012 by Sprint agreeing to acquire the remaining ownership stake in Clearwire that it did not already own. These transactions are each subject to regulatory review and approval. If consummated, these transactions could further intensify the competitive pressures we face.The competitive pressures of the wireless telecommunications industry and the attractive growth prospects in the prepaid segment have caused a number of our competitors (including AT&T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint and T-Mobile) to offer competitively-priced unlimited prepaid and postpaid service offerings. In addition, a number of carriers have begun to offer bundled service offerings comprised of unlimited voice service and fixed amounts of data that customers can share across all of their wireless devices. We also face additional competition in the prepaid segment from Lifeline service offerings, which are available to consumers at reduced costs (and in some cases at no cost) because carriers offering this service receive a subsidy payment from the federal USF program. These Lifeline service offerings are also being provided by new MNVO providers who are utilizing other carriers' networks.In addition to our voice offerings, many companies offer other products and services that compete with those we offer. For example, there are numerous music services that compete with our Muve Music service, including the iTunes service offered by Apple and various streaming services offered by Rhapsody, Pandora, Spotify and others.These various service offerings have presented, and are expected to continue to present, strong competition in markets in which our offerings overlap. We may also face additional competition from new entrants in the wireless marketplace, many of whom may have significantly more resources than we do or who may be able to offer competing wireless services with less capital investment than we require. The FCC is pursuing policies designed to increase the number of wireless licenses and spectrum available for the provision of voice, data and mobile broadband services in each of our markets, as well as policies to increase the level of broadband competition. For example, the FCC has adopted rules that allow the partitioning, disaggregation and leasing of wireless licenses, which may increase the number of our competitors. The FCC announced in March 2010, as part of its National Broadband Plan, the goal of making an additional 500 MHz of spectrum available for broadband use within the next 10 years, of which the FCC stated that 300 MHz should be made available for mobile use within five years. The FCC has also adopted policies to allow satellite operators to use portions of their spectrum for ancillary terrestrial use and recently made further changes intended to facilitate the terrestrial use of this spectrum for voice, data and mobile broadband services. For example, the FCC recently approved a proposal from Dish Network to convert spectrum currently used for satellite service into spectrum that would support a terrestrial wireless network. The FCC has also permitted the offering of broadband services over power lines. The auction and licensing of new spectrum, the re-purposing of other spectrum or the pursuit of policies designed to 6encourage broadband adoption across wireline and wireless platforms may result in new or existing competitors acquiring additional capacity or offering voice or data services without deploying their own wireless facilities, which could allow them to offer services that we may not be able to offer cost effectively, or at all, with the licenses we hold or to which we have access.The evolving competitive landscape negatively impacted our financial and operating results in 2012, including in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2012 when we experienced net customer losses. Our ability to remain competitive will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors and to keep our costs low. During the third quarter of 2012, we increased pricing on our devices in an effort to better manage device subsidies and promote the addition of longer-tenured customers, although such changes have also had the effect of decreasing gross customer additions. We also introduced new pricing plans for our service offerings, which included new features such as visual voicemail on certain smartphones, enhanced international calling plans, and supplemental data packages, and we enhanced our Muve Music service, which is now offered for no additional cost in service plans for our Android-based smartphones. In addition, through a third party we have introduced a device leasing program in certain of our markets to help customers manage the cost of purchasing a handset, and we plan to expand the availability and type of handset financing programs we offer in 2013. The extent to which these initiatives and others we may introduce will positively impact our future financial and operational results will depend upon our continued efforts to enhance the productivity of our distribution channels, continued customer acceptance of our product and service offerings, and our ability to retain these customers. The evolving competitive landscape may result in more competitive pricing, slower growth, higher costs and increased customer turnover. Any of these results or actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Government Regulation Pursuant to its authority under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, or the Communications Act, the FCC regulates the licensing, construction, modification, operation, ownership, sale and interconnection of wireless communications systems, as do some state and local regulatory agencies. Congress also periodically revises or enacts laws affecting the telecommunications industry, as do state legislatures. Decisions by these bodies could have a significant impact on the competitive market structure among wireless providers and on the relationships between wireless providers and other carriers. These mandates may also impose significant financial, operational or service obligations on us and other wireless providers. We are unable to predict the scope, pace or financial impact of legal or policy changes that could be adopted in these proceedings. Licensing of our Wireless Service Systems We hold broadband Personal Communications Services, or PCS, licenses, Advanced Wireless Services, or AWS, licenses and a 700 MHz license. The licensing rules that apply to these three categories of licenses are summarized below. PCS Licenses. A broadband PCS system operates under a license granted by the FCC for a particular market on one of six frequency blocks allocated for broadband PCS. Broadband PCS systems generally are used for two-way voice and data applications. Narrowband PCS systems, in contrast, generally are used for non-voice applications such as paging and data service and are separately licensed. The FCC has segmented the U.S. PCS markets into 51 large regions called major trading areas, or MTAs, which in turn are comprised of 493 smaller regions called basic trading areas, or BTAs. The FCC awards two broadband PCS licenses for each MTA and four licenses for each BTA. Thus, generally, six PCS licensees are authorized to compete in each area. The two MTA licenses authorize the use of 30 MHz of spectrum. One of the BTA licenses is for 30 MHz of spectrum, and the other three BTA licenses are for 10 MHz each. The FCC permits licensees to split their licenses and assign a portion to a third party on either a geographic or frequency basis or both. Over time, the FCC has also further split licenses in connection with re-auctions of PCS spectrum, creating additional 15 MHz and 10 MHz licenses. All PCS licensees must satisfy minimum geographic coverage requirements within five and, in some cases, ten years after the license grant date. These initial requirements are met for most 10 MHz licenses when a signal level sufficient to provide adequate service is offered to at least one-quarter of the population of the licensed area within five years, or in the alternative, a showing of substantial service is made for the licensed area within five years of being licensed. For 30 MHz licenses, a signal level must be provided that is sufficient to offer adequate service to at least one-third of the population within five years and two-thirds of the population within ten years after the license grant date. In the alternative, 30 MHz licensees may provide substantial service to their licensed area within the appropriate five- and ten-year benchmarks. “Substantial service” is defined by the FCC as service that is “sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of mediocre service which just might minimally warrant renewal.” In general, a failure to comply with FCC coverage requirements could cause the revocation of the relevant wireless license, with no eligibility to regain it, or the imposition of fines and/or other sanctions. All PCS licenses have a 10-year term, at the end of which they must be renewed. Our PCS licenses began expiring in 2006 and will continue to expire through 2015. The FCC's rules provide a formal presumption that a PCS license will be renewed, 7called a “renewal expectancy,” if the PCS licensee (1) has provided “substantial service” during its past license term, and (2) has substantially complied with applicable FCC rules and policies and the Communications Act. If a licensee does not receive a renewal expectancy, then the FCC will accept competing applications for the license renewal period and, subject to a comparative hearing, may award the license to another party. If the FCC does not acknowledge a renewal expectancy with respect to one or more of our licenses, or renew one or more of our licenses, our business may be materially harmed. AWS Licenses. Recognizing the increasing consumer demand for wireless mobile services, the FCC has allocated additional spectrum that can be used for two-way mobile wireless voice, data and broadband services, including AWS spectrum. The FCC has licensed six frequency blocks consisting of one 20 MHz license in each of 734 cellular market areas, or CMAs; one 20 MHz license and one 10 MHz license in each of 176 economic areas, or EAs; and two 10 MHz licenses and one 20 MHz license in each of 12 regional economic area groupings, or REAGs. AWS licenses generally have a 15-year term, at the end of which they must be renewed. With respect to construction requirements, an AWS licensee must offer “substantial service” to the public at the end of the license term. As noted above, a failure to comply with FCC coverage requirements could cause the revocation of the relevant wireless license, with no eligibility to regain it, or the imposition of fines and/or other sanctions. Portions of the AWS spectrum that we hold were originally subject to use by U.S. government and/or incumbent commercial licensees. The FCC rules issued in connection with Auction #66 required winning bidders to avoid interfering with existing users or to clear incumbent users from the spectrum through specified relocation procedures. In connection with the launch of new markets, we worked with several incumbent government and commercial licensees to clear AWS spectrum. In the event that we determine to launch additional new markets in the future using AWS spectrum, or to enhance network coverage or capacity in other markets currently in operation, we may need to pursue further spectrum clearing efforts. Any failure to complete these efforts on time or on budget could delay implementation of any clustering and expansion strategies that we may decide to pursue.700 MHz License. The FCC has also assigned licenses in several auctions for use of the 700 MHz band, which had been occupied by television broadcast stations but was made available for commercial and public safety services as a result of the digital television, or DTV, transition. Initial licenses in the 700 MHz band were granted for ten-year terms. For CMA and EA licenses offered in Auction # 92 (such as the 700 MHz license that we acquired from Verizon Wireless in 2012), licensees must provide signal coverage and offer service to (1) at least 35% of the geographic area of the license within four years of the initial license grant, and (2) at least 70% of the geographic area of the license at the end of the license term. Licensees must file construction notifications, all necessary supporting documentation, and required certifications with the FCC to demonstrate compliance with interim and end-of-term construction benchmarks. Any licensee that fails to meet the interim requirement within their license areas will have its license term reduced from ten to eight years, thus requiring the licensee to meet the end-of-term benchmark at an accelerated schedule. For those licenses in which the end-of-term performance requirements have not been met, the unused portion of the license will terminate automatically without FCC action and will become available for reassignment, subject to the "keep-what-you-use" rule. Another potential constraint on 700 MHz band licensees is that they must operate in accordance with the FCC rules intended to reduce the potential for interference to public reception of the signals of DTV broadcast stations transmitting on DTV Channel 51.Our 700 MHz A block license in Chicago is an EA license that is subject to a December 13, 2013 interim construction deadline. While we have been engaged in the first stages of development of this license to supplement existing wireless capacity in this market, we must coordinate with the incumbent broadcaster on DTV Channel 51 in order to commence operations, and we may be delayed in our ultimate ability to construct facilities and operate on this spectrum. We thus may need to seek relief from the FCC from the interim construction benchmark, and/or ask the FCC for relief from DTV interference protection requirements. Designated Entities. Since the early 1990's the FCC has pursued a policy in wireless licensing of attempting to assist various types of designated entities. The FCC generally has determined that designated entities who qualify as small businesses or very small businesses, as defined by a complex set of FCC rules, can receive additional benefits. These benefits can include eligibility to bid for certain licenses set aside only for designated entities. The FCC generally required holders of these licenses to meet certain maximum financial size qualifications for at least a five-year period. In addition, designated entities are eligible for bidding credits in most spectrum auctions and re-auctions, and, in some cases, an installment loan from the federal government for a significant portion of the dollar amount of the winning bids. A failure by an entity to maintain its qualifications to own licenses won through the designated entity program could cause a number of adverse consequences, including the ineligibility to hold licenses for which the FCC's minimum coverage requirements have not been met, and the triggering of FCC unjust enrichment rules, which could require the recapture of bidding credits and the acceleration of any installment payments owed to the U.S. Treasury.8 The FCC has implemented rules and policies to ensure that only legitimate small businesses benefit from the program, and that such small businesses are not controlled or manipulated by larger wireless carriers or other investors that do not meet the small business qualification tests. For example, designated entity structures are subject to a requirement that they seek approval for any event that might affect their ongoing eligibility (for example, changes in agreements that the FCC has previously reviewed), annual reporting requirements and a commitment by the FCC to audit each designated entity at least once during the license term. In addition, third parties and the federal government have in the past challenged certain designated entity structures, alleging violations of federal qui tam and other laws and seeking significant monetary damages. We cannot predict the degree to which rule changes, federal court litigation surrounding designated entity structures, increased regulatory scrutiny or third party or government lawsuits will affect our prior investments in designated entities, future business ventures or our participation in future FCC spectrum auctions. Foreign Ownership. Under existing law, no more than 20% of an FCC licensee's capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, or voted by non-U.S. citizens or their representatives, by a foreign government or its representatives or by a foreign corporation. If an FCC licensee is controlled by another entity (as is the case with Leap's ownership and control of subsidiaries that hold FCC licenses), up to 25% of that entity's capital stock may be owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or their representatives, by a foreign government or its representatives or by a foreign corporation. Foreign ownership above the 25% holding company level may be allowed if the FCC finds such higher levels consistent with the public interest. The FCC has ruled that higher levels of foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public interest with respect to investors from certain nations. If our foreign ownership were to exceed the permitted level, the FCC could revoke our wireless licenses, although we could seek a declaratory ruling from the FCC allowing the foreign ownership or could take other actions to reduce our foreign ownership percentage in order to avoid the loss of our licenses. We have no knowledge of any present foreign ownership in violation of these restrictions. Transfer and Assignment. The Communications Act and FCC rules require the FCC's prior approval of the assignment or transfer of control of a commercial wireless license, with limited exceptions. The FCC may prohibit or impose conditions on assignments and transfers of control of licenses. Non-controlling membership interests in an entity that holds a wireless license generally may be bought or sold without FCC approval. The FCC engages in a case-by-case review of transactions that involve the consolidation of spectrum licenses or leases and applies a spectrum “screen” in examining such transactions. Although we cannot assure you that the FCC will approve or act in a timely fashion upon any pending or future requests for approval of assignment or transfer of control applications that we file, in general we believe the FCC will approve or grant such requests or applications in due course. Because an FCC license is necessary to lawfully provide wireless service, if the FCC were to disapprove any such filing, our business plans would be adversely affected.FCC Regulation Generally The FCC has a number of other complex requirements and proceedings that affect our operations and that could increase our costs or diminish our revenues. For example, the FCC requires wireless carriers to make available emergency 911, or E911, services, including enhanced E911 services that provide the caller's telephone number and detailed location information to emergency responders, as well as a requirement that E911 services be made available to users with speech or hearing disabilities. Our obligations to implement these services occur on a market-by-market basis as emergency service providers request the implementation of enhanced E911 services in their locales. Absent a waiver, a failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to significant penalties. Furthermore, the FCC has initiated a comprehensive re-examination of E911 location accuracy and reliability requirements. In connection with this re-examination, the FCC issued an order requiring wireless carriers to satisfy E911 location and reliability standards at a geographical level defined by the coverage area of a Public Safety Answering Point, or PSAP, and has indicated that further action may be taken in future proceedings to establish more stringent, uniform location accuracy requirements across technologies, and to promote continuing development of technologies that might enable carriers to provide public safety with better information for locating persons in the event of an emergency. We cannot predict whether or how such actions will affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. FCC rules also require that local exchange carriers and most commercial mobile radio service providers, including providers like Cricket, allow customers to change service providers without changing telephone numbers. For wireless service providers, this mandate is referred to as wireless local number portability. The FCC also has adopted rules governing the porting of wireline telephone numbers to wireless carriers. The FCC has the authority to order interconnection between commercial mobile radio service operators and incumbent local exchange carriers, and FCC rules provide that all local exchange carriers must enter into compensation arrangements with commercial mobile radio service carriers for the exchange of local traffic, whereby each carrier compensates the other for terminating local traffic originating on the other carrier's network. As a commercial mobile radio services provider, we are 9required to pay compensation to a wireline local exchange carrier that transports and terminates a local call that originated on our network. Similarly, we are entitled to receive compensation when we transport and terminate a local call that originated on a wireline local exchange network. We negotiate interconnection arrangements for our network with major incumbent local exchange carriers and other independent telephone companies. If an agreement cannot be reached, under certain circumstances, parties to interconnection negotiations can submit outstanding disputes to state authorities for arbitration. Negotiated interconnection agreements are subject to state approval. The FCC's interconnection rules and rulings, as well as state arbitration proceedings, directly impact the nature and costs of facilities necessary for the interconnection of our network with other wireless telecommunications networks. They also determine the amount we receive for terminating calls originating on the networks of local exchange carriers and other telecommunications carriers. The FCC in recent years adopted comprehensive changes to its intercarrier compensation system, which include, among other things, the transition of all types of traffic to a bill-and-keep regime over a multi-year period, as well as a mechanism to offset the resulting revenue losses for incumbents. For wireless carriers, the FCC made the transition immediately, and adopted bill-and-keep as the default compensation for intra-MTA traffic exchanged between local exchange carriers, or LECs, and wireless carriers as of the effective date of the order. Various aspects of the FCC's intercarrier compensation regime are subject to review before the FCC, state regulatory bodies or federal or state courts. The outcome of such proceedings may affect the manner in which we are charged or compensated for the exchange of traffic. The FCC has adopted rules requiring commercial mobile radio service providers to provide automatic roaming for voice and SMS text messaging services on just, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The FCC has also adopted rules generally requiring carriers to offer data roaming services on commercially reasonable terms. These orders, however, do not provide or mandate any specific mechanism for determining the reasonableness of roaming rates and require that roaming complaints be resolved on a case-by-case basis, based on a non-exclusive list of factors that can be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of particular conduct or rates. The FCC's data roaming order and rules were recently affirmed on appeal, although they are still subject to a petition for reconsideration at the FCC. Our inability to obtain these roaming services on a cost-effective basis may limit our ability to compete effectively for wireless customers, which may increase our churn and decrease our revenues, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The FCC has adopted an order codifying and supplementing its previous internet openness principles (sometimes referred to as “network neutrality” principles) into binding rules. These rules are intended to ensure that consumers are able to access the lawful internet content, applications, and services of their choice, and to attach non-harmful devices to the network. The rules also require greater transparency regarding providers' network management practices. The rules in this proceeding are the subject of pending appeals in federal court, and if they survive judicial review, contain uncertainties that will require future case-by-case interpretation and enforcement by the FCC in specific complaints. These rules and pending review and complaint proceedings affecting their interpretation and enforcement could have significant operational implications for how we manage traffic on our network, the applications and devices that can be used on our networks, and our consumer disclosure practices. We cannot predict how these rules, or their interpretation or enforcement, will affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The FCC has rules in place requiring interstate communications carriers, including commercial mobile wireless carriers, to contribute to a federal USF that reimburses communications carriers who are providing subsidized communications services to underserved areas and users. The FCC requires carriers to determine their percentage of traffic that is interstate or international and to make contributions based on the revenues associated with such traffic. Our failure to comply with our USF obligations could subject us to significant fines or forfeitures. The FCC is also considering whether to amend rules regarding USF contributions, and new requirements could result in increased contribution obligations for us and other carriers. We participate in the federal government's Lifeline program, which provides support from the USF to subsidize discounted telecommunications services for qualified low-income consumers. In order to participate in the Lifeline program in any given state, a carrier must be designated as an ETC in that state. As of December 31, 2012, Cricket had been designated as an ETC in 27 states and the District of Columbia. In January 2012, the FCC adopted an order regarding the Lifeline program, the stated purpose of which is to streamline the administration of the program and to implement measures to curb perceived waste, fraud and abuse in the program. In addition, various states are considering or enacting rules with similar stated purposes as the FCC order. In connection with the FCC's order, among other things, we are required to have our Lifeline customers re-certify on an annual basis their eligibility to participate in the program. These requirements could result in the loss of Lifeline customers and associated funding from the USF if these customers fail to meet the FCC's eligibility standards or fail to respond to requests to re-certify their eligibility. Further, the FCC is developing a National Lifeline Accountability Database, the primary purpose of which will be to validate the identity of Lifeline customers and prevent Lifeline support from being provided to more than one eligible recipient per household in accordance with FCC regulations. While the timing of the deployment of the database is uncertain, its implementation and use could reduce the number of customers we enroll in our Lifeline programs and thus the amount of Lifeline funding we receive. In addition, the FCC could pursue enforcement action against us and impose monetary 10penalties if it were to conclude that we violated any of the Lifeline rules. In addition, future action by Congress, the FCC, or the states in which we have been designated as an ETC could reduce or eliminate the amount of Lifeline funding we receive for providing wireless service to certain qualifying low income customers, which could result in the loss of subscribers and the associated service revenue.In November 2011, the FCC adopted an order establishing new universal service support mechanisms intended to support both voice and broadband services in high-cost areas, which would be funded through a new Connect America Fund, or CAF. Over time, these CAF mechanisms will replace legacy high-cost support mechanisms that currently provide funding to wireless carriers and other ETCs. The new CAF mechanisms place greater limits on the total amount of high-cost support available to wireless ETCs (as opposed to wireline incumbents). At the same time, the CAF mechanisms will reduce or eliminate available support in certain high-cost areas that benefit from competition. The CAF program has not yet been implemented fully, and the FCC has sought further public comment with respect to certain details of its implementation. For example, the FCC has stated its intent to distribute funds to wireless ETCs through a competitive auction mechanism but has not yet finalized the details of such a program. In addition, the FCC order establishing the CAF program is the subject of pending petitions for reconsideration filed with the FCC, as well as pending judicial appeals. As such, there is uncertainty as to how and when the CAF program will be implemented fully and how such implementation could impact wireless carriers and competition in local and national markets.We also are subject, or potentially subject, to numerous additional rules and requirements, including universal service obligations; number portability requirements; number pooling rules; rules governing billing, subscriber privacy and customer proprietary network information; roaming obligations; rules that require wireless service providers to configure their networks to facilitate electronic surveillance by law enforcement officials; rate averaging and integration requirements; rules governing spam, telemarketing and truth-in-billing; and rules requiring us to offer equipment and services that are accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, among others. There are also pending proceedings exploring the imposition of various types of nondiscrimination, open access and broadband management obligations on our devices and networks; the prohibition of device exclusivity; the possible re-imposition of bright-line spectrum aggregation requirements; further regulation of special access used for wireless backhaul services; and the effects of the siting of communications towers on migratory birds, among others. Some of these requirements and pending proceedings (of which the foregoing examples are not an exhaustive list) pose technical and operational challenges to which we, and the industry as a whole, have not yet developed clear solutions. These requirements generally are the subject of pending FCC or judicial proceedings, and we are unable to predict how they may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. State, Local and Other Regulation Congress has given the FCC the authority to preempt states from regulating rates and entry into commercial mobile radio service. The FCC, to date, has denied all state petitions to regulate the rates charged by commercial mobile radio service providers. State and local governments are permitted to manage public rights of way and can require fair and reasonable compensation from telecommunications providers, on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis, for the use of such rights of way by telecommunications carriers, including commercial mobile radio service providers, so long as the compensation required is publicly disclosed by the state or local government. States may also impose competitively neutral requirements that are necessary for universal service, to protect the public safety and welfare, to ensure continued service quality and to safeguard the rights of consumers. While a state may not impose requirements that effectively function as barriers to entry or create a competitive disadvantage, the scope of state authority to maintain existing requirements or to adopt new requirements is unclear. State legislators, public utility commissions and other state agencies are becoming increasingly active in efforts to regulate wireless carriers and the service they provide, including efforts to conserve numbering resources and efforts aimed at regulating service quality, advertising, warranties and returns, rebates, and other consumer protection measures. The location and construction of our wireless antennas and base stations and the towers we lease on which such antennas are located are subject to FCC and Federal Aviation Administration regulations, federal, state and local environmental and historic preservation regulations, and state and local zoning, land use or other requirements. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, prohibits the circumvention of technological measures or access controls employed by or on behalf of copyright owners to protect their copyrighted works. However, under the DMCA, the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress, or the Copyright Office, has the authority to exempt for three-year periods certain circumventing activities that might otherwise be prohibited by the statute. In July 2010, the Copyright Office granted an exemption to the DMCA to allow the circumvention of software locks and other firmware that prohibit a wireless handset from connecting to a wireless network when such circumvention is accomplished for the sole purpose of lawfully connecting the handset to another network. This exemption permitted locked handsets purchased from one wireless carrier to be unlocked and then activated on another carrier's network. On October 28, 2012, the Copyright Office issued a new exemption under the 11DMCA, which only permits the circumvention of software locks on handsets purchased before January 26, 2013. In order for locked devices purchased after this date to be connected to another carrier's network, the customer must obtain the prior carrier's consent to unlock the device. This new, narrowed exemption, and any further modification of the DMCA copyright exemption, could impact our ability to attract and activate new customers.We cannot assure you that any federal, state or local regulatory requirements currently applicable to our systems will not be changed in the future or that regulatory requirements will not be adopted in those states and localities that currently have none. Such changes could impose new obligations on us that could adversely affect our operating results. Privacy We are obligated to comply with a variety of federal and state privacy and consumer protection requirements. The Communications Act and FCC rules, for example, impose various rules on us intended to protect against the disclosure of customer proprietary network information. Other FCC and Federal Trade Commission rules regulate the disclosure and sharing of subscriber information. We have developed and comply with a policy designed to protect the privacy of our customers and their personal information. State legislatures and regulators are considering imposing additional requirements on companies to further protect the privacy of wireless customers. Our need to comply with these rules, and to address complaints by subscribers invoking them, could adversely affect our operating results. Intellectual Property We have pursued registration of our primary trademarks and service marks in the United States. Leap is a U.S. registered trademark and the Leap logo is a trademark of Leap. Cricket, Cricket Wireless, Cricket Clicks, Muve Music, Muve First, Muve Headliner, MyPerks, Flex Bucket, Real Unlimited Unreal Savings and the Cricket “K” are U.S. registered trademarks of Cricket. In addition, the following are trademarks or service marks of Cricket: BridgePay, Cricket By Week, Cricket Choice, Cricket Connect, Cricket Nation, Cricket PAYGo, Muve, Muve Money, Cricket Crosswave, Seek Music, Cricket MyPerks and Cricket Wireless Internet Service. All other trademarks are the property of their respective owners.We also have several patents and have several patent applications pending in the United States relating to telecommunications and related services. However, our business is not substantially dependent upon any of our patents or patent applications. We believe that our technical expertise, operational efficiency, cost structure and ability to introduce new products in a timely manner are more critical to maintaining our competitive position in the future.

The information on our website is not part of this report or any other report that we furnish to or file with the SEC. Financial Information Concerning Segments and Geographical Information Financial information concerning our operating segment and the geographic area in which we operate is included in “Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report. Employees As of December 31, 2012, we had 3,292 employees. SeasonalityOur customer activity is influenced by seasonal effects related to traditional retail selling periods and other factors that arise in connection with our target customer base. Based on historical results, we generally expect new sales activity to be highest in the first and fourth quarters, although during 2012 we experienced our lowest customer activity during the fourth quarter due, in part, to pricing changes we introduced in the third quarter which reduced the amount of subsidy we provide on devices. Based on historical results, we also generally expect churn to be highest in the third quarter and lowest in the first quarter. Sales 12activity and churn, however, can be strongly affected by other factors, including changes in service plan pricing, device availability, economic conditions, high unemployment (particularly in the lower-income segment of our customer base) and competitive actions, any of which may either offset or magnify certain seasonal effects. Customer activity can also be strongly affected by promotional and retention efforts that we undertake. For example, from time to time, we lower the price on select smartphones for customers who activate a new line of service and then transfer phone numbers previously used with other carriers. This type of promotion is intended to drive significant, new customer activity for our smartphone handsets and their accompanying higher-priced service plans. We also frequently offer existing customers the opportunity to activate an additional line of voice service on a previously activated Cricket device not currently in service. Customers accepting this offer receive a free first month of service on the additional line of service after paying an activation fee. We also utilize retention programs to encourage existing customers whose service may have been suspended for failure to timely pay to continue service with us for a reduced or free amount. The design, size and duration of our promotional and retention programs vary over time in response to changing market conditions. We believe that our promotional and retention efforts, including those efforts described above, have generally provided and continue to provide important long-term benefits to us, including by helping us attract new customers for our wireless services or by extending the period of time over which customers use our services, thus allowing us to obtain additional revenue from handsets we have already sold. The success of any of these activities depends upon many factors, including the cost that we incur to attract or retain customers and the length of time these customers continue to use our services. Sales activity that would otherwise have been expected based on seasonal trends can also be negatively impacted by factors such as the billing system disruptions we experienced in 2011, promotional and retention efforts not performing as expected at various times in 2012, device quality issues, and inventory shortages for or unavailability of certain of our strongest-selling devices that we have experienced at various times.InflationWe believe inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations.13Executive Officers of the RegistrantName Age Position with the CompanyS.

Item 1A.Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Business and Industry We Have Experienced Net Losses, and We May Not Be Profitable in the Future. We experienced a net loss of $187.3 million, $317.7 million and $785.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We may not generate profits in the future on a consistent basis or at all. Our strategic objectives depend on our ability to successfully and cost-effectively operate our markets, on our ability to forecast and respond appropriately to changes in the competitive and economic environment, on the successful enhancement of our distribution channels, and on customer acceptance of our Cricket product and service offerings. If we fail to attract and retain additional customers for our Cricket products and services and fail to achieve consistent profitability in the future, that failure could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.Our Strategic Plans Require that We Retain and Grow Our Current Customer Base; Our Failure to Do So Would Negatively Affect Our Business Plans and Financial Outlook.We have recently experienced quarterly net customer losses that decreased our total number of customers, including in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2012. In addition, our growth has varied substantially in the past. We believe that this uneven growth generally has reflected competition in the wireless telecommunications market, promotional activity, seasonal trends in customer activity and varying national economic conditions. Our current business plans assume that we will increase our customer base over time, providing us with increased economies of scale. Our ability to continue to grow our customer base and to achieve increased customer penetration levels in our markets is subject to a number of risks, including, among other things, increased competition, our inability to manage or increase our network capacity or service offerings to meet increasing customer demand, promotional or retention activities that do not perform as expected, device quality and selection issues, inventory shortages, device pricing, unfavorable economic conditions (which may have a disproportionate negative impact on portions of our customer base), our inability to successfully enhance our distribution channels, billing or other system or service disruptions, adverse changes in 15the legislative and regulatory environment and other factors that may limit our ability to grow our customer base. If we continue to lose customers or are unable to attract and retain a growing customer base, that failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The Operation of Our Business Requires a Significant Amount of Cash. Our Ability to Generate Cash Depends on Many Factors Beyond Our Control. Our business requires that we generate a significant amount of cash flow from operations to fund ongoing liquidity requirements, including payments on our indebtedness. Our ability to generate cash flow from operations is subject to our operational performance and to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our ongoing liquidity needs. If cash flow from operations is insufficient, we may be required to take actions, such as delaying or reducing capital expenditures, attempting to restructure or refinance our indebtedness prior to maturity, reducing operating expenses, selling assets or seeking additional capital. Any or all of these actions may be insufficient to allow us to fund our liquidity needs. Further, we may be unable to take any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all.We Face Significant Competition, Which Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Demand for Cricket Service.The wireless telecommunications industry is very competitive. In general, we compete with national facilities-based wireless providers and their prepaid affiliates or brands, local and regional carriers, non-facilities-based MVNOs, VoIP service providers, traditional landline service providers, cable companies and mobile satellite service providers. Many of our competitors have greater name and brand recognition, larger spectrum holdings, larger network footprints, access to greater amounts of capital, greater technical, sales, marketing and distribution resources and established relationships with a larger base of current and potential customers. These advantages may allow our competitors to provide service offerings with more extensive features and options than those we currently provide; offer the latest and most popular devices through exclusive vendor arrangements; market to broader customer segments and offer service over larger geographic areas than we can; offer bundled service offerings that include landline phone, television and internet services that we are not able to duplicate; and purchase equipment, supplies, devices and services at lower prices than we can. As device selection and pricing become increasingly important to customers, any restriction on our ability to offer customers the latest and most popular devices as a result of exclusive dealings between device manufacturers and our larger competitors could put us at a significant competitive disadvantage and make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers. In addition, some of our competitors are able to offer their customers roaming services at lower rates. As consolidation in the industry creates even larger competitors, advantages that our competitors may have, as well as their bargaining power as wholesale providers of roaming services, may increase. For example, in connection with the offering of our nationwide voice and data roaming services, we have encountered problems with certain large wireless carriers in negotiating terms for roaming arrangements that we believe are reasonable, and we believe that consolidation has contributed significantly to some carriers' control over the terms and conditions of wholesale roaming services. In addition, national wireless providers have recently entered into a number of strategic transactions that could lead to further competitive pressures. In August 2012, Verizon Wireless acquired significant amounts of spectrum from SpectrumCo, a consortium of cable companies. In October 2012, Deutsche Telekom and MetroPCS entered into an agreement to combine T-Mobile and MetroPCS. In October 2012, Softbank agreed to acquire an approximately 70% ownership position in Sprint Nextel, followed in December 2012 by Sprint agreeing to acquire the remaining ownership stake in Clearwire that it did not already own. These transactions are each subject to regulatory review and approval. If consummated, these transactions could further intensify the competitive pressures we face.The competitive pressures of the wireless telecommunications industry and the attractive growth prospects in the prepaid segment have caused a number of our competitors (including AT&T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint and T-Mobile) to offer competitively-priced unlimited prepaid and postpaid service offerings. In addition, a number of carriers have begun to offer bundled service offerings comprised of unlimited voice service and fixed amounts of data that customers can share across all of their wireless devices. We also face additional competition in the prepaid segment from Lifeline service offerings, which are available to consumers at reduced costs (and in some cases at no cost) because carriers offering this service receive a subsidy payment from the federal USF program. These Lifeline service offerings are also being provided by new MNVO providers who are utilizing other carriers' networks.In addition to our voice offerings, many companies offer other products and services that compete with those we offer. For example, there are numerous music services that compete with our Muve Music service, including the iTunes service offered by Apple, and various streaming services offered by Rhapsody, Pandora, Spotify and others.These various service offerings have presented, and are expected to continue to present, strong competition in markets in which our offerings overlap. 16We may also face additional competition from new entrants in the wireless marketplace, many of whom may have significantly more resources than we do or who may be able to offer competing wireless services with less capital investment than we require. The FCC is pursuing policies designed to increase the number of wireless licenses and spectrum available for the provision of voice, data and mobile broadband services in each of our markets, as well as policies to increase the level of broadband competition. For example, the FCC has adopted rules that allow the partitioning, disaggregation and leasing of wireless licenses, which may increase the number of our competitors. The FCC announced in March 2010, as part of its National Broadband Plan, the goal of making an additional 500 MHz of spectrum available for broadband use within the next 10 years, of which the FCC stated that 300 MHz should be made available for mobile use within five years. The FCC has also adopted policies to allow satellite operators to use portions of their spectrum for ancillary terrestrial use and recently made further changes intended to facilitate the terrestrial use of this spectrum for voice, data and mobile broadband services. For example, the FCC recently approved a proposal from Dish Network to convert spectrum currently used for satellite service into spectrum that would support a terrestrial wireless network. The FCC has also permitted the offering of broadband services over power lines. The auction and licensing of new spectrum, the re-purposing of other spectrum or the pursuit of policies designed to encourage broadband adoption across wireline and wireless platforms may result in new or existing competitors acquiring additional capacity or offering voice or data services without deploying their own wireless facilities, which could allow them to offer services that we may not be able to offer cost effectively, or at all, with the licenses we hold or to which we have access.The evolving competitive landscape negatively impacted our financial and operating results in 2012, including in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2012 when we experienced net customer losses. Our ability to remain competitive will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors and to keep our costs low. During the third quarter of 2012, we increased pricing on our devices in an effort to better manage device subsidies and promote the addition of longer-tenured customers, although such changes have also had the effect of decreasing gross customer additions. We also introduced new pricing plans for our service offerings, which included new features such as visual voicemail on certain smartphones, enhanced international calling plans, and supplemental data packages, and we enhanced our Muve Music service, which is now offered for no additional cost in service plans for our Android-based smartphones. In addition, through a third party we have introduced a device leasing program in certain of our markets to help customers manage the cost of purchasing a handset, and we plan to expand the availability and type of handset financing programs we offer in 2013. The extent to which these initiatives and others we may introduce will positively impact our future financial and operational results will depend upon our continued efforts to enhance the productivity of our distribution channels, continued customer acceptance of our product and service offerings, and our ability to retain these customers. The evolving competitive landscape may result in more competitive pricing, slower growth, higher costs and increased customer turnover. Any of these results or actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.General Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect Our Business, Financial Performance or Ability to Obtain Debt or Equity Financing on Reasonable Terms or at All.Our business and financial performance are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including changes in interest rates, consumer credit conditions, consumer debt levels, consumer confidence, rates of inflation (or concerns about deflation), unemployment rates, energy costs and other macro-economic factors. Market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging in recent years. Continued concerns about the systemic impact of a long-term downturn, high unemployment, high energy costs, the availability and cost of credit and unstable housing and mortgage markets have contributed to increased market volatility and economic uncertainty. These factors have led to a decrease in spending in recent years by businesses and consumers alike. Continued market turbulence and weak economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and financial performance in a number of ways. Because we do not require customers to sign fixed-term contracts or pass a credit check, our service is available to a broad customer base and may be attractive to a market segment that is more vulnerable to weak economic conditions. As a result, during general economic downturns, we may have greater difficulty in gaining new customers within this base for our services and existing customers may be more likely to terminate service due to an inability to pay. For example, high unemployment levels have historically impacted our customer base, especially the lower-income segment of our customer base, by decreasing their discretionary income and affecting their ability to maintain service. Continued weak economic conditions and tight credit conditions may also adversely impact our vendors and dealers, some of which have filed for or may be considering bankruptcy, or may experience cash flow or liquidity problems, any of which could adversely impact our ability to distribute, market or sell our products and services. Sustained difficult, or worsening, general economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, U.S. credit markets have in recent years experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions. Uncertainty in the credit or capital markets could negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing indebtedness in the future on favorable terms or at all. These general economic conditions, combined with intensified competition 17in the wireless telecommunications industry and other factors, have also adversely affected the trading prices of equity securities of many U.S. companies, including Leap, which could significantly limit our ability to raise additional capital through the issuance of common stock, preferred stock or other equity securities. Any of these risks could impair our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We Have Entered into Agreements with Significant Purchase Commitments and Cannot Guarantee that We Will Meet These Commitments or Realize the Expected Benefits from These Agreements.iPhone Purchase Commitment In May 2012, we entered into a three-year iPhone purchase commitment with Apple. The commitment began upon our launch of sales of the iPhone in June 2012. Based on our current handset purchase and sales mix and current iPhone device pricing, we estimate that the commitment would require us to purchase approximately $800 million of iPhones, with annual commitments during the three-year period that increase moderately in the second and third years. We project that the minimum number of iPhones that we are required to purchase from Apple over the term of the commitment would represent 10% or less of the total number of handsets we expect to sell to new and upgrading customers over the period of the commitment and for approximately one year thereafter. However, the actual amount that we spend and the number of devices that we purchase over the term of the commitment will depend on many factors, including customer acceptance and availability of current and future versions of the device, future costs for the device, the success of our marketing and advertising efforts, customer demand for devices offered by other manufacturers and other factors.At our current purchase rate, we project that we will purchase approximately one-half of our first-year minimum purchase commitment through June 2013, although the actual amount of our purchases will depend on the factors described above. If Apple were to require us to meet the annual minimum commitment in each of the three years of the contract term, we estimate that we would be required to purchase approximately $100 million of additional iPhones in mid-2013 above our current purchase rate, approximately $150 million of additional iPhones in mid-2014 above our current purchase rate and approximately $200 million of additional iPhones in mid-2015 above our current purchase rate. If we were unable to sell such additional devices at the rates and prices we project, such differences could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Wholesale AgreementIn August 2010, we entered into a wholesale agreement with an affiliate of Sprint Nextel which we use to offer Cricket services in nationwide retailers outside of our current network footprint. We have agreed, among other things, to purchase a minimum of $300 million of wholesale services over the initial five-year term of the agreement, with the following annual minimum purchase commitments: $20 million in 2011; $75 million in 2012; $80 million in 2013; $75 million in 2014; and $50 million in 2015. We entered into an amendment to the wholesale agreement in February 2013 to enable us to purchase 4G LTE services. In addition, under the amendment, we can credit up to $162 million of revenue we provide Sprint under other existing commercial arrangements against the minimum purchase commitment. Any wholesale revenue we provide to Sprint in a given year above the minimum purchase commitment for that particular year is credited to the next succeeding year. However, to the extent the revenues we provide Sprint were to fall beneath the applicable commitment amount for any given year, excess revenues from a subsequent year could not be carried back to offset such shortfall.Our obligation to provide the minimum purchase amount for any calendar year is subject to Sprint's compliance with specified covenants in the wholesale agreement. Based upon a review of information provided by us to Sprint, we informed Sprint that certain of those covenants had not been met in 2012 and that, as a result, we were not subject to the minimum purchase commitment for that year. Sprint disputed that assertion. In February 2013, the parties resolved the matter.Other AgreementsOther agreements that we have entered into with significant purchase commitments include our agreements with music content providers that require us to purchase certain minimum amounts of content for our Muve Music service. As we continue to expand the size and scope of our business, we may enter into additional agreements with vendors with significant purchase commitments to enable us to offer enhanced products and services or to obtain more favorable overall purchasing terms and conditions.There are numerous risks and uncertainties that could impact our ability to realize the expected benefits from these arrangements or any new ones we may enter into. We cannot guarantee that customers will accept our products and service offerings at the levels we expect, that prices will not decline to levels below what we have negotiated to pay or that we will be able to satisfy any purchase commitments. We are significantly reducing the number of locations in which we offer our products in the nationwide retail channel 18from approximately 13,000 locations at June 30, 2012 to approximately 5,000 locations by early 2013, which may impact our sales volumes and therefore the amount of services we may purchase under the wholesale agreement. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew these agreements or any future agreement on terms that will be acceptable to us. If we are unable to attract new wireless customers and sell our products and services at the levels we expect, our ability to derive benefits from these agreements or any future agreement we enter into could be limited, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our Significant Indebtedness Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Health and Prevent Us from Fulfilling Our Obligations. We May Be Unable to Refinance Our Indebtedness Prior to Maturity.We have now and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2012, our total outstanding indebtedness was $3,302.5 million, including $400 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement, or the Credit Agreement, $250 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.5% convertible senior notes due 2014, $1,100 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.75% senior secured notes due 2016 and $1,600 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.75% senior notes due 2020.Our significant indebtedness could have material consequences. For example, it could: •make it more difficult for us to service or refinance our debt obligations;•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital needs, capital expenditures, network build-out and other activities, including acquisitions and general corporate purposes;•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and•place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness. Any of these risks could impact our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, any significant capital expenditures or increased operating expenses associated with the launch of new product or service offerings or other business investment initiatives will decrease OIBDA and free cash flow for the periods in which we incur such costs, increasing the risk that we may not be able to service our indebtedness.In addition, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to refinance all or any portion of our indebtedness prior to its maturity. We currently expect that we will need to refinance all or substantially all of our $1.1 billion of senior secured notes due 2016 before they mature. If we are unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness as planned, we will likely be required to take additional actions to generate liquidity such as delaying or reducing capital expenditures, reducing operating expenses, selling assets or seeking additional equity capital. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to enable us to repay or refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.Despite Current Indebtedness Levels, We May Incur Additional Indebtedness, Which Could Further Increase the Risks Associated with Our Leverage. The terms of our Credit Agreement, and the indentures governing Cricket's secured and unsecured senior notes permit us, subject to specified limitations, to incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness. The indenture governing Leap's convertible senior notes does not limit our ability to incur debt. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, as market conditions permit, to enhance our liquidity and to provide us with additional flexibility to pursue business investment initiatives, which could consist of debt financing from the public and/or private credit or capital markets. If new indebtedness is added to our current levels of indebtedness, the related risks that we now face could intensify. In addition, depending on the timing and extent of any additional indebtedness that we could incur and our then-current consolidated leverage ratio, such additional amounts could potentially result in the issuance of adverse credit ratings affecting us and/or our outstanding indebtedness. Any future adverse credit ratings could make it more difficult or expensive for 19us to borrow in the future and could affect the trading prices of our secured and unsecured senior notes, our convertible senior notes and our common stock.Covenants in Our Credit Agreement and Indentures or in Credit Agreements or Indentures That We May Enter into in the Future May Limit Our Ability to Operate Our Business.Our Credit Agreement and the indentures governing Cricket's secured and unsecured senior notes contain covenants that restrict the ability of Leap, Cricket and their restricted subsidiaries to make distributions or other payments to our investors or subordinated creditors unless we satisfy certain financial tests or other criteria. In addition, our Credit Agreement and indentures include covenants restricting, among other things, the ability of Leap, Cricket and their restricted subsidiaries to: •incur additional indebtedness;•create liens or other encumbrances;•place limitations on distributions from restricted subsidiaries;•pay dividends, make investments, prepay subordinated indebtedness or make other restricted payments;•issue or sell capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;•issue guarantees;•sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;•enter into transactions with affiliates; and•make acquisitions or merge or consolidate with another entity. The restrictions in our Credit Agreement and the indentures governing Cricket's secured and unsecured senior notes could limit our ability to make borrowings, obtain debt financing, repurchase stock, refinance or pay principal or interest on our outstanding indebtedness, complete acquisitions for cash or debt or react to changes in our operating environment. Any credit agreement or indenture that we may enter into in the future may have similar or more onerous restrictions. Our Credit Agreement also provides for an event of default upon the occurrence of a change of control, which includes the acquisition of beneficial ownership of 35% or more of Leap's equity securities (other than a transaction where immediately after such transaction Leap will be a wholly owned subsidiary of a person of which no person or group is the beneficial owner of 35% or more of such person's voting stock), a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Leap and its restricted subsidiaries and a change in a majority of the members of Leap's board of directors that is not approved by the board. In addition, under the indentures governing our secured and unsecured senior notes and convertible senior notes, if certain "change of control" events occur, each holder of notes may require us to repurchase all of such holder's notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of secured or unsecured senior notes, or 100% of the principal amount of convertible senior notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. If we default under our Credit Agreement or any of the indentures governing our secured or unsecured senior notes or convertible senior notes because of a covenant breach or otherwise, all outstanding amounts thereunder could become immediately due and payable. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain a waiver should any default occur. Any acceleration of amounts due would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition, and we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds to repay all of the outstanding amounts under our Credit Agreement or the indentures governing our secured and unsecured senior notes and convertible senior notes. If Customer Usage of Our Services Exceeds Our Expectations, Our Costs of Providing Service Could Increase, Which Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Operating Expenses.Because we offer unlimited voice, data, mobile broadband and music download services for a flat monthly rate, our customers' average usage of these services per month is significant. We provide these services through our own Cricket network footprint and through roaming and wholesale agreements that we entered into with other carriers.If customers exceed expected usage for our voice, data, mobile broadband or music download services, we could face capacity problems and our costs of providing the services could increase. Although we own less spectrum in many of our markets than our 20competitors, we seek to design our network to accommodate our expected high rates of usage for our services, and we continue to assess and seek to implement technological improvements to increase the efficiency of our wireless spectrum. We currently manage our network and users of our smartphones and Cricket Broadband service by limiting throughput speeds if usage exceeds certain thresholds. However, if future wireless use by Cricket customers increases faster than we anticipate and exceeds the then-available capacity of our network, service quality may suffer. In addition, our roaming or wholesale costs may be higher than we anticipate. Depending on the extent of customers' future use of our network and the roaming and wholesale services we provide, we may be forced to raise the price or alter the service offerings of our wireless or mobile broadband services, further limit data quantities or speeds, otherwise limit the number of new customers for certain services, acquire additional spectrum or incur substantial additional capital expenditures to enhance network capacity or quality.We May Be Unable to Obtain or Maintain the Roaming and Wholesale Services We Need From Other Carriers to Remain Competitive.Many of our competitors have regional or national networks which enable them to offer automatic roaming services to their subscribers at a lower cost than we can offer. The networks we operate do not, by themselves, provide national coverage and we must pay fees to other carriers who provide roaming and wholesale services to us. We currently rely on roaming agreements with several carriers for the majority of our roaming services and generally on one key carrier for 3G data roaming services. In addition, we recently entered into an agreement with that carrier for 4G data roaming services. We have also entered into a wholesale agreement, which we use to offer Cricket services in nationwide retailers outside of our current network footprint, and we recently amended that agreement to allow us to purchase 4G LTE services. Most of our roaming agreements cover voice but not data services and some of these agreements may be terminated on relatively short notice. In addition, we believe that the rates charged to us by some of these carriers are higher than the rates they charge to certain other roaming partners. The FCC has adopted rules requiring commercial mobile radio service providers to provide automatic roaming for voice and SMS text messaging services on just, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The FCC has also adopted rules generally requiring carriers to offer data roaming services on commercially reasonable terms. These orders, however, do not provide or mandate any specific mechanism for determining the reasonableness of roaming rates and require that roaming complaints be resolved on a case-by-case basis, based on a non-exclusive list of factors that can be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of particular conduct or rates. In addition, the FCC's data roaming order is subject to a petition for reconsideration at the FCC. In light of the current FCC rules, orders and proceedings, if we were unexpectedly to lose the benefit of one or more key roaming or wholesale agreements, we may be unable to obtain similar replacement agreements and as a result may be unable to continue providing nationwide voice and 3G or 4G data roaming services for our customers or may be unable to provide such services on a cost-effective basis. Our inability to obtain new or replacement roaming services on a cost-effective basis may limit our ability to compete effectively for wireless customers, which may increase our churn and decrease our revenues, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The Wireless Industry Is Experiencing Rapid Technological Change; Offering LTE Services Will Require Us to Make Significant Capital Investments and/or Enter Into Partnerships or Joint Ventures with Others. The wireless communications industry continues to experience significant technological change, as evidenced by the ongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology, the development and commercial acceptance of wireless data services, shorter development cycles for new products, and enhancements and changes in end-user requirements and preferences. Our continued success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes and to offer, on a timely basis, services that meet customer demands. Competitors have begun providing competing wireless telecommunications services through the use of next-generation technologies, such as LTE, WiMax and HSPA+. We have covered approximately 21 million POPs with next-generation LTE network technology and are exploring cost-effective ways to deliver LTE services to additional customers, including by deploying facilities-based coverage or by entering into partnerships or joint ventures with other carriers. If we are unable to offer our customers cost-effective LTE services, such failure would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and our business, financial condition and results of operations.Deployment of LTE through facilities-based coverage requires significant capital investment. Capital expenditures for the deployment of LTE are currently anticipated to be less than $10 per covered POP. The extent to which we pursue additional facilities-based LTE coverage and the actual amount we spend to do so will depend upon multiple factors, including the availability of alternatives such as partnerships or joint ventures with others. In addition, we may have unanticipated or unforeseen costs in connection with the deployment of LTE and the maintenance of our network. If we pursue further facilities-based coverage, we expect that we would likely be required over time to acquire or access additional spectrum or take other actions to enable us to provide LTE at service levels that would meet future customer expectations. We currently own an average of 23 MHz of spectrum 21in the markets we operate, which generally includes an initial spectrum reserve that we could use to deploy LTE. The national wireless carriers against which we compete generally have greater spectrum capacity than we do in the markets in which we would launch LTE. Because the efficiency of an LTE network and the peak speeds that it can deliver depend upon the amount of contiguous spectrum that is available, competitors who have access to more spectrum than we do are likely to offer faster speeds for their next-generation services or operate those networks more efficiently than we could. As a result, we may be required to take various actions to meet consumer demand, including acquiring additional spectrum, entering into third-party wholesale or roaming arrangements, leasing additional cell sites, spending additional capital to deploy equipment or other actions. We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions at reasonable costs, on a timely basis or at all.We recently entered into a nationwide roaming agreement for LTE services. In addition, we have also amended our wholesale agreement to enable us to provide LTE services. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain or renew these arrangements or enter into additional agreements on a cost-effective basis. There are also risks that other wireless carriers on whose networks our customers roam may change their technology to other technologies or pursue standards that are incompatible with ours. If these risks materialize, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We cannot predict which of the many possible future technologies, standards, products or services will be important to maintain our competitive position. The evolutionary path that we have selected or may select in the future for LTE or other technologies may not be demanded by customers or provide the advantages that we expect. If such services are not broadly adopted within the industry or commercially accepted by our customers, our revenues and competitive position could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the cost of implementing or competing against alternative or future technological innovations may be prohibitive to us, and we may lose customers if we fail to keep up with these changes.We May Be Unable to Acquire Additional Spectrum in the Future at a Reasonable Cost or on a Timely Basis.We expect that we will likely be required to acquire or access additional spectrum in the future to satisfy increasing demand for data and mobile broadband services, to maintain an acceptable grade of service and to provide or support new services or technologies to meet increasing customer demands. We cannot assure you that additional spectrum will become available at auction or in the after-market at a reasonable cost, or at all, or that we will have sufficient capital resources, or the capacity to raise sufficient capital resources, to acquire additional spectrum that we may require to meet customer demands and remain competitive. In addition, the FCC may impose conditions on the use of new wireless broadband mobile spectrum, such as heightened build-out requirements or open access requirements, which may make it less attractive or uneconomical for us. If we are unable to acquire or obtain access to additional spectrum in the future to meet customer demands, such inability may materially and adversely affect our competitive position and our business, financial condition and results of operations.We Rely Heavily on Third Parties to Provide Specialized Services; a Failure or Inability by Such Parties to Provide the Agreed Upon Products or Services Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.We depend heavily on suppliers and contractors with specialized expertise in order for us to efficiently operate our business. Generally, there are multiple sources for the types of products and services we purchase or use. However, we currently rely on one key vendor for billing services, a single vendor to support the platform for our Muve Music service, a single vendor for the operation of our network operations center, a limited number of vendors for voice and data communications transport services and a limited number of vendors for payment processing services. We have also entered into an inventory logistics and supply chain outsourcing arrangement with a third party to manage the planning, purchasing and fulfillment of handsets and other devices. We have also recently entered into new outsourcing agreements to transition various network operations, IT and service desk functions to new vendors.In the past, our suppliers, contractors and third-party retailers have not always performed at the levels we expect or at the levels required by their contracts. If key suppliers, contractors, service providers or third-party retailers fail to comply with their contracts, fail to meet our performance expectations or refuse or are unable to supply or provide services to us in the future, or if we experience delays, disruptions or service degradation during any transition to a new outsourcing provider or other vendor, our business could be severely disrupted. In addition, the costs and time lags that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier or service provider to another could cause further disruptions if we were required to replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers or service providers with those from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.22Risks Associated With Wireless Devices Could Pose Product Liability, Health and Safety Risks That Could Adversely Affect Our Business. We do not manufacture devices or other equipment sold by us and generally rely on our suppliers to provide us with safe equipment. Our suppliers are required by applicable law to manufacture their devices to meet certain governmentally imposed safety criteria. However, even if the devices we sell meet the regulatory safety criteria, we could be held liable with the equipment manufacturers and suppliers for any harm caused by products we sell if such products are later found to have design or manufacturing defects. We generally seek to enter into indemnification agreements with the manufacturers who supply us with devices to protect us from direct losses associated with product liability, but we cannot guarantee that we will be fully protected against all losses associated with a product that is found to be defective. Media reports have suggested that the use of wireless handsets may be linked to various health concerns, including cancer, and may interfere with various electronic medical devices, including hearing aids and pacemakers. Certain class action lawsuits have been filed in the industry claiming damages for alleged health problems arising from the use of wireless handsets. We are currently a defendant in a matter brought by an individual alleging that one of our wireless handsets caused brain cancer. The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research of Cancer has also stated that exposure to wireless handsets may be carcinogenic. In addition, interest groups have requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags, anti-lock brakes, hearing aids and other medical devices, and the FCC recently indicated that it plans to gather additional data regarding wireless handset emissions. The media has also reported incidents of handset battery malfunction, including reports of batteries that have overheated. Concerns over possible health and safety risks associated with radio frequency emissions and defective products may discourage the use of wireless handsets, which could decrease demand for our services, or result in regulatory restrictions or increased requirements on the location and operation of cell sites, which could increase our operating expenses. Concerns over possible safety risks could decrease the demand for our services. If one or more Cricket customers were harmed by a defective product provided to us by a manufacturer and subsequently sold in connection with our services, our ability to add and maintain customers for Cricket service could be materially adversely affected by negative public reactions. There also are some safety risks associated with the use of wireless devices while operating vehicles or equipment. Concerns over these safety risks and the effect of any legislation, rules or regulations that have been and may be adopted in response to these risks could limit our ability to sell our wireless service. System Failures, Security Breaches, Business Disruptions and Unauthorized Use or Interference with Our Network or Other Systems Could Result in Higher Churn, Reduced Revenue and Increased Costs, and Could Harm Our Reputation.Our network and information technology (IT) infrastructure and the infrastructure of our vendors (including systems supporting service activation, billing, point of sale, inventory management, customer care and financial reporting) are vulnerable to damage and disruption from technology failures, power surges or outages, system or equipment failures, natural disasters, fires, human error, hacking and cyber attacks, computer viruses, terrorism, intentional wrongdoing and similar events. In particular, cyber attacks on companies have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. Any such failure, damage or disruption could affect the quality of our services, cause network service interruptions and result in material remediation costs, litigation, higher churn, reduced revenue, increased costs and lost market share. Unauthorized access to or use of customer or account information, including credit card or other personal data, could also result in harm to our customers and legal actions against us, and could damage our reputation. In addition, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, fires and other unforeseen natural disasters or events could materially disrupt our business operations or the provision of Cricket service in one or more markets. In the past, our operations in certain markets have been adversely affected by hurricanes and related weather systems. Costs we incur to restore, repair or replace our network or IT infrastructure, as well as costs associated with detecting, monitoring or reducing the incidence of unauthorized use and other security breaches, may be substantial and increase our cost of providing service. Any failure in, damage to or disruption of our or our vendors' network and IT infrastructure could also materially impact our ability to timely and accurately record, process and report information important to our business. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of the above events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. If any of the above events were to occur, we could experience higher churn, reduced revenues, increased costs and reputational harm, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We Have Upgraded a Number of Significant Business Systems, Including Our Customer Billing System, and Any Unanticipated Difficulties, Delays or Interruptions Could Negatively Impact Our Business.During recent years, we have upgraded a number of our significant, internal business systems, including implementing a new customer billing system, a new inventory management system and a new point-of-sale system.23The implementation of significant new systems often involves delays and disruptions in connection with the transition to and operation of the new systems. From time to time after the launch of our customer billing system in the second quarter of 2011, we experienced intermittent disruptions with certain aspects of the system, which limited our ability to activate new customers and to provide account services to current customers. We believe that these system issues had the effect of reducing our gross customer additions and increasing churn. Although we believe that we largely identified and remedied the causes of these disruptions, we cannot assure you that we will not experience additional disruptions with our customer billing system in the future. Future significant difficulties in operating our customer billing system or other new systems could materially impact our ability to attract and retain customers or to timely and accurately record, process and report information that is important to our business. If any of the above events were to occur, we could experience decreased gross customer additions, higher churn, reduced revenues and increased costs or could suffer a material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, any of which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we cannot guarantee that our new systems will improve our business operations, including our ability to manage and control device inventories. We implemented the inventory management system to assist us with the planning, purchasing and fulfillment of handsets and other devices. Prior to entering into this arrangement, we experienced inventory shortages from time to time, most notably with certain of our strongest-selling devices, and these shortages had the effect of limiting customer activity. There can be no assurance that this new agreement will improve device inventory management or that we will not experience inventory shortages in the future. Any failure to effectively manage and control our device inventories could adversely affect our ability to gain new customers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We May Not Be Successful in Protecting and Enforcing Our Intellectual Property Rights.We rely on a combination of patent, service mark, trademark, and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which offer only limited protection. We endeavor to enter into agreements with our employees and contractors and agreements with parties with whom we do business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. Despite our efforts, the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary rights. Moreover, others may independently develop processes and technologies that are competitive to ours. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights may depend on any legal actions that we undertake against such infringers being successful, but we cannot be sure that any such actions will be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. We cannot assure you that our pending, or any future, patent applications will be granted, that any existing or future patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, that any existing or future patents will be enforceable, or that the rights granted under any patent that may issue will provide us with any competitive advantages. In addition, we cannot assure you that any trademark or service mark registrations will be issued with respect to pending or future applications or that any registered trademarks or service marks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our brands. Our inability to secure trademark or service mark protection with respect to our brands could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We Use Equipment, Software, Technology and Content in the Operation of Our Business, Which May Subject Us to Third-Party Infringement Claims. The technologies used in the telecommunications industry are protected by and subject to a wide array of patents and other intellectual property rights. As a result, third parties have asserted and may in the future assert infringement claims against us or our suppliers based on our or their general business operations and the equipment, software, technology or other content that we or they use or provide. Due in part to the expansion and development of our business operations, we have become subject to increased amounts of litigation, including disputes alleging patent and other intellectual property infringement relating to the operation of our networks and our sale of handsets and other devices. If plaintiffs in any patent litigation that may be brought against us were to prevail, we could be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs, and we could be required to alter the way we conduct business to avoid future infringement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, we rely on third-party intellectual property and digital content to provide certain of our wireless services to customers, including Muve Music, an unlimited music download service we offer that is designed specifically for mobile handsets. The Muve Music service requires us to license music and other intellectual property rights of third parties. We cannot guarantee that these licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our licensing arrangements with these third parties are generally short-term in nature and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Our inability to continue to offer customers a wide variety of content at reasonable costs to us could limit the success of our Muve Music service. In addition, we could become subject to infringement claims and potential liability for damages or 24royalties related to music and intellectual property rights of third parties, including as a result of any unauthorized access to the third-party content we have licensed.We generally seek to enter into indemnification agreements with the manufacturers, licensors and vendors who provide us with the equipment, software and technology that we use in our business to help protect us against possible infringement claims. However, we do not have indemnification arrangements with all of our partners and suppliers. In addition, to the extent that there is an indemnification arrangement in place, depending on the nature and scope of a possible claim, we may not be entitled to seek indemnification under the terms of the agreement. We also cannot guarantee that the financial condition of an indemnifying party would be sufficient to protect us against all losses associated with infringement claims or that we would be fully indemnified against all possible losses associated with a possible claim. In addition, our suppliers may be subject to infringement claims that could prevent or make it more expensive for them to supply us with the products and services we require to run our business, which could have the effect of slowing or limiting our ability to introduce products and services to our customers. Moreover, we may be subject to claims that products, software and services provided by different vendors, which we combine to offer our services may infringe the rights of third parties, and we may not have any indemnification from our vendors for these claims. Whether or not an infringement claim against us or a supplier is valid or successful, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations by diverting management attention, involving us in costly and time-consuming litigation, requiring us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements (which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all) or requiring us to redesign our business operations or systems to avoid claims of infringement. In addition, infringement claims against our suppliers could also require us to purchase products and services at higher prices or from different suppliers and could adversely affect our business by delaying our ability to offer certain products and services to our customers.Action by Congress or Government Agencies and Regulatory Requirements May Increase Our Costs of Providing Service or Require Us to Change Our Services.The FCC regulates the licensing, construction, modification, operation, ownership, sale and interconnection of wireless communications systems, as do some state and local regulatory agencies. We cannot assure you that the FCC or any state or local agencies having jurisdiction over our business will not adopt regulations or take other enforcement or other actions that would adversely affect our business, impose new costs or require changes in current or planned operations. In addition, state regulatory agencies are increasingly focused on the quality of service and support that wireless carriers provide to their customers and several agencies have proposed or enacted new and potentially burdensome regulations in this area. We also cannot assure you that Congress will not amend the Communications Act, from which the FCC obtains its authority, or enact other legislation in a manner that could be adverse to us. Under existing law, no more than 20% of an FCC licensee's capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, or voted by non-U.S. citizens or their representatives, by a foreign government or its representatives or by a foreign corporation. If an FCC licensee is controlled by another entity (as is the case with Leap's ownership and control of subsidiaries that hold FCC licenses), up to 25% of that entity's capital stock may be owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or their representatives, by a foreign government or its representatives or by a foreign corporation. Foreign ownership above the 25% holding company level may be allowed if the FCC finds such higher levels consistent with the public interest. The FCC has ruled that higher levels of foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public interest with respect to investors from certain nations. If our foreign ownership were to exceed the permitted level, the FCC could revoke our wireless licenses, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we could seek a declaratory ruling from the FCC allowing the foreign ownership or could take other actions to reduce our foreign ownership percentage in order to avoid the loss of our licenses, we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such a ruling or that any other actions we may take would be successful. In addition, legislative or regulatory action could be taken, which could limit our ability to use certain foreign vendors to supply us with equipment, materials or other services that we use in our business operations. For example, we previously purchased network equipment from a Chinese company, which is currently used to support approximately 20% of our covered POPs. Members of the U.S. Congress and certain regulatory agencies have raised concerns about American companies purchasing equipment and software from Chinese telecommunications companies, including concerns relating to alleged violations of intellectual property rights by Chinese companies and potential security risks posed by U.S. companies purchasing technical equipment and software from Chinese companies. In October 2012, the U.S. House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence issued a report asserting that network equipment manufactured by Chinese telecommunications companies poses a security threat to the United States and recommending the use of other network vendors. The report also recommends that Congress consider adopting legislation to address the purported risk posed by telecommunications companies with nation-state ties. Any legislative or regulatory requirement that restricts us from purchasing or utilizing equipment or software from Chinese or other foreign companies, or any determination that we otherwise make that it is advantageous for us to cease doing so, could require changes in our equipment procurement activities and business operations.25The DMCA prohibits the circumvention of technological measures or access controls employed by or on behalf of copyright owners to protect their copyrighted works. However, under the DMCA, the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress, or the Copyright Office, has the authority to exempt for three-year periods certain circumventing activities that might otherwise be prohibited by the statute. In July 2010, the Copyright Office granted an exemption to the DMCA to allow the circumvention of software locks and other firmware that prohibit a wireless handset from connecting to a wireless network when such circumvention is accomplished for the sole purpose of lawfully connecting the handset to another network. This exemption permitted locked handsets purchased from one wireless carrier to be unlocked and then activated on another carrier's network. On October 28, 2012, the Copyright Office issued a new exemption under the DMCA, which only permits the circumvention of software locks on handsets purchased before January 26, 2013. In order for locked devices purchased after this date to be connected to another carrier's network, the customer must obtain the prior carrier's consent to unlock the device. This new, narrowed exemption, and any further modification of the DMCA copyright exemption, could impact our ability to attract and activate new customers, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.We participate in the federal government's Lifeline program, which provides support from the USF to subsidize discounted telecommunications services for qualified low-income consumers. In order to participate in the Lifeline program in any given state, a carrier must be designated as an ETC in that state. As of December 31, 2012, Cricket had been designated as an ETC in 27 states and the District of Columbia. In January 2012, the FCC adopted an order regarding the Lifeline program, the stated purpose of which is to streamline the administration of the program and to implement measures to curb perceived waste, fraud and abuse in the program. In addition, various states are considering or enacting rules with similar stated purposes as the FCC order. In connection with the FCC's order, among other things, we are required to have our Lifeline customers re-certify on an annual basis their eligibility to participate in the program. These requirements could result in the loss of Lifeline customers and associated funding from the USF if these customers fail to meet the FCC's eligibility standards or fail to respond to requests to re-certify their eligibility. Further, the FCC is developing a National Lifeline Accountability Database, the primary purpose of which will be to validate the identity of Lifeline customers and prevent Lifeline support from being provided to more than one eligible recipient per household in accordance with FCC regulations. While the timing of the deployment of the database is uncertain, its implementation and use could reduce the number of customers we could enroll in our Lifeline programs and thus reduce the amount of Lifeline funding we receive. In addition, the FCC could pursue enforcement action against us and impose monetary penalties if it were to conclude that we violated any of the Lifeline rules. In addition, future action by Congress, the FCC, or the states in which we have been designated as an ETC could reduce or eliminate the amount of Lifeline funding we receive for providing wireless service to certain qualifying low income customers, which could result in the loss of subscribers and the associated service revenue.We previously invested in various entities that qualified as "very small business" designated entities under FCC regulations. The FCC's rules restricted our ability to acquire controlling membership interests in designated entities during the period that such entities were required to maintain their eligibility as a designated entity. The FCC has implemented rules and policies to ensure that only legitimate small businesses benefit from the designated entity program, and that such small businesses are not controlled or manipulated by larger wireless carriers or other investors that do not meet the small business qualification tests. For example, designated entity structures are subject to a requirement that they seek approval for any event that might affect their ongoing eligibility (for example, changes in agreements that the FCC has previously reviewed), annual reporting requirements and a commitment by the FCC to audit each designated entity at least once during the license term. In addition, third parties and the federal government have in the past challenged certain designated entity structures, alleging violations of federal qui tam and other laws and seeking significant monetary damages. If we previously failed to comply with the FCC's designated entity rules, any such failure could lead to fines, and in extreme cases, license revocation, third-party lawsuits and/or criminal penalties. Federal court litigation surrounding designated entity structures, increased regulatory scrutiny or third party or government lawsuits with respect to our prior investments in designated entities could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We also are subject, or potentially subject, to numerous additional rules and requirements, including universal service obligations; number portability requirements; number pooling rules; rules governing billing, subscriber privacy and customer proprietary network information; roaming obligations; rules that require wireless service providers to configure their networks to facilitate electronic surveillance by law enforcement officials; rate averaging and integration requirements; rules governing spam, telemarketing and truth-in-billing; and rules requiring us to offer equipment and services that are accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, among others. There are also pending proceedings exploring the imposition of various types of nondiscrimination, open access and broadband management obligations on our devices and networks; the prohibition of device exclusivity; the possible re-imposition of bright-line spectrum aggregation requirements; further regulation of special access used for wireless backhaul services; and the effects of the siting of communications towers on migratory birds, among others. Some of these requirements and pending proceedings (of which the foregoing examples are not an exhaustive list) pose technical and operational challenges to which we, and the industry as a whole, have not yet developed clear solutions. These requirements 26generally are the subject of pending FCC or judicial proceedings, and we are unable to predict how they may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, certain states in which we provide service are considering legislation that would require companies selling prepaid wireless services to verify a customer's identity using government identification. Although we request identification from new customers, we currently do not require them to provide identification in order to initiate service with us, and such a requirement could adversely impact our ability to attract new customers for our services. Our operations are subject to various other laws and regulations, including those regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, other federal agencies and state and local regulatory agencies and legislative bodies. Adverse decisions or regulations of these regulatory bodies could negatively impact our operations and costs of doing business. Because of our smaller size, legislation or governmental regulations and orders can significantly increase our costs and affect our competitive position compared to other larger telecommunications providers. We are unable to predict the scope, pace or financial impact of regulations and other policy changes that could be adopted by the various governmental entities that oversee portions of our business.Our Wireless Licenses Are Subject to Renewal and May Be Revoked in the Event That We Violate Applicable Laws.Our existing wireless licenses are subject to renewal upon the expiration of the 10-year or 15-year period for which they are granted, which renewal period commenced for some of our PCS wireless licenses in 2006. The FCC will award renewal expectancy to a wireless licensee that timely files a renewal application, has provided substantial service during its past license term and has substantially complied with applicable FCC rules and policies and the Communications Act. Historically, the FCC has approved our license renewal applications. However, the Communications Act provides that licenses may be revoked for cause and license renewal applications denied if the FCC determines that a renewal would not serve the public interest. In addition, if we fail to timely file to renew any wireless license, or fail to meet any regulatory requirements for renewal, including construction and substantial service requirements, we could be denied a license renewal. Many of our wireless licenses are subject to interim or final construction requirements and there is no guarantee that the FCC will find our construction, or the construction of prior licensees, sufficient to meet the build-out or renewal requirements. FCC rules provide that applications competing with a license renewal application may be considered in comparative hearings, and establish the qualifications for competing applications and the standards to be applied in hearings. The FCC has pending a rulemaking proceeding to re-evaluate, among other things, its wireless license renewal showings and standards and may in this or other proceedings promulgate changes or additional substantial requirements or conditions to its renewal rules, including revising license build-out requirements. We cannot assure you that the FCC will renew our wireless licenses upon their expiration. If any of our wireless licenses were to be revoked or not renewed upon expiration, we would not be permitted to provide services under that license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our recently-purchased 700 MHz A block license in Chicago is subject to a December 13, 2013 interim construction deadline. While we have been engaged in the first stages of development of this license to supplement our existing wireless capacity in this market, we must coordinate with the incumbent broadcaster on DTV Channel 51 in order to commence operations, and we may be delayed in our ultimate ability to construct facilities and operate on this spectrum. We thus expect to seek relief from the FCC from the interim construction benchmark and/or ask the FCC for relief from DTV interference protection requirements. If we are required to seek these types of relief from the FCC, it could delay or impede our ability to expand our service capacity in the Chicago market. Wireless Licenses Comprise a Significant Portion of our Assets; Future Declines in the Fair Value of Our Licenses Could Result in Impairment Charges.As of December 31, 2012, the carrying value of our wireless licenses (excluding assets held for sale) was approximately $1.9 billion. These assets by their nature, however, may not be readily saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in their liquidation. For example, prior FCC approval is required in order for us to sell, or for any remedies to be exercised by our lenders with respect to, our wireless licenses, and obtaining such approval could result in significant delays and reduce the proceeds obtained from the sale or other disposition of our wireless licenses. In addition, the amount that we could realize upon any sale of our wireless licenses could materially differ from their carrying value. Valuation swings could occur for a variety of reasons relating to supply and demand, including consolidation in the wireless industry that allows or requires carriers to sell significant portions of their spectrum holdings, a sudden, large sale of spectrum by one or more carriers, or a decline in market prices as a result of the sale prices in FCC auctions.We assess potential impairments to our indefinite-lived intangible assets, including our wireless licenses, annually during the third quarter of each year. We also evaluate on a quarterly basis whether any triggering events or changes in circumstances have 27occurred subsequent to the annual impairment test that would indicate an impairment condition exists. We estimate the fair value of our wireless licenses primarily on available market prices, including successful bid prices in FCC auctions and selling prices observed in wireless license transactions, pricing trends among historical wireless license transactions, our spectrum holdings within a given market relative to other carriers' holdings and qualitative demographic and economic information concerning the areas that comprise our markets. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we recorded impairment charges of $0.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively, with respect to our wireless licenses. A significant impairment loss in any future period could have a material adverse effect on our operating income and on the carrying value of our wireless licenses on our balance sheet.We Are Subject to Numerous Surcharges, Taxes and Fees from Federal, State and Local Governments, and the Applicability and Amount of These Fees Can Be Uncertain. We calculate and remit surcharges, taxes and fees to numerous federal, state and local jurisdictions in connection with the services we provide. These fees include federal USF fees and common carrier regulatory fees. In addition, many state and local governments impose various surcharges, taxes and fees on our activities, including with respect to sales of our products and services and to our purchases of telecommunications services from various carriers. In many cases, the applicability and method of calculating these surcharges, taxes and fees may be uncertain, and our calculation, assessment and remittance of these amounts may be contested. In the event that we have incorrectly assessed and remitted amounts that were due, we could be subject to fines and penalties, which could materially impact our financial condition. In addition, although we remit applicable surcharges, taxes and fees that are due with respect to the services we provide, we do not recover these amounts (other than sales taxes) as additional charges from customers subscribing to our "all-inclusive" service plans, which are priced to include telecommunications taxes and certain other fees. In the event that federal, state and/or local municipalities were to significantly increase taxes and regulatory fees on our services or seek to impose new ones, it could have a significant adverse effect on our margins and financial and operational results.We May Incur Higher Than Anticipated Intercarrier Compensation Costs. When our customers use our service to call customers of local exchange carriers, we are required under the current intercarrier compensation scheme to pay the carrier that serves the called party, and any intermediary or transit carrier, for the use of their networks. While in most cases we have been successful in negotiating agreements with other carriers that impose reasonable reciprocal compensation arrangements, some local exchange carriers have claimed a right to unilaterally impose what we believe to be unreasonably high charges on us. Some of these carriers have threatened to pursue, have initiated, or may in the future initiate, claims against us to recover these charges, and the outcome of any such claims is uncertain. The FCC has been considering whether a unified intercarrier compensation regime can or should be established for all traffic exchanged between carriers, including commercial mobile radio services carriers. The FCC has instituted a uniform, national bill-and-keep framework for telecommunications traffic exchanged with a local exchange carrier, which will be phased in under a multi-year transition period. There are also various other pending proceedings in the courts, at the FCC and before state regulatory bodies that may affect intercarrier compensation. New or modified intercarrier compensation rules, federal or state proceedings implementing or interpreting those rules and other judicial or regulatory decisions may increase the charges we are required to pay other carriers for terminating calls or transiting calls over telecommunications networks, increase the costs of, or make it more difficult to negotiate, new agreements with carriers, decrease the amount of revenue we receive for terminating calls from other carriers on our network, or result in significant costs to us for past and future termination charges. Any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We resell third party long distance services in connection with our offering of unlimited international long distance service. The charges for these services may be subject to change by the terminating or interconnecting carrier, or by the regulatory body having jurisdiction in the applicable foreign country. If the charges are modified, the terminating or interconnecting carrier may attempt to assess such charges retroactively on us or our third party international long distance provider. If such charges are substantial, or we cease providing service to the foreign destination, prospective customers may elect not to use our service and current customers may choose to terminate service. Such events could limit our ability to grow our customer base, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. If We Experience High Rates of Credit Card, Subscription or Dealer Fraud, Our Ability to Generate Cash Flow Will Decrease.Our operating costs could increase substantially as a result of fraud, including customer credit card, subscription or dealer fraud. We have implemented a number of strategies and processes to detect and prevent efforts to defraud us, and we believe that our efforts have substantially reduced the types of fraud we have identified. However, if our strategies are not successful in detecting 28and controlling fraud, the resulting loss of revenue or increased expenses could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.The Loss of Key Personnel and Difficulty Attracting, Integrating and Retaining Qualified Personnel Could Harm Our Business. We believe our success depends heavily on the contributions of our employees and on attracting, motivating and retaining our officers and other management and technical personnel. We do not, however, generally provide employment contracts to our employees. If we are unable to attract and retain the qualified employees that we need, our business may be harmed. Our business is managed by a small number of key executive officers, including our CEO, S. Douglas Hutcheson. In February 2012, we hired Robert A. Strickland as our executive vice president and chief technical officer. In May 2012, we hired Jerry V. Elliott as our executive vice president and CFO and in November 2012 appointed him as president and chief operating officer. In November 2012, we hired R. Perley McBride as our executive vice president and CFO.As several members of senior management have been hired recently, it may take time to fully integrate these individuals into their new roles. In addition, if we were to lose the services of key individuals in the future, any such departures could materially and adversely impact how we manage and operate our business. We may also have difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel in future periods, particularly if we were to experience poor operating or financial performance. Our Ability to Use Our Net Operating Loss Carryforwards to Reduce Future Possible Tax Payments Could Be Negatively Impacted if There Is an "Ownership Change" (as Defined Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code); Our Tax Benefit Preservation Plan May Not Be Effective to Prevent an Ownership Change. We have substantial federal and state net operating losses, or NOLs, for income tax purposes. Subject to certain requirements, we may "carry forward" our federal NOLs for up to 20 years to offset future taxable income and reduce our income tax liability. For state income tax purposes, the NOL carryforward period ranges from five to 20 years. During the year ended December 31, 2012, $37.2 million of our state NOLs expired. At December 31, 2012, we had federal and state NOLs of approximately $2.6 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively (which begin to expire in 2022 for federal income tax purposes and of which $69.8 million will expire at the end of 2013 for state income tax purposes). While these NOL carryforwards have a potential to be used to offset future ordinary taxable income and reduce future cash tax liabilities by approximately $1.0 billion, our ability to utilize these NOLs will depend upon the availability of future taxable income during the carryforward period and, as such, there is no assurance we will be able to realize such tax savings. Our ability to utilize NOLs could be further limited if we were to experience an "ownership change," as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. In general terms, an ownership change can occur whenever there is a cumulative shift in the ownership of a company by more than 50 percentage points by one or more "5% stockholders" within a three-year period. The occurrence of such a change in our ownership would generally limit the amount of NOL carryforwards we could utilize in a given year to the aggregate fair market value of Leap common stock immediately prior to the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt interest rate in effect for the month of the ownership change. The determination of whether an ownership change has occurred for purposes of Section 382 is complex and requires significant judgment. The occurrence of such an ownership change would accelerate cash tax payments we would be required to make and likely result in a substantial portion of our NOLs expiring before we could fully utilize them. As a result, any restriction on our ability to utilize these NOL carryforwards could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and future cash flows. On August 30, 2011, our board of directors adopted a Tax Benefit Preservation Plan to help deter acquisitions of Leap common stock that could result in an ownership change under Section 382 and thus help preserve our ability to use our NOL carryforwards. The Tax Benefit Preservation Plan was approved by our stockholders in May 2012. The Tax Benefit Preservation Plan is designed to deter acquisitions of Leap common stock that would result in a stockholder owning 4.99% or more of Leap common stock (as calculated under Section 382), or any existing holder of 4.99% or more of Leap common stock acquiring additional shares, by substantially diluting the ownership interest of any such stockholder unless the stockholder obtains an exemption from our board of directors. Because the number of shares of Leap common stock outstanding at any particular time for purposes of the Tax Benefit Preservation Plan is determined in accordance with Section 382, it may differ from the number of shares that we report as outstanding in our SEC filings. Although the Tax Benefit Preservation Plan is intended to reduce the likelihood of an adverse ownership change under Section 382, the Tax Benefit Preservation Plan may not prevent such an ownership change from occurring and does not protect 29against all transactions that could cause an ownership change, such as sales of Leap common stock by certain greater than 5% stockholders or transactions that occurred prior to the adoption of the Tax Benefit Preservation Plan. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that an ownership change under Section 382 will not occur and significantly limit the use of our NOLs. Our Business and Stock Price May Be Adversely Affected if Our Internal Controls Are Not Effective.Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires companies to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, each year we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting; our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting; and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In our quarterly and annual reports (as amended) for the periods ended from December 31, 2006 through September 30, 2008, we reported a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which related to the design of controls over the preparation and review of the account reconciliations and analysis of revenues, cost of revenues and deferred revenues, and ineffective testing of changes made to our revenue and billing systems in connection with the introduction or modification of service offerings. In addition, we previously reported that certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting existed at various times during the period from September 30, 2004 through September 30, 2006. These material weaknesses included excessive turnover and inadequate staffing levels in our accounting, financial reporting and tax departments, weaknesses in the preparation of our income tax provision, and weaknesses in our application of lease-related accounting principles, fresh-start reporting oversight, and account reconciliation procedures. Although we believe we took appropriate actions to remediate the control deficiencies we identified and to strengthen our internal control over financial reporting, we cannot assure you that we will not discover other material weaknesses in the future or that no material weakness will result from any difficulties, errors, delays or disruptions while we implement and transition to significant new internal systems, including the recent transition to our new customer billing system. The existence of one or more material weaknesses could result in errors in our financial statements, and substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify these or other internal control deficiencies. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the market price of Leap common stock could decline significantly, we may be unable to obtain additional financing to operate and expand our business, and our business and financial condition could be harmed.Related to Ownership of Leap Common Stock Our Stock Price May Be Volatile, and You May Lose All or Some of Your Investment. The trading prices of the securities of telecommunications companies have been highly volatile. Accordingly, the trading price of Leap common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the trading price of Leap common stock may include, among other things:•variations in our operating results or those of our competitors;•announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;•entry of new competitors into our markets, changes in product and service offerings by us or our competitors, changes in the prices charged for product and service offerings by us or our competitors, or changes or upgrades in the network technologies used by us or our competitors;•the commencement of or significant developments with respect to intellectual property or other litigation;•announcements of and bidding in auctions for new spectrum;•recruitment or departure of key personnel;•changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow Leap common stock, or changes in our credit ratings or those of our competitors;•changes in the levels of our indebtedness;30•any default under our Credit Agreement or any of the indentures governing our secured or unsecured senior notes or convertible senior notes because of a covenant breach or otherwise;•rumors or speculation in the marketplace regarding acquisitions or consolidation in our industry, including regarding transactions involving Leap; and•market conditions in our industry and the economy as a whole. The occurrence of any one or more of these events could significantly impact the trading price of Leap common stock, and you could lose all or some of your investment.Our Directors and Affiliated Entities Have Substantial Influence over Our Affairs, and Our Ownership Is Highly Concentrated. Sales of a Significant Number of Shares by Large Stockholders May Adversely Affect the Market Price of Leap Common Stock.Our directors and entities affiliated with them beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 30% of Leap common stock as of February 1, 2013. Moreover, our five largest stockholders and entities affiliated with them beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 65% of Leap common stock as of February 1, 2013. These stockholders have the ability to exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders. These stockholders will be able to influence the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of Leap's assets and other matters. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or impeding a merger or consolidation, takeover or other business combination. Our resale shelf registration statements register for resale 23,533,869 shares of Leap common stock held by entities affiliated with one of our directors, or approximately 30% of Leap's outstanding common stock as of February 1, 2013. We have also agreed to register for resale any additional shares of common stock that these entities or their affiliates acquire. We are unable to predict the potential effect that sales into the market of any material portion of such shares, or any of the other shares held by our other large stockholders and entities affiliated with them, may have on the then-prevailing market price of Leap common stock. If any of Leap's stockholders cause a large number of securities to be sold in the public market, these sales could reduce the trading price of Leap common stock. These sales could also impede our ability to raise future capital.We Could Elect to Raise Additional Equity Capital, Which Could Dilute Existing Stockholders.During the second quarter of 2009 we sold 7,000,000 shares of Leap common stock in an underwritten public offering. We could raise additional capital in the future, as market conditions permit, to enhance our liquidity and to provide us with additional flexibility to pursue business investment initiatives. Any additional capital we could raise could be significant and could consist of debt, convertible debt or equity financing from the public and/or private credit or capital markets. To the extent that we were to elect to raise equity capital, this financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us and could be dilutive to existing stockholders. In addition, these sales could reduce the trading price of Leap common stock and impede our ability to raise future capital.Your Ownership Interest in Leap Will Be Diluted upon Issuance of Shares We Have Reserved for Future Issuances, and Future Issuances or Sales of Such Shares May Adversely Affect the Market Price of Leap Common Stock. As of February 1, 2013, 79,134,930 shares of Leap common stock were issued and outstanding, and 5,508,696 additional shares of Leap common stock were reserved for issuance, including 3,444,075 shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and deferred stock units under our 2004 Stock Option, Restricted Stock and Deferred Stock Unit Plan, as amended, 1,476,488 shares of common stock available for future issuance under our 2004 Stock Option, Restricted Stock and Deferred Stock Unit Plan, 483,225 shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options under our 2009 Employment Inducement Equity Incentive Plan, 65,612 shares of common stock available for future issuance under our 2009 Employment Inducement Equity Incentive Plan, and 39,296 shares available for future issuance under our Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan. On December 19, 2012, our board of directors approved an amendment to the Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan to add 400,000 shares for issuance thereunder, subject to, and contingent upon, the approval of our stockholders, which approval will be requested at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 2013. Leap has also reserved up to 4,761,000 shares of its common stock for issuance upon conversion of its $250 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2014. Holders may convert their notes into shares of Leap common stock at any time on or prior to the third scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date of the notes, July 15, 2014. If, at the time of conversion, 31the applicable stock price of Leap common stock is less than or equal to approximately $93.21 per share, the notes will be convertible into 10.7290 shares of Leap common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the notes (referred to as the "base conversion rate"), subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. If, at the time of conversion, the applicable stock price of Leap common stock exceeds approximately $93.21 per share, the conversion rate will be determined pursuant to a formula based on the base conversion rate and an incremental share factor of 8.3150 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, subject to adjustment. At an applicable stock price of approximately $93.21 per share, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon full conversion of the convertible senior notes would be 2,682,250 shares. Upon the occurrence of a "make-whole fundamental change" of Leap under the indenture, under certain circumstances the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon full conversion of the convertible senior notes would be 4,761,000 shares. In addition, we have registered all shares of common stock that we may issue under our 2004 Stock Option, Restricted Stock and Deferred Stock Unit Plan, under our 2009 Employment Inducement Equity Incentive Plan and under our Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan. When we issue shares under these stock plans, they can be freely sold in the public market after the recipient satisfies any vesting period applicable to the shares. If any of Leap's stockholders causes a large number of securities to be sold in the public market, these sales could reduce the trading price of Leap common stock. These sales also could impede our ability to raise future capital. Provisions in Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, under Delaware Law, in Our Credit Agreement and Indentures, or in Our Tax Benefit Preservation Plan Might Discourage, Delay or Prevent a Change in Control of Our Company or Changes in Our Management and, Therefore, Depress the Trading Price of Leap Common Stock.Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of Leap common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that our stockholders may deem advantageous. These provisions:•require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws;•authorize the issuance of "blank check" preferred stock that our board of directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares to discourage a takeover attempt;•prohibit stockholder action by written consent, and require that all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;•provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and•establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any "interested" stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an "interested" stockholder and which may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. In addition, under the indentures governing our secured and unsecured senior notes and convertible senior notes, if certain "change of control" events occur, each holder of notes may require us to repurchase all of such holder's notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of secured or unsecured senior notes, or 100% of the principal amount of convertible senior notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, our Credit Agreement provides for an event of default upon the occurrence of a change of control. See "Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -Liquidity and Capital Resources" of this report. On August 30, 2011, our board of directors adopted a Tax Benefit Preservation Plan as a measure intended to help deter acquisitions of Leap common stock that could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and thus help preserve our ability to use our NOL carryforwards. The Tax Benefit Preservation Plan was approved by our stockholders in May 2012. The Tax Benefit Preservation Plan is designed to deter acquisitions of Leap common stock that would result in a stockholder owning 4.99% or more of Leap common stock (as calculated under Section 382), or any existing holder of 4.99% or more of Leap common stock acquiring additional shares, by substantially diluting the ownership interest of any such stockholder unless the stockholder obtains an exemption from our board of directors. Because the Tax Benefit Preservation Plan may restrict a stockholder's ability to acquire Leap common stock, it could discourage a tender offer for Leap common stock or make it more 32difficult for a third party to acquire a controlling position in our stock without our approval, and the liquidity and market value of Leap common stock may be adversely affected while the Tax Benefit Preservation Plan is in effect.
