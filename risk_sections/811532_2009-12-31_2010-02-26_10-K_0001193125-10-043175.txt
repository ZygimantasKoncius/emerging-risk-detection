ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Risks Related to Our Business The consummation of our proposed merger with affiliates of Apollo is not certain, and its delay or failure could adversely affect our business and the price of our units. Completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction of various conditions, including adoption of the merger by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of our outstanding units. We cannot guarantee that the closing conditions will be satisfied or that the merger will be completed. If our unitholders do not approve the merger, we may be required to pay the affiliates of Apollo for their documented out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the merger agreement up to $6,500,000. In addition, the current market price of our units may reflect a market assumption that the merger will occur, and failure to complete the merger could result in a decline in the market price of our units. Continued uncertainty about the proposed merger may adversely impact our business and financial condition. We have incurred, and continue to incur, substantial costs in connection with the proposed merger. These costs are primarily associated with fees of attorneys, accountants and financial advisors. While the merger is pending, we are subject to restrictions contained in the merger agreement on the conduct of our business, particularly with respect to capital structure. Until the closing of the merger, management must continue to dedicate substantial time and resources to the proposed merger, and employees may experience uncertainty about their future which may harm our ability to retain key individuals and hire new employees all of which could negatively impact business. The terms of our credit agreement could, under certain circumstances, impose limitations upon our activities. The agreement governing our term debt and our revolving credit facilities includes covenants that under some circumstances could limit, among other things, our ability to: incur additional debt; pay distributions to our unitholders; create liens; make certain investments; consolidate or transfer assets; and enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. Our credit agreement also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain other financial tests. A breach of any of these covenants for any reason, including a decline in operating results due to economic conditions, could result in an event of default under our credit agreement. If an event of default occurs and continues, our lenders could elect to cause our outstanding debt to become immediately due and payable, requiring it to be refinanced under market conditions at that time. The most critical of these ratios is the Consolidated Leverage Ratio. At December 31, 2009, this ratio, as set forth in our credit agreement, decreased to 5.25x debt-to-EBITDA. To the extent that our 2010 operating results fall below 2009 levels, our ability to satisfy the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, which steps down again at December 31, 2010 to 5.00x consolidated total debt (excluding revolving debt)-to-EBITDA, could be difficult. Based on 2009 results, our consolidated total debt (excluding revolving debt)-to-EBITDA ratio was 5.14x at December 31, 2009 and in compliance with the covenant. We were in compliance with all other terms of the credit agreement as well as of year-end. Our credit agreement contains certain restrictions that if not met, may limit our ability to reinstate future distributions. Our credit agreement governs, among other things, the amount of distributions we are permitted to pay to unitholders. Certain restrictions exist when cash flow from operations, although positive, is below the levels required by the credit agreement. Also, we are required to meet certain debt to EBITDA levels to establish, maintain or increase our distribution. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we indefinitely suspended our distribution. Our ability to reinstate the distribution may be limited or impacted by these various restrictions which could negatively impact the market price of our units. 9 Table of Contents Our inability to reduce our total debt, as well as a deterioration of credit market conditions, could negatively impact our financial condition in the future. As provided in our credit agreement, our revolving credit facilities mature in August 2011, while $645 million of our term debt matures in 2012 and $895 million matures in 2014. A failure to reduce our debt and reduce our leverage ratios, as well as a deterioration of current credit market conditions, could result in higher cash interest costs in the future and/or may limit our ability to refinance the debt. We compete for discretionary spending with many other entertainment alternatives and are subject to factors that generally affect the recreation and leisure industry, including the current economic downturn. Our parks compete for discretionary spending with other amusement, water and theme parks and with other types of recreational activities and forms of entertainment, including movies, sports events, restaurants and vacation travel. Our business is also subject to factors that generally affect the recreation and leisure industries and are not within our control. Such factors include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions, including relative fuel prices, and changes in consumer tastes and spending habits. The difficult regional economic conditions and recessionary periods may adversely impact attendance figures and guest spending patterns at our parks, and disproportionately affect different segments of our target customers within our core markets. For example, group sales and season-pass sales, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are disproportionately affected by general economic conditions. Both attendance and guest per capita spending at our parks are key drivers of our revenues and profitability, and reductions in either can directly and negatively affect revenues and profitability. The principal competitive factors of a park include location, price, the uniqueness and perceived quality of the rides and attractions, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the park and the quality of its food and entertainment. The current negative economic conditions, such as higher unemployment rates, a constrained credit market and housing-related pressures, has affected our guestsÂ’ levels of discretionary spending. A continued decrease in discretionary spending due to decreases in consumer confidence in the economy, a continued economic slowdown or further deterioration in the economy could adversely affect the frequency with which our guests choose to attend our amusement parks and the amount that our guests spend on our products when they visit. The continued materialization of these risks could lead to a decrease in our revenues, operating income and cash flows. Bad or extreme weather conditions can adversely impact attendance at our parks, which in turn would reduce our revenues. Because most of the attractions at our parks are outdoors, attendance at our parks can be adversely affected by continuous bad or extreme weather and by forecasts of bad or mixed weather conditions, which negatively affects our revenues. Although we believe that our ownership of many parks in different geographic locations reduces the effect that adverse weather can have on our consolidated results, we believe that our operating results in 2009 were adversely affected by abnormally cold and wet weather in a number of our major U.S. markets. The operating season at most of our parks is of limited duration, which can magnify the impact of adverse conditions or events occurring within that operating season. Ten of our amusement parks are seasonal, generally operating during a portion of April or May, then daily from Memorial Day through Labor Day, and during weekends in September and, in most cases, October. Our water parks also operate seasonally, generally from Memorial Day through Labor Day and during some additional weekends before and after that period. Most of our revenues are generated during this 130 to 140-day annual operating season. As a result, when conditions or events described as risk factors occur during the operating season, particularly during the peak months of July and August or the important Fall season, there is only a limited period of time during which the impact of those conditions or events can be mitigated. Accordingly, such conditions or events may have a disproportionately adverse effect upon our revenues. Unanticipated construction delays in completing capital improvement projects in our parks and resort facilities can adversely affect our revenues. A principal competitive factor for an amusement park is the uniqueness and perceived quality of its rides and attractions in a particular market area. Accordingly, the regular addition of new rides and attractions is important, and a key element of our revenue growth is strategic capital spending on new rides and attractions. Any construction delays or ride down-time can adversely affect our attendance and our ability to realize revenue growth. There is a risk of accidents occurring at amusement parks, which may reduce attendance and negatively impact our revenues. All of our amusement parks feature thrill rides. Although we are safety conscious, there are inherent risks involved with these attractions, and an accident or a serious injury at any of our amusement parks may reduce attendance and 10 Table of Contents result in decreased revenues. In addition, accidents or injuries at parks operated by our competitors may influence the general attitudes of amusement park patrons and adversely affect attendance at our amusement parks. We are subject to pending litigation that could delay or prevent the consummation of the proposed merger. The Partnership, its general partner and its board of directors have been named as defendants in putative class actions filed in various jurisdictions in connection with the proposed merger. The plaintiffs in the litigation seek, among other things, injunctive relief to prevent the consummation of the merger. We believe the lawsuits are without merit and will defend them vigorously, but an unfavorable resolution of any such litigation could delay or prevent completion of the merger. If we lose key personnel, our business may be adversely affected. Our success depends in part upon a number of key employees, including our senior management team, whose members have been involved in the amusement park industry for an average of more than 20 years. The loss of the services of our key employees could have a materially adverse effect on our business. With the exception of four executive officers, we do not have employment agreements with our key employees. Other factors, including local events, natural disasters and terrorist activities, can adversely impact park attendance and our revenues. Lower attendance may result from various local events, natural disasters or terrorist activities, all of which are outside of our control. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. None.
