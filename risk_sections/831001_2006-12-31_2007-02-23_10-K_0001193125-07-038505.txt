RISK FACTORS The following discussion sets forth certain risks that the Company believes could cause its actual future results to differ materially from expected results. Economic conditions. The profitability of Citigroups businesses may be affected by global and local economic conditions, such as the liquidity of the global financial markets, the level and volatility of interest rates and equity prices, investor sentiment, inflation, and the availability and cost of credit. The Company generally maintains large trading portfolios in the fixed income, currency, commodity and equity markets and has significant investment positions, including investments held by its private equity business. The revenues derived from these portfolios are directly affected by economic conditions. The credit quality of Citigroups on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures is also affected by economic conditions, as more loan delinquencies would likely result in a higher level of charge-offs and increased provisions for credit losses, adversely affecting the Companys earnings. The Companys consumer businesses are particularly affected by factors such as prevailing interest rates, the rate of unemployment, the level of consumer confidence, changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies. Credit, market and liquidity risk. As discussed above, the Companys earnings may be impacted through its market risk and credit risk positions and by changes in economic conditions. In addition, Citigroups earnings are dependent upon the extent to which management can successfully manage its positions within the global markets. In particular environments, the Company may not be able to mitigate its risk exposures as effectively as desired, and may have unwanted exposures to certain risk factors. The Companys earnings are also dependent upon its ability to properly value financial instruments. In certain illiquid markets, judgmental estimates of value may be required. The Companys earnings are also dependent upon how effectively it assesses the cost of credit and manages its portfolio of risk concentrations. In addition to the direct impact of the successful management of these risk factors, management effectiveness is taken into consideration by the rating agencies, which determine the Companys own credit ratings and thereby affect the Companys cost of funds. Competition. Merger activity in the financial services industry has produced companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices. Globalization of the capital markets and financial services industries exposes Citigroup to competition both at the global and local level. In addition, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. Citigroups ability to grow its businesses, and therefore its earnings, is affected by these competitive pressures. Country risk. Citigroups international revenues are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable political and diplomatic developments, currency fluctuations, social instability, and changes in governmental policies, including expropriation, nationalization, international ownership legislation, interest rate caps and tax policies. In addition, revenues from the trading of international securities and investment in international securities may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors. The impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated because certain international trading markets, particularly those in emerging market countries, are typically smaller, less liquid and more volatile than U.S. trading markets. For geographic distributions of net income, see page 17. For a discussion of international loans, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 136 and Country and Cross-Border Risk Management Process on page 76. Operational risk. Citigroup is exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of fraud by employees and outsiders, clerical and record-keeping errors, and computer/telecommunications systems malfunctions. Given the high volume of transactions at Citigroup, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified. In addition, the Companys necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process its transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical system flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. The Company may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control (for example, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, epidemics, computer viruses, and electrical/ telecommunications outages), which may give rise to losses in service to customers and/or monetary loss to the Company. All of these risks are also applicable where the Company relies on outside vendors to provide services to it and its customers. U.S. fiscal policies. The Companys businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal policies adopted by regulatory authorities of the United States. For example, in the United States, policies of the Federal Reserve Board directly influence the rate of interest paid by commercial banks on their interest-bearing deposits and also may affect the value of financial instruments held by the Company. In addition, such changes in fiscal policy may affect the credit quality of the Companys customers. The actions of the Federal Reserve Board directly impact the Companys cost of funds for lending, capital raising and investment activities. Reputational and legal risk. Various issues may give rise to reputational risk and cause harm to the Company and its business prospects. These issues include appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest; legal and regulatory requirements; ethical issues; money laundering laws; privacy laws; information security policies; sales and trading practices; and conduct by companies in which we hold strategic investments or joint venture partners. Failure to address these issues appropriately could also give rise to additional legal risk to the Company, which could increase the number of litigation claims and the amount of damages asserted against the Company, or subject the Company to regulatory enforcement actions, fines and penalties. Certain regulatory considerations. As a worldwide business, Citigroup and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation, new legislation and changing accounting standards and interpretations thereof. Legislation is introduced, including tax consumer protection, privacy and other legislation, from time to time in Congress, in the states and in foreign jurisdictions that may change banking and financial services laws and the operating environment of the Company and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways. The Company cannot determine whether such legislation will be enacted and the ultimate effect that would have on the Companys results. 58 Table of Contents MANAGING GLOBAL RISK Citigroups risk management framework balances strong corporate oversight with well-defined independent risk management functions within each business. The Citigroup Senior Risk Officer is responsible for:  establishing standards for the measurement and reporting of risk,  managing and compensating the senior independent risk managers at the business level,  approving business-level risk management policies, and  reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations across the organization. The independent risk managers at the business level are responsible for establishing and implementing risk management policies and practices within their business, for overseeing the risk in their business, and for responding to the needs and issues of their business. RISK CAPITAL Risk capital is defined as the amount of capital required to absorb potential unexpected economic losses resulting from extremely severe events over a one-year time period.  Economic losses include losses that appear on the income statement and fair value adjustments to the financial statements, as well as any further declines in value not captured on the income statement.  Unexpected losses are the difference between potential extremely severe losses and Citigroups expected (average) loss over a one-year time period.  Extremely severe is defined as potential loss at a 99.97% confidence level, based on the distribution of observed events and scenario analysis. Risk capital is used in the calculation of return on risk capital (RORC) and return on invested capital (ROIC). RORC, calculated as annualized income from continuing operations divided by average risk capital, compares business income with the capital required to absorb the risks. It is used to assess businesses operating performance and to determine incremental allocation of capital for organic growth. ROIC is calculated using income adjusted to exclude a net internal funding cost Citigroup levies on the goodwill and intangible assets of each business. This adjusted annualized income is divided by the sum of each businesss average risk capital, goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights, which are captured in risk capital). ROIC thus compares business income with the total invested capitalrisk capital, goodwill and intangible assetsused to generate that income. ROIC is used to assess returns on potential acquisitions and divestitures, and to compare long-term performance of businesses with differing proportions of organic and acquired growth. The drivers of economic losses are risks, which can be broadly categorized as credit risk (including cross-border risk), market risk and operational risk:  Credit risk losses primarily result from a borrowers or counterpartys inability to meet its obligations.  Market risk losses arise from fluctuations in the market value of trading and non-trading positions, including changes in value resulting from fluctuations in rates.  Operational risk losses result from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or from external events. These risks are measured and aggregated within businesses and across Citigroup to facilitate the understanding of the Companys exposure to extreme downside events. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, risk capital for Citigroup was comprised of the following risk types: In billions of dollars Dec. 31, 2006 Dec. 31, 2005 Credit risk $ 36.7 $ 36.2 Market risk 21.5 13.6 Operational risk 8.0 8.1 Intersector diversification (1) (6.4 ) (4.7 ) Total Citigroup $ 59.8 $ 53.2 Return on risk capital 38 % 37 % Return on invested capital 19 % 22 % (1) Reduction in risk from diversification between sectors. The increase in Citigroups risk capital from December 31, 2005 was primarily driven by portfolio growth, particularly in U.S. Consumer Lending and CIB, as well as the year-end methodology update. Average risk capital, return on risk capital and return on invested capital are provided for each segment and product and are disclosed on pages 4074. The increase in average risk capital in 2006 was driven by increases across Citigroup businesses. The $700 million, or 39%, increase in U.S. Commercial Business and the $650 million, or 22%, increase in U.S. Retail Distribution were driven by refinements in risk capital methodologies. The $1.5 billion, or 46%, increase in U.S. Consumer Lending was primarily due to portfolio growth and refinements in risk capital methodologies. The $350 million, or 17%, increase in International Cards was primarily due to portfolio growth. The $250 million, or 29%, increase in International Consumer Finance and the $650 million, or 67%, increase in Smith Barney were primarily due to refinements in the risk capital methodologies. 59 Table of Contents Citigroup updates risk capital methodologies in the first quarter of each year. For 2007, Citigroup will be updating the methodologies for market risk for proprietary investments, the implementation of SFAS 158 and operational risk. To evaluate the impact of the refinements, risk capital as of year-end is calculated under both existing and revised methodologies. Measured under the revised methodologies, the total risk capital as of December 31, 2006 is $63.1 billion, $3.3 billion, or 5%, higher than the $59.8 billion reported under the legacy methodology. RORC and ROIC for the 2007 first quarter will be measured using average risk capital based on the revised methodologies. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Credit risk is the potential for financial loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations. Credit risk arises in many of the Companys business activities, including:  lending  sales and trading  derivatives  securities transactions  settlement  when the Company acts as an intermediary on behalf of its clients and other third parties. 60 Table of Contents LOANS OUTSTANDING In millions of dollars at year end 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Consumer loans In U.S. offices: Mortgage and real estate $ 225,944 $ 192,108 $ 161,832 $ 129,507 $ 121,178 Installment, revolving credit, and other 131,399 127,789 134,784 136,725 113,620 Lease financing 4,743 5,095 6,030 8,523 12,027 $ 362,086 $ 324,992 $ 302,646 $ 274,755 $ 246,825 In offices outside the U.S.: Mortgage and real estate $ 44,457 $ 39,619 $ 39,601 $ 28,743 $ 26,564 Installment, revolving credit, and other (1) 105,393 89,559 92,647 76,037 64,817 Lease financing 960 866 1,619 2,216 2,123 $ 150,810 $ 130,044 $ 133,867 $ 106,996 $ 93,504 $ 512,896 $ 455,036 $ 436,513 $ 381,751 $ 340,329 Unearned income (1) 25 (416 ) (1,287 ) (1,819 ) (2,648 ) Consumer loansnet $ 512,921 $ 454,620 $ 435,226 $ 379,932 $ 337,681 Corporate loans In U.S. offices: Commercial and industrial $ 27,437 $ 22,081 $ 14,437 $ 15,207 $ 22,041 Lease financing 2,101 1,952 1,879 2,010 2,017 Mortgage and real estate 168 29 100 95 2,573 $ 29,706 $ 24,062 $ 16,416 $ 17,312 $ 26,631 In offices outside the U.S.: Commercial and industrial $ 105,872 $ 80,116 $ 77,052 $ 62,884 $ 67,456 Mortgage and real estate 5,334 5,206 3,928 1,751 1,885 Loans to financial institutions 21,827 16,889 12,921 12,063 8,583 Lease financing 2,024 2,082 2,485 2,859 2,784 Governments and official institutions 1,857 882 1,100 1,496 3,081 $ 136,914 $ 105,175 $ 97,486 $ 81,053 $ 83,789 $ 166,620 $ 129,237 $ 113,902 $ 98,365 $ 110,420 Unearned income (349 ) (354 ) (299 ) (291 ) (296 ) Corporate loansnet $ 166,271 $ 128,883 $ 113,603 $ 98,074 $ 110,124 Total loansnet of unearned income $ 679,192 $ 583,503 $ 548,829 $ 478,006 $ 447,805 Allowance for loan losseson drawn exposures (8,940 ) (9,782 ) (11,269 ) (12,643 ) (11,101 ) Total loansnet of unearned income and allowance for credit losses $ 670,252 $ 573,721 $ 537,560 $ 465,363 $ 436,704 Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loansnet of unearned income 1.32 % 1.68 % 2.05 % 2.64 % 2.48 % (1) Reclassified to conform to current years presentation.

Approval policies for a product or business are tailored to internal audit ratings, profitability, and credit risk portfolio performance. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO REVIEW Citigroups consumer loan portfolio is well diversified by both product and location. In the Consumer portfolio, credit loss experience is often expressed in terms of annualized net credit losses as a percentage of average loans. Consumer loans are generally written off no later than a predetermined number of days past due on a contractual basis, or earlier in the event of bankruptcy. U.S. Commercial Business includes loans and leases made principally to small- and middle-market businesses. These are placed on a non-accrual basis when it is determined that the payment of interest or principal is past due for 90 days or more, except when the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. The following table summarizes delinquency and net credit loss experience in both the managed and on-balance sheet consumer loan portfolios. The managed loan portfolio includes held-for-sale and securitized credit card receivables. Only U.S. Cards from a product view and U.S. from a regional view are impacted. Although a managed basis presentation is not in conformity with GAAP, the Company believes managed credit statistics provide a representation of performance and key indicators of the credit card business that is consistent with the way management reviews operating performance and allocates resources. For example, the U.S. Cards business considers both on-balance sheet and securitized balances (together, its managed portfolio) when determining capital allocation and general management decisions and compensation. Furthermore, investors use information about the credit quality of the entire managed portfolio, as the results of both the on-balance sheet and securitized portfolios impact the overall performance of the U.S. Cards business.

Citigroups total allowance for loans, leases and unfunded lending commitments of $10.040 billion is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire portfolio. For analytical purposes only, the portion of Citigroups allowance for credit losses attributed to the Consumer portfolio was $6.006 billion at December 31, 2006, $6.922 billion at December 31, 2005 and $8.379 billion at December 31, 2004. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses from December 31, 2005 of $916 million included:  reserve releases, primarily related to a decline in bankruptcy filings due to the impact of the change in bankruptcy legislation on U.S. Cards in 2005, and stable credit conditions in the U.S. and internationally;  $429 million of reductions related to securitizations and sales of portfolios in the U.S. Cards business;  a $200 million release related to Hurricane Katrina. Offsetting these reductions in the allowance for credit losses was the impact of reserve builds of $660 million, primarily related to increased reserves in Mexico; increased reserves in Asia, primarily related to industry-wide credit conditions in the Taiwan cards market; and increased reserves in Japan primarily related to the change in the operating environment in the consumer finance business, and the passage on December 13, 2006, of changes to Japans consumer lending laws. The acquisition of the CrediCard portfolio increased the allowance for credit losses by $84 million in Latin America. On-balance sheet consumer loans of $510.8 billion increased $60.2 billion, or 13%, from December 31, 2005, primarily driven by growth in mortgage and other real-estate-secured loans in the U.S. Consumer Lending, U.S. Commercial Business, and Private Bank businesses and growth in U.S. Retail Distribution. Credit card receivables declined on higher payment rates by customers. Net credit losses, delinquencies and the related ratios are affected by the credit performance of the portfolios, including bankruptcies, unemployment, global economic conditions, portfolio growth and seasonal factors, as well as macro-economic and regulatory policies. Consumer Credit Outlook Consumer credit losses in 2007 are expected to moderately deteriorate from prior-year levels due to the following:  Increased bankruptcy write-offs in U.S. Cards and U.S. Retail Distribution.  Increased credit costs due to seasoning of the rapidly growing Home Equity portfolio in U.S. Consumer Lending.  Increased credit costs in International Cards, International Consumer Finance, excluding Japan, and International Retail Banking as the growing portfolio in all businesses seasons, although the underlying credit environment in all businesses are forecast to remain stable.  In International Consumer Finance Japan the impact of the changes to consumer lending laws enacted in 2006 will continue to affect the credit environment. 66 Table of Contents CORPORATE CREDIT RISK For corporate clients and investment banking activities across the organization, the credit process is grounded in a series of fundamental policies, including:  joint business and independent risk management responsibility for managing credit risks;  single center of control for each credit relationship that coordinates credit activities with that client;  portfolio limits to ensure diversification and maintain risk/capital alignment;  a minimum of two-authorized credit officer-signatures are required on extensions of credit(one from a sponsoring credit officer in the business and one from a credit officer in independent credit risk management);  risk rating standards, applicable to every obligor and facility; and  consistent standards for credit origination documentation and remedial management. The following table represents the corporate credit portfolio, before consideration of collateral, by maturity at December 31, 2006. The Corporate portfolio is broken out by direct outstandings (which include drawn loans, overdrafts, interbank placements, bankers acceptances, certain investment securities and leases) and unfunded commitments (which include unused commitments to lend, letters of credit and financial guarantees).

Obligor risk ratings reflect an estimated probability of default for an obligor, and are derived primarily through the use of statistical models (which are validated periodically), external rating agencies (under defined circumstances), or approved scoring methodologies. Facility risk ratings are assigned, using the obligor risk rating, and then factors that affect the loss-given-default of the facility such as support or collateral are taken into account. Internal obligor ratings equivalent to BBB and above are considered investment-grade. Ratings below the equivalent of BBB are considered non-investment-grade. The following table presents the corporate credit portfolio by facility risk rating at December 31, 2006 and 2005, as a percentage of the total portfolio: Direct outstandings andunfunded commitments 2006 2005 AAA/AA/A 53 % 54 % BBB 27 29 BB/B 18 15 CCC or below 1 1 Unrated 1 1 Total 100 % 100 % The corporate credit portfolio is diversified by industry, with a concentration only to the financial sector, including banks, other financial institutions, investment banks, and government and central banks.

The effect of these transactions is to transfer credit risk to credit worthy, independent third parties. Beginning in the 2003 fourth quarter, the results of the mark-to-market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives are reflected in the Principal Transactions line on the Consolidated Statement of Income. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, $93.0 billion and $40.7 billion, respectively, of credit risk exposure was economically hedged. Our expected loss model used in the calculation of our loan loss reserve does not include the favorable impact of credit derivatives and other risk mitigants. The reported amounts of direct outstandings and unfunded commitments in this report do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the credit protection was economically hedging underlying credit exposure with the following risk rating distribution: Rating of Hedged Exposure 2006 2005 AAA/AA/A 49 % 48 % BBB 41 43 BB/B 10 6 CCC or below  3 Total 100 % 100 % At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the credit protection was economically hedging underlying credit exposure with the following industry distribution: Industry of Hedged Exposure 2006 2005 Utilities 10 % 10 % Telephone and cable 9 8 Agriculture and food preparation 7 7 Petroleum 6 6 Autos 5 7 Other financial institutions 5 6 Retail 5 4 Industrial machinery and equipment 4 5 Chemicals 4 4 Pharmaceuticals 4 4 Insurance 4 4 Natural gas distribution 3 5 Airlines 3 4 Global information technology 3 3 Metals 3 3 Investment banks 3 3 Business services 3 2 Forest products 2 3 Banks 2 2 Freight transportation 2 2 Entertainment 2 2 Other industries (1) 11 6 Total 100 % 100 % (1) Includes all other industries, none of which is greater than 2% of the total hedged amount. Credit Exposure Arising from Derivatives and Foreign Exchange Citigroup uses derivatives as both an end-user for asset/liability management and in its client businesses. In CIB, Citigroup enters into derivatives for trading purposes or to enable customers to transfer, modify or reduce their interest rate, foreign exchange and other market risks. In addition, Citigroup uses derivatives and other instruments, primarily interest rate and foreign exchange products, as an end-user to manage interest rate risk relating to specific groups of interest-sensitive assets and liabilities. Also, foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated debt, net capital exposures and foreign exchange transactions. The Companys credit exposure on derivatives and foreign exchange contracts is primarily to professional counterparties in the financial sector, arising from transactions with banks, investment banks, governments and central banks, and other financial institutions. For purposes of managing credit exposure on derivative and foreign exchange contracts, particularly when looking at exposure to a single counterparty, the Company measures and monitors credit exposure taking into account the current mark-to-market value of each contract plus a prudent estimate of its potential change in value over its life. This measurement of the potential future exposure for each credit facility is based on a stressed simulation of market rates and generally takes into account legally enforceable risk-mitigating agreements for each obligor such as netting and margining. For asset/liability management hedges, a derivative must be highly effective in accomplishing the hedge objective of offsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item for the risk being hedged. Any ineffectiveness present in the hedge relationship is recognized in current earnings. The assessment of effectiveness excludes the changes in the value of the hedged item that are unrelated to the risks being hedged. Similarly, the assessment of effectiveness may exclude changes in the fair value of a derivative related to time value, which, if excluded, is recognized in current earnings. The following tables summarize by derivative type the notionals, receivables and payables held for trading and asset/liability management hedge purposes as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 148 for a discussion regarding the accounting for derivatives. 68 Table of Contents CITIGROUP DERIVATIVES Notionals (1) In millions of dollars Trading Derivatives (2) Asset/Liability Management Hedges (3) As of December 31 2006 2005 2006 2005 Interest rate contracts Swaps $ 14,196,404 $ 12,677,814 $ 561,376 $ 403,576 Futures and forwards 1,824,205 2,090,844 75,374 18,425 Written options 3,054,990 1,949,501 12,764 5,166 Purchased options 2,953,122 1,633,983 35,420 53,920 Total interest rate contract notionals $ 22,028,721 $ 18,352,142 $ 684,934 $ 481,087 Foreign exchange contracts Swaps $ 722,063 $ 563,888 $ 53,216 $ 37,418 Futures and forwards 2,068,310 1,508,754 42,675 53,757 Written options 416,951 249,725 1,228  Purchased options 404,859 253,089 1,246 808 Total foreign exchange contract notionals $ 3,612,183 $ 2,575,456 $ 98,365 $ 91,983 Equity contracts Swaps $ 104,320 $ 70,188 $  $  Futures and forwards 36,362 14,487   Written options 387,781 213,383   Purchased options 355,891 193,248   Total equity contract notionals $ 884,354 $ 491,306 $  $  Commodity and other contracts Swaps $ 35,611 $ 20,486 $  $  Futures and forwards 17,433 10,876   Written options 11,991 9,761   Purchased options 16,904 12,240   Total commodity and other contract notionals $ 81,939 $ 53,363 $  $  Credit derivatives $ 1,944,980 $ 1,030,745 $  $  Total derivative notionals $ 28,552,177 $ 22,503,012 $ 783,299 $ 573,070 Mark-to-Market (MTM) Receivables/Payables in millions of dollars Derivatives ReceivablesMTM Derivatives PayableMTM As of December 31 2006 2005 2006 2005 Trading Derivatives (2) Interest rate contracts $ 167,521 $ 192,761 $ 166,119 $ 188,182 Foreign exchange contracts 52,297 42,749 47,469 41,474 Equity contracts 26,883 18,633 52,980 32,313 Commodity and other contracts 5,387 7,332 5,776 6,986 Credit derivatives 14,069 8,106 15,081 9,279 Total $ 266,157 $ 269,581 $ 287,425 $ 278,234 Less: Netting agreements, cash collateral and market value adjustments (216,616 ) (222,167 ) (212,621 ) (216,906 ) Net Receivables/Payables $ 49,541 $ 47,414 $ 74,804 $ 61,328 Asset/Liability Management Hedges (3) Interest rate contracts $ 1,801 $ 3,775 $ 3,327 $ 1,615 Foreign exchange contracts 3,660 1,385 947 1,137 Total $ 5,461 $ 5,160 $ 4,274 $ 2,752 (1) Includes the notional amounts for long and short derivative positions.

Impaired corporate loans are written down to the extent that principal is judged to be uncollectible. Impaired collateral-dependent loans are written down to the lower of cost or collateral value, less disposal costs. The following table summarizes corporate cash-basis loans and net credit losses: In millions of dollars 2006 2005 2004 Corporate cash-basis loans Capital Markets and Banking $ 500 $ 923 $ 1,794 Transaction Services 35 81 112 Total corporate cash-basis loans (1) $ 535 $ 1,004 $ 1,906 Net credit losses (recoveries) Capital Markets and Banking $ 63 ($ 268 ) $ 148 Transaction Services 25 (9 ) (18 ) Alternative Investments (12 )   Corporate/Other 6   Total net credit losses (recoveries) $ 82 ($ 277 ) $ 130 Corporate allowance for loan losses $ 2,934 $ 2,860 $ 2,890 Corporate allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments (2) 1,100 850 600 Total corporate allowance for loans, leasesand unfunded lending commitments $ 4,034 $ 3,710 $ 3,490 As a percentage of total corporate loans (3) 1.76 % 2.22 % 2.54 % (1) Excludes purchased distressed loans as they are accreting interest in accordance with SOP 03-3 in 2005. In prior years, these loans were classified in Other Assets. The carrying value of these loans was $949 million at December 31, 2006, $1,120 million at December 31, 2005 and $1,213 million at December 31, 2004. (2) Represents additional reserves recorded in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. (3) Does not include the allowance for unfunded lending commitments. Cash-basis loans on December 31, 2006 decreased $469 million from 2005; $423 million of the decrease was in Capital Markets and Banking and $46 million was in Transaction Services. Capital Markets and Banking decreased primarily due to the absence of cash-basis portfolios in Russia and Australia and decreases in portfolios in Poland and Korea. The decrease in Transaction Services was primarily related to decreases in Mexico. Cash-basis loans decreased $902 million in 2005 due to decreases of $871 million in Capital Markets and Banking and $31 million in Transaction Services. Capital Markets and Banking primarily reflected decreases in Brazil, Argentina, KorAm and Europe. Transaction Services decreased primarily due to charge-offs in Brazil. Total corporate Other Real Estate Owned (OREO) was $316 million, $150 million and $126 million at December 31, 2006, December 31, 2005, and December 31, 2004, respectively. The $166 million increase from December 31, 2005 reflects net foreclosures in the U.S. real estate portfolio. Total corporate loans outstanding at December 31, 2006 were $166 billion as compared to $129 billion at December 31, 2005. Total corporate net credit losses of $82 million in 2006 increased $359 million compared to the net credit recovery of $277 million in 2005, primarily attributable to the absence of gross credit recoveries experienced in 2005. Total corporate net credit recoveries of $277 million in 2005 improved $407 million compared to 2004 as higher recoveries more than offset credit losses. Citigroups total allowance for credit losses for loans, leases and unfunded lending commitments of $10.040 billion at December 31, 2006 is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire Companys portfolio. For analytical purposes only, the portion of Citigroups allowance for credit losses attributed to the corporate portfolio was $4.034 billion at December 31, 2006, $3.710 billion at December 31, 2005, and $3.490 billion at December 31, 2004. The $324 million increase in the corporate allowance at December 31, 2006 from December 31, 2005 primarily reflects $250 million in reserve builds related to increases in off-balance sheet exposures and a slight decline in credit quality. The $220 million increase in the corporate allowance at December 31, 2005 from December 31, 2004 primarily reflects an increase in the allowance for unfunded lending commitments based on portfolio growth and the deterioration of the underlying portfolio. Losses on corporate lending activities and the level of cash-basis loans can vary widely with respect to timing and amount, particularly within any narrowly defined business or loan type. 70 Table of Contents LOAN MATURITIES AND FIXED/VARIABLE PRICING In billions of dollars at year end Due within 1 year Over 1 yearbut within5 years Over 5years Total Corporate loan portfolio maturities In U.S. offices: Commercial andindustrial loans $ 18,883 $ 3,373 $ 5,180 $ 27,436 Mortgage and real estate 115 21 32 168 Lease financing 1,446 258 397 2,101 In offices outside the U.S. 80,704 43,178 13,033 136,915 Total corporate loans $ 101,148 $ 46,830 $ 18,642 $ 166,620 Fixed/variable pricing of corporate loans with maturities due afterone year (1) Loans at fixed interest rates $ 9,248 $ 4,959 Loans at floating or adjustable interest rates 37,582 13,683 Total $ 46,830 $ 18,642 (1) Based on contractual terms.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Market risk encompasses liquidity risk and price risk, both of which arise in the normal course of business of a global financial intermediary. Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity may be unable to meet a financial commitment to a customer, creditor, or investor when due. Liquidity risk is discussed in the Capital Resources and Liquidity on page 86. Price risk is the earnings risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, and in their implied volatilities. Price risk arises in non-trading portfolios, as well as in trading portfolios. Market risks are measured in accordance with established standards to ensure consistency across businesses and the ability to aggregate risk. Each business is required to establish, with approval from independent market risk management, a market risk limit framework, including risk measures and controls, that clearly defines approved risk profiles and is within the parameters of Citigroups overall risk appetite. In all cases, the businesses are ultimately responsible for the market risks they take and for remaining within their defined limits. Non-Trading Portfolios Interest Rate Risk One of Citigroups primary business functions is providing financial products that meet the needs of its customers. Loans and deposits are tailored to the customers requirements with regard to tenor, index, and rate type. Net Interest Revenue (NIR) is the difference between the yield earned on the non-trading portfolio assets (including customer loans) and rate paid on the liabilities (including customer deposits or company borrowings). The NIR is affected by changes in the level of interest rates. For example:  At any given time, there may be an unequal amount of assets and liabilities, which are subject to market rates due to maturation or repricing. Whenever the amount of liabilities subject to repricing exceeds the amount of assets subject to repricing, a company is considered liability sensitive. In this case, a companys NIR will deteriorate in a rising rate environment.  The assets and liabilities of a company may reprice at different speeds or mature at different times, subjecting both liability sensitive and asset sensitive companies to NIR sensitivity from changing interest rates. For example, a company may have a large amount of loans that are subject to repricing this period, but the majority of deposits are not scheduled for repricing until the following period. That company would suffer from NIR deterioration if interest rates were to fall. NIR in the current period is the result of customer transactions and the related contractual rates originated in prior periods as well as new transactions in the current period; those prior period transactions will be impacted by changes in rates on floating rate assets and liabilities in the current period. Due to the long-term nature of the portfolios, NIR will vary from quarter to quarter even assuming no change in the shape or level of the yield curve as the assets and liabilities reprice. These repricings are a function of implied forward interest rates, which represent the overall markets unbiased estimate of future interest rates and incorporate possible changes in the Federal Funds rate as well as the shape of the yield curve. Interest Rate Risk Governance The risks in Citigroups non-traded portfolios are estimated using a common set of standards that define, measure, limit and report the market risk. Each business is required to establish, with approval from independent market risk management, a market risk limit framework that clearly defines approved risk profiles and is within the parameters of Citigroups overall risk appetite. In all cases, the businesses are ultimately responsible for the market risks they take and for remaining within their defined limits. These limits are monitored by independent market risk, country and business Asset and Liability Committees (ALCOs) and the Global Finance and Asset and Liability Committee (FinALCO). 71 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Measurement Citigroups principal measure of risk to NIR is Interest Rate Exposure (IRE). IRE measures the change in expected NIR in each currency resulting solely from unanticipated changes in forward interest rates. Factors such as changes in volumes, spreads, margins and the impact of prior-period pricing decisions are not captured by IRE. IRE assumes that businesses make no additional changes in pricing or balances in response to the unanticipated rate changes. IRE tests the impact on NIR resulting from unanticipated changes in forward interest rates. For example, if the current 90-day LIBOR rate is 3.00% and the one-year forward rate is 5.00% (i.e., the estimated 90-day LIBOR rate in one year), the +100bps IRE scenario measures the impact of the firms NIR of a 100bps instantaneous change in the 90-day LIBOR, to 6% in one year). The impact of changing prepayment rates on loan portfolios is incorporated into the results. For example, in the declining interest rate scenarios, it is assumed that mortgage portfolios prepay faster and income is reduced. In addition, in a rising interest rate scenario, portions of the deposit portfolio are assumed to experience rate increases that are less than the change in market interest rates. Mitigation and Hedging of Risk All financial institutions financial performance is subject to some degree of risk due to changes in interest rates. In order to manage these risks effectively, Citigroup may modify pricing on new customer loans and deposits, enter into transactions with other institutions or enter into off-balance sheet derivative transactions that have the opposite risk exposures. Therefore, Citigroup regularly assesses the viability of strategies to reduce unacceptable risks to earnings and implements such strategies when the Company believes those actions are prudent. As information becomes available, Citigroup formulates strategies aimed at protecting earnings from the potential negative effects of changes in interest rates. Citigroup employs additional measurements, including stress testing the impact of non-linear interest rate movements on the value of the balance sheet; the analysis of portfolio duration and volatility, particularly as they relate to mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities; and the potential impact of the change in the spread between different market indices. The exposures in the following table represent the approximate annualized risk to NIR assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100bp change, as well as a more gradual 100bp (25bp per quarter) parallel change in rates as compared with the market forward interest rates in selected currencies. December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 In millions of dollars Increase Decrease Increase Decrease U.S. dollar Instantaneous change $ (728 ) $ 627 $ (155 ) $ 284 Gradual change $ (349 ) $ 360 $ (73 ) $ 66 Mexican peso Instantaneous change $ 42 $ (43 ) $ 63 $ (64 ) Gradual change $ 41 $ (41 ) $ 34 $ (34 ) Euro Instantaneous change $ (91 ) $ 91 $ (40 ) $ 40 Gradual change $ (38 ) $ 38 $ (19 ) $ 19 Japanese yen Instantaneous change $ (32 ) NM $ (16 ) NM Gradual change $ (21 ) NM $ (11 ) NM Pound sterling Instantaneous change $ (41 ) $ 41 $ 3 $ (3 ) Gradual change $ (21 ) $ 21 $ 9 $ (9 ) NM Not meaningful. A 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would imply negative rates for the Japanese yen yield curve. The changes in the U.S. dollar interest rate exposures from the prior year reflect changes in customer-related asset and liability balances, additional available-for-sale securities as well as Citigroups view of prevailing interest rates. 72 Table of Contents The following table shows the risk to NIR from six different changes in the implied forward rates. Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur on a gradual basis every three months over the course of one year.

Factor sensitivities are expressed as the change in the value of a position for a defined change in a market risk factor, such as a change in the value of a Treasury bill for a one basis point change in interest rates. Citigroups independent market risk management ensures that factor sensitivities are calculated, monitored and, in most cases, limited, for all relevant risks taken in a trading portfolio. VAR estimates the potential decline in the value of a position or a portfolio under normal market conditions. The VAR method incorporates the factor sensitivities of the trading portfolio with the volatilities and correlations of those factors and is expressed as the risk to the Company over a one-day holding period, at a 99% confidence level. Citigroups VAR is based on the volatilities of and correlations between a multitude of market risk factors as well as factors that track the specific issuer risk in debt and equity securities. Stress testing is performed on trading portfolios on a regular basis to estimate the impact of extreme market movements. It is performed on both individual trading portfolios, as well as on aggregations of portfolios and businesses. Independent market risk management, in conjunction with the businesses, develops stress scenarios, reviews the output of periodic stress testing exercises, and uses the information to make judgments as to the ongoing appropriateness of exposure levels and limits. Each trading portfolio has its own market risk limit framework, encompassing these measures and other controls, including permitted product lists and a new product approval process for complex products. Risk capital for market risk in trading portfolios is based on an annualized VAR figure, with adjustments for intra-day trading activity. Total revenues of the trading business consist of:  Customer revenue, which includes spreads from customer flow and positions taken to facilitate customer orders;  Proprietary trading activities in both cash and derivative transactions; and  Net interest revenue. All trading positions are marked-to-market, with the result reflected in earnings. In 2006, negative trading-related revenue (net losses) were recorded for 25 of 251 trading days. Of the 25 days on which negative revenue (net losses) was recorded, only four were greater than $30 million. The following histogram of total daily revenue or loss captures trading volatility and shows the number of days in which the Companys trading-related revenues fell within particular ranges. 73 Table of Contents Citigroup periodically performs extensive back-testing of many hypothetical test portfolios as one check of the accuracy of its VAR. Back-testing is the process in which the daily VAR of a portfolio is compared to the actual daily change in the market value of its transactions. Back-testing is conducted to confirm that the daily market value losses in excess of 99% confidence level occur, on average, only 1% of the time. The VAR calculation for the hypothetical test portfolios, with different degrees of risk concentration, meets this statistical criteria. The level of price risk exposure at any given point in time depends on the market environment and expectations of future price and market movements, and will vary from period to period. For Citigroups major trading centers, the aggregate pretax VAR in the trading portfolios was $106 million at December 31, 2006 and $93 million at December 31, 2005. Daily exposures averaged $99 million in 2006 and ranged from $71 million to $133 million. The following table summarizes VAR to Citigroup in the trading portfolios as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, including the Total VAR, the specific risk only component of VAR, and TotalGeneral market factors only, along with the yearly averages: In millions of dollars December 31, 2006 2006 Average December 31, 2005 2005 Average Interest rate $ 81 $ 87 $ 83 $ 100 Foreign exchange 27 27 17 14 Equity 62 48 50 40 Commodity 18 15 8 15 Covariance adjustment (82 ) (78 ) (65 ) (60 ) Total  All market risk factors, including general and specific risk $ 106 $ 99 $ 93 $ 109 Specific risk only component $ 8 $ 10 $ 12 $ 6 Total  General market factors only $ 98 $ 89 $ 81 $ 103 The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and debt issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR. Citigroups specific risk model conforms to the 4x-multiplier treatment approved by the Federal Reserve and is subject to extensive annual hypothetical back-testing. The table below provides the range of VAR in each type of trading portfolio that was experienced during 2006 and 2005: 2006 2005 In millions of dollars Low High Low High Interest rate $ 64 $ 125 $ 62 $ 155 Foreign exchange 16 45 9 23 Equity 35 68 27 63 Commodity 5 25 5 24 74 Table of Contents OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems, or from external events. It includes the reputation and franchise risk associated with business practices or market conduct that the Company undertakes. Operational risk is inherent in Citigroups global business activities and, as with other risk types, is managed through an overall framework with checks and balances that include:  Recognized ownership of the risk by the businesses;  Oversight by independent risk management; and  Independent review by Audit and Risk Review (ARR). Framework Citigroups approach to operational risk is defined in the Citigroup Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA)/ Operational Risk Policy. The objective of the Policy is to establish a consistent, value-added framework for assessing and communicating operational risk and the overall effectiveness of the internal control environment across Citigroup. Each major business segment must implement an operational risk process consistent with the requirements of this Policy. The process for operational risk includes the following steps:  Identify and assess Key Operational Risks;  Establish Key Risk Indicators; and  Produce a comprehensive operational risk report. The Operational Risk standards facilitate the effective communication of operational risk both within and across businesses. Information about the businesses operational risk, historical losses, and the control environment is reported by each major business segment and functional area, and summarized for Senior Management and the Citigroup Board of Directors. The RCSA standards establish a formal governance structure to provide direction, oversight, and monitoring of Citigroups RCSA programs. The RCSA standards for risk and control assessment are applicable to all businesses and staff functions. They establish RCSA as the process whereby important risks inherent in a business activities are identified and the effectiveness of the key controls over those risks are evaluated and monitored. RCSA processes facilitate Citigroups adherence to regulatory requirements, including Sarbanes-Oxley, FDICIA, the International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards (Basel II), and other corporate initiatives, including Operational Risk Management and alignment of capital assessments with risk management objectives. The entire process is subject to audit by Citigroups ARR, and the results of RCSA are included in periodic management reporting, including reporting to Senior Management and the Audit and Risk Management Committee. Measurement and Basel II To support advanced capital modeling and management, the businesses are required to capture relevant operational risk capital information. An enhanced version of the risk capital model for operational risk has been developed and implemented across the major business segments as a step toward readiness for Basel II capital calculations. The risk capital calculation is designed to qualify as an Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) under Basel II. It uses a combination of internal and external loss data to support statistical modeling of capital requirement estimates, which are then adjusted to reflect qualitative data regarding the operational risk and control environment. Information Security and Continuity of Business During 2006, Citigroup continued to enhance a strategic framework for Information Security technology initiatives, and the Company began implementing enhancements to various Information Security programs across its businesses covering Information Security Risk Management, Security Incident Response and Electronic Transportable Media. The Company continues to implement tools to increase the effectiveness of its data protection and entitlement management programs. Additional monthly Information Security metrics were established to better assist the Information Technology Risk Officer in managing enterprise-wide risk. The Information Security Program complies with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and other regulatory guidance. The Corporate Office of Business Continuity, with the support of Senior Management, continues to coordinate global preparedness and mitigate business continuity risks by reviewing and testing recovery procedures. 75 Table of Contents COUNTRY AND CROSS-BORDER RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS Country Risk Country risk is the risk that an event in a foreign country will impair the value of Citigroup assets or will adversely affect the ability of obligors within that country to honor their obligations to Citigroup. Country risk events may include sovereign defaults, banking or currency crises, social instability, and changes in governmental policies (for example, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and other changes in legislation relating to international ownership). Country risk includes local franchise risk, credit risk, market risk, operational risk, and cross-border risk. The Country risk management framework at Citigroup includes a number of tools and management processes designed to facilitate the ongoing analysis of individual countries and their risks. These include country risk rating models, scenario planning and stress testing, internal watch lists, and the Country Risk Committee process. The Citigroup Country Risk Committee is the senior forum to evaluate the Companys total business footprint within a specific country franchise with emphasis on responses to current potential country risk events. The Committee is chaired by the Head of Global Country Risk Management and includes as its members senior risk management officers, senior regional business heads, and senior product heads. The Committee regularly reviews all risk exposures within a country, makes recommendations as to actions, and follows up to ensure appropriate accountability. Cross-border Risk Cross-border risk is the risk that actions taken by a non-U.S. government may prevent the conversion of local currency into non-local currency and/or the transfer of funds outside of the country, thereby impacting the ability of the Company and its customers to transact business across borders. Examples of cross-border risk include actions taken by foreign governments such as exchange controls, debt moratoria, or restrictions on the remittance of funds. These actions might restrict the transfer of funds or the ability of the Company to obtain payment from customers on their contractual obligations. Management oversight of cross-border risk is performed through a formal review process that includes annual setting of cross-border limits and/or exposures, monitoring of economic conditions globally, and the establishment of internal cross-border risk management policies. Under Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) regulatory guidelines, total reported cross-border outstandings include cross-border claims on third parties, as well as investments in and funding of local franchises. Cross-border claims on third parties (trade, short-term, and medium- and long-term claims) include cross-border loans, securities, deposits with banks, investments in affiliates, and other monetary assets, as well as net revaluation gains on foreign exchange and derivative products. Cross-border outstandings are reported based on the country of the obligor or guarantor. Outstandings backed by cash collateral are assigned to the country in which the collateral is held. For securities received as collateral, cross-border outstandings are reported in the domicile of the issuer of the securities. Cross-border resale agreements are presented based on the domicile of the counterparty in accordance with FFIEC guidelines. Investments in and funding of local franchises represent the excess of local country assets over local country liabilities. Local country assets are claims on local residents recorded by branches and majority-owned subsidiaries of Citigroup domiciled in the country, adjusted for externally guaranteed claims and certain collateral. Local country liabilities are obligations of non-U.S. branches and majority-owned subsidiaries of Citigroup for which no cross-border guarantee has been issued by another Citigroup office. The table below shows all countries in which total FFIEC cross-border outstandings exceed 0.75% of total Citigroup assets: December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 Cross-border claims on third parties In millions of dollars Banks Public Private Total Trading andshort-term claims (1) Investments in and funding of local franchises Total cross- border outstandings Commitments (2) Total cross- border outstandings Commitments Germany $ 21.8 $ 5.0 $ 11.7 $ 38.5 $ 35.1 $ 0.1 $ 38.6 $ 43.6 $ 14.8 $ 25.0 India 1.4 0.1 8.2 9.7 7.8 15.1 24.8 0.7 6.5 0.7 Netherlands 5.9 3.6 10.6 20.1 17.6  20.1 10.5 15.8 9.2 France 8.5 2.2 9.1 19.8 17.9  19.8 60.8 14.9 33.5 Spain 2.7 5.6 6.8 15.1 14.6 4.6 19.7 6.8 7.4 2.8 South Korea 0.8 0.2 3.1 4.1 4.0 15.6 19.7 11.4 14.8 5.2 Italy 3.4 8.3 5.7 17.4 16.8 1.2 18.6 4.0 10.9 3.0 United Kingdom (3) 7.6  10.8 18.4 13.6  18.4 192.8 10.3 103.8 Canada 1.4 0.1 3.8 5.3 4.9 5.6 10.9 9.5 9.1 2.9 (1) Included in total cross-border claims on third parties.

Loans Loans are an extension of credit to individuals, corporations, and government institutions. Loans vary across regions and industry and primarily include credit cards, mortgages, other real estate lending, personal loans, auto loans, student loans, and corporate loans. Consumer and corporate loans comprised 76% and 24%, respectively, of total loans (net of unearned income and before the allowance for loan losses). Consumer loans increased by $58 billion, or 13%, primarily due to:  $39 billion, or 17%, increase in mortgage and real estate loans;  $19 billion, or 9%, increase in installment and revolving credit; which was partially driven by the following acquisitions:  The $3 billion Federated credit card portfolio;  The $1 billion in loans from Brazils CrediCard consolidation; and  The $1 billion Exxon Mobil private label credit card receivables. Corporate Loans increased $38 billion, or 29%, primarily driven by increases of:  $31 billion, or 30%, in commercial and industrial loans; and  $5 billion, or 29%, in loans to financial institutions. During 2006, average consumer loans (net of unearned income) of $480 billion yielded an average rate of 9.0%, compared to $437 billion and 9.0% in the prior year. Average corporate loans of $153 billion yielded an average rate of 7.7% in 2006, compared to $120 billion and 6.6% in the prior year. For further information, see Loans Outstanding on page 61 and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 136. Trading Account Assets (Liabilities) Trading account assets include U.S. Government securities, corporate securities, equities, derivatives, and other securities acquired for the purpose of facilitating customer transactions and proprietary risk-taking. Trading account liabilities include short positions arising from sales of securities and other assets, and the fair value of derivative contracts held for trading that are in a loss position. All trading account assets and liabilities are reported at their fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in current income. Trading account assets increased by $98 billion, or 33%, due to:  $34 billion, or 56%, increase in corporate and other debt securities;  $28 billion, or 43%, increase in equity securities;  $12 billion, or 55%, increase in foreign government securities;  $9 billion, or 33%, increase in mortgage loans and collateralized mortgage securities (CMOs);  $6 billion, or 15%, increase in U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities;  $2 billion, or 4%, increase in revaluation gains primarily consisting of increases from foreign exchange, equity, and credit derivative contracts, a decrease in netting permitted under master netting agreements, and an offset from a decrease in gains related to interest rate contracts; and  $7 billion, or 20%, net increase in other trading securities. Total average trading account assets were $290 billion in 2006, compared to $235 billion in 2005, yielding average rates of 4.1%, and 3.5%, respectively. Trading account liabilities increased by $25 billion, or 21%, due to:  $14 billion, or 22%, increase in revaluation losses primarily consisting of increases from equity, foreign exchange and credit derivative contracts, a decrease in netting permitted under master netting agreements, and an offset from a decrease in losses related to interest rate contracts; and  $11 billion, or 19%, increase in securities sold, not yet purchased comprising of a $9 billion increase in debt securities and a $2 billion increase in U.S. treasury securities. In 2006, average trading account liabilities were $75 billion, yielding an average rate of 1.5%, compared to $74 billion and 0.9% in the prior year. For further discussion regarding trading account assets and liabilities, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 133. 77 Table of Contents Federal Funds Sold (Purchased) and Securities Borrowed (Loaned) or Purchased (Sold) Under Agreements to Resell (Repurchase) Federal funds sold and federal funds purchased consist of unsecured advances of excess balances in reserve accounts held at Federal Reserve Banks. When the Company advances federal funds to a third party, it is selling its excess reserves. Similarly, when the Company receives federal funds, the Company is purchasing reserves from a third party. These interest-bearing transactions typically have an original maturity of one business day. Securities borrowed and securities loaned are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received. With respect to securities borrowed, the Company pays cash collateral in an amount in excess of the market value of securities borrowed, and receives excess in the case of securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities borrowed and loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral advanced or obtained as necessary. Interest received or paid for these transactions are recorded in interest income or interest expense. Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are carried at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently reacquired or resold, including accrued interest, as specified in the respective agreements. The Companys policy is to take possession of securities purchased under agreements to resell. The market value of securities to be repurchased and resold is monitored, and additional collateral is obtained where appropriate to protect against credit exposure. The increase of $66 billion, or 30%, in federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell was primarily driven by a shift from securities purchased under agreements to resell to securities borrowed. This resulted in a decline in the netting benefits permissible under FIN 41 as securities borrowed do not qualify for FIN 41 netting. Securities purchased under agreements to resell remained relatively unchanged on a net basis, while securities borrowed increased. The increase of $107 billion, or 44%, in federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase was primarily due to a $65 billion decrease in FIN 41 netting, as well as a $27 billion increase in securities loaned, which was driven by the funding needs for the increases in trading assets. For further information regarding these balance sheet categories, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 132. Investments Investments consist of fixed income and equity securities. Fixed income includes bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stock, as well as loan-backed securities (such as mortgage-backed securities) and other structured notes. Equity securities include common and nonredeemable preferred stocks. These instruments provide the Company with long-term investment opportunities while in most cases remaining relatively liquid. These investments are primarily carried at fair value with the changes in fair value generally recognized in stockholders equity (Accumulated other comprehensive income). Declines in fair value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized in current earnings, as well as gains and losses from the sale of these investment securities. Investments increased by $93 billion, or 51%, due to the following increases:  $69 billion in mortgage-backed securities, which is primarily due to the expansion of a Mortgage-Backed Securities Program in the U.S. Consumer Lending business;  $7 billion in U.S. corporate securities;  $6 billion in foreign government securities; and  net $11 billion for all other securities. For further information regarding investments, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 134. Deposits Deposits represent customer funds that are payable on demand or upon maturity. They can be interest-bearing or non-interest-bearing. Interest-bearing deposits payable by foreign and U.S. domestic banking subsidiaries of the Company comprise 62% and 27% of total deposits, respectively, while non-interest-bearing deposits comprise 5% and 6% of total deposits, respectively. Total deposits increased by $120 billion, or 20%, primarily due to:  Strong growth in corporate interest-bearing deposits in all regions, notably in Europe, North America and Asia. Increases reflected the impact of rising short-term interest rates, as well as increased client transactional volumes; and  Growth in retail deposits primarily from high-yield savings accounts, time deposits and money market accounts in the consumer businesses. U.S. deposits grew in interest-bearing time deposits, CDs, money market and e-savings accounts, driven by internal growth through branch expansion, competitive interest rates, and marketing campaigns of new products. In regions outside of the U.S., deposits grew as a result of continued branch and client acquisition and servicing channel expansion, competitive interest rates and marketing campaigns of new products. Average deposits increased $80 billion to $587 billion in 2006, yielding an average rate of 3.7%, compared to 2.7% in the prior year. For more information on deposits, see Capital Resources and Liquidity on page 86. 78 Table of Contents Brokerage Payables Brokerage Payables include payables arising from unsettled trades including securities purchased, but not yet received by the Company as of the settlement date (fails to receive). These payables increased by $14 billion, or 20%. The brokerage payables balance fluctuates based upon investment security inventory levels, trade activity, and the timing of trade settlements. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 133. Debt Debt is comprised of both short-term and long-term borrowings. It includes commercial paper, borrowings from unaffiliated banks, senior notes (including collateralized advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank), subordinated notes, and trust preferred securities. Debt increased by $105 billion, or 37%, as short-term borrowings increased $34 billion, or 51%, and long-term debt increased $71 billion, or 33%. The increase in short-term borrowings included an increase of $10 billion in commercial paper, and an increase of $24 billion in other funds borrowed. The increase was used to fund both trading and non-trading activities. Average commercial paper outstanding in 2006 was $32 billion and yielded an average rate of 5.0%, compared to $26 billion and 3.1% in 2005. Average other funds borrowed in 2006 was $39 billion, yielding an average rate of 4.1%, compared to $32 billion and 4.1% in the prior year. As for long-term debt, the Company took advantage of flattening yield curves and the positive credit environment experienced during 2006 to extend the maturities of new borrowings and issued/acquired additional debt from new acquisitions as U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar-denominated fixed and variable rate senior debt increased by $62 billion, while subordinated debt increased by $6 billion. These increases were driven by new issuances of $114 billion, offset by repayments/redemptions and maturities totaling $46 billion. The increase in long-term debt was primarily used to fund growth in the mortgage loan portfolio and to fund the mortgage-backed securities investment portfolios. Additionally, trust preferred securities increased by $3 billion. Average long-term debt outstanding during 2006 was $245 billion, compared to $212 billion in 2005, yielding an average rate of 4.9% and 3.7%, respectively.

The respective segment information closely depicts the assets and liabilities managed by each segment. While this presentation is not defined by GAAP, the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance investors understanding of the balance sheet components managed by the underlying business segments as well as the beneficial interrelationship of the asset and liability dynamics of the balance sheet components among the Companys business segments. The Company believes that investors may find it useful to see these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze financial performance. 80 Table of Contents Interest Revenue/Expense and Yields In millions of dollars 2006 2005 2004 % Change 2006 vs. 2005 % Change 2005 vs. 2004 Interest Revenue (1) (2) $ 96,431 $ 75,916 $ 63,621 27 % 19 % Interest Expense 56,943 36,676 22,004 55 67 Net Interest Revenue (1) (2) $ 39,488 $ 39,240 $ 41,617 1 % (6 )% Interest RevenueAverage Rate (2) 6.48 % 5.93 % 5.56 % 55 bps 37 bps Interest ExpenseAverage Rate 4.24 % 3.19 % 2.12 % 105 bps 107 bps Net Interest Margin (2) 2.65 % 3.06 % 3.64 % (41 ) bps (58 ) bps Interest Rate Benchmarks: Federal Funds RateEnd of Period 5.25 % 4.25 % 2.25 % 100 bps 200 bps 2-Year U.S. Treasury NoteAverage Rate 4.81 % 3.85 % 2.38 % 96 bps 147 bps 10-Year U.S. Treasury NoteAverage Rate 4.79 % 4.28 % 4.27 % 51 bps 1 bps 10-Year vs. 2-Year Spread (2 ) bps 43 bps 189 bps (1) Excludes taxable equivalent adjustment based on the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate of 35%. (2) 2006 includes a $(666) million reduction of interest revenue related to consumer lending in Japan. This impacted the average rate on average interest-earning assets by 4 basis points and the net interest margin by 5 basis points. A significant portion of the Companys business activities is based upon gathering deposits and borrowing money and then lending or investing those funds, including market-making activities in tradable securities. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing gross interest revenue less gross interest expense by average interest earning assets. During 2006, pressure on net interest margin continued, driven by several factors. Interest expense increased due to both a rise in short-term interest rates and funding actions the Company has taken to lengthen its debt maturity profile. The average rate on the Companys assets increased during the period, but by less than the increase in average rates on borrowed funds or deposits. The average rate on loans reflected a highly competitive loan pricing environment, as well as a shift in the Companys loan portfolio from higher-yielding credit card receivables to assets that carry lower yields, such as mortgages and home equity loans. The shift partially reflects increased securitization activity and, while moderating, continued high payment rates on credit card receivables. 81 Table of Contents AVERAGE BALANCES AND INTEREST RATES  ASSETS (1) (2) (3) (4) Average Volume Interest Revenue % Average Rate In millions of dollars 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Assets Deposits with banks (5) $ 37,977 $ 34,211 $ 28,339 $ 2,289 $ 1,537 $ 536 6.03 % 4.49 % 1.89 % Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell (6) In U.S. offices $ 166,202 $ 154,578 $ 129,538 $ 10,258 $ 7,041 $ 2,979 6.17 % 4.55 % 2.30 % In offices outside the U.S. (5) 85,200 74,728 73,829 3,941 2,749 2,043 4.63 3.68 2.77 Total $ 251,402 $ 229,306 $ 203,367 $ 14,199 $ 9,790 $ 5,022 5.65 % 4.27 % 2.47 % Trading account assets (7) (8) In U.S. offices $ 188,985 $ 154,716 $ 125,597 $ 8,537 $ 5,678 $ 4,435 4.52 % 3.67 % 3.53 % In offices outside the U.S. (5) 100,634 80,367 70,458 3,328 2,459 2,034 3.31 3.06 2.89 Total $ 289,619 $ 235,083 $ 196,055 $ 11,865 $ 8,137 $ 6,469 4.10 % 3.46 % 3.30 % Investments (1) In U.S. offices Taxable $ 106,136 $ 77,000 $ 70,861 $ 4,799 $ 2,623 $ 2,143 4.52 % 3.41 % 3.02 % Exempt from U.S. income tax 14,023 10,852 8,582 661 481 410 4.71 4.43 4.78 In offices outside the U.S. (5) 98,640 81,309 74,665 4,939 4,234 3,650 5.01 5.21 4.89 Total $ 218,799 $ 169,161 $ 154,108 $ 10,399 $ 7,338 $ 6,203 4.75 % 4.34 % 4.03 % Loans (net of unearned income) (9) Consumer loans In U.S. offices $ 341,315 $ 306,396 $ 283,659 $ 28,472 $ 24,874 $ 23,991 8.34 % 8.12 % 8.46 % In offices outside the U.S. (5) 138,978 130,550 117,476 14,773 14,238 12,650 10.63 10.91 10.77 Total consumer loans $ 480,293 $ 436,946 $ 401,135 $ 43,245 $ 39,112 $ 36,641 9.00 % 8.95 % 9.13 % Corporate loans In U.S. offices $ 28,113 $ 19,200 $ 16,030 $ 1,941 $ 1,134 $ 918 6.90 % 5.91 % 5.73 % In offices outside the U.S. (5) 124,462 101,262 91,644 9,836 6,837 6,175 7.90 6.75 6.74 Total corporate loans $ 152,575 $ 120,462 $ 107,674 $ 11,777 $ 7,971 $ 7,093 7.72 % 6.62 % 6.59 % Total loans $ 632,868 $ 557,408 $ 508,809 $ 55,022 $ 47,083 $ 43,734 8.69 % 8.45 % 8.60 % Other interest-earning assets $ 57,472 $ 56,095 $ 53,741 $ 2,657 $ 2,031 $ 1,657 4.62 % 3.62 % 3.08 % Total interest-earning assets $ 1,488,137 $ 1,281,264 $ 1,144,419 $ 96,431 $ 75,916 $ 63,621 6.48 % 5.93 % 5.56 % Non-interest-earning assets (7) 191,408 165,604 175,620 Total assets from discontinued operations  51,270 96,734 Total assets $ 1,679,545 $ 1,498,138 $ 1,416,773 (1) Interest revenue excludes the taxable equivalent adjustments (based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%) of $98 million, $158 million, and $150 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

It is used primarily to support asset growth in the Companys businesses. Excess capital is used to pay dividends to shareholders, repurchase stock, and fund acquisitions. Citigroups capital management framework is designed to ensure that Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital consistent with the Companys risk profile, all applicable regulatory standards and guidelines, and external rating agency considerations. The capital management process is centrally overseen by senior management and is frequently reviewed at the entity and country level. Senior management oversees the capital management process of Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries mainly through Citigroups Global Finance and Asset and Liability Committee (FinALCO). This Committee includes Citigroups Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Head of Corporate Finance and Treasury, Senior Risk Officer, the business segment CEOs, and other senior managers. The Committees responsibilities include: determining the financial structure of Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries; ensuring that Citigroup and its regulated entities are adequately capitalized; reviewing the funding and capital markets plan for Citigroup; monitoring interest rate risk, corporate and bank liquidity, and the impact of currency translation on non-U.S. earnings and capital; and reviewing and recommending share repurchase levels and dividends on preferred and common stock. The FinALCO has established capital targets for Citigroup and for significant subsidiaries. These targets exceed the regulatory standards. Capital Ratios Citigroup is subject to risk-based capital ratio guidelines issued by the FRB. Capital adequacy is measured via two risk-based ratios, Tier 1 and Total Capital (Tier 1 + Tier 2 Capital). Tier 1 Capital is considered core capital while Total Capital also includes other items such as subordinated debt and loan loss reserves. Both measures of capital are stated as a percent of risk-adjusted assets. Risk-adjusted assets are measured primarily on their perceived credit risk and include certain off-balance sheet exposures, such as unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit and the notional amounts of derivative and foreign exchange contracts. Citigroup is also subject to the Leverage Ratio requirement, a non-risk-based asset ratio, which is defined as Tier 1 Capital as a percentage of adjusted average assets. To be well capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of at least 6%, a Total Capital Ratio of at least 10%, and a Leverage Ratio of at least 3%, and not be subject to an FRB directive to maintain higher capital levels. Historically, Citigroup has maintained a Leverage Ratio above 5%. As Citigroup adds low risk-weighted, secured financing assets in the CIB business, the Leverage Ratio at the holding company level is expected to decline below 5%, but remain above 4%. The Leverage Ratio at each of the regulated U.S. banks is not expected to decline below 5%. The addition of these assets is not expected to materially affect any of Citigroups risk-based capital ratios. These statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. See Forward-Looking Statements on page 97. As noted in the following table, Citigroup maintained a well capitalized position during both 2006 and 2005.

Market risk-equivalent assets included in risk-adjusted assets amounted to $40.1 billion and $40.6 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Risk-adjusted assets also include the effect of other off-balance sheet exposures, such as unused loan commitments and letters of credit, and reflects deductions for certain intangible assets and any excess allowance for credit losses. 86 Table of Contents Common Equity Common stockholders equity increased approximately $7.4 billion during the year to $118.8 billion at December 31, 2006, representing 6.3% of assets. This compares to $111.4 billion and 7.5% at year-end 2005.

Additionally, on February 15, 2006, Citigroup redeemed for cash all the outstanding shares of its Fixed/Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series V. The redemption price was $50.00 per depositary share, plus accrued dividends to the date of redemption. At the date of redemption, the value of the Series V Preferred Stock was $125 million. On April 17, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized up to an additional $10 billion in share repurchases. As of December 31, 2006, $7.4 billion remained under authorized repurchase programs after the repurchase of $7.0 billion and $12.8 billion in shares during 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Mandatorily Redeemable Securities of Subsidiary Trusts Total mandatorily redeemable securities of subsidiary trusts (trust preferred securities), which qualify as Tier 1 Capital, were $9.579 billion at December 31, 2006, as compared to $6.264 billion at December 31, 2005. In 2006, Citigroup issued $1.600 billion, $1.185 billion, and $565 million of Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities through Citigroup Capital XVI, Citigroup Capital XV, and Citigroup Capital XIV, respectively. On December 8, 2006, Citigroup redeemed for cash all of the $25 million Trust Preferred Securities of Adam Capital Trust I, at the redemption price of $1,000 per preferred security plus any accrued distribution up to, but excluding, the date of redemption. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 139 for details on Citigroup Capital XIV, Citigroup Capital XV, and Citigroup Capital XVI. On February 15, 2007, Citigroup redeemed for cash all of the $300 million Trust Preferred Securities of Citicorp Capital I, $450 million of Citicorp Capital II, and $400 million of Citigroup Capital II, at the redemption price of $1,000 per preferred security plus any accrued distribution up to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The FRB has issued a final rule, with an effective date of April 11, 2005, which retains trust preferred securities in Tier 1 Capital of Bank Holding Companies (BHCs), but with stricter quantitative limits and clearer qualitative standards. Under the rule, after a five-year transition period, the aggregate amount of trust preferred securities and certain other capital elements included in Tier 1 Capital of internationally active banking organizations, such as Citigroup, would be limited to 15% of Tier 1 Capital elements, net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability. The amount of trust preferred securities and certain other elements in excess of the limit could be included in Tier 2 Capital, subject to restrictions. Under this rule, Citigroup currently would have less than 13% against the limit. The FRB granted interim capital relief for the impact of adopting SFAS 158 at December 31, 2006. The FRB and the FFIEC may propose amendments to, and issue interpretations of, risk-based capital guidelines and reporting instructions. These may affect reported capital ratios and net risk-adjusted assets.* * This is a forward-looking statement within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. See Forward-Looking Statements on page 97. 87 Table of Contents Capital Resources of Citigroups Depository Institutions Bank Consolidation Project: During 2006, Citigroup began and completed the majority of its bank consolidation project, which called for the merger of its twelve U.S.-insured depository institutions into four, as well as the reorganization of its U.S. mortgage banking business. The first phase of this project was completed in July 2006, when CitiFinancial Credit Company (CCC), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, transferred its ownership of Citicorp Trust Bank, fsb to Citigroup. The second phase occurred in October 2006, when Citigroup reduced its overall number of U.S.-insured depository institutions from twelve to five. Also during this phase, Citibank, N.A. transferred its investment in Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. (the Companys primary banking entity responsible for U.S. credit card activities) to Citigroup. In addition, a majority of the Companys U.S. consumer mortgage lending activity was consolidated within Citibank, N.A. as Citibank (West), FSB, Citibank Texas, N.A., Citibank, FSB and Citibank Delaware were merged into Citibank, N.A. The final phase of this consolidation project is expected to be completed at a later date with the merger of Citibank (Banamex USA) into Citibank, N.A. activities) to Citigroup. In addition, a majority of the Companys U.S. consumer mortgage lending activity was consolidated within Citibank, N.A. as Citibank (West), FSB, Citibank Texas, N.A., Citibank, FSB and Citibank Delaware were merged into Citibank, N.A. The final phase of this consolidation project is expected to be completed at a later date with the merger of Citibank (Banamex USA) into Citibank, N.A. Benefits achieved from reducing the number of depository institutions included optimized capital efficiency, enhanced flexibility of operations as a result of Citibank, N.A.s larger capital base, reduced regulatory complexity and improved customer relationships. Capital Ratios of Depository Institutions: Citigroups subsidiary depository institutions in the United States are subject to risk-based capital guidelines issued by their respective primary federal bank regulatory agencies, which are similar to the FRBs guidelines. To be well capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency definitions, Citigroups depository institutions must have a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of at least 6%, a Total Capital (Tier 1 + Tier 2 Capital) Ratio of at least 10% and a Leverage Ratio of at least 5%, and not be subject to a regulatory directive to meet and maintain higher capital levels. At December 31, 2006, all of Citigroups subsidiary depository institutions were well capitalized under the federal regulatory agencies definitions, including Citigroups primary depository institution, Citibank, N.A., as noted in the following table: Citibank, N.A. Regulatory Capital Ratios At year end 2006 Tier 1 Capital (1) 8.32 % Total Capital (Tier 1 and Tier 2) (1) 12.39 Leverage (1)(2) 6.09 (1) The U.S. Banking Agencies granted interim capital relief for the impact of adopting SFAS 158 at December 31, 2006. (2) Tier 1 Capital divided by adjusted average assets. Citibank, N.A. Components of Capital Under Regulatory Guidelines In billions of dollars at year end 2006 Tier 1 Capital (1) $ 59.9 Total Capital (Tier 1 and Tier 2) (1) 89.1 (1) The U.S. Banking Agencies granted interim capital relief for the impact of adopting SFAS 158 at December 31, 2006. Citibank, N.A. had net income for 2006 amounting to $9.3 billion. During 2006, Citibank, N.A. paid dividends of $3.0 billion. During 2006, Citibank, N.A. issued an additional $7.8 billion of subordinated notes that qualify for inclusion in Citibank, N.A.s Tier 2 Capital. Total subordinated notes that were outstanding at December 31, 2006 and included in Citibank, N.A.s Tier 2 Capital amounted to $23.0 billion. Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries The Companys broker-dealer subsidiaries  including Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (CGMI), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI)  are subject to various securities and commodities regulations and capital adequacy requirements of the regulatory and exchange authorities of the countries in which they operate. The Companys U.S. registered broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Securities and Exchange Commissions Net Capital Rule, Rule 15c3-1 (the Net Capital Rule) under the Exchange Act. As a registered broker-dealer, CGMI is subject to the SECs Net Capital Rule. Under the Net Capital Rule, CGMI is required to maintain minimum net capital equal to 2% of aggregate debit items, as defined. Under NYSE regulations, CGMI may be required to reduce its business if its net capital is less than 4% of aggregate debit items and may also be prohibited from expanding its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital would be less than 5% of aggregate debit items. Furthermore, the Net Capital Rule does not permit withdrawal of equity or subordinated capital if the resulting net capital would be less than 5% of aggregate debit items. During the third quarter of 2006, the SEC granted CGMI approval to compute net capital in accordance with the provisions of Appendix E of the Net Capital Rule. This methodology allows CGMI to compute market risk capital charges using internal Value-at-Risk models. Under Appendix E, CGMI is also required to hold tentative net capital in excess of $1 billion and net capital in excess of $500 million. The firm is also required to notify the SEC in the event that its tentative net capital is less than $5 billion. Compliance with the Net Capital Rule could limit those operations of CGMI that require the intensive use of capital, such as underwriting and trading activities and the financing of customer account balances, and also restrict CGMHIs ability to withdraw capital from its broker-dealer subsidiaries, which in turn could limit CGMHIs ability to pay dividends and make payments on its debt. At December 31, 2006, CGMI had net capital, computed in accordance with the Net Capital Rule, of $8.0 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement by $7.3 billion. In addition, certain of the Companys broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the other countries in which they do business, including requirements to maintain specified levels of net capital or its equivalent. The Companys broker-dealer subsidiaries were in compliance with their capital requirements at December 31, 2006. See further discussions on Capital Requirements on page 169. Regulatory Capital Standards Developments Citigroup generally supports the move to a new set of risk-based regulatory capital standards, published on June 26, 2004 (and subsequently amended in November 2005) by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee), consisting of central banks and bank supervisors from 13 countries. The international version of the Basel II framework will allow 88 Table of Contents Citigroup to leverage internal risk models used to measure credit, operational, and market risk exposures to drive regulatory capital calculations. On September 30, 2005, the U.S. banking regulators delayed the U.S. implementation of Basel II by one year. The current U.S. implementation timetable consists of parallel calculations under the current regulatory capital regime (Basel I) and Basel II, starting January 1, 2008, and an implementation transition period, starting January 1, 2009 through year-end 2011 or possibly later. The U.S. regulators have also reserved the right to change how Basel II is applied in the U.S., and retain the existing Prompt Corrective Action and leverage capital requirements applicable to U.S. banking organizations. The new timetable, clarifications, and other proposals are set forth in a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) issued on September 25, 2006, which contains a number of material differences from the international version of Basel II. Citigroup continues to monitor, analyze and comment on the developing capital standards in the U.S. and in countries where Citigroup has significant presence, in order to assess their collective impact and allocate project management and funding resources accordingly. LIQUIDITY Overview At the Holding Company level for Citigroup, for CGMHI, and for the Combined Holding Company and CGMHI, Citigroup maintains sufficient liquidity to meet all maturing unsecured debt obligations due within a one-year time horizon without accessing the unsecured markets. Management of Liquidity Management of liquidity at Citigroup is the responsibility of the Head of Corporate Finance and Treasury. A uniform liquidity risk management policy exists for Citigroup and its major operating subsidiaries. Under this policy, there is a single set of standards for the measurement of liquidity risk in order to ensure consistency across businesses, stability in methodologies and transparency of risk. Management of liquidity at each operating subsidiary and/or country is performed on a daily basis and is monitored by Corporate Treasury and independent risk management. The basis of Citigroups liquidity management is strong decentralized liquidity management at each of its principal operating subsidiaries and in each of its countries, combined with an active corporate oversight function. As discussed in Capital Resources and Liquidity on page 86, Citigroups FinALCO undertakes this oversight responsibility, along with the Head of Corporate Finance and Treasury. One of the objectives of the FinALCO is to monitor and review the overall liquidity and balance sheet positions of Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries. Similarly, Asset and Liability Committees are also established for each country and/or major line of business. Monitoring Liquidity Each principal operating subsidiary and/or country must prepare an annual funding and liquidity plan for review by the Head of Corporate Finance and Treasury and approval by independent risk management. The funding and liquidity plan includes analysis of the balance sheet, as well as the economic and business conditions impacting the liquidity of the major operating subsidiary and/or country. As part of the funding and liquidity plan, liquidity limits, liquidity ratios, market triggers, and assumptions for periodic stress tests are established and approved. Liquidity Limits Liquidity limits establish boundaries for market access in business-as-usual conditions and are monitored against the liquidity position on a daily basis. These limits are established based on the size of the balance sheet, depth of the market, experience level of local management, stability of the liabilities, and liquidity of the assets. Finally, the limits are subject to the evaluation of the entities stress test results. Generally, limits are established such that in stress scenarios, entities are self-funded or net providers of liquidity. Liquidity Ratios A series of standard corporate-wide liquidity ratios have been established to monitor the structural elements of Citigroups liquidity. For bank entities, these include cash capital (defined as core deposits, long-term debt, and capital compared with illiquid assets), liquid assets against liquidity gaps, core deposits to loans, long-term assets to long-term liabilities, and deposits to loans. Several measures exist to review potential concentrations of funding by individual name, product, industry, or geography. At the Holding Company level for Citigroup, for CGMHI and for the Combined Holding Company and CGMHI, ratios are established for liquid assets against short-term obligations. Triggers for management discussion, which may result in other actions, have been established against these ratios. In addition, each individual major operating subsidiary or country establishes targets against these ratios and may monitor other ratios as approved in its funding and liquidity plan. Market Triggers Market triggers are internal or external market or economic factors that may imply a change to market liquidity or Citigroups access to the markets. Citigroup market triggers are monitored by the Head of Corporate Finance and Treasury and the Head of Risk Oversight and are discussed in the FinALCO. Appropriate market triggers are also established and monitored for each major operating subsidiary and/or country as part of the funding and liquidity plans. Local triggers are reviewed with the local country or business ALCO and independent risk management. Stress Testing Simulated liquidity stress testing is periodically performed for each major operating subsidiary and/or country. The scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources, credit ratings, contingent uses of funding, and political and economic conditions in certain countries. The results of stress tests of individual countries and operating subsidiaries are reviewed to ensure that each individual major operating subsidiary or country is either self-funded or a net provider of liquidity. In addition, a Contingency Funding Plan is prepared on a periodic basis for Citigroup. The plan includes detailed policies, procedures, roles and responsibilities, and the results of corporate stress tests. The product of these stress tests is a series of alternatives that can be used by the Head of Corporate Finance and Treasury in a liquidity event. CGMHI monitors liquidity by tracking asset levels, collateral and funding availability to maintain flexibility to meet its financial commitments. As a policy, CGMHI attempts to maintain sufficient capital and funding sources in order to have the capacity to finance itself on a fully collateralized basis in the event that its access to uncollateralized financing is temporarily impaired. This is documented in CGMHIs contingency funding plan. This plan is reviewed periodically to keep the funding options current and in line with market conditions. The management of this plan includes an analysis used to determine CGMHIs ability to withstand varying levels of stress, 89 Table of Contents including rating downgrades, which could impact its liquidation horizons and required margins. CGMHI maintains liquidity reserves of cash and loan value of unencumbered securities in excess of its outstanding short-term uncollateralized liabilities. This is monitored on a daily basis. CGMHI also ensures that long-term illiquid assets are funded with long-term liabilities. FUNDING Overview As a financial holding company, substantially all of Citigroups net earnings are generated within its operating subsidiaries. These subsidiaries make funds available to Citigroup, primarily in the form of dividends. Certain subsidiaries dividend paying abilities may be limited by covenant restrictions in credit agreements, regulatory requirements and/or rating agency requirements that also impact their capitalization levels. Banking Subsidiaries There are various legal limitations on the ability of Citigroups subsidiary depository institutions to extend credit, pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to Citigroup and its nonbank subsidiaries. The approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, in the case of national banks, or the Office of Thrift Supervision, in the case of federal savings banks, is required if total dividends declared in any calendar year exceed amounts specified by the applicable agencys regulations. State-chartered depository institutions are subject to dividend limitations imposed by applicable state law. As of December 31, 2006, Citigroups subsidiary depository institutions can declare dividends to their parent companies, without regulatory approval, of approximately $17.7 billion. In determining the dividends, each depository institution must also consider its effect on applicable risk-based capital and Leverage Ratio requirements, as well as policy statements of the federal regulatory agencies that indicate that banking organizations should generally pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Consistent with these considerations, Citigroup estimates that, as of December 31, 2006, its subsidiary depository institutions can distribute dividends to Citigroup of approximately $11.0 billion of the available $17.7 billion. Non-Banking Subsidiaries Citigroup also receives dividends from its nonbank subsidiaries. These nonbank subsidiaries are generally not subject to regulatory restrictions on dividends. As discussed in Capital Resources and Liquidity on page 86, the ability of CGMHI to declare dividends can be restricted by capital considerations of its broker-dealer subsidiaries. During 2007, it is not anticipated that any restrictions on the subsidiaries dividending capability will restrict Citigroups ability to meet its obligations as and when they become due.* Sources of Liquidity Primary sources of liquidity for Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries include:  deposits;  collateralized financing transactions;  senior and subordinated debt;  commercial paper;  trust preferred securities; and  purchased/wholesale funds. Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries also generate funds through securitizing financial assets, including credit card receivables and single-family or multi-family residences. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 143 for additional information about securitization activities. Finally, Citigroups net earnings provide a significant source of funding to the corporation. Citigroups funding sources are well diversified across funding types and geography, a benefit of the strength of the global franchise. Funding for the parent and its major operating subsidiaries includes a large geographically diverse retail and corporate deposit base of $712.0 billion. A significant portion of these deposits has been, and is expected to be, long-term and stable and is considered core. Citigroup and its subsidiaries have a significant presence in the global capital markets. During the 2005 second quarter, Citigroup consolidated its capital markets funding activities into two legal entities: (i) Citigroup Inc., which issues long-term debt, medium-term notes, trust preferred securities, and preferred and common stock; and (ii) Citigroup Funding Inc. (CFI), a first-tier subsidiary of Citigroup, which issues commercial paper, medium- term notes and structured equity-linked and credit-linked notes, all of which are guaranteed by Citigroup. As part of the funding consolidation, Citigroup also guaranteed and continues to guarantee various debt obligations of CGMHI as well as all of the outstanding debt obligations under CGMHIs publicly-issued securities. In August 2005, Citigroup merged its two intermediate bank holding companies, Citigroup Holdings Company and Citicorp, into Citigroup Inc. Coincident with this merger, Citigroup assumed all existing indebtedness and outstanding guarantees of Citicorp. As a result, Citigroup also guaranteed various debt obligations of Associates and of CitiFinancial Credit Company, each an indirect subsidiary of Citigroup. In addition, Citigroup guaranteed various debt obligations of Citigroup Finance Canada Inc. (CFCI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Associates. CFCI continues to issue debt in the Canadian market supported by a Citigroup guarantee. See Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 156 for further discussions. Other significant elements of long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet include collateralized advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank system, asset-backed outstandings, and certain borrowings of foreign subsidiaries. CGMHIs consolidated balance sheet is highly liquid, with the vast majority of its assets consisting of marketable securities and collateralized short-term financing agreements arising from securities transactions. The highly liquid nature of these assets provides CGMHI with flexibility in financing and managing its business. CGMHI monitors and evaluates the adequacy of its capital and borrowing base on a daily basis to maintain liquidity, and to ensure that its capital base supports the regulatory capital requirements of its subsidiaries. Citigroup uses its liquidity to service debt obligations, to pay dividends to its stockholders, to support organic growth, to fund acquisitions and to repurchase its shares, pursuant to Board of Directors approved plans. Each of Citigroups major operating subsidiaries finances its operations on a basis consistent with its capitalization, regulatory structure and the environment in which it operates. Particular attention is paid to those businesses that for tax, sovereign risk, or regulatory reasons cannot be freely and readily funded in the international markets. * This is a forward-looking statement within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. See Forward-Looking Statements on page 97. 90 Table of Contents Citigroups borrowings are diversified by geography, investor, instrument and currency. Decisions regarding the ultimate currency and interest rate profile of liquidity generated through these borrowings can be separated from the actual issuance through the use of derivative financial products. At December 31, 2006, long-term debt and commercial paper outstanding for Citigroup Parent Company, CGMHI, Citigroup Funding Inc. and Citigroups Subsidiaries were as follows: In billions of dollars CitigroupParentCompany CGMHI CitigroupFundingInc. Other CitigroupSubsidiaries Long-term debt $ 125.4 $ 28.7 $ 18.8 $ 115.6 (1) Commercial paper   $ 41.8 $ 1.9 (1) At December 31, 2006, approximately $81.5 billion relates to collateralized advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 139 for further detail on long-term debt and commercial paper outstanding. Citigroups ability to access the capital markets and other sources of wholesale funds, as well as the cost of these funds, is highly dependent on its credit ratings. The table below indicates the current ratings for Citigroup. Citigroups Debt Ratings as of December 31, 2006 Citigroup Inc. Citigroup Funding Inc. Citibank, N.A.

The subordinated debt ratings of Citigroup and Citigroup Funding Inc (CFI) were upgraded to AA- from A+. The long-term rating of Citibank, N.A. was upgraded to AA+ from AA. On September 26, 2006, Moodys Investors Service upgraded Citibank, N.A.s long-term rating to Aaa from Aa1. The outlook for all of Citigroups ratings is stable. Some of Citigroups nonbank subsidiaries, including CGMHI, have credit facilities with Citigroups subsidiary depository institutions, including Citibank, N.A. Borrowings under these facilities must be secured in accordance with Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. There are various legal restrictions on the extent to which a bank holding company and certain of its nonbank subsidiaries can borrow or obtain credit from Citigroups subsidiary depository institutions or engage in certain other transactions with them. In general, these restrictions require that transactions be on arms-length terms and be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 139. Contractual Obligations The following table includes aggregated information about Citigroups contractual obligations that impact its short- and long-term liquidity and capital needs. The table includes information about payments due under specified contractual obligations, aggregated by type of contractual obligation. It includes the maturity profile of the Companys consolidated long-term debt, operating leases and other long-term liabilities. The Companys capital lease obligations are not material and are included within purchase obligations in the table. Citigroups contractual obligations include purchase obligations that are enforceable and legally binding for the Company. For the purposes of the table below, purchase obligations are included through the termination date of the respective agreements, even if the contract is renewable. Many of the purchase agreements for goods or services include clauses that would allow the Company to cancel the agreement with specified notice; however, that impact is not included in the table (unless Citigroup has already notified the counterparty of its intention to terminate the agreement). Other liabilities reflected on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet include obligations for goods and services that have already been received, litigation settlements, as well as other long-term liabilities that have been incurred and will ultimately be paid in cash. Excluded from the following table are obligations that are generally short-term in nature, including deposit liabilities and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. The table also excludes certain insurance and investment contracts subject to mortality and morbidity risks or without defined maturities, such that the timing of payments and withdrawals is uncertain. The liabilities related to these insurance and investment contracts are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as Insurance Policy and Claims Reserves, Contractholder Funds, and Separate and Variable Accounts. 91 Table of Contents Citigroups funding policy for pension plans is generally to fund to the minimum amounts required by the applicable laws and regulations. At December 31, 2006, there were no minimum required contributions, and no contributions are currently planned for the U.S. pension plans. Accordingly, no amounts have been included in the table below for future contributions to the U.S. pension plans. For the non-U.S. plans, discretionary contributions in 2007 are anticipated to be approximately $123 million and this amount has been included within purchase obligations in the table below.* The estimated pension plan contributions are subject to change, since contribution decisions are affected by various factors such as market performance, regulatory and legal requirements, and managements ability to change funding policy. For additional information regarding the Companys retirement benefit obligations, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 124.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Overview Citigroup and its subsidiaries are involved with several types of off-balance sheet arrangements, including special purpose entities (SPEs), lines and letters of credit, and loan commitments. The securitization process enhances the liquidity of the financial markets, may spread credit risk among several market participants, and makes new funds available to extend credit to consumers and commercial entities. Uses of SPEs In order to execute securitizations, the Company uses SPEs. An SPE is an entity in the form of a trust or other legal vehicle designed to fulfill a specific limited need of the company that organized it. The principal uses of SPEs are to obtain liquidity and favorable capital treatment by securitizing certain of Citigroups financial assets, to assist clients in securitizing their financial assets, and to create investment products for clients. SPEs may be organized as trusts, partnerships, or corporations. In a securitization, the company transferring assets to an SPE converts those assets into cash before they would have been realized in the normal course of business, through the SPEs issuing debt and equity instruments, certificates, commercial paper, and other notes of indebtedness. Investors usually have recourse to the assets in the SPE and often benefit from other credit enhancements, such as a collateral account or overcollateralization in the form of excess assets in the SPE, or from a liquidity facility, such as a line of credit or asset purchase agreement. Accordingly, the SPE can typically obtain a more favorable credit rating from rating agencies than the transferor could obtain for its own debt issuances, resulting in less expensive financing costs. The SPE may also enter into derivative contracts in order to convert the yield or currency of the underlying assets to match the needs of the SPE investors, or to limit or change the credit risk of the SPE. Citigroup may be the counterparty to these derivatives. SPEs may be Qualifying SPEs (QSPEs) or variable interest entities (VIEs) or neither. A VIE is a type of SPE that does not have sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from third parties. Its investors may not have the power to make significant decisions about the entitys operations, or investors may not share pro rata in the entitys expected returns or losses. The Companys credit card receivable and mortgage loan securitizations are organized as QSPEs and are, therefore, not VIEs subject to FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (revised December 2003), (FIN 46-R). When an entity is deemed a VIE under FIN 46-R, the entity in question must be consolidated by the primary beneficiary; however, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of most of these entities and as such does not consolidate most of them. Securitization of Citigroups Assets In some of these off-balance sheet arrangements, including credit card receivable and mortgage loan securitizations, Citigroup is securitizing assets that were previously recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. A summary of certain cash flows received from and paid to securitization trusts is included in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 143. Credit Card Receivables Credit card receivables are securitized through trusts, which are established to purchase the receivables. Citigroup sells receivables into the trusts on a non-recourse basis. Credit card securitizations are revolving securitizations; that is, as customers pay their credit card balances, the cash proceeds are used to purchase new receivables and replenish the receivables in the trust. CGMI is one of several underwriters that distribute securities issued by the trusts to investors. The Company relies on securitizations to fund a significant portion of its managed U.S. Cards business, which includes both on-balance sheet and securitized receivables. * This is a forward-looking statement within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. See Forward-Looking Statements on page 97. 92 Table of Contents The following table reflects amounts related to the Companys securitized credit card receivables at December 31: In billions of dollars 2006 2005 Principal amount of credit card receivables in trusts $ 112.4 $ 107.7 Ownership interests in principal amount of trust credit card receivables: Sold to investors via trust-issued securities 93.1 92.1 Retained by Citigroup as trust-issued securities 5.1 4.0 Retained by Citigroup via non-certificated interest recorded as consumer loans 14.2 11.6 Total ownership interests in principal amount of trust credit card receivables $ 112.4 $ 107.7 Other amounts recorded on the balance sheet related to interests retained in the trusts: Amounts receivable from trusts $ 4.5 $ 3.4 Amounts payable to trusts 1.7 1.6 Residual interest retained in trust cash flows 2.5 2.1 The Company recorded net gains from securitization of credit card receivables of $1.0 billion and $1.0 billion during 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net gains reflect the following:  incremental gains from new securitizations  the reversal of the allowance for loan losses associated with receivables sold  net gains on replenishments of the trust assets  offset by other-than-temporary impairments. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 143 for additional information regarding the Companys securitization activities. Mortgages and Other Assets The Company provides a wide range of mortgage and other loan products to its customers. In addition to providing a source of liquidity and less expensive funding, securitizing these assets also reduces the Companys credit exposure to the borrowers. The Companys mortgage loan securitizations are primarily non-recourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchasers of the securities issued by the trust. In addition to servicing rights, the Company also retains a residual interest in its student loan and other asset securitizations, consisting of securities and interest-only strips that arise from the calculation of gain or loss at the time assets are sold to the SPE. The Company recognized gains related to the securitization of mortgages and other assets of $388 million and $323 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Securitization of Client Assets The Company acts as an intermediary for its corporate clients, assisting them in obtaining liquidity by selling their trade receivables or other financial assets to an SPE. In addition, Citigroup administers several third-party-owned, special purpose, multi-seller finance companies that purchase pools of trade receivables, credit card receivables, and other financial assets from its clients. As administrator, the Company provides accounting, funding, and operations services to these conduits but has no ownership interest. Generally, the clients continue to service the transferred assets. The conduits asset purchases are funded by issuing commercial paper and medium-term notes. Clients absorb the first losses of the conduits by providing collateral in the form of excess assets or holding a residual interest. The Company, along with other financial institutions, provides liquidity facilities, such as commercial paper backstop lines of credit to the conduits. The Company also provides loss enhancement in the form of letters of credit and other guarantees. All fees are charged on a market basis. During 2003 many of the conduits issued first loss subordinated notes to third-party investors so that such investors in each conduit would be deemed the primary beneficiary under FIN 46-R, and would consolidate that conduit. At December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, total assets and liabilities in the unconsolidated conduits were $66 billion and $55 billion, respectively. Creation of Other Investment and Financing Products In addition to securitizations of mortgage loans originated by the Company, the Company also securitizes purchased mortgage loans, creating collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and other mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) and distributes them to investors. In 2006 and 2005, respectively, the Company organized 33 and 36 mortgage securitizations with assets of $24 billion and $25 billion. For 2006 and 2005, the Companys revenues for these activities were $758 million and $483 million, respectively, and estimated expenses before taxes were $151 million and $116 million. Expenses have been estimated based upon a percentage of product revenues to total business revenues. The Company packages and securitizes assets purchased in the financial markets in order to create new security offerings, including arbitrage collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and synthetic CDOs for institutional clients and retail customers, which match the clients investment needs and preferences. Typically these instruments diversify investors risk to a pool of assets as compared with investments in individual assets. The VIEs, which are issuers of CDO securities, are generally organized as limited liability corporations. The Company typically receives fees for structuring and/or distributing the securities sold to investors. In some cases, the Company may repackage the investment with higher-rated debt CDO securities or U.S. Treasury securities to provide a greater or a very high degree of certainty of the return of invested principal. A third-party manager is typically retained by the VIE to select collateral for inclusion in the pool and then actively manage it, or, in other cases, only to manage work-out credits. The Company may also provide other financial services and/or products to the VIEs for market-rate fees. These may include: the provision of liquidity or contingent liquidity facilities, interest rate or foreign exchange hedges and credit derivative instruments, as well as the purchasing and warehousing of securities until they are sold to the SPE. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs under FIN 46-R due to its limited continuing involvement and, as a result, we do not consolidate their assets and liabilities in our financial statements. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 143 for additional information about off-balance sheet arrangements. 93 Table of Contents Credit Commitments and Lines of Credit The table below summarizes Citigroups credit commitments: In millions of dollars at year end 2006 2005 Financial standby letters of credit and foreign office guarantees $ 72,548 $ 52,384 Performance standby letters of credit and foreign office guarantees 15,802 13,946 Commercial and similar letters of credit 7,861 5,790 One- to four-family residential mortgages 3,457 3,343 Revolving open-end loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties 32,449 25,089 Commercial real estate, construction and land development 4,007 2,283 Credit card lines (1) 987,409 859,504 Commercial and other consumer loan commitments (2) 439,931 346,444 Total $ 1,563,464 $ 1,308,783 (1) Credit card lines are unconditionally cancelable by the issuer.

See Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 151 for additional information on credit commitments and lines of credit. U.S. CONSUMER MORTGAGE LENDING The following charts present the characteristics of Citigroups first and second U.S. mortgage loan portfolio as of December 31, 2006: Interest Rate Risk Associated with Consumer Mortgage Lending Activity Citigroup originates and funds mortgage loans. As with all other lending activity, this exposes Citigroup to several risks, including credit, liquidity and interest rate risks. To manage credit and liquidity risk, Citigroup sells most of the mortgage loans it originates, but retains the servicing. These sale transactions create an intangible asset referred to as mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). The fair value of this asset is primarily affected by changes in prepayments that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates. Thus, by retaining the servicing rights of sold mortgage loans, Citigroup is still exposed to interest rate risk. In managing this risk, Citigroup hedges a significant portion of the value of its MSRs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts, forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed securities, and purchased securities classified as available-for-sale or trading (primarily fixed income debt, such as U.S. government and agencies obligations, and mortgage-backed securities including principal-only strips). Since the change in the value of these hedging instruments does not perfectly match the change in the value of the MSRs, Citigroup is still exposed to what is commonly referred to as basis risk. Citigroup manages this risk by reviewing the mix of the various hedging instruments referred to above on a daily basis. Prior to January 1, 2006, the portion of the MSRs that were hedged with instruments qualifying for hedge accounting under SFAS 133 was recorded at fair value. The remaining portion of the MSRs, which was hedged with instruments that did not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133 or were unhedged, were accounted for at the lower-of-cost-or-market. With the adoption of SFAS 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets (SFAS 156) as of January 1, 2006, the Company records all MSRs at fair value. Citigroups MSRs totaled $5.439 billion and $4.339 billion, at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. For additional information about the Companys MSRs, see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 143. As part of the mortgage lending activity, Citigroup commonly enters into purchase commitments to fund residential mortgage loans at specific interest rates within a given period of time, generally up to 60 days after the rate has been set. If the resulting loans from these commitments will be classified as loans-held-for-sale, Citigroup accounts for the commitments as derivatives under SFAS 133. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these commitments, which are driven by changes in mortgage interest rates, are recognized in current earnings after taking into consideration the likelihood that the commitment will be funded. However, a value is not assigned to the MSRs until after the loans have been funded and sold. Citigroup hedges its exposure to the change in the value of these commitments by utilizing hedging instruments similar to those referred to above. 94 Table of Contents PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS The Company has several non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and has various defined benefit pension and termination indemnity plans covering employees outside the United States. The U.S. defined benefit plan provides benefits under a cash balance formula. Employees satisfying certain age and service requirements remain covered by a prior final pay formula. The Company also offers postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain eligible U.S. retired employees, as well as to certain eligible employees outside the United States. The following table shows the pension expense and contributions for Citigroups plans: U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans In millions of dollars 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Pension expense (1) $ 182 $ 237 $ 196 $ 115 $ 182 $ 185 Company contributions (2)  160 400 382 379 524 (1) The 2006 expense for the U.S. plans includes an $80 million curtailment gain recognized as of September 30, 2006 relating to the Companys decision to freeze benefit accruals for all cash balance participants after 2007. (2) In addition, the Company absorbed $20 million, $19 million and $18 million during 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, relating to certain investment management fees and administration costs for the U.S. plans, which are excluded from this table. The following table shows the combined postretirement expense and contributions for Citigroups U.S. and foreign plans: U.S. and Non-U.S. Plans In millions of dollars 2006 2005 2004 Postretirement expense $ 71 $ 73 $ 75 Company contributions 260 226 216 Expected Rate of Return Upon the adoption of SFAS 158 at December 31, 2006, the Company recorded an after-tax charge to equity of $1.647 billion, which corresponds to the plans net pension liability and the write-off of the existing prepaid asset, which relates to unamortized actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs/benefits and transition assets/liabilities. Citigroup determines its assumptions for the expected rate of return on plan assets for its U.S. pension and postretirement plans using a building block approach, which focuses on ranges of anticipated rates of return for each asset class. A weighted range of nominal rates is then determined based on target allocations to each asset class. Citigroup considers the expected rate of return to be a long-term assessment of return expectations and does not anticipate changing this assumption annually unless there are significant changes in investment strategy or economic conditions. This contrasts with the selection of the discount rate, future compensation increase rate, and certain other assumptions, which are reconsidered annually in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The expected rate of return was 8.0% at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, reflecting the performance of the global capital markets. Actual returns in 2006, 2005 and 2004 were more than the expected returns. The expected returns impacted pretax earnings by 2.9%, 2.7% and 3.3%, respectively. This expected amount reflects the expected annual appreciation of the plan assets and reduces the obligation of the Company. It is deducted from the service cost, interest and other components of pension expense to arrive at the net pension expense. Net pension expense for 2006, 2005 and 2004 reflects deductions of $845 million, $806 million and $750 million of expected returns, respectively. The following table shows the expected versus actual rate of return on plan assets for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans: 2006 2005 2004 Expected rate of return 8.0 % 8.0 % 8.0 % Actual rate of return 14.7 % 9.7 % 11.5 % For the foreign plans, pension expense for 2006 was reduced by the expected return of $384 million, which impacted pretax earnings by 1.3%. Pension expense for 2005 and 2004 was reduced by expected returns of $315 million and $251 million, respectively. Actual returns were higher in 2006, 2005 and 2004 than the expected returns in those years. Discount Rate The 2006 discount rates for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans were selected by reference to a Citigroup-specific analysis using each plans specific cash flows and compared with the Moodys Aa Long-Term Corporate Bond Yield for reasonableness. As of September 30, 2006, the U.S. pension plan was remeasured to reflect the freeze of benefits accruals for all non-grandfathered participants, effective January 1, 2008. Under the September 30th remeasurement and year-end analysis, the resulting plan-specific discount rate for the pension plan was 5.86%. Citigroups policy is to round to the nearest tenth of a percent. Accordingly, at September 30, 2006 and December 31, 2006, the discount rate was set at 5.9% for the pension plans and, as of December 31, 2006, the discount rate was set at 5.7% for the postretirement welfare plans. At December 31, 2005, the Moodys Aa Long-Term Corporate Bond Yield was 5.63% and the discount rate was set at 5.6% for the pension plans and 5.5% for the postretirement plans, rounding to the nearest tenth of a percent, after giving consideration to a Citigroup-specific cash flow analysis. The discount rates for the foreign pension and postretirement plans are selected by reference to high-quality corporate bond rates in countries that have developed corporate bond markets. However, where developed corporate bond markets do not exist, the discount rates are selected by reference to local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect the additional risk for corporate bonds. For additional information on the pension and postretirement plans, and on discount rates used in determining pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net benefit expense for the Companys plans, as well as the effects of a one percentage-point change in the expected rates of return and the discount rates, see Note 9 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements on page 124. 95 Table of Contents CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Corporate Governance Citigroup has a Code of Conduct that maintains the Companys commitment to the highest standards of conduct. The Company has established an ethics hotline for employees. The Code of Conduct is supplemented by a Code of Ethics for Financial Professionals (including finance, accounting, treasury, tax and investor relations professionals) that applies worldwide. Both the Code of Conduct and the Code of Ethics for Financial Professionals can be found on the Citigroup Web site, www.citigroup.com, by clicking on the Corporate Governance page. The Companys Corporate Governance Guidelines and the charters for the Audit and Risk Management Committee, the Nomination and Governance Committee, the Personnel and Compensation Committee, and the Public Affairs Committee of the Board are also available under the Corporate Governance page, or by writing to Citigroup Inc., Corporate Governance, 425 Park Avenue, 2nd Floor, New York, New York 10043. Controls and Procedures Disclosure The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed under the Exchange Act securities laws is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure and appropriate SEC filings. The Companys Disclosure Committee is responsible for ensuring that there is an adequate and effective process for establishing, maintaining and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures for the Companys external disclosures. The Companys management, with the participation of the Companys CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2006 and, based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that at that date the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Financial Reporting The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process under the supervision of the CEO and CFO, and effected by Citigroups Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. These controls include policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Companys management and directors; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Citigroup has had a longstanding process whereby business and financial officers throughout the Company attest to the accuracy of financial information reported in corporate systems as well as the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure processes.

Additional Minimum Liability (AML)Recognition of an additional minimum liability is required when the ABO exceeds pension plan assets and the liability for accrued pension cost already recognized is insufficient. Upon the adoption of SFAS 158 at December 31, 2006, AMLs are no longer required to be recognized. APB 23 BenefitIn accordance with paragraph 31a of SFAS 109, a deferred tax liability is not recognized for the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis of an investment in a foreign subsidiary unless it becomes apparent that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future. Assets Under Management (AUMs)Assets held by Citigroup in a fiduciary capacity for clients. These assets are not included on Citigroups balance sheet.

Accounts enrolled in the program automatically have their cash balances invested, or swept, into interest-bearing, FDIC-insured deposit accounts at Citigroup-affiliated banks. Cash-Basis FormulaA formula, within a defined benefit plan, that defines the ultimate benefit as a hypothetical account balance based on annual benefit credits and interest earnings. Cash-Basis LoansLoans in which the borrower has fallen behind in interest payments are considered impaired and are classified as non-performing or non-accrual assets. In situations where the lender reasonably expects that only a portion of the principal and interest owed ultimately will be collected, all payments are credited directly to the outstanding principal. Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs)An investment-grade security backed by a pool of bonds, loans, or other assets. Credit Default SwapAn agreement between two parties whereby one party pays the other a fixed coupon over a specified term. The other party makes no payment unless a specified credit event such as a default occurs, at which time a payment is made and the swap terminates. Deferred Tax AssetAn asset attributable to deductible temporary differences and carryforwards. A deferred tax asset is measured using the applicable enacted tax rate and provisions of the enacted tax law. Deferred Tax LiabilityA liability attributable to taxable temporary differences. A deferred tax liability is measured using the applicable enacted tax rate and provisions of the enacted tax law. Defined Benefit PlanA retirement plan under which the benefits paid are based on a specific formula. The formula is usually a function of age, service and compensation. A non-contributory plan does not require employee contributions. DerivativeA contract or agreement whose value is derived from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, prices of securities or commodities, or financial or commodity indices. Federal FundsNon-interest-bearing deposits held by member banks at the Federal Reserve Bank. Foregone InterestInterest on cash-basis loans that would have been earned at the original contractual rate if the loans were on accrual status. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)Accounting rules and conventions defining acceptable practices in preparing financial statements in the United States of America.

Managed Average YieldGross managed interest revenue earned, divided by average managed loans. Managed BasisManaged basis presentation includes results from both on-balance sheet loans and off-balance sheet loans, and excludes the impact of card securitization activity. Managed basis disclosures assume that securitized loans have not been sold and present the result of the securitized loans in the same manner as the Companys owned loans. Managed LoansIncludes loans classified as Loans on the balance sheet plus loans held-for-sale that are included in other assets plus securitized receivables. These are primarily credit card receivables. Managed Net Credit LossesNet credit losses adjusted for the effect of credit card securitizations. See Managed Loans. Market-Related Value of Plan AssetsA balance used to calculate the expected return on pension-plan assets. Market-related value can be either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years. Minority InterestWhen a parent owns a majority (but less than 100%) of a subsidiarys stock, the Consolidated Financial Statements must reflect the minoritys interest in the subsidiary. The minority interest as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Income is equal to the minoritys proportionate share of the subsidiarys net income and, as included within other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, is equal to the minoritys proportionate share of the subsidiarys net assets. Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)An intangible asset representing servicing rights retained in the securitization of mortgage loans. Net Credit LossesGross credit losses (write-offs) less gross credit recoveries. Net Credit Loss RatioAnnualized net credit losses divided by average loans outstanding.

The net cash flows include collections of interest income and fee revenue in excess of the interest paid to securitization trust investors, reduced by net credit losses, servicing fees, and other costs related to the securitized receivables. Net Interest Revenue (NIR)Interest revenue less interest expense. Net Interest MarginInterest revenue less interest expense divided by average interest-earning assets.

Notional AmountThe principal balance of a derivative contract used as a reference to calculate the amount of interest or other payments. On-Balance Sheet LoansLoans originated or purchased by the Company that reside on the balance sheet at the date of the balance sheet.

QSPE status allows the seller to remove assets transferred to the QSPE from its books, achieving sale accounting. QSPEs are not consolidated by the seller or the investors in the QSPE. Return on AssetsAnnualized income divided by average assets. Return on Common EquityAnnualized income less preferred stock dividends, divided by average common equity. Return on Invested CapitalAnnualized net income, adjusted to exclude the effects of capital charges on goodwill and intangibles, divided by average invested capital, which consists of risk capital plus goodwill and intangibles. Return on Risk CapitalAnnualized net income, divided by average risk capital. Risk CapitalRisk capital is a management metric defined as the amount of capital required to absorb potential unexpected economic volatility. Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell (Reverse Repo Agreements)An agreement between a seller and a buyer, generally of government or agency securities, whereby the buyer agrees to purchase the securities and the seller agrees to repurchase them at an agreed-upon price at a future date. Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase (Repurchase Agreements)An agreement between a seller and a buyer, generally of government or agency securities, whereby the seller agrees to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price at a future date.

Standby Letter of CreditAn obligation issued by a bank on behalf of a bank customer to a third party where the bank promises to pay the third party, contingent upon the failure by the banks customer to perform under the terms of the underlying contract with the beneficiary, or it obligates the bank to guarantee or stand as a surety for the benefit of the third party to the extent permitted by law or regulation. SecuritizationsA process by which a legal entity issues to investors certain securities which pay a return based on the principal and interest cash flows from a pool of loans or other financial assets. Tier 1 and Tier 2 CapitalTier 1 Capital includes common stockholders equity (excluding certain components of other comprehensive income), qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying mandatorily redeemable securities of subsidiary trusts, and minority interests that are held by others, less certain intangible assets. Tier 2 Capital includes, among other items, perpetual preferred stock to the extent that it does not qualify for Tier 1, qualifying senior and subordinated debt, limited-life preferred stock, and the allowance for credit losses, subject to certain limitations. Unearned CompensationThe unamortized portion of a grant to employees of restricted or deferred stock measured at the market value on the date of grant. Unearned compensation is displayed as a reduction of stockholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Unfunded CommitmentsLegally binding agreements to provide financing at a future date. Variable Interest Entity (VIE)An entity that does not have enough equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from third parties. VIEs may include entities with equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entitys operations. A VIE must be consolidated by its primary beneficiary, if any, which is the party that has the majority of the expected losses or residual returns of the VIE or both. 99 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The management of Citigroup is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Citigroups internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management maintains a comprehensive system of controls intended to ensure that transactions are executed in accordance with managements authorization, assets are safeguarded, and financial records are reliable. Management also takes steps to ensure that information and communication flows are effective, and to monitor performance, including performance of internal control procedures. Citigroup management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2006, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been audited by KPMG LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page 101, which expressed unqualified opinions on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. 100 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMINTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Board of Directors and Stockholders Citigroup Inc.: We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting that Citigroup Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company or Citigroup) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that Citigroup maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also, in our opinion, Citigroup maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Citigroup as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, and our report dated February 23, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. New York, New York February 23, 2007 101 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Board of Directors and Stockholders Citigroup Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Citigroup Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company or Citigroup) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, and the related consolidated balance sheets of Citibank, N.A. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Citigroup as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, and the financial position of Citibank, N.A. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2006 the Company changed its methods of accounting for defined benefit pensions and other postretirement benefits, stock-based compensation, certain hybrid financial instruments and servicing of financial assets, and in 2005 the Company changed its method of accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations associated with operating leases. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Citigroups internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 23, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

See Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 108 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Citigroup Inc. and Subsidiaries 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Citigroup and its subsidiaries (the Company). The Company consolidates subsidiaries in which it holds, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights or where it exercises control. Entities where the Company holds 20% to 50% of the voting rights and/or has the ability to exercise significant influence, other than investments of designated venture capital subsidiaries, are accounted for under the equity method, and the pro rata share of their income (loss) is included in other revenue. Income from investments in less than 20%-owned companies is recognized when dividends are received. As discussed below, Citigroup consolidates entities deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs) when Citigroup is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Gains and losses on the disposition of branches, subsidiaries, affiliates, buildings, and other investments and charges for managements estimate of impairment in their value that is other than temporary, such that recovery of the carrying amount is deemed unlikely, are included in other revenue. Citibank, N.A. Citibank, N.A. is a commercial bank and wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup Inc. Citibanks principal offerings include consumer finance, mortgage lending, and retail banking products and services; investment banking, commercial banking, cash management, trade finance and e-commerce products and services; and private banking products and services. The Company includes a balance sheet and statement of changes in stockholders equity for Citibank, N.A. to provide information about this entity to shareholders and international regulatory agencies. (See Notes 28 and 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 155 and 156, respectively.) Variable Interest Entities An entity is referred to as a variable interest entity (VIE) if it meets the criteria outlined in FASB Interpretation No. 46-R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (revised December 2003) (FIN 46-R), which are: (1) the entity has equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) the entity has equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entitys operations or that do not absorb the expected losses or receive the expected returns of the entity. In addition, as specified in FIN 46-R, a VIE must be consolidated by the Company if it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, which is the party involved with the VIE that has a majority of the expected losses or a majority of the expected residual returns or both. Along with the VIEs that are consolidated in accordance with these guidelines, the Company has significant variable interests in other VIEs that are not consolidated because the Company is not the primary beneficiary. These include multi-seller finance companies, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), many structured finance transactions, and various investment funds. All other entities not deemed to be VIEs, with which the Company has involvement, are evaluated for consolidation under Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, and SFAS. 94, Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries (SFAS 94). Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end spot foreign exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated monthly at amounts that approximate weighted average exchange rates, with resulting gains and losses included in income. The effects of translating income with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are included in stockholders equity along with related hedge and tax effects. The effects of translating operations with the U.S. dollar as the functional currency, including those in highly inflationary environments, are included in other revenue along with the related hedge effects. Hedges of foreign currency exposures include forward currency contracts and designated issues of non-U.S. dollar debt. Investment Securities Investments include fixed income and equity securities. Fixed income instruments include bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stocks, as well as certain loan-backed and structured securities subject to prepayment risk. Equity securities include common and nonredeemable preferred stocks. Fixed income investments classified as held to maturity represent securities that the Company has both the ability and the intent to hold until maturity and are carried at amortized cost. Fixed income securities and marketable equity securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value, which is determined based upon quoted market prices when available. If quoted market prices are not available, discounted expected cash flows using market rates commensurate with the characteristics of the investment are used. Unrealized gains and losses and related hedge effects are reported in a separate component of stockholders equity, net of applicable income taxes. Declines in fair value that are determined to be other than temporary are charged to earnings. Accrual of income is suspended on fixed income instruments that are in default or on which it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. Fixed income instruments subject to prepayment risk are accounted for using the retrospective method, where the principal amortization and effective yield are recalculated each period based on actual historical and projected future cash flows. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are included in earnings on a specific identification cost basis. Citigroups private equity subsidiaries include subsidiaries registered as Small Business Investment Companies and other subsidiaries that engage exclusively in venture capital activities. Venture capital investments are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in other revenue. The fair values of publicly traded securities held by these subsidiaries are generally based upon quoted market prices. In certain situations, including thinly traded securities, large block holdings, restricted shares, or other special situations, the quoted market prices are adjusted to produce an estimate of the attainable fair value for the securities. For securities held by these subsidiaries that are not publicly traded, estimates of fair value are made based upon a review of the investees financial results, condition and prospects, together with comparisons to similar companies for which quoted market prices are available. 109 Table of Contents Trading Account Assets and Liabilities Trading account assets and liabilities, including securities and derivatives, are carried at fair value. Fair value is determined based upon quoted prices when available, or under an alternative approach such as matrix or model pricing when market prices are not readily available. If quoted market prices are not available for fixed income securities or derivatives, the Company discounts the expected cash flows using market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality and duration of the investment. Obligations to deliver securities sold, not yet purchased, are also carried at fair value and included in trading account liabilities. The determination of fair value considers various factors, including: closing exchange or over-the-counter market price quotations; time value and volatility factors underlying options, warrants, and derivatives; price activity for equivalent or synthetic instruments; counterparty credit quality; the potential impact on market prices or fair value of liquidating the Companys positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under current market conditions; and derivatives transaction maintenance costs during that period. The fair value of aged inventory is actively monitored and, where appropriate, is discounted to reflect the implied illiquidity for positions that have been available-for-immediate-sale for longer than 90 days. Changes in fair value of trading account assets and liabilities are recognized in earnings. Interest expense on trading account liabilities is reported as a reduction of interest revenue. Commodities are accounted for on a lower of cost or market (LOCOM) basis and include physical quantities of commodities involving future settlement or delivery. Related gains or losses are reported as principal transactions. Derivatives used for trading purposes include interest rate, currency, equity, credit, and commodity swap agreements, options, caps and floors, warrants, and financial and commodity futures and forward contracts. The fair value of derivatives is determined based upon liquid market prices evidenced by exchange traded prices, broker/dealer quotations, or prices of other transactions with similarly rated counterparties. The fair value includes an adjustment for individual counterparty credit risk and other adjustments, as appropriate, to reflect liquidity and ongoing servicing costs. The fair values of derivative contracts reflect cash the Company has paid or received (for example, option premiums and cash margin in connection with credit support agreements). Derivatives in a net receivable position, as well as options owned and warrants held, are reported as trading account assets. Similarly, derivatives in a net payable position, as well as options written and warrants issued, are reported as trading account liabilities. Revenues generated from derivative instruments used for trading purposes are reported as principal transactions and include realized gains and losses, as well as unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of such instruments. Trading profit at inception of a derivative transaction is not recognized unless the fair value of that derivative is obtained from a quoted market price, supported by comparison to other observable market transactions, or based upon a valuation technique incorporating observable market data. The Company defers trade date gains and losses on derivative transactions where the fair value is not determined based upon observable market transactions and market data. The deferral is recognized in income when the market data becomes observable or over the life of the transaction. Securities Borrowed and Securities Loaned Securities borrowed and securities loaned are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received. With respect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash collateral in an amount in excess of the market value of securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities borrowed and loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary. Interest received or paid is recorded in interest income or interest expense. Repurchase and Resale Agreements Repurchase and resale agreements are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are carried at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently reacquired or resold, including accrued interest, as specified in the respective agreements. The Companys policy is to take possession of securities purchased under agreements to resell. The market value of securities to be repurchased and resold is monitored, and additional collateral is obtained where appropriate to protect against credit exposure. Loans and Leases Loans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income and unamortized deferred fees and costs. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are generally deferred and recognized as adjustments to income over the lives of the related loans. Consumer Loans Consumer loans represent loans and leases managed by the Global Consumer business and Private Bank. As a general rule, interest accrual ceases for open-end revolving and closed-end installment and real estate loans when payments are 90 days contractually past due. For credit cards, however, the Company accrues interest until payments are 180 days past due. Interest and fees earned, but not collected, are reversed when interest is no longer accrued. As a general rule, unsecured closed-end installment loans are charged off at 120 days past due and unsecured open-end (revolving) loans are charged off at 180 days contractually past due. Loans secured with non-real-estate collateral are written down to the estimated value of the collateral, less costs to sell, at 120 days past due. Real-estate secured loans (both open- and closed-end) are written down to the estimated value of the property, less costs to sell, at 180 days contractually past due. In certain consumer businesses in the U.S., secured real estate loans are written down to the estimated value of the property, less costs to sell, at the earlier of the receipt of title or 12 months in foreclosure (a process that must commence when payments are 120 days contractually past due). Closed-end loans secured by non-real-estate collateral are written down to the estimated value of the collateral, less costs to sell, at 180 days contractually past due. Unsecured loans (both open- and closed-end) are charged off at 180 days contractually past due and 180 days from the last payment, but in no event can these loans exceed 360 days contractually past due. Unsecured loans in bankruptcy are charged off within 30 days of notification of filing by the bankruptcy court or within the contractual write-off periods, whichever occurs earlier. In CitiFinancial (a component of the U.S. Consumer Lending business), unsecured loans in bankruptcy are charged off when they are 30 days contractually past due. 110 Table of Contents Commercial Business includes loans and leases made principally to small- and middle-market businesses. Commercial Business loans are placed on a non-accrual basis when it is determined that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when payments are past due for 90 days or more, except when the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Any interest accrued on impaired corporate loans and leases is reversed at 90 days and charged against current earnings, and interest is thereafter included in earnings only to the extent actually received in cash. Corporate Loans Corporate loans represent loans and leases managed by the CIB. Corporate loans are identified as impaired and placed on a cash (non-accrual) basis when it is determined that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful, or when interest or principal is 90 days past due, except when the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection. Any interest accrued on impaired corporate loans and leases is reversed at 90 days and charged against current earnings, and interest is thereafter included in earnings only to the extent actually received in cash. When there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of principal, all cash receipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded investment in the loan. Impaired corporate loans and leases are written down to the extent that principal is judged to be uncollectible. Impaired collateral-dependent loans and leases, where repayment is expected to be provided solely by the sale of the underlying collateral and there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment, are written down to the lower of cost or collateral value. Cash-basis loans are returned to an accrual status when all contractual principal and interest amounts are reasonably assured of repayment and there is a sustained period of repayment performance in accordance with the contractual terms. Lease Financing Transactions Loans include the Companys share of aggregate rentals on lease financing transactions and residual values net of related unearned income. Lease financing transactions represent direct financing leases and also include leveraged leases. Unearned income is amortized under a method that results in an approximate level rate of return when related to the unrecovered lease investment. Gains and losses from sales of residual values of leased equipment are included in other revenue. Loans Held-for-Sale Corporate and consumer loans that have been identified for sale are classified as loans held-for-sale within other assets and are accounted for at the lower of cost or market value, with any write-downs or subsequent recoveries charged to other revenue. Allowance for Loan Losses Allowance for loan losses represents managements estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio. Attribution of the allowance is made for analytical purposes only, and the entire allowance is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the overall portfolio. Additions to the allowance are made through the provision for credit losses. Credit losses are deducted from the allowance, and subsequent recoveries are added. Securities received in exchange for loan claims in debt restructurings are initially recorded at fair value, with any gain or loss reflected as a recovery or charge-off to the allowance, and are subsequently accounted for as securities available-for-sale. In the Corporate and Commercial Business portfolios, larger-balance, non-homogeneous exposures representing significant individual credit exposures are evaluated based upon the borrowers overall financial condition, resources, and payment record; the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors; and, if appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. Reserves are established for these loans based upon an estimate of probable losses for the individual loans deemed to be impaired. This estimate considers all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans contractual effective rate, the secondary market value of the loan and the fair value of collateral less disposal costs. The allowance for credit losses attributed to the remaining portfolio is established via a process that estimates the probable loss inherent in the portfolio based upon various analyses. These analyses consider historical and project default rates and loss severities; internal risk ratings; and geographic, industry, and other environmental factors. Management also considers overall portfolio indicators including trends in internally risk-rated exposures, classified exposures, cash-basis loans, historical and forecasted write-offs, and a review of industry, geographic, and portfolio concentrations, including current developments within those segments. In addition, management considers the current business strategy and credit process, including credit limit setting and compliance, credit approvals, loan underwriting criteria, and loan workout procedures. For Consumer loans (excluding Commercial Business loans), each portfolio of smaller-balance, homogenous loansincluding consumer mortgage, installment, revolving credit, and most other consumer loansis collectively evaluated for impairment. The allowance for credit losses attributed to these loans is established via a process that estimates the probable losses inherent in the portfolio based upon various analyses. These include migration analysis, in which historical delinquency and credit loss experience is applied to the current aging of the portfolio, together with analyses that reflect current trends and conditions. Management also considers overall portfolio indicators including historical credit losses; delinquent, non-performing, and classified loans; trends in volumes and terms of loans; an evaluation of overall credit quality; the credit process, including lending policies and procedures; and economic, geographical, product and other environmental factors. Allowance for Unfunded Lending Commitments A similar approach to the allowance for loan losses is used for calculating a reserve for the expected losses related to unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit. This reserve is classified on the balance sheet within other liabilities. Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs) Mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), which are included within intangible assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, are recognized as assets when purchased or when the Company sells or securitizes loans acquired through purchase or origination and retains the right to service the loans. With the Company electing to early-adopt SFAS 156 as of January 1, 2006, MSRs in the U.S. mortgage and student loan classes of servicing rights are accounted for at fair value, with changes in value recorded in current earnings. Upon electing the fair value method of accounting for its MSRs, the Company discontinued the application of SFAS 133 fair value hedge accounting, the calculation of amortization and the assessment of impairment for the MSRs. The MSR valuation allowance at the date of adoption of SFAS 156 was written off against the recorded value of the MSRs. 111 Table of Contents Prior to 2006, only the portion of the MSR portfolio that was hedged with instruments qualifying for hedge accounting under SFAS 133 was recorded at fair value. The remaining portion, which was hedged with instruments that did not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133, was accounted for at the lower-of-cost-or-market. Servicing rights retained in the securitization of mortgage loans were measured by allocating the carrying value of the loans between the assets sold and the interests retained, based on the relative fair values at the date of securitization. MSRs were amortized using a proportionate cash flow method over the period of the related net positive servicing income to be generated from the various portfolios purchased or loans originated. Impairment of MSRs was evaluated on a disaggregated basis by type (i.e., fixed rate or adjustable rate) and by interest-rate band, which were believed to be the predominant risk characteristics of the Companys servicing portfolio. Any excess of the carrying value of the capitalized servicing rights over the fair value by stratum was recognized through a valuation allowance for each stratum and charged to the provision for impairment on MSRs. Additional information on the Companys MSRs can be found in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 143. Goodwill Goodwill represents an acquired companys acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests, whereby goodwill is allocated to the Companys reporting units and an impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Furthermore, on any business dispositions, goodwill is allocated to the business disposed of based on the ratio of the fair value of the business disposed of to the fair value of the reporting unit. Intangible Assets Intangible Assetsincluding core deposit intangibles, present value of future profits, purchased credit card relationships, other customer relationships, and other intangible assetsare amortized over their estimated useful lives. Upon the adoption of SFAS 142, intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives, primarily certain asset management contracts and trade names, are not amortized and are subject to annual impairment tests. An impairment exists if the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value. For other intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset. Repossessed Assets Upon repossession, loans are adjusted, if necessary, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral and transferred to repossessed assets. This is reported in other assets, net of a valuation allowance for selling costs and net declines in value as appropriate. Securitizations The Company primarily securitizes credit card receivables and mortgages. Other types of securitized assets include corporate debt securities, auto loans, and student loans. There are two key accounting determinations that must be made relating to securitizations. First, in the case where Citigroup originated or owned the financial assets transferred to the securitization entity, a decision must be made as to whether that transfer is considered a sale under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. If it is a sale, the transferred assets are removed from the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet with a gain or loss recognized. Alternatively, when the transfer would be considered not a sale but rather a financing, the assets will remain on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet with an offsetting liability recognized in the amount of received proceeds. Second, a determination must be made as to whether the securitization entity would be included in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. For each securitization entity with which it is involved, the Company makes a determination of whether the entity should be considered a subsidiary of the Company and be included in its Consolidated Financial Statements or whether the entity is sufficiently independent that it does not need to be consolidated. If the securitization entitys activities are sufficiently restricted to meet accounting requirements to be a qualifying special purpose entity (QSPE), the securitization entity is not consolidated by the seller of the transferred assets. If the securitization entity is determined to be a VIE, the Company consolidates the VIE if it is the primary beneficiary. For all other securitization entities determined not to be VIEs in which Citigroup participates, a consolidation decision is made by evaluating several factors, including how much of the entitys ownership is in the hands of third-party investors, who controls the securitization entity, and who reaps the rewards and bears the risks of the entity. Only securitization entities controlled by Citigroup are consolidated. Interest in the securitized and sold loans may be retained in the form of subordinated interest-only strips, subordinated tranches, spread accounts, and servicing rights. The Company retains a sellers interest in the credit card receivables transferred to the trusts, which is not in securitized form. Accordingly, the sellers interest is carried on a historical cost basis and classified as consumer loans. Retained interests in securitized mortgage loans are classified as trading account assets. Other retained interests are primarily recorded as available-for-sale investments, except for servicing rights that are included in Intangible Assets. However, since January 1, 2006, servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value. Gains or losses on securitization and sale depend in part on the previous carrying amount of the loans involved in the transfer and, prior to January 1, 2006, were allocated between the loans sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair values at the date of sale. Gains are recognized at the time of securitization and are reported in other revenue. The Company values its securitized retained interests at fair value using either financial models, quoted market prices, or sales of similar assets. Where quoted market prices are not available, the Company estimates the fair value of these retained interests by determining the present value of expected future cash flows using modeling techniques that incorporate managements best estimates of key assumptions, including prepayment speeds, credit losses, and discount rates. Additional information on the Companys securitization activities can be found in Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements on page 92 and in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 143. Transfers of Financial Assets For a transfer of financial assets to be considered a sale, the assets must have been isolated from the Company, even in bankruptcy or other receivership; the purchaser must have the right to sell the assets transferred and the Company may not have an option or any obligation to reacquire the assets, or the purchaser must be a QSPE. If these sale requirements are met, the assets are removed from the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. If the 112 Table of Contents conditions for sale are not met, the transfer is considered to be a secured borrowing, the assets remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the sale proceeds are recognized as the Companys liability. A legal opinion on a sale is generally obtained for complex transactions or where the Company has continuing involvement with assets transferred or with the securitization entity. Those opinions must state that the asset transfer is considered a sale and that the assets transferred would not be consolidated with the Companys other assets in the event of the Companys insolvency. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 143. Risk Management Activities  Derivatives Used for Non-Trading Purposes The Company manages its exposures to market rate movements outside its trading activities by modifying the asset and liability mix, either directly or through the use of derivative financial products, including interest rate swaps, futures, forwards, and purchased option positions such as interest rate caps, floors, and collars as well as foreign exchange contracts. These end-user derivatives are carried at fair value in other assets or other liabilities. To qualify as a hedge, a derivative must be highly effective in offsetting the risk designated as being hedged. The hedge relationship must be formally documented at inception, detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge, which includes the item and risk that is being hedged and the derivative that is being used, as well as how effectiveness will be assessed and ineffectiveness measured. The effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated on a retrospective and prospective basis, typically using quantitative measures of correlation with hedge ineffectiveness measured and recorded in current earnings. If a hedge relationship is found to be ineffective, it no longer qualifies as a hedge and any gains or losses attributable to the derivatives, as well as subsequent changes in fair value, are recognized in other revenue. The foregoing criteria are applied on a decentralized basis, consistent with the level at which market risk is managed, but are subject to various limits and controls. The underlying asset, liability, firm commitment, or forecasted transaction may be an individual item or a portfolio of similar items. For fair value hedges, in which derivatives hedge the fair value of assets, liabilities, or firm commitments, changes in the fair value of derivatives are reflected in other revenue, together with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item. These are expected to, and generally do, offset each other. Any net amount, representing hedge ineffectiveness, is reflected in current earnings. Citigroups fair value hedges are primarily hedges of fixed-rate long-term debt, loans, and available-for-sale securities. For cash flow hedges, in which derivatives hedge the variability of cash flows related to floating rate assets, liabilities, or forecasted transactions, the accounting treatment depends on the effectiveness of the hedge. To the extent these derivatives are effective in offsetting the variability of the hedged cash flows, changes in the derivatives fair values will not be included in current earnings but are reported as Accumulated other comprehensive income. These changes in fair value will be included in earnings of future periods when the hedged cash flows come into earnings. To the extent these derivatives are not effective, changes in their fair values are immediately included in other revenue. Citigroups cash flow hedges primarily include hedges of loans, rollovers of short-term liabilities, and foreign currency denominated funding. They also include hedges of certain forecasted transactions in which a substantial majority of them mature within five years. For net investment hedges in which derivatives hedge the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, the accounting treatment will similarly depend on the effectiveness of the hedge. The effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative, including any forward premium or discount, is reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment. End-user derivatives that are economic hedges rather than qualifying for hedge accounting purposes are also carried at fair value, with changes in value included in principal transactions or other revenue. Citigroup often uses economic hedges when qualifying for hedge accounting would be too complex or operationally burdensome; examples are hedges of the credit risk component of commercial loans and loan commitments. Citigroup periodically evaluates its hedging strategies in other areas, such as mortgage servicing rights, and may designate either a qualifying hedge or economic hedge, after considering the relative cost and benefits. Economic hedges are also employed when the hedged item itself is marked to market through current earnings, such as hedges of commitments to originate one-to-four family mortgage loans to be held-for-sale. For those hedge relationships that are terminated or when hedge designations are removed, the hedge accounting treatment described in the paragraphs above is no longer applied. The end-user derivative is terminated or transferred to the trading account. For fair value hedges, any changes in the fair value of the hedged item remain as part of the basis of the asset or liability and are ultimately reflected as an element of the yield. For cash flow hedges, any changes in fair value of the end-user derivative remain in Accumulated other comprehensive income and are included in earnings of future periods when the hedged cash flows impact earnings. However, if the forecasted transaction is no longer likely to occur, any changes in fair value of the end-user derivative are immediately reflected in other revenue. Employee Benefits Expense Employee benefits expense includes current service costs of pension and other postretirement benefit plans, which are accrued on a current basis; contributions and unrestricted awards under other employee plans; the amortization of restricted stock awards; and costs of other employee benefits. Stock-Based Compensation Prior to January 1, 2003, Citigroup accounted for stock-based compensation plans under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related interpretations (APB 25). Under APB 25, there was generally no charge to earnings for employee stock option awards, because the options granted under these plans have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the grant date. Alternatively, SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS 123), allowed companies to recognize compensation expense over the related service period based on the grant date fair value of the stock award. On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value provisions of SFAS 123. On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), which replaced the existing SFAS 123 and APB 25. See Accounting Changes on the next page. Income Taxes The Company is subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations 113 Table of Contents by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, the Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. The Company must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review/adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. Deferred taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns, based upon enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to managements judgment that realization is more likely than not. Commissions, Underwriting, and Principal Transactions Commissions, Underwriting, and Principal Transactions revenues and related expenses are recognized in income on a trade-date basis. Earnings Per Share Earnings per share is computed after recognition of preferred stock dividend requirements. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, excluding restricted stock. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised. It is computed after giving consideration to the weighted average dilutive effect of the Companys stock options and the shares issued under the Companys Capital Accumulation Program and other restricted stock plans. Use of Estimates Management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related footnote disclosures. While management makes its best judgment, actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash Flows Cash equivalents are defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks. Cash flows from risk management activities are classified in the same category as the related assets and liabilities. ACCOUNTING CHANGES Accounting for Defined Benefit Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits As of December 31, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits (SFAS 158). In accordance with this standard, Citigroup recorded the funded status of each of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as an asset or liability on its Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding offset, net of taxes, recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Stockholders Equity, resulting in an after-tax decrease in equity of $1.647 billion. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 124. The following table shows the effects of adopting SFAS 158 at December 31, 2006 on individual line items in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2006: In millions of dollars Beforeapplicationof SFAS158 Adjustments Afterapplicationof SFAS158 Other assets Prepaid benefit cost $ 2,620 $ (534 ) $ 2,086 Other liabilities Accrued benefit liability $  $ 2,147 $ 2,147 Deferred taxes, net $ 3,653 $ 1,034 $ 4,687 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ (2,053 ) $ (1,647 )(1) $ (3,700 ) Total stockholders equity $ 121,430 $ (1,647 )(1) $ 119,783 (1) Adjustment to initially apply SFAS 158, net of taxes. Stock-Based Compensation On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), which replaced the existing SFAS 123 and APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS 123(R) requires companies to measure compensation expense for stock options and other share-based payments based on the instruments grant date fair value, and to record expense based on that fair value reduced by expected forfeitures. The Company adopted this standard by using the modified prospective approach. Beginning January 1, 2006, Citigroup recorded incremental expense for stock options granted prior to January 1, 2003 (the date the Company adopted SFAS 123). That expense will equal the remaining unvested portion of the grant date fair value of those stock options, reduced by estimated forfeitures. The Company recorded incremental compensation expense of $43 million during the year. Based on current estimates, the incremental charge for all of 2007 will be $11 million pretax. The Company maintains a number of incentive programs in which equity awards are granted to eligible employees. The most significant of the programs offered is the Capital Accumulation Program (CAP). Under the CAP program, the Company grants deferred and restricted shares to eligible employees. The program provides that employees who meet certain age plus years-of-service requirements (retirement-eligible employees) may terminate active employment and continue vesting in their awards provided they comply with specified non-compete provisions. For awards granted to retirement-eligible employees prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), the Company has been and will continue to amortize the compensation cost of these awards over the full vesting periods. Awards granted to retirement-eligible employees after the adoption of SFAS 123(R) must be either expensed on the grant date or accrued in the year prior to the grant date. The impact to 2006 was a charge of $648 million ($398 million after-tax) for the immediate expensing of awards granted to retirement-eligible employees in January 2006, and $824 million ($526 million after-tax) for the accrual of the awards that were granted in January 2007. The Company has changed the plans retirement eligibility provisions for the January 2007 management awards, which affected the amount of the accrual in 2006. In adopting SFAS 123(R), the Company began to recognize compensation expense for restricted or deferred stock awards net of estimated forfeitures. Previously, the effects of forfeitures were recorded as they occurred. 114 Table of Contents On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, prospectively for all awards granted, modified, or settled after December 31, 2002. This was in effect until December 31, 2005, after which the Company adopted SFAS 123(R) as outlined above. The prospective method is one of the adoption methods provided for under SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure (SFAS 148) issued in December 2002. SFAS 123 requires that compensation cost for all stock awards be calculated and recognized over the employees service period (which is generally equal to the vesting period). For stock options, the compensation cost is determined using option pricing models intended to estimate the fair value of the awards at the grant date. Similar to APB 25 (the alternative method of accounting), under SFAS 123, an offsetting increase to stockholders equity is recorded equal to the amount of compensation expense. Earnings per share dilution is recognized as well. Had the Company applied SFAS 123 prior to 2003 in accounting for all of the Companys stock option plans, including the Citigroup 2003 Stock Purchase Program, net income and net income per share would have been the pro forma amounts indicated below: In millions of dollars, except per share amounts 2006 (1) 2005 2004 Compensation expense related to stock option plans, net of taxes As reported $ 80 $ 84 $ 173 Pro forma 80 163 325 Net income As reported $ 21,538 $ 24,589 $ 17,046 Pro forma 21,538 24,510 16,894 Basic earnings per share As reported $ 4.39 $ 4.84 $ 3.32 Pro forma 4.39 4.82 3.29 Diluted earnings per share As reported $ 4.31 $ 4.75 $ 3.26 Pro forma 4.31 4.73 3.23 (1) There are no differences in the 2006 reported results due to the implementation of SFAS 123(R). During the first quarter of 2004, the Company changed its option valuation method from the Black-Scholes model to a lattice-type model, which did not have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has made changes to various stock-based compensation plan provisions for future awards. For example, in January 2005, the Company largely moved from granting stock options to granting restricted and deferred stock awards, unless participants elect to receive all or a portion of their award in the form of stock options. Thus, the majority of management options granted in 2005 were due to stock option elections and carried the same vesting period as the restricted or deferred stock awards in lieu of which they were granted. Stock options granted in 2003 and 2004 have three-year vesting periods and six-year terms. In addition, the sale of underlying shares acquired upon exercise is restricted for a two-year period and pursuant to a stock ownership commitment; senior executives must retain 75% of the shares they own and acquire from the Company over the term of their employment. Options granted in 2003 and thereafter do not have a reload feature; however, some previously granted options retain that feature. See Note 8 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements on page 122. Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments On January 1, 2006, the Company elected to early-adopt, primarily on a prospective basis, SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments (SFAS 155). In accordance with this standard, hybrid financial instrumentssuch as structured notes containing embedded derivatives that otherwise would require bifurcation, as well as interest-only instrumentsmay be accounted for at fair value if the Company makes an irrevocable election to do so on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The changes in fair value are recorded in current earnings. The impact of adopting this standard was not material. Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets On January 1, 2006, the Company elected to early-adopt SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets (SFAS 156). This pronouncement requires all servicing rights to be initially recognized at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, it permits a one-time irrevocable election to remeasure each class of servicing rights at fair value, with the changes in fair value being recorded in current earnings. The classes of servicing rights are identified based on the availability of market inputs used in determining their fair values and the methods for managing their risks. The Company has elected fair value accounting for its mortgage and student loan classes of servicing rights. The impact of adopting this standard was not material. Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations On December 31, 2005, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47). FIN 47 requires entities to estimate and recognize a liability for costs associated with the retirement or removal of an asset from service, regardless of the uncertainty of timing or whether performance will be required. For Citigroup, this applies to certain real estate restoration activities in the Companys branches and office space, most of which is rented under operating lease agreements. Local market practices and requirements with regard to restoration activity under a real estate lease agreement differ by region. Based on a review of active lease terms and conditions, historical costs of past restoration activities, and local market practices, an estimate of the expected real estate restoration costs for some of the Companys branches and office space was determined. Each region applied local inflation and discount rates to determine the present value of the liability and capitalized asset amounts. The impact of adopting FIN 47 was an increase to total liabilities and total assets of $150 million and $122 million, respectively. The increase in total assets is net of an increase in accumulated depreciation of $52 million. In addition, a $49 million after-tax ($80 million pretax) charge to earnings, which was reported on the Consolidated Statement of Income as the cumulative effect of an accounting change, was recorded in the 2005 fourth quarter. Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer On January 1, 2005, Statement of Position (SOP) No. 03-3, Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer (SOP 03-3), was adopted for loan acquisitions. SOP 03-3 requires acquired loans to be recorded at fair value and prohibits carrying over valuation allowances in the initial accounting for acquired impaired loans. Loans carried at fair value, mortgage loans held-for-sale, and loans to borrowers in good standing under revolving credit agreements are excluded from the scope of SOP 03-3. 115 Table of Contents SOP 03-3 limits the yield that may be accreted to the excess of the undiscounted expected cash flows over the investors initial investment in the loan. The excess of the contractual cash flows over expected cash flows may not be recognized as an adjustment of yield. Subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected are recognized prospectively through an adjustment of the loans yield over its remaining life. Decreases in expected cash flows are recognized as impairments. Determining the Variability in a Potential VIE The FASB issued FASB Staff Position FIN 46(R)-6, Determining the Variability to Be Considered in Applying FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (FSP FIN 46(R)-6), in April 2006. FSP FIN 46(R)-6 addresses the application of FIN 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, in determining whether certain contracts or arrangements with a variable interest entity (VIE) are variable interests by requiring companies to base such evaluations on an analysis of the VIEs purpose and design, rather than its legal form or accounting classification. FSP FIN 46(R)-6 is required to be applied for all reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2006. The adoption of the FSP did not result in material differences from Citigroups existing accounting policies regarding the consolidation of VIEs. Postretirement Benefits In May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS No. 106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (FSP FAS 106-2), which supersedes FSP FAS 106-1, in response to the December 2003 enactment of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act of 2003). The Act of 2003 established a prescription drug benefit for Medicare-eligible participants, as well as a federal subsidy of 28% of prescription drug claims for sponsors of retiree health care plans with drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to those offered under Medicare Part D. If a plan qualifies, FSP FAS 106-2 requires plan sponsors to disclose the effect of the subsidy on the net periodic expense and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation in their financial statements. Plan sponsors that initially elected to defer accounting for the effects of the subsidy are allowed the option of retroactive application to the date of enactment or prospective application from the date of adoption. In the 2004 third quarter, Citigroup reflected the effects of the subsidy in its financial statements retroactive to January 1, 2004 in accordance with FSP FAS 106-2. The effect of adopting FSP FAS 106-2 is included in Note 9 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements on page 124. Accounting for Loan Commitments Accounted for as Derivatives On April 1, 2004, the Company adopted the SECs Staff Accounting Bulletin 105, Application of Accounting Principles to Loan Commitments (SAB 105), which specifies that servicing assets embedded in commitments for loans to be held-for-sale should be recognized only when the servicing asset has been contractually separated from the associated loans by sale or securitization. The impact of implementing SAB 105 across all of the Companys business was a delay in recognition of $35 million pretax in the 2004 second quarter. Profit Recognition on Bifurcated Hybrid Instruments On January 1, 2004, Citigroup revised the application of Derivatives Implementation Group (DIG) Issue B6, Embedded Derivatives: Allocating the Basis of a Hybrid Instrument to the Host Contract of the Embedded Derivative. In December 2003, the SEC staff gave a speech that clarified the accounting for derivatives embedded in financial instruments (hybrid instruments) to preclude the recognition of any profit on the trade date for hybrid instruments that must be bifurcated for accounting purposes. The trade-date revenue must instead be amortized over the life of the hybrid instrument. The impact of this change in application was an approximately $256 million pretax reduction in revenue, net of amortization, across all of the Companys businesses during 2004. This revenue is recognized over the life of the transactions, which on average is approximately four years. Related Party Transactions The Company has related party transactions with certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates. These transactions, which are primarily short-term in nature, include cash accounts, collateralized financing transactions, margin accounts, derivative trading, charges for operational support and the borrowing and lending of funds and are entered into in the ordinary course of business. FUTURE APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which attempts to set out a consistent framework for preparers to use to determine the appropriate level of tax reserves to maintain for uncertain tax positions. This interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 uses a two-step approach wherein a tax benefit is recognized if a position is more likely than not to be sustained. The amount of the benefit is then measured to be the highest tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. FIN 48 also sets out disclosure requirements to enhance transparency of an entitys tax reserves. Citigroup will be required to adopt this interpretation as of January 1, 2007. The Company expects that the effect of adopting FIN 48 will result in an immaterial adjustment to 2007 opening retained earnings. Leveraged Leases On July 13, 2006, the FASB issued a Staff Position, Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leverage Lease Transaction (FSP 13-2), which provides guidance regarding changes or projected changes in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction. Leveraged leases can provide significant tax benefits principally related to the timing of tax payments to the lessor. Since changes in the timing and/or amount of these tax benefits may have a material effect on the cash flows of a lease transaction, a lessor, in accordance with FSP 13-2, will be required to perform a recalculation of a leveraged lease when there is a change or projected change in the timing of the realization of tax benefits generated by that lease. Currently, Citigroup does not recalculate the tax benefits if only the timing of cash receipts has changed. The effective date of FSP 13-2 for Citigroup is January 1, 2007. Citigroup expects the cumulative effect of adopting FSP 13-2 to be a decrease to retained earnings of $152 million after-tax ($255 million pretax). This decrease to retained earnings will be reflected in earnings over the remaining lives of the leases as tax benefits are realized. Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157) In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). This standard defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure 116 Table of Contents requirements about fair value measurements. In addition, SFAS 157 precludes the use of block discounts and supercedes the guidance in EITF 02-3, which prohibited the recognition of day-1 gains on certain derivative trades when determining the fair value of instruments not traded in an active market. With the adoption of this standard, these changes will be reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The standard also requires Citigroup to reflect its own credit standing when measuring the fair value of debt it has issued that is carried at fair value, including derivatives, prospectively from the date of adoption. SFAS 157 is effective for Citigroups fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008, with earlier adoption permitted for the Companys fiscal year beginning January 1, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this standard. Fair Value Option (SFAS 159) On February 15, 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159). Under this Standard, the Company may elect to report financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on a contract-by-contract basis with changes in value reported in earnings. This election is irrevocable. SFAS 159 provides an opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings that is caused by measuring hedged assets and liabilities that were previously required to use a different accounting method than the related hedging contracts when the complex provisions of SFAS 133 hedge accounting are not met. SFAS 159 is effective for years beginning after November 15, 2007. Early adoption within 120 days of the beginning of the Companys 2007 fiscal year is permissible, provided the Company has not yet issued interim financial statements for 2007 and has adopted SFAS 157. Citigroup is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this Standard. Potential Amendments to Various Current Accounting Standards The FASB is currently working on amendments to the existing accounting standards governing asset transfers and securitizations. Upon completion of this standard, the Company will need to reevaluate its accounting and disclosures. Due to the ongoing deliberations of the standard setters, the Company is unable to accurately determine the effect of future amendments or proposals at this time. 2.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Sale of the Asset Management Business On December 1, 2005, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of its Asset Management Business to Legg Mason, Inc. (Legg Mason) in exchange for Legg Masons broker-dealer and capital markets businesses, $2.298 billion of Legg Masons common and preferred shares (valued as of the closing date), and $500 million in cash.

Concurrently, Citigroup sold Legg Masons capital markets business to Stifel Financial Corp. The business consisted of areas in which Citigroup already had full capabilities, including investment banking, institutional equity sales and trading, taxable fixed income sales and trading, and research. No gain or loss was recognized from this transaction. (The transactions described in these two paragraphs are referred to as the Sale of the Asset Management Business.) In connection with this sale, Citigroup and Legg Mason entered into a three-year agreement under which Citigroup will continue to offer its clients Asset Managements products, will become the primary retail distributor of the Legg Mason funds managed by Legg Mason Capital Management Inc., and may also distribute other Legg Mason products. These products will be offered primarily through Citigroups Global Wealth Management businesses, Smith Barney and Private Bank, as well as through Primerica and Citibank. The distribution of these products will be subject to applicable requirements of law and Citigroups suitability standards and product requirements. 118 Table of Contents Upon completion of the Sale of the Asset Management Business, Citigroup added 1,226 financial advisors in 124 branch offices to its Global Wealth Management Business. On January 31, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its Asset Management Business within Bank Handlowy (an indirect banking subsidiary of Citigroup located in Poland) to Legg Mason. This transaction, which was originally part of the overall Asset Management Business sold to Legg Mason Inc. on December 1, 2005, was postponed due to delays in obtaining local regulatory approval. A gain from this sale of $18 million after-tax and minority interest ($31 million pretax and minority interest) was recognized in the 2006 first quarter within discontinued operations. During March 2006, the Company sold 10.3 million shares of Legg Mason stock through an underwritten public offering. The net sale proceeds of $1.258 billion resulted in a pretax gain of $24 million in Alternative Investments. In September 2006, the Company received from Legg Mason the final closing adjustment payment related to this sale. This payment resulted in an additional after-tax gain of $51 million ($83 million pretax), recorded in discontinued operations.

In addition to the accounting policies outlined in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 109, the following represents the policies specifically related to the Life Insurance & Annuities Business that was sold: Separate and Variable Accounts Separate and variable accounts primarily represent funds for which investment income and investment gains/losses accrue directly to, and investment risk is borne by, the contractholders. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of any other business of the Company. The assets of these accounts are generally carried at market value. Amounts assessed to the contractholders for management services are included in revenues. Deposits, net investment income and realized investment gains and losses for these accounts are excluded from revenues, and related liability increases are excluded from benefits and expenses. Contractholder Funds Contractholder funds represent receipts from the issuance of universal life, pension investment and certain deferred annuity contracts. Such receipts are considered deposits on investment contracts that do not have substantial mortality or morbidity risk. Account balances are increased by deposits received and interest credited and are reduced by withdrawals, mortality charges and administrative expenses charged to the contractholders. The Spin-Off of Travelers Property Casualty Corp. (TPC) During the 2006 first quarter, releases from various tax contingency reserves were recorded as the IRS concluded their tax audits for the years 1999 through 2002. Included in these releases was $44 million related to Travelers Property Casualty Corp., which the Company spun off during 2002. This release has been included in the provision for income taxes within the results for discontinued operations.

INCENTIVE PLANS The Company has adopted a number of equity compensation plans under which it administers stock options, restricted or deferred stock and stock purchase programs. The award programs are used to attract, retain and motivate officers, employees and non-employee directors, to compensate them for their contributions to the Company, and to encourage employee stock ownership. The plans are administered by the Personnel and Compensation Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors, which is comprised entirely of independent non-employee directors. At December 31, 2006, approximately 316 million shares were authorized and available for grant under Citigroups stock incentive and stock purchase plans. In accordance with Citigroup practice, shares would be issued out of Treasury stock upon exercise or vesting. The following compensation expense relates to the Companys stock-based compensation programs as recorded during 2006, 2005 and 2004: In millions of dollars 2006 2005 2004 SFAS 123(R) charges for January 2006 awards issued to retirement-eligible employees $ 648 $  $  SFAS 123(R) charges for estimated awards granted through January 2007 to retirement-eligible employees 824   Option expense 129 137 281 Amortization of restricted and deferred stock awards (1) 1,565 1,766 1,515 Total $ 3,166 $ 1,903 $ 1,796 (1) Represents the amortization of the remaining unvested restricted and deferred stock awards granted to all employees prior to 2006. The 2006 period also includes amortization expense for awards granted to non-retirement-eligible employees in 2006. Also included is amortization of the forfeiture provision on stock awards. Stock Award Programs The Company, primarily through its Capital Accumulation Program (CAP), issues shares of Citigroup common stock in the form of restricted or deferred stock to participating officers and employees. For all stock award programs, during the applicable vesting period, the shares awarded cannot be sold or transferred by the participant, and the award is subject to cancellation if the participants employment is terminated. After the award vests, the shares become freely transferable (subject to the stock ownership commitment of senior executives). From the date of award, the recipient of a restricted stock award can direct the vote of the shares and receive dividend equivalents. Recipients of deferred stock awards receive dividend equivalents, but cannot vote. Stock awards granted in January 2006 and 2005 generally vest 25% per year over four years, except for certain employees at Smith Barney whose awards vest after two years. Stock awards granted in 2003 and 2004 generally vest after a two- or three-year vesting period. CAP participants may elect to receive all or part of their award in stock options. The figures presented in the stock option program tables include options granted under CAP. Unearned compensation expense associated with the stock awards represents the market value of Citigroup common stock at the date of grant and is recognized as a charge to income ratably over the full vesting period, except for those awards granted to retirement-eligible employees. The charge to income for awards made to retirement-eligible employees is accelerated based on the dates the retirement rules are met. CAP and certain other awards provide that participants who meet certain age and years of service conditions may continue to vest in all or a portion of the award without remaining employed by the Company during the entire vesting period, so long as they do not compete with Citigroup during that time. Beginning in 2006, awards to these retirement-eligible employees are recognized in the year prior to the grant in the same manner as cash incentive compensation is accrued. However, awards granted in January 2006 were required to be expensed in their entirety at the date of grant. Prior to 2006, such awards were recognized ratably over the stated vesting period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 109 for the impact of adopting SFAS 123(R). In 2003, special equity awards were issued to certain employees in the Corporate and Investment Banking, Global Wealth Management and Citigroup International businesses. These awards were fully vested in January 2006. From 2003 to 2006, Citigroup granted restricted or deferred shares annually under the Citigroup Ownership Program (COP) to eligible employees. This program replaced the WealthBuilder, CitiBuilder, and Citigroup Ownership stock option programs. Under COP, employees are issued either restricted or deferred shares of Citigroup common stock that vest after three years. Unearned compensation expense associated with the stock grants represents the market value of Citigroup common stock at the date of grant and is recognized as a charge to income ratably over the vesting period, except for those awards granted to retirement-eligible employees. The charge to income for awards made to retirement-eligible employees is accelerated based on the dates the retirement rules are met. 122 Table of Contents A summary of the status of Citigroups unvested stock awards as of December 31, 2006, and changes during the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, is presented below: Unvested stock awards Shares Weighted averagegrant datefair value Unvested at January 1, 2006 117,623,501 $ 44.12 Awards 66,162,677 $ 48.54 Cancellations (7,885,387 ) $ 47.58 Deletions (391,663 ) $ 47.25 Vestings (48,536,363 ) $ 39.56 Unvested at December 31, 2006 126,972,765 $ 47.94 The weighted average market value of the vestings during 2006 was approximately $47.33 per share. As of December 31, 2006, there was $2.6 billion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock awards net of the forfeiture provision. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years. Stock Option Programs The Company has a number of stock option programs for its non-employee directors, officers and employees. Generally, since January 2005, stock options have been granted only to CAP participants who elect to receive stock options in lieu of restricted or deferred stock awards, and to non-employee directors who elect to receive their compensation in the form of a stock option grant. All stock options are granted on Citigroup common stock with exercise prices equal to the fair market value at the time of grant. Options granted since 2003 have six-year terms; directors options vest after two years and all other options granted since January 2005 typically vest 25% each year over four years. Options granted in 2004 and 2003 typically vest in thirds each year over three years, with the first vesting date occurring 17 months after the grant date. The sale of shares acquired through the exercise of employee stock options granted since January 2003 is restricted for a two-year period (and the shares are subject to the stock ownership commitment of senior executives thereafter). Prior to 2003, Citigroup options, including options granted since the date of the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group, Inc., generally vested at a rate of 20% per year over five years, with the first vesting date occurring 12 to 18 months following the grant date. Certain options, mostly granted prior to January 1, 2003, permit an employee exercising an option under certain conditions to be granted new options (reload options) in an amount equal to the number of common shares used to satisfy the exercise price and the withholding taxes due upon exercise. The reload options are granted for the remaining term of the related original option and vest after six months. An option may not be exercised using the reload method unless the market price on the date of exercise is at least 20% greater than the option exercise price. To further encourage employee stock ownership, the Companys eligible employees participated in WealthBuilder, CitiBuilder, or the Citigroup Ownership Program. Options granted under the WealthBuilder and the Citigroup Ownership programs vest over a five-year period, whereas options granted under the CitiBuilder program vest after five years. These options did not have a reload feature. Options have not been granted under these programs since 2002. Information with respect to stock option activity under Citigroup stock option plans for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Options Weighted averageexercise price Intrinsic valueper share Options Weighted averageexercise price Intrinsic valueper share Options Weighted averageexercise price Intrinsic valueper share Outstanding, beginning of period 277,255,935 $ 40.27 $ 8.26 330,910,779 $ 39.28 $ 8.90 359,376,198 $ 37.07 $ 11.47 Granted-original 3,259,547 $ 48.87  5,279,863 47.45  27,520,987 49.05  Granted-reload 12,530,318 $ 52.30  3,013,384 48.85  12,725,607 49.99  Forfeited or exchanged (14,123,110 ) $ 45.57 3.36 (17,726,910 ) 44.29 2.33 (16,606,946 ) 43.27 3.82 Expired (2,021,955 ) $ 44.87 4.06 (2,572,189 ) 47.70  (1,635,927 ) 48.12  Exercised (64,832,818 ) $ 36.37 12.56 (41,648,992 ) 31.72 14.90 (50,469,140 ) 29.89 17.20 Outstanding, end of period 212,067,917 $ 41.87 $ 13.83 277,255,935 $ 40.27 $ 8.26 330,910,779 $ 39.28 $ 8.90 Exercisable at end of period 179,424,900 221,497,294 214,952,186 The following table summarizes the information about stock options outstanding under Citigroup stock option plans at December 31, 2006: Options outstanding Options exercisable Range of exercise prices Numberoutstanding Weighted averagecontractual liferemaining Weighted average exercise price Number exercisable Weighted averageexercise price $7.77$9.99 4,765 4.6 years $ 7.77 4,765 $ 7.77 $10.00$19.99 2,136,705 0.8 years $ 19.14 2,135,513 $ 19.14 $20.00$29.99 22,571,585 1.6 years $ 22.98 22,514,416 $ 22.98 $30.00$39.99 35,452,847 2.9 years $ 33.07 33,492,489 $ 32.98 $40.00$49.99 131,722,983 3.8 years $ 46.22 110,938,800 $ 46.20 $50.00$56.83 20,179,032 3.0 years $ 52.45 10,338,917 $ 51.91 212,067,917 3.3 years $ 41.87 179,424,900 $ 40.83 As of December 31, 2006, there was $54.3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options; this cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 11 months. 123 Table of Contents Stock Purchase Program The Citigroup 2003 Stock Purchase Program, which was administered under the Citigroup 2000 Stock Purchase Plan, as amended, allowed eligible employees of Citigroup to enter into fixed subscription agreements to purchase shares in the future at the lesser of the market price on the first day of the offering period or at the market price at the end of the offering period. For the June 15, 2003 offering only, subject to certain limits, enrolled employees were permitted to make one purchase prior to end of the offering period. The purchase price of the shares was paid with accumulated payroll deductions plus interest. Shares of Citigroups common stock delivered under the Citigroup 2003 Stock Purchase Program were sourced from treasury shares. Offerings under the Citigroup 2003 Stock Purchase Program were made in June 2003 and to new employees in June 2004. The program ended in July 2005. The following were the share prices under the Stock Purchase Program: The fixed price for the June 2003 offering was $44.10, and the fixed price for the June 2004 offering was $46.74. The market price at the end of the program was $46.50. The shares under the June 2003 offering were purchased at the offering price ($44.10), which was the market price at the start of the offering period. The shares under the June 2004 offering were purchased at the market price at the closing of the program ($46.50). 2006 2005 2004 Outstanding subscribed shares at beginning of year  7,112,678 8,336,245 Subscriptions entered into   495,144 . Shares purchased  (4,498,358 ) (365,591 ) Canceled or terminated  (2,614,320 ) (1,353,120 ) Outstanding subscribed shares at end of year   7,112,678 Fair Value Assumptions SFAS 123(R) requires that reload options be treated as separate grants from the related original grants. Pursuant to the terms of currently outstanding reloadable options, upon exercise of an option, if employees use previously owned shares to pay the exercise price and surrender shares otherwise to be received for related tax withholding, they will receive a reload option covering the same number of shares used for such purposes, but only if the market price on the date of exercise is at least 20% greater than the option exercise price. Reload options vest after six months and carry the same expiration date as the option that gave rise to the reload grant. The exercise price of a reload grant is the fair market value of Citigroup common stock on the date the underlying option was exercised. Reload options are intended to encourage employees to exercise options at an earlier date and to retain the shares acquired. The result of this program is that employees generally will exercise options as soon as they are able and, therefore, these options have shorter expected lives. Shorter option lives result in lower valuations. However, such values are expensed more quickly due to the shorter vesting period of reload options. In addition, since reload options are treated as separate grants, the existence of the reload feature results in a greater number of options being valued. Shares received through option exercises under the reload program, as well as certain other options, are subject to restrictions on sale. Additional valuation and related assumption information for Citigroup option plans is presented below. Since 2004, Citigroup has used a lattice-type model to value stock options.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Company has several non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and has various defined benefit pension and termination indemnity plans covering employees outside the United States. The U.S. qualified defined benefit plan provides benefits under a cash balance formula. Employees satisfying certain age and service requirements remain covered by a prior final pay formula under that plan. The Company also offers postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain eligible U.S. retired employees, as well as to certain eligible employees outside the United States. The following tables summarize the components of net expense recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income and the funded status and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the Companys U.S. qualified pension plan, post retirement plans and significant plans outside the United States. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for the U.S. plans as well as the plans outside the United States. 124 Table of Contents Net Expense Pension plans Postretirement benefit plans U.S. plans (1) Plans outside U.S. U.S. plans Plans outside U.S. In millions of dollars 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Benefits earned during the year $ 260 $ 257 $ 241 $ 164 $ 163 $ 147 $ 2 $ 2 $ 2 $ 21 $ 13 $ 14 Interest cost on benefit obligation 630 599 581 274 261 222 61 63 66 65 48 42 Expected return on plan assets (845 ) (806 ) (750 ) (384 ) (315 ) (251 ) (13 ) (14 ) (16 ) (78 ) (49 ) (38 ) Amortization of unrecognized: Net transition obligation    2 2 3       Prior service cost (benefit) (19 ) (24 ) (25 ) 1 1  (4 ) (4 ) (4 ) 1   Net actuarial loss 185 161 105 51 69 60 8 13 8 8 1 1 Curtailment (gain) loss (2) (80 )   7 1 4       Net expense $ 131 $ 187 $ 152 $ 115 $ 182 $ 185 $ 54 $ 60 $ 56 $ 17 $ 13 $ 19 (1) The U.S. plans exclude nonqualified pension plans, for which the net expense was $51 million in 2006, $50 million in 2005, and $44 million in 2004. (2) In 2006, the Company announced that commencing January 1, 2008, the U.S. qualified pension plan would be frozen. Accordingly, no additional contributions would be credited to the cash balance plan for existing plan participants. However, employees still covered under the prior final pay plan will continue to accrue benefits. The estimated net actuarial loss, prior service benefit and net transition obligation that will be amortized from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) into net expense in 2007 are $176 million, $(3) million and $2 million, respectively, for defined benefit pension plans. For postretirement plans, $15 million and $(3) million are expected to be amortized for the estimated net actuarial loss and prior service benefit, respectively. 125 Table of Contents Net Amount Recognized Pension plans Postretirement benefit plans U.S. plans (1) Plans outside U.S. U.S. Plans Plans outside U.S. In millions of dollars at year end 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 Change in projected benefit obligation Projected benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 10,984 $ 10,249 $ 4,552 $ 4,381 $ 1,161 $ 1,172 $ 669 $ 536 Benefits earned during the year 260 257 164 163 2 2 21 13 Interest cost on benefit obligation 630 599 274 261 61 63 65 48 Plan amendments    (2 )   (1 ) 15 Actuarial loss (gain) (147 ) 372 220 229 (67 ) 14 84 77 Benefits paid (537 ) (493 ) (246 ) (211 ) (67 ) (90 ) (35 ) (31 ) Medicare Part D Subsidy     11    Acquisitions   27 76   2  Divestitures   (5 )      Settlements   (15 ) (45 )     Curtailments (81 )  (1 ) 8     Foreign exchange impact   393 (308 )   20 11 Projected benefit obligation at year end $ 11,109 $ 10,984 $ 5,363 $ 4,552 $ 1,101 $ 1,161 $ 825 $ 669 Change in plan assets Plan assets at fair value at beginning of year $ 10,981 $ 10,379 $ 4,784 $ 4,190 $ 179 $ 193 $ 633 $ 393 Actual return on plan assets 1,468 916 605 678 26 18 160 85 Company contributions 20 179 382 379 37 58 223 168 Employee contributions   5 5     Acquisitions   18 75     Divestitures   (2 )      Settlements   (16 ) (46 )     Benefits paid (537 ) (493 ) (246 ) (211 ) (67 ) (90 ) (35 ) (31 ) Foreign exchange impact   376 (286 )   3 18 Plan assets at fair value at year end $ 11,932 $ 10,981 $ 5,906 $ 4,784 $ 175 $ 179 $ 984 $ 633 Reconciliation of prepaid (accrued) benefit cost and total amount recognized Funded status of the plan at year-end $ 823 $ (3 ) $ 543 $ 232 $ (926 ) $ (982 ) $ 159 $ (36 ) Unrecognized: Net transition obligation N/A  N/A 11 N/A  N/A  Prior service cost (benefit) N/A (109 ) N/A 11 N/A (21 ) N/A 7 Net actuarial loss N/A 2,613 N/A 799 N/A 191 N/A 37 Amounts recognized on the balance sheet consist of: Benefit asset $ 823 N/A $ 908 N/A $  N/A $ 355 N/A Benefit liability  N/A (365 ) N/A (926 ) N/A (196 ) N/A Prepaid benefit cost N/A $ 2,501 N/A $ 1,176 N/A $  N/A $ 68 Accrued benefit liability N/A  N/A (212 ) N/A (812 ) N/A (60 ) Intangible asset N/A  N/A 21 N/A  N/A  Amounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss): Additional minimum pension liability N/A  N/A 68 N/A  N/A  Net transition obligation  N/A 9 N/A  N/A 3 N/A Prior service cost (benefit) (10 ) N/A 13 N/A (17 ) N/A (1 ) N/A Net actuarial loss 1,577 N/A 817 N/A 103 N/A 45 N/A Net amount recognized in equitypretax $ 1,567 N/A $ 839 68 $ 86 N/A $ 47 N/A Net amount recognized on the balance sheet $ 2,390 $ 2,501 $ 1,382 $ 1,053 $ (840 ) $ (812 ) $ 206 $ 8 Accumulated benefit obligation at year end $ 10,982 $ 10,734 $ 4,846 $ 4,121 $ 1,101 $ 1,161 $ 825 $ 669 (1) The U.S. plans exclude nonqualified unfunded pension plans, for which the aggregate projected benefit obligation was $660 million and $671 million, and the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation was $646 million and $648 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) includes pretax charges of $133 million as a result of adopting SFAS 158 and $141 million related to an additional minimum liability adjustment for U.S. nonqualified plans at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. N/A Not applicable. 126 Table of Contents At the end of 2006 and 2005 for both qualified and non-qualified plans, and both funded and unfunded plans, the aggregate projected benefit obligation (PBO), the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation (ABO), and the aggregate fair value of plan assets for pension plans with a projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets, and pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets, were as follows: PBO exceeds fair value of plan assets ABO exceeds fair value of plan assets U.S. plans Plans outside U.S. U.S. plans Plans outside U.S. In millions of dollars at year end 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 Projected benefit obligation $ 660 $ 11,655 $ 2,832 $ 1,613 $ 660 $ 671 $ 694 $ 691 Accumulated benefit obligation 646 11,382 2,517 1,419 646 648 632 634 Fair value of plan assets  10,981 2,467 1,337   447 493 Combined plan assets for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, excluding U.S. non-qualified plans, exceeded the accumulated benefit obligations by $2.0 billion and $910 million at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. Assumptions The discount rate and future rate of compensation assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net benefit expense for the Companys plans are shown in the following table: At year end 2006 2005 Discount rate U.S. plans: (1) Pension (2) 5.9 % 5.6 % Postretirement 5.7 5.5 Plans outside the U.S. Range 2.25 to 11.0 2.0 to 12.0 Weighted average 6.5 7.0 Future compensation increase rate U.S. Plans (1)(3) 4.0 4.0 Plans outside the U.S. Range 1.0 to 10.0 2.0 to 9.0 Weighted average 4.3 4.2 During the year 2006 2005 Discount rate U.S. plans (1) Pension (2) 5.6 % 5.75 % Postretirement 5.5 5.5 Plan outside the U.S. Range 2.0 to 12.0 2.0 to 10.0 Weighted average 7.0 5.3 Future compensation increase rate U.S. Plans (1) (3) 4.0 4.0 Plans outside the U.S. Range 2.0 to 9.0 1.5 to 9.0 Weighted average 4.2 2.9 (1) Weighted average rates for the U.S. plans equal the stated rates. (2) At September 30, 2006, the discount rate was changed from 5.6% to 5.9% to reflect the remeasurement due to the pension plan curtailment. (3) Future compensation increase rate for small groups of grandfathered employees is 3.0% or 6.0%. A one percentage-point change in the discount rates would have the following effects on pension expense: One percentage-point increase One percentage-point decrease In millions of dollars 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Effect on pension expense for U.S. plans $ (100 ) $ (146 ) $ (140 ) $ 120 $ 146 $ 140 Effect on pension expense for foreign plans (52 ) (68 ) (260 ) 72 83 306 Assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows: 2006 2005 Health care cost increase rate U.S. plans Following year 9.0 % 10.0 % Ultimate rate to which cost increase is assumed to decline 5.0 % 5.0 % Year in which the ultimate rate is reached 2011 2011 127 Table of Contents A one percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: One percentage-point increase One percentage-point decrease In millions of dollars 2006 2005 2006 2005 Effect on benefits earned and interest cost for U.S. plans $ 5 $ 3 $ (4 ) $ (3 ) Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for U.S. Plans 79 54 (69 ) (48 ) Citigroup considers the expected rate of return to be a longer-term assessment of return expectations, based on each plans expected asset allocation, and does not anticipate changing this assumption annually unless there are significant changes in economic conditions or portfolio composition. Market performance over a number of earlier years is evaluated covering a wide range of economic conditions to determine whether there are sound reasons for projecting forward any past trends. The expected long-term rates of return on assets used in determining the Companys pension expense and postretirement expense are shown below: 2006 2005 Rate of return on assets U.S. plans (1) 8.0 % 8.0 % Plans outside the U.S.: Range 3.25% to 10.0 % 3.25% to 10.0 % Weighted average 8.9 % 6.6 % (1) Weighted average rates for the U.S. plans equal the stated rates. A one percentage-point change in the expected rates of return would have the following effects on pension expense: One percentage-point increase One percentage-point decrease In millions of dollars 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Effect on pension expense for U.S. plans $ (110 ) $ (101 ) $ (94 ) $ 110 $ 101 $ 94 Effect on pension expense for foreign plans (61 ) (45 ) (118 ) 61 45 118 Plan Assets Citigroups pension and postretirement plan asset allocation for the U.S. plans at the end of 2006 and 2005, and the target allocation for 2007 by asset category based on asset fair values are as follows: Target assetallocation U.S. pension assets at December 31 U.S. postretirement assets at December 31 Asset Category 2007 2006 2005 (1) 2006 2005 (1) Equity securities 15% to 40% 35 % 44 % 35 % 44 % Debt securities 13.5 to 43.5 18 13 18 13 Real estate 6 to 12 7 5 7 5 Other investments 18 to 49.5 40 38 40 38 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation. Equity securities in the U.S. pension plans include Citigroup common stock with a fair value of $141 million or 1.2% of plan assets and $122 million or 1.1% of plan assets at the end of 2006 and 2005, respectively. Affiliated and third-party investment managers and affiliated advisors provide their respective services to Citigroups U.S. pension plans. Assets are rebalanced as the plan investment committee deems appropriate. Citigroups investment strategy with respect to its pension assets is to maintain a globally diversified investment portfolio across several asset classes targeting an annual rate of return of 8% that, when combined with Citigroups contributions to the plans, will maintain the plans ability to meet all required benefit obligations. 128 Table of Contents Citigroups pension and postretirement plans weighted average asset allocations for the non-U.S. plans and the actual ranges at the end of 2006 and 2005, and the weighted average target allocations for 2007 by asset category based on asset fair values are as follows: Non-U.S. pension plans Weightedaverage Actual range Weighted average Target assetallocation at December 31 at December 31 Asset Category 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 Equity securities 57.3 % 0.0% to 79.6 % 0.0% to 80.4 % 57.8 % 57.3 % Debt securities 39.4 0.0 to 100 0.0 to 96.0 36.2 37.9 Real estate 0.1 0.0 to 46.8 0.0 to 21.2 0.4 3.0 Other investments 3.2 0.0 to 100 0.0 to 100 5.6 1.8 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Non-U.S. postretirement plans Weightedaverage Actual range Weighted average Target assetallocation at December 31 at December 31 Asset Category 2007 2006 2005 2006 (1) 2005 (1) Equity securities 50.0 % 0.0% to 50.0 % 17.5% to 46.5 % 44.6 % 46.5 % Debt securities 32.5 0.0 to 85.0 43.0 to 82.5 41.4 43.0 Real estate      Other investments 17.5 0.0 to 17.5 0.0 to 10.5 14.0 10.5 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) The weighted average asset allocation is affected by the assets of one plan only, as the assets in the other postretirement plans are insignificant and do not affect the weighting. Citigroups global pension and postretirement funds investment strategies are to invest in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants. The investment strategies are targeted to produce a total return that, when combined with Citigroups contributions to the funds, will maintain the funds ability to meet all required benefit obligations. Risk is controlled through diversification of asset types and investments in domestic and international equities, fixed income securities and cash. The target asset allocation in most locations outside the U.S. is 50% equities and 50% debt securities. These allocations may vary by geographic region and country depending on the nature of applicable obligations and various other regional considerations. The wide variation in the actual range of plan asset allocations for the funded non-U.S. plans is a result of differing local economic conditions. For example, in certain countries local law requires that all pension plan assets must be invested in fixed income investments, or in government funds, or in local country securities. Contributions As a result of new requirements in SFAS 158, Citigroups revised pension funding policy for U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans is generally to fund to applicable minimum funding requirements rather than to the amounts of accumulated benefit obligations. For the U.S. plans, the Company may increase its contributions above the minimum required contribution under ERISA, if appropriate, to its tax and cash position and the plans funded position. At December 31, 2006, there were no minimum required contributions, and no discretionary or non-cash contributions are currently planned. Discretionary contributions in 2007 for the non-U.S. pension plans are anticipated to be approximately $123 million. For 2007, there are no expected or required contributions for the U.S. postretirement benefit plans and $0.4 million of contributions are expected for the non-U.S. postretirement benefit plans. These estimates are subject to change, since contribution decisions are affected by various factors, such as market performance and regulatory requirements; in addition, management has the ability to change funding policy. Estimated Future Benefit Payments The Company expects to pay the following estimated benefit payments in future years: U.S.plans Plans outside U.S. In millions of dollars Pensionbenefits Pensionbenefits Postretirementbenefits 2007 $ 644 $ 234 $ 31 2008 682 232 33 2009 709 245 35 2010 738 261 36 2011 766 279 39 2012-2016 4,358 1,686 238 In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act of 2003) was enacted. The Act of 2003 established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare known as Medicare Part D, and a federal subsidy to sponsors of U.S. retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. The benefits provided to certain participants are at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D and, accordingly, the Company is entitled to a subsidy. 129 Table of Contents With respect to this, Citigroup adopted FSP FAS 106-2 retroactive to the beginning of 2004. The expected subsidy reduced the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) by approximately $154 million and $130 million as of January 1, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and the 2006 and 2005 postretirement expense by approximately $24 million and $19 million, respectively, for all of the postretirement welfare plans for 2006 and 2005. The following table shows the estimated future benefit payments without the effect of the subsidy and the amounts of the expected subsidy in future years. Expected U.S. postretirement benefit payments In millions of dollars Before MedicarePart D Subsidy MedicarePart D Subsidy 2007 $ 113 $ 12 2008 114 13 2009 115 13 2010 114 13 2011 114 13 20122016 $ 513 $ 66 Citigroup 401(k) Under the Citigroup 401(k) plan, eligible employees receive matching contributions of up to 3% of their compensation, subject to an annual maximum of $1,500, invested in the Citigroup common stock fund. The pretax expense associated with this plan amounted to approximately $77 million in 2006, $70 million in 2005, and $69 million in 2004. In connection with the announced changes to the U.S. qualified pension plan, the Company will increase its contributions to the Citigroup 401(k) plan. Beginning in 2008, the eligible employees will receive a matching contribution of up to 6% of their compensation and a fixed contribution of 2% of their total compensation. 10.

The reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the Company's effective income tax rate applicable to income from continuing operations (before minority interest and the cumulative effect of accounting changes) for the years ended December 31 was as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Federal statutory rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit 1.6 1.6 1.4 Foreign income tax rate differential (4.2 ) (3.3 ) (4.5 ) Audit settlements (2) (2.8 ) (0.2 ) (1.3 ) Tax advantaged investments (1.8 ) (1.5 ) (1.6 ) Other, net (0.5 ) (0.8 ) (0.6 ) Effective income tax rate 27.3 % 30.8 % 28.4 % (2) For 2006, relates to the resolution of the Federal and New York Tax Audits. 130 Table of Contents Deferred income taxes at December 31 related to the following: In millions of dollars 2006 2005 Deferred tax assets Credit loss deduction $ 2,497 $ 2,597 Deferred compensation and employee benefits 3,190 1,163 Restructuring and settlement reserves 2,410 3,194 Unremitted foreign earnings 3,638 2,635 Interest-related items 604 839 State tax loss carryforwards  16 Other deferred tax assets 2,111 1,912 Gross deferred tax assets $ 14,450 $ 12,356 Valuation allowance  16 Deferred tax assets after valuation allowance $ 14,450 $ 12,340 Deferred tax liabilities Investments $ (1,738 ) $ (1,294 ) Deferred policy acquisition costs and value of insurance in force (715 ) (700 ) Leases (2,195 ) (2,308 ) Fixed assets (1,201 ) (1,319 ) Intangibles (1,600 ) (808 ) Other deferred tax liabilities (2,314 ) (2,349 ) Gross deferred tax liabilities $ (9,763 ) $ (8,778 ) Net deferred tax asset $ 4,687 $ 3,562 Foreign pre-tax earnings approximated $11.8 billion in 2006, $10.6 billion in 2005, and $10.5 billion in 2004. As a U.S. corporation, Citigroup and its U.S. subsidiaries are subject to U.S. taxation currently on all foreign pre-tax earnings earned by a foreign branch. Pre-tax earnings of a foreign subsidiary or affiliate are subject to U.S. taxation when effectively repatriated. The Company provides income taxes on the undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries except to the extent that such earnings are indefinitely invested outside the United States. At December 31, 2006, $14.7 billion of accumulated undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries were indefinitely invested. At the existing U.S. federal income tax rate, additional taxes (net of U.S. foreign tax credits) of $4.4 billion would have to be provided if such earnings were remitted currently. The current years effect on the income tax expense from continuing operations is included in the Foreign income tax rate differential line in the reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the Companys effective income tax rate on the previous page. The Homeland Investment Act provision of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (2004 Tax Act) provided companies with a one-time 85% reduction in the U.S. net tax liability on cash dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries in 2005, to the extent that they exceed a baseline level of dividends paid in prior years. In 2005, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $198 million in continuing operations, net of the impact of remitting income earned in 2005 and prior years that would have been indefinitely invested overseas. Income taxes are not provided for on the Companys savings bank base year bad debt reserves that arose before 1988 because under current U.S. tax rules such taxes will become payable only to the extent such amounts are distributed in excess of limits prescribed by federal law. At December 31, 2006, the amount of the base year reserves totaled approximately $358 million (subject to a tax of $125 million). There was a $16 million decrease in the valuation allowance related to deferred state tax assets in 2006, and as a result, there is no valuation allowance at December 31, 2006. Management believes that the realization of the recognized net deferred tax asset of $4,687 million is more likely than not based on existing carryback ability and expectations as to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company, which has a history of consistent earnings, has reported pre-tax financial statement income from continuing operations of approximately $27 billion, on average, over the last three years. 131 Table of Contents 11.

FEDERAL FUNDS, SECURITIES BORROWED, LOANED, AND SUBJECT TO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, at their respective carrying values, consisted of the following at December 31: In millions of dollars at year end 2006 2005 Federal funds sold $ 33 $ 30 Securities purchased under agreements to resell 120,603 119,377 Deposits paid for securities borrowed 162,181 98,057 Total $ 282,817 $ 217,464 Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, at their respective carrying values, consisted of the following at December 31: In millions of dollars at year end 2006 2005 Federal funds purchased $ 18,316 $ 9,821 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 270,542 198,730 Deposits received for securities loaned 60,377 33,841 Total $ 349,235 $ 242,392 The resale and repurchase agreements represent collateralized financing transactions used to generate net interest income and facilitate trading activity. These instruments are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities and generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to a year. It is the Companys policy to take possession of the underlying collateral, monitor its market value relative to the amounts due under the agreements, and, when necessary, require prompt transfer of additional collateral or reduction in the balance in order to maintain contractual margin protection. In the event of counterparty default, the financing agreement provides the Company with the right to liquidate the collateral held. Resale agreements and repurchase agreements are reported net by counterparty, when applicable, pursuant to FASB Interpretation No. 41, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements (FIN 41). Excluding the impact of FIN 41, resale agreements totaled $165.7 billion and $230.8 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Deposits paid for securities borrowed and deposits received for securities loaned are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received and are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, corporate debt and equity securities. Securities borrowed transactions require the Company to deposit cash with the lender. With respect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash collateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value of securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities borrowed and securities loaned daily, and additional collateral is obtained as necessary. Securities borrowed and securities loaned are reported net by counterparty, when applicable, pursuant to FASB Interpretation No. 39, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts (FIN 39). 132 Table of Contents 13. BROKERAGE RECEIVABLES AND BROKERAGE PAYABLES The Company has receivables and payables for financial instruments purchased from and sold to brokers and dealers and customers. The Company is exposed to risk of loss from the inability of brokers and dealers or customers to pay for purchases or to deliver the financial instruments sold, in which case the Company would have to sell or purchase the financial instruments at prevailing market prices. Credit risk is reduced to the extent that an exchange or clearing organization acts as a counterparty to the transaction. The Company seeks to protect itself from the risks associated with customer activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines. Margin levels are monitored daily, and customers deposit additional collateral as required. Where customers cannot meet collateral requirements, the Company will liquidate sufficient underlying financial instruments to bring the customer into compliance with the required margin level. Exposure to credit risk is impacted by market volatility, which may impair the ability of clients to satisfy their obligations to the Company. Credit limits are established and closely monitored for customers and brokers and dealers engaged in forwards and futures and other transactions deemed to be credit sensitive. Brokerage receivables and brokerage payables, which arise in the normal course of business, consisted of the following at December 31: In millions of dollars 2006 2005 Receivables from customers $ 27,408 $ 29,394 Receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations 17,037 13,429 Total brokerage receivables $ 44,445 $ 42,823 Payables to customers $ 46,185 $ 46,184 Payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations 38,934 24,810 Total brokerage payables $ 85,119 $ 70,994 14. TRADING ACCOUNT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Trading account assets and liabilities, at fair value, consisted of the following at December 31: In millions of dollars 2006 2005 Trading account assets U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities $ 44,661 $ 38,771 State and municipal securities 17,358 17,856 Foreign government securities 33,057 21,266 Corporate and other debt securities 93,891 60,137 Derivatives (1) 49,541 47,414 Equity securities 92,518 64,553 Mortgage loans and collateralized mortgage securities 37,104 27,852 Other 25,795 17,971 Total trading account assets $ 393,925 $ 295,820 Trading account liabilities Securities sold, not yet purchased $ 71,083 $ 59,780 Derivatives (1) 74,804 61,328 Total trading account liabilities $ 145,887 $ 121,108 (1) Pursuant to master netting agreements. In determining the fair value of our trading portfolio, management also reviews the length of time trading positions have been held to identify aged inventory. During 2006, the monthly average aged trading inventory designated as available-for-immediate-sale was approximately $12.8 billion compared with $8.8 billion in 2005. Inventory positions that are both aged and whose values are unverified amounted to $1.1 billion compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The fair value of aged-inventory is actively monitored and, when appropriate, is discounted to reflect the implied illiquidity for positions that have been available-for-immediate-sale for longer than 90 days. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, such valuation adjustments amounted to $129 million and $96 million, respectively. 133 Table of Contents 15.

(2) Includes fixed income securities, held to maturity. (3) Includes non-marketable equity securities carried at fair value of $15.466 billion and $11.175 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The related gross unrealized gains and losses, which were recognized in earnings, were $1.619 billion and $263 million as of December 31, 2006, respectively, and $1.165 billion and $146 million as of December 31, 2005, respectively. At December 31, 2006, the cost of approximately 5,000 investments in equity and fixed income securities exceeded their fair value by $1.941 billion. Of the $1.941 billion, the gross unrealized loss on equity securities was $259 million. Of the remainder, $434 million represents fixed income investments that have been in a gross unrealized loss position for less than a year, and of these 97% are rated investment grade; $1,248 million represents fixed income investments that have been in a gross unrealized loss position for a year or more, and of these 96% are rated investment grade. Management has determined that the unrealized losses on the Companys investments in equity and fixed income securities at December 31, 2006 are temporary in nature. The Company conducts periodic reviews to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment. An investment in a debt or equity security is impaired if its fair value falls below its cost and the decline is considered other-than-temporary. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. The Companys review for impairment generally entails:  Identification and evaluation of investments that have indications of possible impairment;  Analysis of individual investments that have fair values significantly less than amortized cost, including consideration of the length of time the investment has been in an unrealized loss position;  Discussion of evidential matter, including an evaluation of factors or triggers that could cause individual investments to qualify as having other-than-temporary impairment and those that would not support other-than-temporary impairment; and  Documentation of the results of these analyses, as required under business policies. 134 Table of Contents The table below shows the fair value of investments in fixed income and equity securities that are available-for-sale and that have been in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months or for 12 months or longer as of December 31, 2006 and 2005: Less than 12 months 12 months or longer Total In millions of dollars at year end Fair value Grossunrealizedlosses Fair value Grossunrealizedlosses Fair value Grossunrealizedlosses 2006: Fixed income securities available-for-sale Mortgage-backed securities, principally obligations of U.S. federal agencies $ 26,817 $ 53 $ 4,172 $ 239 $ 30,989 $ 292 U.S. Treasury and federal agencies 14,755 42 4,562 311 19,317 353 State and municipal 1,500 10 42  1,542 10 Foreign government 29,385 288 6,888 439 36,273 727 U.S. corporate 1,208 9 1,946 228 3,154 237 Other debt securities 4,389 32 1,024 31 5,413 63 Total fixed income securities available-for-sale $ 78,054 $ 434 $ 18,634 $ 1,248 $ 96,688 $ 1,682 Equity securities $ 830 $ 257 $ 27 $ 2 $ 857 $ 259 2005: Fixed income securities available-for-sale (1) Mortgage-backed securities, principally obligations of U.S. federal agencies $ 7,242 $ 69 $ 1,437 $ 193 $ 8,679 $ 262 U.S. Treasury and federal agencies 20,697 71 4,356 361 25,053 432 State and municipal 2,205 21 12  2,217 21 Foreign government 20,124 186 12,074 202 32,198 388 U.S. corporate 1,542 32 903 275 2,445 307 Other debt securities 3,276 26 1,281 19 4,557 45 Total fixed income securities available-for-sale $ 55,086 $ 405 $ 20,063 $ 1,050 $ 75,149 $ 1,455 Equity securities $ 229 $ 16 $ 34 $ 5 $ 263 $ 21 (1) Reclassified to conform to current periods presentation.

(2) Reclassified to conform to current years presentation. (3) Includes loans not otherwise separately categorized. Included in the previous loan table are lending products whose terms may give rise to additional credit issues. Credit cards with below-market introductory interest rates, multiple loans supported by the same collateral (e.g., home equity loans), or interest-only loans are examples of such products. However, these products are not material to Citigroups financial position and are closely managed via credit controls that mitigate their additional inherent risk. Impaired loans are those on which Citigroup believes it is probable that it will not collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. This excludes smaller-balance homogeneous loans that are evaluated collectively for impairment, and are carried on a cash basis. Valuation allowances for these loans are estimated considering all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans contractual effective rate, the secondary market value of the loan and the fair value of collateral less disposal costs. The following table presents information about impaired loans: In millions of dollars at year end 2006 2005 2004 Impaired corporate loans $ 458 $ 925 $ 1,854 Other impaired loans (1) 360 327 934 Total impaired loans (2) $ 818 $ 1,252 $ 2,788 Impaired loans with valuation allowances $ 439 $ 919 $ 1,847 Total valuation allowances (3) 122 238 431 During the year Average balance of impaired loans $ 767 $ 1,432 $ 2,215 Interest income recognized on impaired loans $ 63 $ 99 $ 175 (1) Primarily commercial market loans managed by the Consumer business. (2) Excludes loans purchased for investment purposes. (3) Included in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, included in the loan table are purchased distressed loans, which are loans that have evidenced credit deterioration subsequent to origination but prior to acquisition by Citigroup. In conforming to the requirements of Statement of Position No. 03-3, Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer (SOP 03-3), which became effective in 2005, these purchased loans were reclassified from other assets to loans. In accordance with SOP 03-3, the difference between the total expected cash flows for these loans and the initial recorded investments must be recognized in income over the life of the loans using a level yield. Accordingly, these loans have been excluded from the impaired loan information presented above. In addition, per the Statement of Position, subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows for a purchased distressed loan require a build of an allowance so the loan retains its level yield. However, increases in the expected cash flows are first recognized as a reduction of any previously established allowance and then recognized as income prospectively over the remaining life of the loan by increasing the loans level yield. Where the expected cash flow cannot be estimated, the purchased distressed loan is accounted for under the cost recovery method. The carrying amount of the purchased distressed loan portfolio at December 31, 2006 was $949 million net of an allowance of $59 million. 136 Table of Contents The changes in the accretable yield, related allowance and carrying amount net of accretable yield for 2006 are as follows: In millions of dollars Accretable yield Carrying amount of loanreceivable Allowance Beginning balance $ 109 $ 1,094 $ 34 Purchases (1) 48 403 Disposals/payments received (27 ) (671 ) Accretion (131 ) 131 Builds (reductions) to the allowance  (8 ) 25 Increase to expected cash flow 72  Balance, December 31, 2006 (2) $ 71 $ 949 $ 59 (1) The balance reported in the column Carrying amount of loan receivable consists of $160 million of purchased loans accounted for under the level-yield method and $243 million under the cost recovery method. These balances represent the fair value of these loans at their acquisition date. The related total expected cash flows for the level-yield loans was $208 million at their acquisition date. The balance reported in the Accretable yield column includes the effects from an increase in the expected cash flows of $72 million. (2) The balance reported in the column Carrying amount of loan receivable consists of $557 million of loans accounted under the level-yield method and $392 million accounted for under the cost recovery method. 17.

CGMHI has a syndicated five-year committed uncollateralized revolving line of credit facility with unaffiliated banks totaling $3.0 billion, which matures in 2011. CGMHI also has three-year bilateral facilities totaling $575 million with unaffiliated banks with borrowings maturing on various dates in 2009. At December 31, 2006, $1.0 billion of the syndicated five-year committed facility was drawn. CGMHI also has committed long-term financing facilities with unaffiliated banks. At December 31, 2006, CGMHI had drawn down the full $1.78 billion available under these facilities, of which $1.08 million is guaranteed by Citigroup. A bank can terminate these facilities by giving CGMHI prior notice (generally one year). CGMHI also has substantial borrowing arrangements consisting of facilities that CGMHI has been advised are available, but where no contractual lending obligation exists. These arrangements are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure flexibility in meeting CGMHIs short-term requirements. The Company issues both fixed and variable rate debt in a range of currencies. It uses derivative contracts, primarily interest rate swaps, to effectively convert a portion of its fixed rate debt to variable rate debt and variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. The maturity structure of the derivatives generally corresponds to the maturity structure of the debt being hedged. In addition, the Company uses other derivative contracts to manage the foreign exchange impact of certain debt issuances. At December 31, 2006, the Companys overall weighted average interest rate for long-term debt was 5.00% on a contractual basis and 4.79% including the effects of derivative contracts. Aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt obligations (based on final maturity dates) including trust preferred securities are as follows: In millions of dollars 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Citigroup Parent Company $ 9,828 $ 12,344 $ 13,422 $ 12,246 $ 13,344 $ 64,166 Other Citigroup Subsidiaries 22,015 26,067 34,012 6,037 15,050 12,397 Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. 4,855 4,633 4,527 4,895 1,640 8,169 Citigroup Funding Inc. 1,821 6,168 4,207 1,385 1,628 3,638 Total $ 38,519 $ 49,212 $ 56,168 $ 24,563 $ 31,662 $ 88,370 140 Table of Contents Long-term debt at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 includes $9,775 million and $6,459 million, respectively, of junior subordinated debt. The Company formed statutory business trusts under the laws of the state of Delaware, which exist for the exclusive purposes of (i) issuing Trust Securities representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust; (ii) investing the gross proceeds of the Trust securities in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures (subordinated debentures) of its parent; and (iii) engaging in only those activities necessary or incidental thereto. Upon approval from the Federal Reserve, Citigroup has the right to redeem these securities.

On February 15, 2006, Citigroup redeemed for cash all outstanding shares of its Fixed/Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series V. The redemption price was $50.00 per depositary share, plus accrued dividends to the date of redemption. At the date of redemption, the value of the Series V Preferred Stock was $125 million. Regulatory Capital Citigroup is subject to risk-based capital and leverage guidelines issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). Its U.S. insured depository institution subsidiaries, including Citibank, N.A., are subject to similar guidelines issued by their respective primary federal bank regulatory agencies. These guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and include the required minimums shown in the following table. The regulatory agencies are required by law to take specific prompt actions with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital standards. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, all of Citigroups U.S. insured subsidiary depository institutions were well capitalized. At December 31, 2006, regulatory capital as set forth in guidelines issued by the U.S. federal bank regulators is as follows: In millions of dollars Requiredminimum Wellcapitalizedminimum Citigroup (1) Citibank, N.A. (1) Tier 1 Capital $ 90,899 $ 59,860 Total Capital (2) 123,260 89,138 Tier 1 Capital Ratio 4.0 % 6.0 % 8.59 % 8.32 % Total Capital Ratio (2) 8.0 10.0 11.65 12.39 Leverage Ratio (3) 3.0 5.0 (4) 5.16 6.09 (1) The FRB granted interim capital relief for the impact of adopting SFAS 158 at December 31, 2006. (2) Total Capital includes Tier 1 and Tier 2. (3) Tier 1 Capital divided by adjusted average assets. (4) Applicable only to depository institutions. For bank holding companies to be well capitalized, they must maintain a minimum Leverage Ratio of 3%. Banking Subsidiaries There are various legal limitations on the ability of Citigroups subsidiary depository institutions to extend credit, pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to Citigroup and its nonbank subsidiaries. The approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, in the case of national banks, or the Office of Thrift Supervision, in the case of federal savings banks, is required if total dividends declared in any calendar year exceed amounts specified by the applicable agencys regulations. State-chartered depository institutions are subject to dividend limitations imposed by applicable state law. As of December 31, 2006, Citigroups subsidiary depository institutions can declare dividends to their parent companies, without regulatory approval, of approximately $17.7 billion. In determining the dividends, each depository institution must also consider its effect on applicable risk-based capital and Leverage Ratio requirements, as well as policy statements of the federal regulatory agencies that indicate that banking organizations should generally pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Consistent with these considerations, Citigroup estimates that, as of December 31, 2006, its subsidiary depository institutions can distribute dividends to Citigroup of approximately $11.0 billion of the available $17.7 billion. 142 Table of Contents Non-Banking Subsidiaries Citigroup also receives dividends from its nonbank subsidiaries. These nonbank subsidiaries are generally not subject to regulatory restrictions on dividends. The ability of CGMHI to declare dividends can be restricted by capital considerations of its broker-dealer subsidiaries.

SECURITIZATIONS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES The Company primarily securitizes credit card receivables and mortgages. Other types of assets securitized include corporate debt securities, auto loans, and student loans. After securitization of credit card receivables, the Company continues to maintain credit card customer account relationships and provides servicing for receivables transferred to the trusts. The Company also arranges for third parties to provide credit enhancement to the trusts, including cash collateral accounts, subordinated securities, and letters of credit. As specified in some of the sale agreements, the net revenue collected each month is accumulated up to a predetermined maximum amount, and is available over the remaining term of that transaction to make payments of yield, fees, and transaction costs in the event that net cash flows from the receivables are not sufficient. Once the predetermined amount is reached, net revenue is recognized by the Citigroup subsidiary that sold the receivables. The Company provides a wide range of mortgage and other loan products to a diverse customer base. In connection with the securitization of these loans, the servicing rights entitle the Company to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balances of the loans and the 143 Table of Contents contractual servicing fee. Failure to service the loans in accordance with contractual requirements may lead to a termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees. In non-recourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the Company is the cost of temporary advances of funds. In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans such as FNMA or FHLMC or with a private investor, insurer, or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing occur primarily when foreclosure sale proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage are less than the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest of the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The Companys mortgage loan securitizations are primarily non-recourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchase of the securities issued by the trust. The Company also originates and sells first mortgage loans in the ordinary course of its mortgage banking activities. The Company sells some of these loans to the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) with the servicing rights retained. GNMA has the primary recourse obligation on the individual loans; however, GNMAs recourse obligation is capped at a fixed amount per loan. Any losses above that fixed amount are borne by Citigroup as the seller/servicer. The following table summarizes certain cash flows received from and paid to securitization trusts during 2006, 2005, and 2004: 2006 2005 2004 In billions of dollars Credit cards Mortgages Other (1) Credit cards Mortgages Other (1) Credit cards Mortgages Other (1) Proceeds from new securitizations $ 20.2 $ 96.7 $ 38.7 $ 21.6 $ 85.2 $ 33.1 $ 20.2 $ 66.4 $ 22.7 Proceeds from collections reinvested in new receivables 213.1 1.8  201.3 1.4  171.1 0.8 0.1 Contractual servicing fees received 2.1 1.0  1.9 0.9  1.5 0.7  Cash flows received on retained interests and other net cash flows 7.9 0.1  6.4 0.1 0.1 5.3  0.1 (1) Other includes corporate debt securities, student loans and other assets. The Company recognized gains on securitizations of mortgages of $171 million, $197 million, and $342 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. In 2006, the Company recorded net gains of $975 million and, in 2005 and 2004, recorded net gains of $1.0 billion and $234 million, respectively, related to the securitization of credit card receivables. Gains recognized on the securitization of other assets during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $217 million, $126 million and $93 million, respectively. Key assumptions used for credit cards, mortgages, and other assets during 2006 and 2005 in measuring the fair value of retained interests at the date of sale or securitization follow: 2006 2005 Credit cards Mortgages and other (1) Credit cards Mortgages and other (1) Discount rate 12.0% to 16.2% 0.4% to 27.9% 13.6% to 17.3% 0.4% to 98.6 % Constant prepayment rate 6.4% to 21.7% 6.6% to 52.5% 8.5% to 20.0% 6.0% to 46.4 % Anticipated net credit losses 3.8% to 6.1% 0.0% to 100% 5.1% to 6.5% 0.0% to 80.0 % (1) Other includes corporate debt securities, student loans and other assets. As required by SFAS 140, the effect of two negative changes in each of the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of retained interests must be disclosed. The negative effect of each change must be calculated independently, holding all other assumptions constant. Because the key assumptions may not in fact be independent, the net effect of simultaneous adverse changes in the key assumptions may be less than the sum of the individual effects shown below. At December 31, 2006, the key assumptions used to value retained interests and the sensitivity of the fair value to adverse changes of 10% and 20% in each of the key assumptions were as follows: Key Assumptions at December 31, 2006 Mortgages and other (1) Credit cards Discount rate 4.1% to 27.9 % 12.8% to 16.2 % Constant prepayment rate 7.1% to 52.5 % 6.4% to 20.9 % Anticipated net credit losses 24.0% to 100 % 3.9% to 6.1 % Weighted average life 6.1 to 21.2 years 11 to 12 months (1) Other includes corporate debt securities, student loans and other assets.

As a result, the Company considers the securitized credit card receivables to be part of the business it manages. The following tables present a reconciliation between the managed basis and on-balance sheet credit card portfolios and the related delinquencies (loans which are 90 days or more past due) and credit losses, net of recoveries.

The following table summarizes the changes in capitalized MSRs: In millions of dollars 2006 2005 Balance, beginning of year $ 4,339 $ 4,149 Originations 1,010 842 Purchases 673 107 Amortization (2)  (859 ) Gain (loss) on changesin value of MSRs (1)  (158 ) Provision for impairments (2)  258 Changes in fair value of MSRs due tochanges in inputs and assumptions 309  Other changes (3) (892 )  Balance, end of year $ 5,439 $ 4,339 (1) The gain (loss) on changes in value of MSRs represents the change in the fair value of the MSRs attributable to risks that were hedged using fair value hedges in accordance with SFAS 133 prior to 2006. The offsetting change in the fair value of the related hedging instruments is not included in this table. With the adoption of SFAS 156 on January 1, 2006, the Company no longer applies fair value hedge accounting to its MSRs. (2) With the adoption of SFAS 156, the Company carries its MSRs at fair value and no longer amortizes servicing assets over the period of estimated net servicing income, or assesses impairment related to the excess of the MSRs net carrying value over their fair value as any impairment would be reflected in the fair value of the MSRs. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 156, the provision for impairment of MSRs represented the excess of their net carrying value, which included the gain (loss) on changes in value of MSRs over their fair value. The provision for impairment increased the valuation allowance on MSRs, which was a component of the net MSRs carrying value. A recovery of the MSR impairment was recorded when the fair value of the MSRs exceeded their carrying value, but it was limited to the amount of the existing valuation allowance. The valuation allowance on MSRs was $1.021 billion at December 31, 2005. (3) Represents changes due to customer payments and passage of time. The market for MSRs is not sufficiently liquid to provide participants with quoted market prices. Therefore, the Company uses an option-adjusted spread valuation approach to determine the fair value of MSRs. This approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios, and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted discount rates. The key assumptions used in the valuation of MSRs include mortgage prepayment speeds and discount rates. The model assumptions and the MSRs fair value estimates are compared to observable trades of similar MSR portfolios and interest-only security portfolios, as well as to MSR broker valuations and industry surveys. The cash flow model and underlying prepayment and interest rate models used to value these MSRs are subject to validation in accordance with the Companys model validation policies. Key economic assumptions used in determining the fair value of MSRs at December 31, 2006 were as follows: Discount rate 10.61% Estimated prepayment rate 11.72% Average expected life in years 6.13 years The fair value of the MSRs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates. In managing this risk, the Company hedges a significant portion of the value of its MSRs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts, forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed securities, and purchased securities classified as trading. The amount of contractually specified servicing fees, late fees and ancillary fees earned were $1,036 million, $56 million and $45 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2006. These fees are classified in the Consolidated Statement of Income as Commissions and Fees. 145 Table of Contents Variable Interest Entities The following table summarizes all the Companys involvement in SPEs by business segment at December 31, 2006 and 2005, both as direct participant or structurer: 2006 2005 (1) In millions of dollars of SPE assets VIEs QSPEs Totalinvolvementwith SPEs VIEs QSPEs Totalinvolvementwith SPEs Global Consumer Credit Cards $ 527 $ 111,766 $ 112,293 $ 791 $ 107,925 $ 108,716 Investment funds 12,358  12,358 10,920  10,920 Leasing 2,006  2,006 2,437  2,437 Mortgages  333,804 333,804 1,833 283,245 285,078 Other 2,659 12,732 15,391 1,733 5,716 7,449 Total $ 17,550 $ 458,302 $ 475,852 $ 17,714 $ 396,886 $ 414,600 Corporate and Investment Banking Commercial paper conduits $ 70,825 $  $ 70,825 $ 59,662 $  $ 59,662 Mortgage-backed securities 109,659 1,033,810 1,143,469 95,149 798,220 893,369 CDOs 110,109  110,109 74,290  74,290 Structured finance 146,419 11,249 157,668 141,398 6,117 147,515 Other 56,437 2,351 58,788 54,853 2,289 57,142 Total $ 493,449 $ 1,047,410 $ 1,540,859 $ 425,352 $ 806,626 $ 1,231,978 Global Wealth Management Investment funds $ 4,400 $  $ 4,400 $ 4,820 $  $ 4,820 Structured investment vehicles 1,259  1,259 620  620 Total $ 5,659 $  $ 5,659 $ 5,440 $  $ 5,440 Alternative Investments Structured investment vehicles $ 79,847 $  $ 79,847 $ 55,692 $  $ 55,692 Investment funds 42,187  42,187 20,727  20,727 Total $ 122,034 $  $ 122,034 $ 76,419 $  $ 76,419 Corporate/Other-Trust Preferred Securities $ 9,775 $  $ 9,775 $ 6,459 $  $ 6,459 Total Citigroup $ 648,467 $ 1,505,712 $ 2,154,179 $ 531,384 $ 1,203,512 $ 1,734,896 (1) Reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation. Some of the Companys private equity subsidiaries may invest in venture capital entities that may also be subject to FIN 46-R and are not included in the previous table showing our VIE involvement. The Company accounts for its venture capital activities in accordance with the Investment Company Audit Guide (Audit Guide). Also excluded from the above table are certain funds for which the Company provides investment management services. The Companys involvement in these funds is not considered significant. The Company provides administrative, trustee and/or investment management services to numerous personal estate trusts, which are considered VIEs under FIN 46-R, but not consolidated. These trusts are excluded from the table summarizing the Companys involvement in VIEs. The following table represents the carrying amounts and classification of consolidated assets that are collateral for VIE obligations, including VIEs that were consolidated prior to the implementation of FIN 46-R under then-existing guidance and VIEs that the Company became involved with after July 1, 2003: In billions of dollars December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 Cash $ 0.5 $ 0.4 Trading account assets 31.6 29.7 Investments 10.1 6.1 Loans 6.8 9.5 Other assets 5.7 4.7 Total assets of consolidated VIEs $ 54.7 $ 50.4 146 Table of Contents The consolidated VIEs included in the table above represent hundreds of separate entities with which the Company is involved and includes approximately $1.6 billion related to VIEs consolidated as a result of adopting FIN 46-R as of January 1, 2004 and $2.1 billion related to VIEs consolidated as a result of adopting FIN 46 at July 1, 2003. Of the $54.7 billion and $50.4 billion of total assets of VIEs consolidated by the Company at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, $39.2 billion and $37.1 billion represent structured transactions where the Company packages and securitizes assets purchased in the financial markets or from clients in order to create new security offerings and financing opportunities for clients; $13.1 billion and $10.6 billion represent investment vehicles that were established to provide a return to the investors in the vehicles; and $2.4 billion and $2.7 billion represent vehicles that hold lease receivables and equipment as collateral to issue debt securities, thus obtaining secured financing at favorable interest rates. The Company may provide various products and services to the VIEs. It may provide liquidity facilities, may be a party to derivative contracts with VIEs, may provide loss enhancement in the form of letters of credit and other guarantees to the VIEs, may be the investment manager, and may also have an ownership interest or other investment in certain VIEs. In general, the investors in the obligations of consolidated VIEs have recourse only to the assets of the VIEs and do not have recourse to the Company, except where the Company has provided a guarantee to the investors or is the counterparty to a derivative transaction involving the VIE. In addition to the VIEs that are consolidated in accordance with FIN 46-R, the Company has significant variable interests in certain other VIEs that are not consolidated because the Company is not the primary beneficiary. These include multi-seller finance companies, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), structured finance transactions, and numerous investment funds. In addition to these VIEs, the Company issues preferred securities to third-party investors through trust vehicles as a source of funding and regulatory capital, which were deconsolidated during the first quarter of 2004. The Companys liabilities to the deconsolidated trusts are included in long-term debt. The Company administers several third-party-owned, special purpose, multi-seller finance companies that purchase pools of trade receivables, credit cards, and other financial assets from third-party clients of the Company. As administrator, the Company provides accounting, funding, and operations services to these conduits. Generally, the Company has no ownership interest in the conduits. The sellers continue to service the transferred assets. The conduits asset purchases are funded by issuing commercial paper and medium-term notes. The sellers absorb the first losses of the conduits by providing collateral in the form of excess assets. The Company, along with other financial institutions, provides liquidity facilities, such as commercial paper backstop lines of credit to the conduits. The Company also provides loss enhancement in the form of letters of credit and other guarantees. All fees are charged on a market basis. During 2003, to comply with FIN 46-R, many of the conduits issued first loss subordinated notes such that one third-party investor in each conduit would be deemed the primary beneficiary and would consolidate the conduit. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, total assets in unconsolidated conduits were $66.3 billion and $55.3 billion, respectively. The Company also packages and securitizes assets purchased in the financial markets in order to create new security offerings, including arbitrage CDOs and synthetic CDOs for institutional clients and retail customers, that match the clients investment needs and preferences. Typically, these instruments diversify investors risk to a pool of assets as compared with investments in an individual asset. The VIEs, which are issuers of CDO securities, are generally organized as limited liability corporations. The Company typically receives fees for structuring and/or distributing the securities sold to investors. In some cases, the Company may repackage the investment with higher rated debt CDO securities or U.S. Treasury securities to provide a greater or a very high degree of certainty of the return on invested principal. A third-party manager is typically retained by the VIE to select collateral for inclusion in the pool and then actively manage it, or, in other cases, only to manage work-out credits. The Company may also provide other financial services and/or products to the VIEs for market-rate fees. These may include: the provision of liquidity or contingent liquidity facilities; interest rate or foreign exchange hedges and credit derivative instruments; and the purchasing and warehousing of securities until they are sold to the SPE. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs under FIN 46-R due to its limited continuing involvement and, as a result, does not consolidate their assets and liabilities in its financial statements. In addition to the conduits discussed above, the following table represents the assets of unconsolidated VIEs where the Company has significant involvement: In billions of dollars December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005(1) CDO-type transactions $ 52.1 $ 40.7 Investment-related transactions 122.1 78.0 Trust preferred securities 9.8 6.5 Mortgage-related transactions 2.7 3.1 Structured finance and other 41.1 63.1 Total assets of significant unconsolidated VIEs $ 227.8 $ 191.4 (1) Reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation. The Company has also established a number of investment funds as opportunities for qualified employees to invest in venture capital investments. The Company acts as investment manager to these funds and may provide employees with financing on both a recourse and non-recourse basis for a portion of the employees investment commitments. In addition, the Company administers numerous personal estate trusts. The Company may act as trustee and may also be the investment manager for the trust assets. As mentioned above, the Company may, along with other financial institutions, provide liquidity facilities, such as commercial paper backstop lines of credit to the VIEs. The Company may be a party to derivative contracts with VIEs, may provide loss enhancement in the form of letters of credit and other guarantees to the VIEs, may be the investment manager, and may also have an ownership interest in certain VIEs. Although actual losses are not expected to be material, the Companys maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with VIEs that are not consolidated was $109 billion and $91 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. For this purpose, maximum exposure is considered to be the notional amounts of credit lines, guarantees, other credit support, and liquidity facilities, the notional amounts of credit default swaps and certain total return swaps, and the amount invested where Citigroup has an ownership interest in the VIEs. In addition, the Company may be party to other derivative contracts with VIEs. Exposures that are considered to be guarantees are also included in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 151. 147 Table of Contents 23. DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES In the ordinary course of business, Citigroup enters into various types of derivative transactions. These derivative transactions include:  Futures and forward contracts which are commitments to buy or sell at a future date a financial instrument, commodity or currency at a contracted price and may be settled in cash or through delivery.  Swap contracts which are commitments to settle in cash at a future date or dates that may range from a few days to a number of years, based on differentials between specified financial indices, as applied to a notional principal amount.  Option contracts which give the purchaser, for a fee, the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell within a limited time a financial instrument or currency at a contracted price that may also be settled in cash, based on differentials between specified indices. Citigroup enters into these derivative contracts for the following reasons:  Trading Purposes  Customer Needs  Citigroup offers its customers derivatives in connection with their risk-management actions to transfer, modify or reduce their interest rate, foreign exchange and other market/credit risks or for their own trading purposes. As part of this process, Citigroup considers the customers suitability for the risk involved, and the business purpose for the transaction. Citigroup also manages its derivative-risk positions through offsetting trade activities, controls focused on price verification, and daily reporting of positions to senior managers.  Trading Purposes  Own Account  Citigroup trades derivatives for its own account. Trading limits and price verification controls are key aspects of this activity.  Asset/Liability Management Hedging  Citigroup uses derivatives in connection with its risk-management activities to hedge certain risks. For example, Citigroup may issue a fixed rate long-term note and then enter into a receive-fixed, pay-variable-rate interest rate swap with the same tenor and notional amount to convert the interest payments to a net variable-rate basis. This strategy is the most common form of an interest rate hedge, as it minimizes interest cost in certain yield curve environments. Derivatives are also used to manage risks inherent in specific groups of on-balance sheet assets and liabilities, including investments, corporate and consumer loans, deposit liabilities, other interest-sensitive assets and liabilities, as well as credit card securitizations, redemptions and sales. In addition, foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated debt, available-for-sale securities, net capital exposures and foreign exchange transactions. Citigroup accounts for its hedging activity in accordance with SFAS 133. As a general rule, SFAS 133 hedge accounting is permitted for those situations where the Company is exposed to a particular risk, such as interest rate or foreign exchange risk, that causes changes in the fair value of an asset or liability, or variability in the expected future cash flows of an existing asset, liability, or a forecasted transaction. Derivative contracts hedging the risks associated with the changes in fair value are referred to as fair value hedges, while contracts hedging the risks affecting the expected future cash flows are called cash flow hedges. Hedges that utilize derivatives to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with equity investments in non-U.S. dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries are called net investment hedges. All derivatives are reported on the balance sheet at fair value. If certain hedging criteria specified in SFAS 133 are met, including testing for hedging effectiveness, special hedge accounting may be applied. The hedge effectiveness assessment methodologies for similar hedges are performed in a similar manner and are used consistently throughout the hedging relationships. For fair value hedges, the changes in value of the hedging derivative, as well as the changes in value of the related hedged item, due to the risk being hedged, are reflected in current earnings. For cash flow hedges and net investment hedges, the changes in value of the hedging derivative are reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity, to the extent the hedge was effective. Hedge ineffectiveness, in either case, is reflected in current earnings. Continuing with the example referred to above, the fixed rate long-term note is recorded at amortized cost under current U.S. GAAP. However, by electing to use SFAS 133 hedge accounting, the carrying value of this note is adjusted for changes in the benchmark floating rate, with any changes in fair value recorded in current earnings. The related interest rate swap is also recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, with any changes in fair value attributable to changes in interest rates reflected in earnings. Thus, any ineffectiveness resulting from the hedging relationship is recorded in current earnings. Alternatively, an economic-basis hedge, which does not meet the SFAS 133 hedging criteria, would involve only recording the derivative at fair value on the balance sheet, with its associated changes in value recorded in earnings. The note would continue to be carried at amortized cost, and therefore, current earnings would be impacted only by the interest rate shifts that cause the change in the swaps value. This type of hedge is undertaken when SFAS 133 hedge requirements cannot be achieved in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Fair value hedges  Hedging of benchmark interest rate risk  Citigroup hedges exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate financing transactions, including liabilities related to outstanding debt, borrowings and time deposits. The fixed cash flows from those financing transactions are converted to benchmark-variable-rate cash flows by entering into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. Typically these fair value hedge relationships use dollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis. Citigroup also hedges exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate assets, including available-for-sale securities, reverse repurchase agreements and inter-bank placements. The hedging instruments mainly used are receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps for the remaining hedged asset categories. Most of these fair value hedging relationships use dollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis, while others use regression analysis. For a limited number of fair value hedges of benchmark interest rate risk, Citigroup uses the shortcut method as SFAS 133 allows the Company to assume no ineffectiveness if the hedging relationship involves an interest-bearing financial asset or liability and an interest rate swap. In order to assume no ineffectiveness, Citigroup ensures that all the shortcut method requirements of SFAS 133 for these types of hedging relationships are met. 148 Table of Contents  Hedging of foreign exchange risk  Citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to foreign exchange rate movements in available-for-sale securities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity holding the securities, which may be within or outside the U.S. Typically, the hedging instrument employed is a short-term forward foreign exchange contract. In this type of hedge, the change in fair value of the hedged available-for-sale security attributable to the portion of foreign exchange risk hedged is reported in earnings and not other comprehensive incomea process that serves to offset substantially the change in fair value of the forward contract that is also reflected in earnings. Citigroup typically considers the premium associated with forward contracts (differential between spot and contractual forward rates) as the cost of hedging; this is generally excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and reflected directly in earnings. Hedge effectiveness is typically assessed based on changes in fair value attributable to changes in spot rates on both the available-for-sale securities and the forward contracts for the portion of the relationship hedged. As a result, the amount of hedge ineffectiveness is not significant.  Hedging the overall changes in fair value  Citigroup primarily hedges the change in the overall fair value of portfolios of similar held-for-sale mortgage loans. Derivatives used in these hedging relationships are mainly forward sales of mortgage-backed securities. Citigroup assesses effectiveness at inception and on an ongoing basis using regression analysis. Cash flow hedges  Hedging of benchmark interest rate risk  Citigroup hedges variable cash flows resulting from floating-rate financings, including debt, deposits with stated maturities. Variable cash flows from those financings are converted to fixed-rate cash flows by entering into receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps. Efforts are made to match all critical terms of the hedged item and the hedging derivative at inception and on an ongoing basis to eliminate hedge ineffectiveness. To the extent all critical terms are not matched, these cash flow hedging relationships use regression or dollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis. Since efforts are made initially to align the terms of the derivatives to those hedged forecasted cash flows, the amount of hedge ineffectiveness is not significant. Citigroup also hedges variable cash flows resulting from investments in floating-rate available-for-sale securities, loans and receivables, as well as rollovers of short-term certificates of deposit. Variable cash flows from those assets are converted to fixed-rate cash flows by entering into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. These cash flow hedging relationships use regression or dollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and on an ongoing basis. Efforts are made initially to align the terms of the derivatives to those hedged forecasted cash flows. As a result, the amount of hedge ineffectiveness is not significant.  Hedging of foreign exchange risk  Citigroup locks in the functional currency equivalent of cash flows of various balance sheet exposures, including deposits, notes and long-term debt (and the forecasted issuances, purchases or rollover of such items) that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the issuing entity. Depending on the risk management objectives, these types of hedges are designated as either cash flow hedges of only foreign exchange risk or cash flow hedges of both foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Generally, the hedging instruments used are foreign exchange forward contracts and cross-currency swaps. Citigroup matches all critical terms of the hedged item and the hedging derivative at inception and on an ongoing basis to eliminate hedge ineffectiveness. To the extent all critical terms are not matched, any ineffectiveness is measured using the hypothetical derivative method as described in FASB Derivative Implementation Group Issue G7. Efforts are made initially to match up the terms of the hypothetical and actual derivatives used. As a result, the amount of hedge ineffectiveness is not significant.  Hedging the overall changes in cash flows  In situations where the contractual rate of a variable rate asset or liability is not a benchmark rate, Citigroup designates the risk of overall changes in cash flows as the hedged risk. Citigroup primarily hedges variability in the total cash flows related to non-benchmark-rate-based liabilities, such as customer deposits with stated maturities, and uses receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps as the hedging instrument. These cash flow hedging relationships use regression or dollar-offset ratio analysis to assess effectiveness at inception and on an ongoing basis. Citigroup also hedges the forecasted purchase of mortgage-backed securities and designates the overall change in the purchase price as a hedged risk. The assessment of effectiveness is based on ensuring that the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged item match exactly. Net investment hedges Consistent with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation (SFAS 52), SFAS 133 allows hedging of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign operation. Citigroup primarily uses foreign currency forward contracts, short-term borrowings, and to a lesser extent foreign currency future contracts and foreign-currency-denominated debt instruments, to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with Citigroups equity investments in several non-U.S. dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. In accordance with SFAS 52, Citigroup records the change in the carrying amount of these investments in the cumulative translation adjustment account within Accumulated other comprehensive income. Simultaneously, the effective portion of the hedge of this exposure is also recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment account, and any ineffective portion of net investment hedges is immediately recorded in earnings. Achieving hedge accounting in compliance with SFAS 133 guidelines is extremely complex. Key aspects of achieving SFAS 133 hedge accounting are documentation of hedging strategy and hedge effectiveness at the hedge inception and substantiating hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis. A derivative must be highly effective in accomplishing the hedge objective of offsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item for the risk being hedged. Any ineffectiveness in the hedge relationship is recognized in current earnings. The assessment of effectiveness excludes changes in the value of the hedged item that are unrelated to the risks being hedged. Similarly, the assessment of effectiveness may exclude changes in the fair value of a derivative related to time value that, if excluded, are recognized in current earnings. 149 Table of Contents The following table summarizes certain information related to the Companys hedging activities for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004: In millions of dollars 2006 2005 2004 Fair value hedges Hedge ineffectiveness recognized in earnings $ 245 $ 38 $ (100 ) Net gain (loss) excluded from assessment of effectiveness 302 (32 ) 509 Cash flow hedges Hedge ineffectiveness recognized in earnings (18 ) (18 ) 10 Net gain excluded from assessment of effectiveness  1 8 Net investment hedges Net gain (loss) included in foreign currency translation adjustment within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (569 ) 492 (1,159 ) For cash flow hedges, any changes in the fair value of the end-user derivatives remaining in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are generally included in earnings of future periods when earnings are also affected by the variability of the hedged cash flows. The net gains associated with cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income within 12 months of December 31, 2006 are $107 million. The change in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from cash flow hedges for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 can be summarized as follows (after-tax): In millions of dollars 2006 2005 2004 Beginning balance $ 612 $ 173 $ 751 Net gain (loss) from cash flow hedges (29 ) 641 (251 ) Net amounts reclassified to earnings (644 ) (202 ) (327 ) Ending balance $ (61 ) $ 612 $ 173 Derivatives may expose Citigroup to market, credit or liquidity risks in excess of the amounts recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Market risk on a derivative product is the exposure created by potential fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and other values, and is a function of the type of product, the volume of transactions, the tenor and terms of the agreement, and the underlying volatility. Credit risk is the exposure to loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the transaction where the value of any collateral held is not adequate to cover such losses. The recognition in earnings of unrealized gains on these transactions is subject to managements assessment as to collectibility. Liquidity risk is the potential exposure that arises when the size of the derivative position may not be able to be rapidly adjusted in periods of high volatility and financial stress at a reasonable cost. 24. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Concentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic, industry or geographic factors similarly affect groups of counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is material in relation to Citigroups total credit exposure. Although Citigroups portfolio of financial instruments is broadly diversified along industry, product, and geographic lines, material transactions are completed with other financial institutions, particularly in the securities trading, derivatives, and foreign exchange businesses. In connection with the Companys efforts to maintain a diversified portfolio, the Company limits its exposure to any one geographic region, country or individual creditor and monitors this exposure on a continuous basis. At December 31, 2006, Citigroups most significant concentration of credit risk was with the U.S. government and its agencies. The Companys exposure, which primarily results from trading assets and investments issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, amounted to $140.2 billion and $78.0 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. After the U.S. government, the Companys next largest exposure is to the Mexican government and its agencies, which are rated investment grade by both Moodys and S&P. The Companys exposure amounted to $20.9 billion and $20.7 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is composed of investment securities, loans, and trading assets. 25. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments The table on the next page presents the carrying value and fair value of Citigroups financial instruments. The disclosure excludes leases, affiliate investments, pension and benefit obligations, and insurance policy claim reserves. In addition, contractholder fund amounts exclude certain insurance contracts. Also as required, the disclosure excludes the effect of taxes, any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings of a particular instrument, excess fair value associated with deposits with no fixed maturity and other expenses that would be incurred in a market transaction. In addition, the table excludes the values of non-financial assets and liabilities, as well as a wide range of franchise, relationship, and intangible values (but includes mortgage servicing rights), which are integral to a full assessment of Citigroups financial position and the value of its net assets. The fair value represents managements best estimates based on a range of methodologies and assumptions. The carrying value of short-term financial instruments, as well as receivables and payables arising in the ordinary course of business, approximates fair value because of the relatively short period of time between their origination and expected realization. Quoted market prices are used for most investments and for both trading and end-user derivatives, as well as for liabilities, such as long-term debt, with quoted prices. For performing loans, contractual cash flows are discounted at quoted secondary market rates or estimated market rates if available. Otherwise, sales of comparable loan portfolios or current market origination rates for loans with similar terms and risk characteristics are used. For loans with doubt as to collectibility, expected cash flows are discounted using an appropriate rate considering the time of collection and the premium for the uncertainty of the flows. The value of collateral is also considered. For liabilities such as long-term debt without quoted market prices, market borrowing rates of interest are used to discount contractual cash flows. 150 Table of Contents 2006 2005 (1) In billions of dollars at year end Carryingvalue Estimatedfair value Carryingvalue Estimatedfair value Assets Investments $ 273.6 $ 273.6 $ 180.6 $ 180.6 Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell 282.8 282.8 217.5 217.5 Trading account assets 393.9 393.9 295.8 295.8 Loans (2) 660.5 673.3 563.8 580.2 Other financial assets (3) 172.8 172.9 145.2 145.2 Liabilities Deposits $ 712.0 $ 711.0 $ 591.8 $ 591.5 Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase 349.2 349.2 242.4 242.4 Trading account liabilities 145.9 145.9 121.1 121.1 Long-term debt (4) 288.5 289.1 217.5 218.9 Other financial liabilities (5) 229.1 229.1 169.0 169.0 (1) Reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation.

(3) Includes cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, brokerage receivables, reinsurance recoverable, mortgage servicing rights and separate and variable accounts for which the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value, and the carrying value and estimated fair value of financial instruments included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. (4) Trust preferred securities were deconsolidated during 2004 in accordance with FIN 46-R with the resulting liabilities to the trust companies included as a component of long-term debt. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the carrying value was $9.8 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively, and the fair value was $9.9 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 139. (5) Includes brokerage payables, separate and variable accounts, and short-term borrowings for which the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value, and the carrying value and estimated fair value of financial instruments included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Fair values vary from period to period based on changes in a wide range of factors, including interest rates, credit quality, and market perceptions of value, and as existing assets and liabilities run off and new transactions are entered into. The estimated fair values of loans reflect changes in credit status since the loans were made, changes in interest rates in the case of fixed-rate loans, and premium values at origination of certain loans. The estimated fair values of Citigroups loans, in the aggregate, exceeded the carrying values (reduced by the allowance for loan losses) by $12.8 billion in 2006 and $16.4 billion in 2005. Within these totals, estimated fair values exceeded carrying values for consumer loans net of the allowance by $9.0 billion, a decrease of $3.5 billion from 2005, and an increase for corporate loans net of the allowance by $3.8 billion, a decrease of $0.1 billion from 2005. 26. PLEDGED ASSETS, COLLATERAL, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES Pledged Assets At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the approximate fair values of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other assets pledged, excluding the impact of FIN 39 and FIN 41, were as follows: In millions of dollars 2006 2005 For securities sold under agreements to repurchase $ 359,273 $ 322,188 As collateral for securities borrowed for approximately equivalent value 39,382 45,671 As collateral on bank loans 10,832 51,841 To clearing organizations or segregated under securities laws and regulations 30,675 31,649 For securities loaned 84,118 49,666 Other 169,922 38,219 Total $ 694,202 $ 539,234 In addition, included in cash and due from banks at December 31, 2006 and 2005 are $8.5 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, of cash segregated under federal and other brokerage regulations or deposited with clearing organizations. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had $2.3 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, of outstanding letters of credit from third-party banks to satisfy various collateral and margin requirements. Collateral At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the approximate market value of collateral received by the Company that may be sold or repledged by the Company, excluding amounts netted in accordance with FIN 39 and FIN 41, was $403.9 billion and $409.1 billion, respectively. This collateral was received in connection with resale agreements, securities borrowings and loans, derivative transactions, and margined broker loans. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, a substantial portion of the collateral received by the Company had been sold or repledged in connection with repurchase agreements; securities sold, not yet purchased; securities borrowings and loans; pledges to clearing organizations; segregation requirements under securities laws and regulations; derivative transactions; and bank loans. In addition, at December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had pledged $222 billion and $295 billion, respectively, of collateral that may not be sold or repledged by the secured parties. Lease Commitments Rental expense (principally for offices and computer equipment) was $1.9 billion, $1.8 billion, and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. 151 Table of Contents Future minimum annual rentals under noncancelable leases, net of sublease income, are as follows: In millions of dollars 2007 $ 1,406 2008 1,278 2009 1,147 2010 976 2011 832 Thereafter 4,552 Total $ 10,191 Loan Commitments In millions of dollars at year end 2006 2005 One- to four-family residential mortgages $ 3,457 $ 3,343 Revolving open-end loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties 32,449 25,089 Commercial real estate, construction and land development 4,007 2,283 Credit card lines (1) 987,409 859,504 Commercial and other consumer loan commitments (2) 439,931 346,444 Total $ 1,467,253 $ 1,236,663 (1) Credit card lines are unconditionally cancelable by the issuer. (2) Includes commercial commitments to make or purchase loans, to purchase third-party receivables, and to provide note issuance or revolving underwriting facilities. Amounts include $251 billion and $179 billion with original maturity of less than one year at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The majority of unused commitments are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards. Commercial commitments generally have floating interest rates and fixed expiration dates and may require payment of fees. Such fees (net of certain direct costs) are deferred and, upon exercise of the commitment, amortized over the life of the loan or, if exercise is deemed remote, amortized over the commitment period. The table does not include unfunded commercial letters of credit issued on behalf of customers and collateralized by the underlying shipment of goods that totaled $7.9 billion and $5.8 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Obligations Under Guarantees The Company provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to Citigroup customers to enhance their credit standing and enable them to complete a wide variety of business transactions. The following table summarizes at December 31, 2006 and 2005 all of the Companys guarantees and indemnifications, where management believes the guarantees and indemnifications are related to an asset, liability, or equity security of the guaranteed parties at the inception of the contract. The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the notional amounts that could be lost under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged. Such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses on these guarantees and indemnifications and greatly exceed anticipated losses. The following tables present information about the Companys guarantees at December 31, 2006 and 2005: Maximum Potential Amount of Future Payments Carryingvalue In billions of dollars at December 31, except carrying value in millions Expire within1 year Expire after1 year Total amountoutstanding 2006 Financial standby letters of credit $ 46.7 $ 25.8 $ 72.5 $ 206.0 Performance guarantees 11.2 4.6 15.8 20.5 Derivative instruments 42.0 916.6 958.6 16,836.0 Guarantees of collection of contractual cash flows (1)     Loans sold with recourse  1.6 1.6 51.9 Securities lending indemnifications (1) 110.7  110.7  Credit card merchant processing (1) 52.3  52.3  Custody indemnifications (1)  54.4 54.4  Total $ 262.9 $ 1,003.0 $ 1,265.9 $ 17,114.4 2005 Financial standby letters of credit $ 30.6 $ 21.8 $ 52.4 $ 175.2 Performance guarantees 10.0 3.9 13.9 18.2 Derivative instruments (2) 40.5 477.7 518.2 14,425.2 Guarantees of collection of contractual cash flows (1)  0.1 0.1  Loans sold with recourse  1.3 1.3 58.4 Securities lending indemnifications (1) 68.4  68.4  Credit card merchant processing (1) 28.1  28.1  Custody indemnifications (1)  27.0 27.0  Total $ 177.6 $ 531.8 $ 709.4 $ 14,677.0 (1) The carrying values of guarantees of collection of contractual cash flows, securities lending indemnifications, credit card merchant processing, and custody indemnifications are not material as the Company has determined that the amount and probability of potential liabilities arising from these guarantees are not significant and the carrying amount of the Companys obligations under these guarantees is immaterial. (2) Reclassified to conform to current periods presentation. 152 Table of Contents Financial standby letters of credit include guarantees of payment of insurance premiums and reinsurance risks that support industrial revenue bond underwriting and settlement of payment obligations to clearing houses, and that support options and purchases of securities or in lieu of escrow deposit accounts. Financial standbys also backstop loans, credit facilities, promissory notes and trade acceptances. Performance guarantees and letters of credit are issued to guarantee a customers tender bid on a construction or systems installation project or to guarantee completion of such projects in accordance with contract terms. They are also issued to support a customers obligation to supply specified products, commodities, or maintenance or warranty services to a third party. Derivative instruments include credit default swaps, total return swaps, written foreign exchange options, written put options, and written equity warrants. Guarantees of collection of contractual cash flows protect investors in credit card receivables securitization trusts from loss of interest relating to insufficient collections on the underlying receivables in the trusts. Loans sold with recourse represent the Companys obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under certain circumstances. Securities lending indemnifications are issued to guarantee that a securities lending customer will be made whole in the event that the security borrower does not return the security subject to the lending agreement and collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of the security. Credit card merchant processing guarantees represent the Companys indirect obligations in connection with the processing of private label and bankcard transactions on behalf of merchants. Custody indemnifications are issued to guarantee that custody clients will be made whole in the event that a third-party subcustodian fails to safeguard clients assets. Beginning with the 2006 third quarter, the scope of the custody indemnifications was broadened to cover all clients assets held by third-party subcustodians. Citigroups primary credit card business is the issuance of credit cards to individuals. In addition, the Company provides transaction processing services to various merchants with respect to bankcard and private label cards. In the 2005 third quarter, the Company entered into a partnership under which a third party processes bankcard transactions. As a result, in the event of a billing dispute with respect to a bankcard transaction between a merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholders favor, the third party holds the primary contingent liability to credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and charge back the transaction to the merchant. If the third party is unable to collect this amount from the merchant, it bears the loss for the amount of the credit or refund paid to the cardholder. The Company continues to have the primary contingent liability with respect to its portfolio of private label merchants. The risk of loss is mitigated as the cash flows between the third party or the Company and the merchant are settled on a net basis and the third party or the Company has the right to offset any payments with cash flows otherwise due to the merchant. To further mitigate this risk, the third party or the Company may require a merchant to make an escrow deposit, delay settlement, or include event triggers to provide the third party or the Company with more financial and operational control in the event of the financial deterioration of the merchant, or require various credit enhancements (including letters of credit and bank guarantees). In the unlikely event that a private label merchant is unable to deliver products, services or a refund to its private label cardholders, Citigroup is contingently liable to credit or refund cardholders. In addition, although a third party holds the primary contingent liability with respect to the processing of bankcard transactions, in the event that the third party does not have sufficient collateral from the merchant or sufficient financial resources of its own to provide the credit or refunds to the cardholders, Citigroup would be liable to credit or refund the cardholders. The Companys maximum potential contingent liability related to both bankcard and private label merchant processing services is estimated to be the total volume of credit card transactions that meet the requirements to be valid chargeback transactions at any given time. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, this maximum potential exposure was estimated to be $52 billion and $28 billion, respectively. However, the Company believes that the maximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure, based on the Companys historical experience and its position as a secondary guarantor (in the case of bankcards). In most cases, this contingent liability is unlikely to arise, as most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants. The Company assesses the probability and amount of its contingent liability related to merchant processing based on the financial strength of the primary guarantor (in the case of bankcards) and the extent and nature of unresolved chargebacks and its historical loss experience. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the estimated losses incurred and the carrying amounts of the Companys contingent obligations related to merchant processing activities were immaterial. In addition, the Company, through its credit card business, provides various cardholder protection programs on several of its card products, including programs that provide insurance coverage for rental cars, coverage for certain losses associated with purchased products, price protection for certain purchases and protection for lost luggage. These guarantees are not included in the table on page 152, since the total outstanding amount of the guarantees and the Companys maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified. The protection is limited to certain types of purchases and certain types of losses and it is not possible to quantify the purchases that would qualify for these benefits at any given time. Actual losses related to these programs were not material during 2006 and 2005. The Company assesses the probability and amount of its potential liability related to these programs based on the extent and nature of its historical loss experience. At December 31, 2006, the estimated losses incurred and the carrying value of the Companys obligations related to these programs were immaterial. In the normal course of business, the Company provides standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with numerous transactions and also provides indemnifications that protect the counterparties to the contracts in the event that additional taxes are owed due either to a change in the tax law or an adverse interpretation of the tax law. Counterparties to these transactions provide the Company with comparable indemnifications. While such representations, warranties and tax indemnifications are essential components of many contractual relationships, they do not represent the underlying business purpose for the transactions. The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms related to the Companys own performance under the terms of a contract and are entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss is remote. Often these clauses are intended to ensure that terms of a contract are met at inception (for example, that loans transferred to a counterparty in a sales transaction did in fact meet the conditions specified in the contract at the transfer date). No compensation is received for these standard representations and warranties, and it is not 153 Table of Contents possible to determine their fair value because they rarely, if ever, result in a payment. In many cases, there are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and the contingencies potentially triggering the obligation to indemnify have not occurred and are not expected to occur. There are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 related to these indemnifications and they are not included in the table on page 152. In addition, the Company is a member of or shareholder in hundreds of value transfer networks (VTNs) (payment, clearing and settlement systems as well as securities exchanges) around the world. As a condition of membership, many of these VTNs require that members stand ready to backstop the net effect on the VTNs of a members default on its obligations. The Companys potential obligations as a shareholder or member of VTN associations are excluded from the scope of FIN 45, since the shareholders and members represent subordinated classes of investors in the VTNs. Accordingly, the Companys participation in VTNs is not reported in the table on page 152 and there are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006 or 2005 for potential obligations that could arise from the Companys involvement with VTN associations. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the carrying amounts of the liabilities related to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the table on page 152 amounted to approximately $17 billion and $15 billion, respectively. The carrying value of derivative instruments is included in either trading liabilities or other liabilities, depending upon whether the derivative was entered into for trading or non-trading purposes. The carrying value of financial and performance guarantees is included in other liabilities. For loans sold with recourse, the carrying value of the liability is included in other liabilities. In addition, at December 31, 2006 and 2005, other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet include an allowance for credit losses of $1.1 billion and $850 million, respectively, relating to letters of credit and unfunded lending commitments. In addition to the collateral available in respect of the credit card merchant processing contingent liability discussed above, the Company has collateral available to reimburse potential losses on its other guarantees. Cash collateral available to the Company to reimburse losses realized under these guarantees and indemnifications amounted to $92 billion and $55 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Securities and other marketable assets held as collateral amounted to $42 billion and $24 billion and letters of credit in favor of the Company held as collateral amounted to $142 million and $681 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Other property may also be available to the Company to cover losses under certain guarantees and indemnifications; however, the value of such property has not been determined. Loans Sold with Credit Enhancements In billions of dollars at year end 2006 2005 Form of credit enhancement Residential mortgages and other loans sold with recourse (1) $ 21.5 $ 9.0 2006: Recourse obligation of $1.7 2005: Recourse obligation of $1.3 GNMA sales/servicingagreements (2) 33.8 29.1 Secondary recourse obligation Securitized credit card receivables $ 99.5 $ 96.2 Includes net revenue over the life of the transaction. Also includes other recourse obligations of $9.1 in 2006 and $7.3 in 2005 (1) Residential mortgages represent 24% of amounts in 2006 and 25% in 2005. (2) Government National Mortgage Association sales/servicing agreements covering securitized residential mortgages. Citigroup and its subsidiaries are obligated under various credit enhancements related to certain sales of loans or sales of participations in pools of loans, as summarized above. Net revenue on securitized credit card receivables is collected over the life of each sale transaction. The net revenue is based upon the sum of finance charges and fees received from cardholders and interchange revenue earned on cardholder transactions, less the sum of the yield paid to investors, credit losses, transaction costs, and a contractual servicing fee, which is also retained by certain Citigroup subsidiaries as servicers. The amount contained in these accounts is included in other assets and was $14 million at December 31, 2006 and $114 million at December 31, 2005. Financial Guarantees Financial guarantees are used in various transactions to enhance the credit standing of Citigroup customers. They represent irrevocable assurances, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, that Citigroup will make payment in the event that the customer fails to fulfill its obligations to third parties. Citigroup issues financial standby letters of credit, which are obligations to pay a third-party beneficiary when a customer fails to repay an outstanding loan or debt instrument, such as assuring payments by a foreign reinsurer to a U.S. insurer, to act as a substitute for an escrow account, to provide a payment mechanism for a customers third-party obligations, and to assure payment of specified financial obligations of a customer. Fees are recognized ratably over the term of the standby letter of credit. The following table summarizes financial standby letters of credit issued by Citigroup. The table does not include securities lending indemnifications issued to customers, which are fully collateralized and totaled $110.7 billion at December 31, 2006 and $68.4 billion at December 31, 2005, and performance standby letters of credit. 2006 2005 In billions of dollars at year end Expire within 1 year Expire after 1 year Total amountoutstanding Total amountoutstanding Insurance, surety $ 3.6 $ 11.5 $ 15.1 $ 11.8 Options, purchased securities, and escrow 0.1  0.1  Clean letters of credit 29.1 4.1 33.2 9.0 Other debt-related 10.5 9.1 19.6 28.4 Total (1) $ 43.3 $ 24.7 $ 68.0 $ 49.2 (1) Total is net of cash collateral of $4.5 billion in 2006 and $3.2 billion in 2005. Collateral other than cash covered 10% of the total in 2006 and 14% in 2005. 154 Table of Contents 27. CONTINGENCIES As described in the Legal Proceedings discussion on page 169, the Company has been a defendant in numerous lawsuits and other legal proceedings arising out of alleged misconduct in connection with: (i) underwritings for, and research coverage of, WorldCom; (ii) underwritings for Enron and other transactions and activities related to Enron; (iii) transactions and activities related to research coverage of companies other than WorldCom; and (iv) transactions and activities related to the IPO Securities Litigation. As of December 31, 2006, the Companys litigation reserve for these matters, net of amounts previously paid or not yet paid but committed to be paid in connection with the Enron class action settlement and other settlements arising out of these matters, was approximately $3.2 billion. The Company believes that this reserve is adequate to meet all of its remaining exposure for these matters. However, in view of the large number of these matters, the uncertainties of the timing and outcome of this type of litigation, the novel issues presented, and the significant amounts involved, it is possible that the ultimate costs of these matters may exceed or be below the reserve. The Company will continue to defend itself vigorously in these cases, and seek to resolve them in the manner management believes is in the best interests of the Company. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Citigroup and its subsidiaries are defendants or co-defendants or parties in various litigation and regulatory matters incidental to and typical of the businesses in which they are engaged. In the opinion of the Companys management, the ultimate resolution of these legal and regulatory proceedings would not be likely to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Company but, if involving monetary liability, may be material to the Companys operating results for any particular period. 28.

See Note 29 on page 156 for a full description of the bank consolidation project 155 Table of Contents 29. CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES These condensed consolidating financial statement schedules are presented for purposes of additional analysis but should be considered in relation to the consolidated financial statements of Citigroup taken as a whole. Bank Consolidation Project During 2006, Citigroup began and completed a majority of its bank consolidation project, which called for the merger of its 12 U.S.-insured depository institutions into four, as well as the reorganization of its U.S. mortgage banking business. The first phase of this project was completed in July 2006, when CitiFinancial Credit Company (CCC), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, transferred its ownership of Citicorp Trust Bank, fsb to Citigroup. The second phase occurred in October 2006, when Citigroup reduced its overall number of U.S.-insured depository institutions from twelve to five. Also during this phase, Citibank, N.A. transferred its investment in Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. (the Companys primary banking entity responsible for U.S. credit card activities) to Citigroup. In addition, a majority of the Companys U.S. consumer mortgage lending activity was consolidated within Citibank, N.A. as Citibank (West), FSB, Citibank Texas, N.A., Citibank, FSB and Citibank Delaware were merged into Citibank, N.A. The final phase of this consolidation project is expected to be completed at a later date with the merger of Citibank (Banamex USA) into Citibank, N.A. Merger of Bank Holding Companies On August 1, 2005, Citigroup merged its two intermediate bank holding companies, Citigroup Holdings Company and Citicorp, into Citigroup Inc. Coinciding with this merger, Citigroup assumed all existing indebtedness and outstanding guarantees of Citicorp. During the 2005 second quarter, Citigroup also consolidated its capital markets funding activities into two legal entities: (i) Citigroup Inc., which issues long-term debt, trust preferred securities, and preferred and common stock, and (ii) Citigroup Funding Inc. (CFI), a first-tier subsidiary of Citigroup, which issues commercial paper, medium-term notes and structured equity-linked and credit-linked notes, all of which is guaranteed by Citigroup. As part of the funding consolidation, Citigroup also guaranteed and continues to guarantee various debt obligations of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI) as well as all of the outstanding debt obligations under CGMHIs publicly-issued securities.

(Citibank) and other banks makes Citigroup a bank holding company under U.S. law. Bank holding companies are generally limited to the business of banking, managing or controlling banks, and other closely related activities. Because Citigroups subsidiary banks are well capitalized and well managed under U.S. banking regulations, and have satisfactory ratings under the U.S. Community Reinvestment Act, Citigroup has qualified as a financial holding company, which permits the Company to engage in a broader range of financial activities in the U.S. and abroad. These activities include underwriting and dealing in securities, insurance underwriting and brokerage, and making investments in non-financial companies for a limited period of time, as long as the Company does not manage the non-financial companys day-to-day activities, and the Companys banking subsidiaries engage only in permitted cross-marketing with the non-financial company. If Citigroup ceases to qualify as a financial holding company, it could be barred from new financial activities or acquisitions, and have to discontinue the broader range of activities permitted to financial holding companies. Regulators As a bank holding company, Citigroup is regulated and supervised by the FRB. Nationally chartered subsidiary banks, such as Citibank, are regulated and supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC); federal savings associations by the Office of Thrift Supervision; and state-chartered depository institutions by state banking departments and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The FDIC has back-up enforcement authority for banking subsidiaries whose deposits it insures. Overseas branches of Citibank are regulated and supervised by the FRB and OCC and overseas subsidiary banks by the FRB. Such overseas branches and subsidiary banks are also regulated and supervised by regulatory authorities in the host countries. Internal Growth and Acquisitions Financial holding companies generally can engage, directly or indirectly in the U.S. and abroad, in financial activities, either de novo or by acquisition, by providing after-the-fact notice to the FRB. However, the Company must obtain the prior approval of the FRB before acquiring more than five percent of any class of voting stock of a U.S. depository institution or bank holding company. Subject to certain restrictions and the prior approval of the appropriate federal banking regulatory agency, the Company can acquire U.S. depository institutions, including out-of-state banks. In addition, intrastate bank mergers are permitted and banks in states that do not prohibit out-of-state mergers may merge. A national or state bank can establish a new branch in another state if permitted by the other state, and a federal savings association can generally open new branches in any state. The FRB must approve certain additional capital contributions to an existing non-U.S. investment and certain acquisitions by the Company of an interest in a non-U.S. company, including in a foreign bank, as well as the establishment by Citibank of foreign branches. Dividends The Companys bank holding companies and banking subsidiaries are limited in their ability to pay dividends. (See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 142.) In addition to specific limitations on the dividends that subsidiary banks can pay to their holding companies, federal regulators could prohibit a dividend that would be an unsafe or unsound banking practice. It is FRB policy that bank holding companies pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organizations expected future needs and financial condition. Moreover, bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine the companys ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. Transactions with Nonbank Subsidiaries A banking subsidiarys transactions with a holding company or nonbank subsidiary generally are limited to 10% of the banking subsidiarys capital stock and surplus, with an aggregate limit of 20% of the banking subsidiarys capital stock and surplus for all such transactions. Such transactions must be on arms-length terms, and certain credit transactions must be fully secured by approved forms of collateral. Liquidation The Companys right to participate in the distribution of assets of a subsidiary upon the subsidiarys liquidation will be subordinate to the claims of the subsidiarys creditors. If the subsidiary is an insured depository institution, the Companys claim as a stockholder or creditor will be subordinated to the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors. In the liquidation of a U.S. insured depository institution, deposits in U.S. offices and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation will have priority over other general unsecured claims, including deposits in offices outside the U.S., non-deposit claims in all offices, and claims of a parent such as the Company. The FDIC, which succeeds to the position of insured depositors, would be a priority creditor. An FDIC-insured financial institution that is affiliated with a failed FDIC-insured institution may have to indemnify the FDIC for losses resulting from the insolvency of the failed institution, even if this causes the indemnifying institution also to become insolvent. Obligations of a subsidiary depository institution to a parent company are subordinate to the subsidiarys indemnity liability and the claims of its depositors. 167 Table of Contents Other Bank and Bank Holding Company Regulation The Company and its banking subsidiaries are subject to other regulatory limitations, including requirements for banks to maintain reserves against deposits; requirements as to risk-based capital and leverage (see Capital Resources and Liquidity on page 86 and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 142); restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged; and limitations on investments that can be made and services that can be offered. The FRB may also expect the Company to commit resources to its subsidiary banks in certain circumstances. However, the FRB may not compel a bank holding company to remove capital from its regulated securities and insurance subsidiaries for this purpose. A U.S. bank is not required to repay a deposit at a branch outside the U.S. if the branch cannot repay the deposit due to an act of war, civil strife, or action taken by the government in the host country. Privacy and Data Security Under U.S. federal law, the Company must disclose its privacy policy to consumers, permit consumers to opt out of having non-public customer information disclosed to third parties, and allow customers to opt out of receiving marketing solicitations based on information about the customer received from another subsidiary. States may adopt more extensive privacy protections. The Company is similarly required to have an information security program to safeguard the confidentiality and security of customer information and to ensure its proper disposal and to notify customers of unauthorized disclosure, consistent with applicable law or regulation. Non-U.S. Regulation A substantial portion of the Companys revenues is derived from its operations outside the U.S., which are subject to the local laws and regulations of the host country. Those requirements affect how the local activities are organized and the manner in which they are conducted. The Companys foreign activities are thus subject to both U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory requirements and supervision, including U.S. laws prohibiting companies from doing business in certain countries. SECURITIES REGULATION Certain of Citigroups subsidiaries are subject to various securities and commodities regulations and capital adequacy requirements of the regulatory and exchange authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate. Subsidiaries registrations include as broker-dealer and as investment adviser with the SEC and as futures commission merchant and commodity pool operator with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Subsidiaries memberships include the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (NYSE) and other principal United States securities exchanges, as well as the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) and the National Futures Association (NFA). Citigroups primary U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (CGMI), is registered as a broker-dealer in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Taiwan and Guam. CGMI is also a primary dealer in U.S. Treasury securities and a member of the principal United States futures exchanges. CGMI is subject to extensive regulation, including minimum capital requirements, which are issued and enforced by, among others, the SEC, the CFTC, the NFA, the NASD, the NYSE, various other self-regulatory organizations of which CGMI is a member and the securities administrators of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam. The SEC and the CFTC also require certain registered broker-dealers (including CGMI) to maintain records concerning certain financial and securities activities of affiliated companies that may be material to the broker-dealer, and to file certain financial and other information regarding such affiliated companies. Citigroups securities operations abroad are conducted through various subsidiaries and affiliates, principally Citigroup Global Markets Limited in London and Nikko Citigroup Limited (a joint venture between CGMHI and Nikko Cordial) in Tokyo. Its securities activities in the United Kingdom, which include investment banking, trading, and brokerage services, are subject to the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000, which regulates organizations that conduct investment businesses in the United Kingdom including capital and liquidity requirements and to the rules of the Financial Services Authority. Nikko Citigroup Limited is a registered foreign securities company in Japan and, as such, its activities in Japan are subject to Japanese law applicable to non-Japanese securities firms and are regulated principally by the Financial Services Agency. These and other subsidiaries of Citigroup are also members of various securities and commodities exchanges and are subject to the rules and regulations of those exchanges. Citigroups other offices abroad are also subject to the jurisdiction of foreign financial services regulatory authorities. CGMI is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which, in the event of the liquidation of a broker-dealer, provides protection for customers securities accounts held by the firm of up to $500,000 for each eligible customer, subject to a limitation of $100,000 for claims for cash balances. To supplement the SIPC coverage, CGMI has purchased for the benefit of its customers additional protection, subject to an aggregate loss limit of $600 million and a per client cash loss limit of up to $1.9 million. Unresolved SEC Staff Comments The Company is in discussion with the SEC regarding the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows classification of loan securitizations. 168 Table of Contents CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS As a registered broker-dealer, CGMI is subject to the SECs Net Capital Rule. CGMI computes net capital under the alternative method of the Net Capital Rule, which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital equal to 2% of aggregate debit items (as defined). A member of the NYSE may be required to reduce its business if its net capital is less than 4% of aggregate debit balances (as defined) and may also be prohibited from expanding its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital would be less than 5% of aggregate debit balances. Furthermore, the Net Capital Rule does not permit withdrawal of equity or subordinated capital if the resulting net capital would be less than 5% of such aggregate debit balances. The Net Capital Rule also limits the ability of broker-dealers to transfer large amounts of capital to parent companies and other affiliates. Under the Net Capital Rule, equity capital cannot be withdrawn from a broker-dealer without the prior approval of that broker-dealers designated examining authority (in the case of CGMI, the NYSE) in certain circumstances, including when net capital after the withdrawal would be less than (i) 120% of the minimum net capital required by the Net Capital Rule, or (ii) 25% of the broker-dealers securities position haircuts. Haircuts is the term used for deductions from capital of certain specified percentages of the market value of securities to reflect the possibility of a market decline prior to disposition. In addition, the Net Capital Rule requires broker-dealers to notify the SEC and the appropriate self-regulatory organization two business days before any withdrawals of excess net capital if the withdrawals (in the aggregate over any 30-day period) would exceed the greater of $500,000 or 30% of the broker-dealers excess net capital, and two business days after any withdrawals (in the aggregate over any 30-day period) that exceeds the greater of $500,000 or 20% of excess net capital. The Net Capital Rule also authorizes the SEC to order a freeze (for up to 20 business days) on the transfer of capital if a broker-dealer plans a withdrawal of more than 30% of its excess net capital (when aggregated with all other withdrawals during the previous 30 days) and the SEC believes that such a withdrawal may be detrimental to the financial integrity of the broker-dealer or may jeopardize the broker-dealers ability to pay its customers. GENERAL BUSINESS FACTORS In the Companys judgment, no material part of the Companys business depends upon a single customer or group of customers, the loss of which would have a materially adverse effect on the Company, and no one customer or group of affiliated customers accounts for as much as 10% of the Companys consolidated revenues. PROPERTIES Citigroups principal executive offices are located at 399 Park Avenue in New York City. Citigroup, and certain of its subsidiaries, is the largest tenant of this building. The Company also has office space in Citigroup Center (153 E. 53rd St. in New York City) under a long-term lease. Citibank leases a building in Long Island City, New York, and has a long-term lease on a building at 111 Wall Street in New York City, which are totally occupied by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. CGMHI owns its principal offices in a building at 388 Greenwich Street in New York City, and also owns the neighboring building at 390 Greenwich Street, both of which are fully occupied by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. Banamex has its principal offices in Mexico City in facilities that are part owned and part leased by it. Banamex has office and branch sites throughout Mexico, most of which it owns. The Company owns other offices and certain warehouse space, none of which is material to the Companys financial condition or operations. The Company believes its properties are adequate and suitable for its business as presently conducted and are adequately maintained. For further information concerning leases, see Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 151. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Enron Corp. Beginning in 2002, Citigroup, CGMI and certain executive officers and current and former employees (along with, in many cases, other investment banks and certain Enron officers and directors, lawyers and/or accountants) were named as defendants in a series of individual and putative class action lawsuits related to Enron. The putative securities class action and all remaining individual actions (other than actions brought as part of Enrons Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding) were consolidated or coordinated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The consolidated securities class action, brought on behalf of a putative class of individuals who purchased Enron securities (NEWBY, et al. v. ENRON CORP., et al.), alleged violations of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Sections 10 and 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Citigroup agreed to settle this action on June 10, 2005. Under the terms of the settlement, approved by the District Court on May 24, 2006, Citigroup will make a pretax payment of $2.01 billion to the settlement class, which consists of all purchasers of publicly traded equity and debt securities issued by Enron and Enron-related entities between September 9, 1997 and December 2, 2001. In light of this settlement, plaintiffs in three individual securities actions, which are part of the NEWBY class, have agreed to dismiss their lawsuits against Citigroup: CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM v. BANC OF AMERICA SECURITIES LLC, et al.; HEADWATERS CAPITAL LLC v. LAY, et al.; and VARIABLE ANNUITY LIFE INS. CO. v. CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORP., et al. Plaintiffs in two other cases, not part of the NEWBY class, have also voluntarily dismissed their claims against Citigroup: STEINER v. ENRON CORP., et al. and TOWN OF NEW HARTFORD v. LAY, et al. 169 Table of Contents A number of other individual actions have been settled and/or dismissed. On October 26, 2006, Citigroup, along with certain other investment bank defendants, agreed to settle an action brought by four Ohio state pension funds that purchased Enron securities, PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF OHIO, et al. v. FASTOW, et al. In December 2006, Citigroup agreed to settle three actions brought by various investment funds and insurance companies that purchased Enron securities: AMERICAN NATIONAL INSURANCE COMPANY, et al. v. CITIGROUP INC., et al.; WESTBORO PROPERTIES, LLC, et al. v. CITIGROUP INC., et al.; and RAVENSWOOD I, L.L.C., et al. v. CITIGROUP INC., et al. On December 15, 2006, the District Court dismissed with prejudice 10 cases brought by clients of a single law firm in connection with the purchase and holding of Enron securities (also dismissing third-party claims against Citigroup): ADAMS, et al. v. ARTHUR ANDERSEN, et al.; AHLICH, et al. v. ARTHUR ANDERSEN, et al.; BULLOCK, et al. v. ARTHUR ANDERSEN, et al.; CHOUCROUN, et al. v. ARTHUR ANDERSEN, et al.; DELGADO, et al. v. ARTHUR ANDERSEN, et al.; GUY, et al. v. ARTHUR ANDERSEN, et al.; JOSE, et al. v. ARTHUR ANDERSEN, et al.; ODAM, et al. v. ENRON CORP., et al.; PEARSON, et al. v. FASTOW, et al.; and ROSEN, et al. v. FASTOW, et al. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in each of the ten cases on January 5, 2007. Additional actions against Citigroup and its affiliates were filed beginning in 2002 in the Southern District of Texas and other various jurisdictions. Certain of these remain pending, including: (i) actions brought by investors in Enron securities; (ii) actions brought by commercial banks that participated in Enron revolving credit facilities and/or purchasers of Enron bank debt in the secondary market; (iii) actions filed by Enron in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings seeking to recover payments to Citigroup as alleged preferences or fraudulent conveyances, to disallow or equitably subordinate claims of Citigroup and Citigroup transferees on the basis of alleged fraud, and to recover damages from Citigroup for allegedly aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty; (iv) actions brought by the Attorney General of Connecticut in connection with an Enron-related transaction; (v) an action brought by certain trusts that issued securities linked to Enrons credit, by the related indenture trustee and certain holders of those securities; (vi) an action brought by a utility, alleging that Citigroup and others aided Enron in fraudulently overcharging for electricity; and (vii) actions by a bank that entered into credit derivative swap transactions with Citibank. Research WorldCom, Inc. Beginning in 2002, Citigroup, CGMI and certain executive officers and current and former employees (along with, in many cases, other investment banks, certain WorldCom officers and directors, and/or accountants) were named as defendants in a series of individual and putative class action lawsuits relating to the underwriting of WorldCom securities and the issuance of research analyst reports concerning WorldCom. The putative class action and the majority of the individual actions were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as In re WORLDCOM, INC. SECURITIES LITIGATION; certain individual actions remained pending in other state and federal courts. Citigroup settled the consolidated putative class action in May 2004. Citigroup has now settled all but four of the WorldCom-related individual actions. One of the four remaining actions, HOLMES, et al. v. GRUBMAN, et al., was dismissed by the District Court; an appeal is pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Telecommunications Research Class Actions. Beginning in 2002, Citigroup, CGMI and certain executive officers and current and former employees were named as defendants in a series of putative class action lawsuits, alleging violations of the federal securities laws, including Sections 10 and 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in connection with Citigroup research analyst reports concerning seven issuers: AT&T Corp. (AT&T), Winstar Communications, Inc. (Winstar), Level 3 Communications, Inc. (Level 3), Metromedia Fiber Network, Inc. (MFN), XO Communications, Inc. (XO), Williams Communications Group Inc. (Williams), and Focal Communications, Inc. (Focal). These putative class actions were assigned to a single judge in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for coordinated proceedings. The court consolidated these actions into seven separate proceedings corresponding to the seven issuers of securities involved. Citigroup has settled five of the seven actions. On August 17, 2006, the court approved Citigroups settlement of the AT&T action, In re SALOMON ANALYST AT&T LITIGATION. On September 29, 2006, the court approved Citigroups settlements of the Level 3, XO and Williams actions, In re SALOMON ANALYST LEVEL 3 LITIGATION, In re SALOMON ANALYST XO LITIGATION, and In re SALOMON ANALYST WILLIAMS LITIGATION, respectively. On November 14, 2006, the court preliminarily approved Citigroups settlement of the Focal action, LOS ANGELES CITY EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT ASSOCIATION v. CITIGROUP. A hearing on the final approval of the Focal settlement is scheduled for March 23, 2007. The Winstar action, In re SALOMON ANALYST WINSTAR LITIGATION, was dismissed with prejudice in its entirety on January 6, 2005. The MFN action, In re SALOMON ANALYST METROMEDIA LITIGATION, remains pending. On January 6, 2005, the District Court granted in part and denied in part Citigroups motion to dismiss the claims against it. On June 20, 2006, the District Court certified the plaintiff class in the MFN action. The District Courts class certification decision is on appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 170 Table of Contents Global Crossing, Ltd. In January 2004, the Global Crossing Estate Representative filed an adversary action in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York against Citigroup and several other banks seeking to rescind the payment of a loan made to a Global Crossing subsidiary. Citigroup moved to dismiss the action in May 2004, and the motion remains pending. Qwest-related Actions. Beginning in 2003, Citigroup and CGMI (along with, in many cases, other investment banks, certain Qwest officers and directors and accountants) were named as defendants in a series of actions alleging violations of state and federal securities laws in connection with the underwriting of, and research analyst reports concerning, Qwest Communications International Inc. (Qwest). Citigroup either settled or obtained dismissal of several such cases. In October 2006, Citigroup settled the two remaining Qwest-related actions: CALIFORNIA STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM v. QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC., et al., and STATE UNIVERSITIES RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF ILLINOIS v. QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC., et al. Customer Class Actions. On May 18, 2006, the District Court gave final approval to the settlement in NORMAN v. SALOMON SMITH BARNEY, a putative class action asserting violations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and various common law claims in connection with certain customers who maintained guided portfolio management accounts at Smith Barney. In March 2004, a putative research-related customer class action alleging various state law claims arising out of the issuance of allegedly misleading research analyst reports, DISHER v. CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC., was filed in Illinois state court. Citigroup removed this action to federal court, and in August 2005 the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the District Courts August 2004 order remanding the case to state court, and directed the District Court to dismiss plaintiffs claims as pre-empted. On June 26, 2006, the United States Supreme Court granted plaintiffs petition for a writ of certiorari, vacated the Seventh Circuits opinion and remanded the case to the Seventh Circuit for further proceedings. On January 22, 2007, the Seventh Circuit dismissed Citigroups appeal from the District Courts removal order for lack of appellate jurisdiction. On February 1, 2007, plaintiffs secured an order reopening this case in Illinois state court, and on February 16, Citigroup removed the reopened action to federal court. Arbitrations. In addition to the various lawsuits discussed above, similar claims against Citigroup and certain of its affiliates relating to research analyst reports concerning the securities mentioned above, and other securities, are pending in numerous arbitrations around the country. Parmalat Beginning in 2004, Citigroup and Citibank, N.A. (along with, in many cases, other investment banks and certain Parmalat officers and/or accountants) were named as defendants in a series of class action complaints filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York relating to the collapse of Parmalat Finanziaria S.P.A. (Parmalat) and consolidated under the caption In re PARMALAT SECURITIES LITIGATION. The consolidated amended complaint, filed on October 18, 2004, alleges violations of Sections 10 and 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of Parmalat securities between January 5, 1999 and December 18, 2003. On January 10, 2005, the Citigroup defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action, which the District Court granted in part and denied in part on July 13, 2005. Plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated complaint on August 25, 2005. On September 21, 2006, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, which is currently pending. On October 10, 2006, defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings dismissing the claims of all foreign purchasers for lack of subject matter jurisdiction; that motion is also still pending. On July 29, 2004, Enrico Bondi, as extraordinary commissioner of Parmalat and other affiliated entities (Bondi), filed a lawsuit in New Jersey Superior Court against Citigroup, Citibank, N.A. and certain allegedly controlled Citigroup entities, alleging that the Citigroup defendants participated in fraud committed by the officers and directors of Parmalat and seeking unspecified damages. The action alleges a variety of claims under New Jersey state law, including fraud, negligent misrepresentation, violations of the New Jersey Fraudulent Transfer Act and violations of the New Jersey RICO statute. The Citigroup defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action, which was granted in part and denied in part. The Citigroup defendants answered the complaint and filed counterclaims alleging causes of action for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, conversion and breach of warranty. Bondis motion to dismiss the counterclaims was denied. On July 14, 2006, the New Jersey Appellate Division affirmed the denial of Citigroups motion to dismiss the complaint. On September 19, 2006, the New Jersey Supreme Court denied Citigroups motion for leave to appeal from the Appellate Divisions decision. On December 18, 2006, Citigroup made a renewed motion to dismiss for forum non conveniens, which was denied on January 22, 2007. Citigroup (along with, among others, numerous other investment banks, certain former Parmalat officers and accountants) also is involved in various Parmalat-related proceedings in Italy. In one such action, the Milan prosecutor has initiated proceedings seeking the indictment of numerous individuals, including a Citigroup employee, for offenses under Italian law that arise out of the collapse of Parmalat. In connection with this proceeding, the Milan prosecutor may also seek administrative remedies. In addition, a number of private parties, including former investors in Parmalat securities, have applied to join the Milan proceedings as civil claimants and are seeking unspecified civil damages against numerous parties, including Citigroup. In Parma, a public prosecutor is conducting a criminal investigation into alleged bankruptcy offenses relating to the collapse of Parmalat. That investigation is ongoing. 171 Table of Contents Adelphia Communications Corporation On July 6, 2003, an adversary proceeding was filed by the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors on behalf of Adelphia Communications Corporation against certain lenders and investment banks, including CGMI, Citibank, N.A., Citicorp USA, Inc., and Citigroup Financial Products, Inc. (together, the Citigroup Parties). The complaint alleges that the Citigroup Parties and numerous other defendants committed acts in violation of the Bank Holding Company Act and common law. The complaints seek equitable relief and an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages. In November 2003, a similar adversary proceeding was filed by the Equity Holders Committee of Adelphia. In June 2004, motions to dismiss were filed with respect to the complaints of the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors and the Equity Holders Committee. The motions are currently pending. In addition, CGMI is among the underwriters named in numerous civil actions brought to date by investors in Adelphia debt securities in connection with Adelphia securities offerings between September 1997 and October 2001. Three of the complaints also assert claims against Citigroup Inc. and Citibank, N.A. All of the complaints allege violations of federal securities laws, and certain of the complaints also allege violations of state securities laws and the common law. The complaint seeks unspecified damages. In December 2003, a second amended complaint was filed and consolidated before the same judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In February 2004, motions to dismiss the class and individual actions pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York were filed. In May and July of 2005, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted motions to dismiss several claims, based on the running of applicable statute of limitations, asserted in the putative class and individual actions being coordinated under IN RE ADELPHIA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVE LITIGATION. With the exception of one individual action that was dismissed with prejudice, the court granted the putative class and individual plaintiffs leave to re-plead certain of those claims the court found to be time-barred. Without admitting any liability, CGMI and numerous other financial institution defendants settled IN RE ADELPHIA COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVE LITIGATION for a total of $250 million, and the settlement was approved in November 2006. Two of the additional remaining individual complaints have been settled. Allied Irish Bank On January 31, 2006, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York partially denied motions filed by Citibank and a co-defendant to dismiss a complaint filed by Allied Irish Bank, P.L.C. (AIB) in May 2003, seeking compensatory and punitive damages in connection with losses sustained by a subsidiary of AIB in 20002002. The complaint alleges that defendants are liable for fraudulent and fictitious foreign currency trades entered by one of AIBs traders through defendants, who provided prime brokerage services. The courts ruling on the motions to dismiss allowed plaintiffs common law claims, including fraudulent concealment and aiding and abetting fraud, to proceed. Mutual Funds Citigroup and certain of its affiliates have been named in several class action litigations pending in various federal District Courts arising out of alleged violations of the federal securities laws, including the Investment Company Act, and common law (including breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment). The claims concern practices in connection with the sale of mutual funds, including allegations involving market timing, revenue sharing, incentive payments for the sale of proprietary funds, undisclosed breakpoint discounts for the sale of certain classes of funds, inappropriate share class recommendations and inappropriate fund investments. The litigations involving market timing have been consolidated under the Multi District rules in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland (the MDL action), and the litigations involving revenue sharing, incentive payment and other issues are pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs in these litigations generally seek unspecified compensatory damages, recessionary damages, injunctive relief, costs and fees. In the principal cases concerning revenue sharing, incentive payment and other issues, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated and amended complaint on December 15, 2004. Citigroup defendants motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint was substantially granted; a motion to dismiss the remaining claim has been filed. Several derivative actions and class actions were also dismissed against Citigroup defendants in the MDL action (the class actions were dismissed with leave to replead state law claims of unjust enrichment). Issues in the mutual-fund industry continue to receive scrutiny by various government regulators and SROs. CGMI reached an agreement in principle with the NYSE to settle a matter related to its market-timing practices prior to September 2003. IPO Securities Litigation In April 2002, consolidated amended complaints were filed against CGMI and other investment banks named in numerous putative class actions filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging violations of certain federal securities laws (including Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) with respect to the allocation of shares for certain initial public offerings and related aftermarket transactions and damage to investors caused by allegedly biased research analyst reports. Defendants motion to dismiss was denied. On October 13, 2004, the court granted in part the motion to certify class actions for six focus cases in the securities litigation. CGMI is not a defendant in any of the six focus cases. In December 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Court and held that the matter could not proceed as a class action. The plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing in January 2007. 172 Table of Contents IPO Antitrust Litigation Beginning in March 2001, several putative class actions that were later consolidated into a single class action were filed in the Southern District of New York against CGMI and other investment banks, alleging violations of certain federal and state antitrust laws in connection with the allocation of shares in initial public offerings when acting as underwriters. A separate putative class action was filed against the same underwriter defendants as well as certain institutional investors alleging commercial bribery claims under the Robinson Patman Act arising out of similar allegations regarding IPO allocation conduct. On November 3, 2003, the District Court granted CGMIs motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint in the antitrust case and the Robinson Patman complaint. Plaintiffs thereafter appealed the District Courts order dismissing the two actions. On September 28, 2005, the Second Circuit vacated the District Courts decision and ordered the cases remanded to the District Court. In December 2006, the United States Supreme Court granted the underwriter defendants petition for certiorari to review the Second Circuits decision and set oral argument for March 2007. Wage & Hour Employment Actions Numerous financial services firms, including Citigroup and its affiliates, have been named in putative class actions alleging that certain present and former employees in California were entitled to overtime pay under state and federal laws; were subject to certain allegedly unlawful deductions under state law; or were entitled to reimbursement for employment-related expenses incurred by them. The first of these class actions filed in the Fall of 2004 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, BAHRAMIPOUR v. CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC., seeks damages and injunctive relief on behalf of a putative class of California employees. Similar complaints have been subsequently filed against CGMI on behalf of certain statewide or nationwide putative class in (i) the United States District Courts for the Southern District of New York, the District of New Jersey, the Eastern District of New York, the District of Massachusetts, and the Middle District of Pennsylvania; and (ii) the New Jersey Superior Court. Without admitting any liability, CGMI has reached an agreement in principle, which is subject to court approval, to a nationwide settlement for up to approximately $98 million of various class actions asserting violations of state and federal laws relating to overtime and violations of various state laws relating to alleged unlawful payroll deductions. Other The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting a non-public investigation into the Companys treatment of certain potential Argentina- related losses in the 2001 fourth quarter and the treatment of certain specific tax reserves and releases during the period 2000 to 2004 related to the Associates businesses acquired in the 2000 fourth quarter. In connection with these matters, the SEC has subpoenaed witness testimony and certain accounting and internal controls-related information for the years 1997 to 2004. The Company is cooperating with the SEC in its investigation. The Company cannot predict the outcome of the investigation. Beginning in June 2005, certain participants in the Citigroup Pension Plan (the Plan) filed putative class action complaints against the Plan and other Citigroup defendants, alleging that certain aspects of the Plan violate provisions of ERISA. The claims were later consolidated as IN RE: CITIGROUP PENSION PLAN ERISA LITIGATION in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In December 2006, the District Court denied defendants summary judgment motion; granted summary judgment to plaintiffs on their backloading, age discrimination and notice claims; and ordered the Plan reformed to comply with ERISA. The District Court also granted plaintiffs motion for class certification. On January 23, 2007, defendants moved the District Court for entry of a partial, appealable final judgment with respect to the backloading and age discrimination rulings, permission to file an interlocutory appeal from the summary judgment order, and for a stay pending proceedings in the Second Circuit. In 2002, a shareholder derivative action CARROLL v. WEILL, et al., was filed in New York state court alleging claims against Citigroup directors in connection with Citigroups activities with Enron and other matters. The court dismissed the complaint in October 2002, the Appellate Division affirmed the dismissal in December 2003, and in May 2004, the New York Court of Appeals denied plaintiffs motion for leave to appeal that affirmance. Since that date, Citigroup has received a shareholder demand containing allegations similar to those set forth in the CARROLL action, and a supplemental letter containing various additional allegations relating to other activities of Citigroup.

Does not include an aggregate of 6.01 million shares subject to outstanding options granted by predecessor companies under plans assumed by Citigroup in connection with mergers and acquisitions. Citigroup has not made any awards under these plans, and they are not considered as a source of shares for future awards. The weighted-average exercise price of such options is $43.94 per share. Some of the assumed options also entitled the holders to receive Litigation Tracking Warrants (LTWs) upon exercise, in addition to the shares underlying the options. The LTWs were issued in 1998 to holders of the outstanding common stock of Golden State Bancorp Inc. (GSB), and assumed by Citigroup upon the acquisition of GSB in 2002. In 2005, following resolution of certain litigation against the U.S. government by Glendale Federal Bank, FSB, the LTWs became exercisable for a 60-day period entitling the holders to receive upon exercise 0.02302 share of Citigroup common stock and $0.6725 net cash payment after deducting the $0.0002 exercise price per LTW. Holders of unexercised GSB options who would have received LTWs had their options been exercised before the start of the LTW exercise period are entitled to receive the LTW consideration whenever the underlying GSB options are exercised. This could result in the issuance of less than 1,000 additional shares of Citigroup common stock if all the LTW options that remain outstanding are exercised in full. (2) As described in footnote 1 above, does not include 6.01 million shares subject to outstanding options under certain plans assumed by Citigroup in connection with mergers and acquisitions, and 59.22 million shares subject to deferred stock awards. (3) Does not include shares that were available for issuance under plans approved by shareholders of acquired companies but under which Citigroup does not make any awards. Of the number of shares available for future issuance, 249.50 million of such shares are available under plans that provide for awards of restricted stock, in addition to (or in lieu of) options, warrants and rights. (4) Includes 2.14 million shares issuable upon the vesting of deferred stock awards. Does not include 287,018 shares subject to outstanding options under a plan assumed by Citigroup in a merger. Citigroup has not made any awards under this plan, and it is not considered as a source of shares for future awards by Citigroup. The weighted-average exercise price of such options is $46.33 per share. (5) As described in footnote 4 above, does not include 287,018 shares subject to outstanding options under a plan assumed by Citigroup in a merger, and 2.14 million shares subject to deferred stock awards. (6) Does not include plans of acquired companies under which Citigroup does not make any awards. Also does not include up to 4.59 million shares available for purchase pursuant to the Travelers Group Stock Purchase Plan for PFS Representatives. This plan allows eligible Primerica Financial Services (PFS) representatives to use their earned commissions to periodically purchase shares of Citigroup common stock at current market prices. A limited number of high performers may purchase shares, subject to plan limits, at discounts of up to 25%. The discount is funded by Primerica Financial Services and is considered additional compensation. Shares are purchased on the open market; no newly issued or treasury shares are used in this program. Most of Citigroups outstanding equity awards were granted under three stockholder approved plansthe Citigroup 1999 Stock Incentive Plan (the 1999 Plan); the Travelers Group Capital Accumulation Plan; and the 1997 Citicorp Stock Incentive Plan. There were no offerings under the Citigroup 2000 Stock Purchase Plan since the final purchase date under the last offering under this plan in 2005. A small percentage of equity awards have been granted under several plans that have not been approved by stockholders, primarily the Citigroup Employee Incentive Plan. Generally, awards are made to employees participating in Citigroups stock option, stock award or stock purchase programs. All of the plans are administered by the Personnel and Compensation Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors (the Committee), which is comprised entirely of non-employee independent directors. Persons eligible to participate in Citigroups equity plans are selected by management from time to time subject to the Committees approval. Effective April 19, 2005, stockholders approved amendments to the 1999 Plan, and the other plans mentioned above (with the exception of the 2000 Stock Purchase Plan) were terminated as a source of shares for future awards. The following disclosure is provided with respect to plans that have not been submitted to stockholders for approval, and which remain active only with respect to previously granted awards. Additional information regarding Citigroups equity compensation programs can be found in Note 8 to the Company Consolidated Financial Statements on page 122. Non-Stockholder Approved Plans The Citigroup Employee Incentive Plan, originally adopted by the Board of Directors in 1991, was amended by the Board of Directors on April 17, 2001. This plan was used to grant stock options and restricted or deferred stock awards to participants in the Citigroup Capital Accumulation Program (CAP) and to new hires. Executive officers and directors of the Company were not eligible to participate in this plan. CAP is an incentive and retention award program pursuant to which a specified portion of a participants incentive compensation (or commissions) is delivered in the form of a restricted or deferred stock award, or in some cases, restricted or deferred stock and stock options. Vesting periods for restricted and deferred stock awards under this plan, including awards pursuant to CAP, were generally from three to five years. Stock options awarded under this plan, including CAP options, are non-qualified stock options. Options granted prior to January 1, 2003 have 10-year terms and vest at a rate of 20% per year, with the first vesting date generally occurring 12 to 18 months following the grant date. Options granted on or after January 1, 2003, but prior to January 1, 2005, generally have six-year terms and vest at a rate of one-third per year, with the first vesting date generally occurring 12 to 18 months following the grant date. Options granted under this plan in 2005 generally have six-year terms and vest at a rate of 25% per year. Generally, the terms of restricted and deferred stock awards and options granted under the Citigroup Employee Incentive Plan provide that the awards will be canceled if an employee leaves the Company, except in cases of disability or death, or after satisfying certain age and years of service requirements. Additionally, since December 2001, deferred stock awards that used to be made under certain deferred compensation plans administered by Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. were made under the Citigroup Employee Incentive Plan. These plans provide for deferred stock awards to employees who meet certain specified performance targets. Generally, the awards vest in five years. Awards are canceled if an employee voluntarily leaves the Company prior to vesting. Effective April 19, 2005, all equity awards provided for by these deferred compensation plans are being granted under the 1999 Plan. Deferred stock awards granted under the Salomon Smith Barney Inc. Branch Managers Asset Deferred Bonus Plan, the Salomon Smith Barney Inc. Asset Gathering Bonus Plan, the Salomon Smith Barney Inc. Directors Council Milestone Bonus Plan and the Salomon Smith Barney Inc. Stock Bonus Plan for FC Associates prior to December 2001 remain outstanding. 175 Table of Contents The Travelers Group Capital Accumulation Plan for PFS Representatives (PFS CAP) and similar plans were adopted by Citigroup at various times. These plans provided for CAP awards and other restricted stock awards to agents of certain subsidiaries or affiliates of Citigroup. Awards are no longer being granted from these plans, and of awards previously granted from these plans, only awards from PFS CAP remain outstanding. Beginning in July 2002, awards that used to be granted pursuant to PFS CAP were made under the Employee Incentive Plan; these awards are now being made under the 1999 Plan. In connection with the acquisition of Associates in 2001, Citigroup assumed options granted to former Associates directors pursuant to the Associates First Capital Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors. Upon the acquisition, the options vested and were converted to options to purchase Citigroup common stock, and the plan was terminated. All options that remain outstanding under the plan will expire by no later than January 2010. The Citigroup 2000 International Stock Purchase Plan was adopted in 2000 to allow employees outside the United States to participate in Citigroups stock purchase programs. The terms of the international plan are identical to the terms of the stockholder-approved Citigroup 2000 Stock Purchase Plan, except that it is not intended to be qualified under Section 423 of the United States Internal Revenue Code. The number of shares available for issuance under both plans may not exceed the number authorized for issuance under the stockholder-approved plan.
