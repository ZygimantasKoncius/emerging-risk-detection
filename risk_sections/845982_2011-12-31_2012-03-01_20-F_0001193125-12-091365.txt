Sir John Buchanan Chairman 22 February 2012 63 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Corporate Governance Directors Remuneration Report Joseph Papa Chairman of Remuneration Committee  We are building a remuneration framework to reinforce a new strategy and to drive performance for the benefit of our shareholders 64 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Corporate Governance Directors Remuneration Report Dear shareholder, I am pleased to present the report on the activities of the Smith & Nephew Remuneration Committee throughout 2011. This was a year of many changes for Smith & Nephew. I took over from Rolf Stomberg as Chairman of the Committee at the Annual General Meeting, the same day as Olivier Bohuon assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer. Elsewhere in this annual report, you will have read about the new strategy which Olivier is implementing across the Group. I shall now explain how the Remuneration Committee are building the remuneration framework for the Executive Directors and other senior executives that will reinforce that new strategy and drive performance for the benefit of you, our shareholders. Our review has been driven by the following principles:  Restraint  the total reward at target under the 2012 framework is broadly the same as under the 2011 framework.  Transparency  the new framework is simpler and clearer to understand by all stakeholders.  Alignment with strategy  the measures and targets in all our plans are linked back to our business goals. The membership and the principal duties of the Committee are set out in the table on page 58 of this Annual Report. The formal Directors Remuneration Report that follows explains the technical details of our remuneration arrangements in 2011 and also looks forward to explain our remuneration strategy for 2012 and beyond. Firstly however, I should like to explain some of the main activities of the Committee in 2011 and the reasoning behind the new remuneration structure we are proposing. New remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors and Senior Executives The main work of the Remuneration Committee this year has been the development of a remuneration strategy for our Executive Directors and Senior Executives which supports and reinforces the new strategy Olivier is pursuing. We want to put in place a remuneration framework that will focus our key executives to drive the new strategy over the short, medium and long-term which in turn will drive performance for our shareholders. Following a review of our existing arrangements, which included feedback from our senior executives, it was felt that the plans previously in place were too complex and really did not work as effective incentives for the performance and behaviours we wished to drive. As a result, we are proposing a revised framework, which seeks to simplify remuneration at Smith & Nephew, provide a clear link to the business goals and strengthen the line of sight between reward and performance. The changes we are proposing have consciously been designed to be broadly neutral in value: for target performance the quantum available to our Executive Directors and Executive Officers will not change. However, we have rebalanced the package across the short, medium and long-term varying by level, to improve the link with our business strategy. We have moved away from two long-term incentive arrangements to a simple performance share plan linked to the delivery of Total Shareholder Return relative to our peers and growth in free cash flow. We have also amended the short-term incentive arrangements. The cash element will be linked to the achievement of business and strategic performance measures with an equity incentive linked to individual and business performance over the medium-term. We have introduced measures to enable us to clawback payments and awards already made should a serious financial mis-statement come to light or a participant is found to have engaged in misconduct. We have also strengthened the rules around share ownership for our executives. In December, I visited a number of our largest shareholders and UK Institutional bodies to discuss our new proposals. They were all broadly supportive of our moves towards increased transparency, simplification and alignment with our changing corporate strategy and most importantly shareholder interests. The suggestions made by these shareholders have been most useful in developing our final proposals. Retirement arrangements for David Illingworth Consideration was given to the retirement arrangements for David Illingworth who stepped down from the Board in April. We followed the provisions in his service contract and saw no need to make discretionary adjustments. David was employed for seven months of the year and will receive a bonus in respect of this employment period. Since his retirement David has continued to provide consultancy advice to Olivier and has received a consultancy fee in respect of this. Details of Davids retirement and consultancy arrangements can be found in the report that follows. UK and International ShareSave Plans We have operated an all-employee ShareSave Plan in the UK for 30 years. In 2002 we introduced an International ShareSave Plan which now operates in 27 countries. The UK and International ShareSave Plans approved in 2002 have now expired and need to be renewed at the Annual General Meeting. These plans are very popular amongst our employees who are able to save on a regular basis and then buy shares in the Company. We have around 2,500 employees participating in the current plans around the world and are currently exploring ways of extending these arrangements to China and other emerging markets to enable us to attract and retain talent in these key areas. 65 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Corporate Governance Directors Remuneration Report continued Compliance statement We have prepared this Directors Remuneration Report (the Report) in accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (the Regulations). It also meets the relevant requirements of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) Listing Rules. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the Report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting on 12 April 2012. As set out on page 58 of this Annual Report, my fellow members of the Remuneration Committee are Pamela Kirby, Brian Larcombe, Richard De Schutter and Rolf Stomberg who will be retiring from the Board on 12 April 2012. We would like to thank Rolf for all the work he did as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee for 10 years. Details concerning the number of meetings held and the scope and role of our duties may be found on this page. From time to time, we are advised by Olivier Bohuon, Chief Executive Officer, Susan Henderson, Company Secretary, Helen Maye, Head of Group Human Resources and Elizabeth Sohn, SVP Compensation and Benefits, who attend some or all of our meetings, except for when their personal remuneration is being discussed. Independent advice During the year, we conducted a review of our remuneration consultants. We felt that with a new Chief Executive Officer, a new Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and a new Head of Group Human Resources, it would also be appropriate to appoint a new Remuneration Consultant. Given our global business, we wanted a firm with an international presence and in particular one with an internal data service. After considering a number of firms, the Remuneration Committee appointed Towers Watson in September 2011. They have assisted us in developing the new remuneration packages in line with our new strategy. Throughout 2011, we were also advised by Deloitte LLP relating to long-term comparative performance and Towers Watson, Aon Hewitt, Mercer Limited relating to salary data. Towers Watson also provided other human resources and compensation advice to the Company for levels below Board level and Deloitte also provided taxation advice to the Group. All of these consultants have complied with the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants and we are satisfied that their advice is objective and independent. Remuneration policy Our policy is designed to attract talent that will drive the strategy over the short, medium and long-term, which in turn will lead to performance for our shareholders. This report describes the remuneration arrangements which were in force during 2011, but it also looks forward to describe the remuneration arrangements we are applying in 2012 and beyond. We therefore thought that it would be helpful to provide a summary of these arrangements before focusing on the detail later in the report. 66 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Corporate Governance 2011 2012 Objective Link to Business Strategy Base Salary and Benefits Base salary benchmarked to median for relevant geographic market.

We review salaries on an annual basis with effect from 1 April each year. With effect from 1 April 2011, we approved the following base salaries for the Executive Directors: Olivier Bohuon 1,050,000 Adrian Hennah £ 580,000 In February 2012, we reviewed the base salaries of the Executive Directors having regard to average salary increases across the Group which will be around 3%. We considered increasing the salaries paid to the Executive Directors by a similar amount given their outstanding performance and contribution. The Executive Directors have however requested that at a time when we are driving cost efficiencies across the Group and a number of positions are being eliminated, no increase be made to Olivier Bohuons salary and that Adrian Hennahs salary be increased by 1%. Their base salaries with effect from 1 April 2012 will therefore be: Olivier Bohuon 1,050,000 Adrian Hennah £585,800 We also provide benefits in line with local market practice in the countries in which we operate. Typically, these benefits include private healthcare, company car or allowance and where appropriate relocation expenses. Pensions We provide pension arrangements for employees across the Group. The nature of the arrangements differ depending on their location and in some cases their length of service depending on the arrangements in place when they first joined the Company. Olivier Bohuon and Adrian Hennah both receive a salary supplement of 30% of basic salary to apply towards their retirement savings in lieu of membership of a company run pension scheme. Base salary is the only element of remuneration that is pensionable. They also receive death in service cover of seven times basic salary, of which four times salary is payable as a lump sum. Executive Officers who joined the company in 2003 or later are also entitled to receive a salary supplement or to join one of the Companys Defined Contribution Pension Plans depending on local practice. Different arrangements are in place for employees and Executive Officers who joined the Company prior to 2003 as follows: In the UK, such Executive Officers participate in the Smith & Nephew UK Pension Fund or the UK Executive Pension Scheme, under which pensions have been accrued in the year at an annual rate of one-thirtieth of final pensionable salary up to a limit based on service of two-thirds of final pensionable salary, subject to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) constraints. The normal retirement age is 62. Pensions in payment are guaranteed to increase by 5% per annum or the rate of inflation in the UK, if lower. Death in service cover of four times salary and a spouses pension at the rate of two thirds of the members pension are provided on death. A salary supplement partially compensates for the HMRC earnings cap on final pensionable salary which continues to apply in the defined benefit plans. In the US such Executive Officers participate in either the defined benefit Smith & Nephew US Pension Plan or the defined contribution US Savings plan 401 (K) Plus. Under the US Pension Plan, pensions accrue at an annual rate of approximately one sixty-sixth of final pensionable salary up to a limit based on service of 53% of final pensionable salary. The plan also provides for a spouses pension at the rate of one half of the members pension on death. Normal retirement age under the plan is 65. For executives in the defined benefit and defined contribution plans, a supplementary plan is used to provide additional retirement benefits and to compensate for the earnings cap imposed by the US Internal Revenue Code. Short-term incentive arrangements As I explained in my introductory letter, we reviewed all our remuneration arrangements in 2011. This review has resulted in a change to our short-term incentive arrangements. As you will have seen elsewhere in this Annual Report, our strategy has a number of near term goals, particularly in improving efficiencies and reducing costs in our established markets. We need to achieve these short-term goals before we can achieve our longer term objectives of investing in emerging markets and innovating for value. We therefore need a remuneration framework which incentivises our executives to drive short-term performance which will enable the Group to achieve the long term performance we want for our shareholders. A proportion of Annual Incentive earned by Executive Directors and Executive Officers prior to 2011 was deferred into share awards. For 2012, we are moving away from a single Annual Incentive Plan, with a deferred element to two distinct elements comprising an Annual Cash Incentive and an Equity Incentive Award. The bonuses earned in 2011 have therefore been paid entirely in cash and a new short-term Equity Incentive Award will be made later in March 2012. The arrangements which applied in 2011 and those which will apply from 2012 onwards are both described below. Annual Incentive Plan in 2011 During 2011, we operated an Annual Incentive Plan across the Group. Executive Directors and Executive Officers participated in the same Annual Incentive Plan although the opportunities varied, reflecting their differing roles and levels of responsibility: Performance attarget Performance atmaximum Executive Directors 100% 150% Executive Officers 70% 140% The performance measures for the Annual Incentive Plan were linked to the four strategic pillars for success which drove our Strategy in 2011, namely Customer Led Efficient, Investing for Growth and Aligned. All employees across the Group were set performance objectives that linked back to these strategic pillars. The incentive bonus in 2011 for Executive Directors was subject to performance measures relating to revenue (30% of incentive), trading profit/margin (30%) and trading cash flow (15%). The remaining 25% of the incentive payable was dependent on personal objectives. Over the period, underlying revenue growth was 4%, underlying trading profit fell by 4%, trading margin fell by 200 bps and trading profit to cash conversion was 87%. Collectively these financial performance measures were just below target. The remaining part of the incentive bonus reflects the Executive Directors performance against their personal objectives. The Remuneration Committee reviewed the performance of Olivier Bohuon and Adrian Hennah against their agreed individual objectives for 2011 and determined that Olivier Bohuon had consistently exceeded his objectives for the year (in building a strong team and launching the new strategy) and that Adrian Hennah had consistently met his objectives for the year. 68 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Corporate Governance The overall cash incentive bonuses were as follows: Total CashBonus Olivier Bohuon(i)  807,709 Adrian Hennah £548,680 David Illingworth(i) $497,199 (i) Prorated to reflect active service with the Company. (Olivier Bohuon appointed CEO in April 2011; David Illingworth retired in August 2011). Annual Cash Incentive in 2012 From 2012 onwards, the Annual Incentive for Executive Directors and Executive Officers is divided into two parts: a) an Annual Cash Incentive and b) an Equity Incentive Award, which is a conditional award over ordinary shares, vesting in equal annual tranches over three years, provided that individual performance is sustained. The payment of the Annual Cash Incentive and the award and subsequent vesting of the Equity Incentive Award are dependent upon the same performance measures. The Annual Cash Incentive is designed to reward employees for the annual achievement of Company financial and non-financial business goals. The level of Equity Incentive Award is governed by these same annual goals and vests only if an acceptable level of performance against these same goals is sustained in each of the following three years. The performance measures for Executive Directors are based on a mix of financial goals and non-financial goals as follows: Financial Revenue (30%) Goals Trading Profit (30%) 70% Trading Cash (10%) Non-Financial Olivier Bohuon Adrian Hennah Goals R&D investment R&D investment Development of Shared Services product portfolio Succession Succession 30% Planning Planning Employee engagement Employee engagement Compliance Compliance The performance measures for Executive Officers and for all other employees in the Group are cascaded down from these goals, so that all employees are aligned with the same business goals. For each of the above measures, we have determined the precise measurements for the achievement at threshold, target and maximum, which are directly linked with the Financial Plan for 2012. As such, these measurements are commercially sensitive. In next years Report, we will disclose levels of performance against the measures. The maximum Cash Incentive payable depends upon level within the Company. Maximum and target awards for Executive Directors and Executive Officers are as follows: Performance attarget Performance atmaximum Executive Directors 100% 150% Executive Officers 55% 110% Equity Incentive Award in 2012 Grant Conditions We measure achievement against the goals in two different ways. Firstly we look at what the employee has achieved in the year and secondly we look at how they have performed in the year. It is important to us that as well as achieving their financial targets, our employees are displaying the right behaviours and values, that they are customer focused, operating compliantly and ethically and are treating their fellow employees fairly. Executive Directors and Executive Officers will receive an Annual Equity Incentive Award provided that they consistently meet the goals described above on both the how and what bases. If they fail to meet either of these ratings, they will receive no award and if they exceed their objectives on both measures, they will receive a higher award. The level of awards for Executive Directors and Executive Officers is as follows: Consistently meets how and what objectives Consistently exceeds how and what objectives Executive Directors 50% base salary 65% base salary Executive Officers 50% of base salary 65% of base salary Vesting Conditions The Equity Award will be a conditional award over ordinary shares. This award will vest in equal annual tranches over three years subject to continued achievement of objectives. Each tranche will only vest if the Executive Director or Executive Officer has consistently met their objectives on both the how and the what basis in each year since the grant of the award. In the event that objectives in subsequent years are not met, the unvested portion of the Equity Incentive Awards granted in previous years will lapse. Long term incentives As I mentioned earlier, we have made changes to the overall remuneration framework for 2012. Prior to 2012, Executive Directors and Executive Officers received share option grants and performance share awards. From 2012, we shall only be making performance share awards. The arrangements which applied in 2011 and those which will apply from 2012 onwards are both described below. Performance Share Awards prior to 2012 During 2011, we made conditional share awards to Executive Directors, Executive Officers and senior executives. Awards to Executive Directors were made under the 2004 Performance Share Plan and awards to other employees were made under the Global Share Plan 2010. In respect of the Performance Share Awards, these two plans operate in the same way. The level of the awards made to Executive Directors and Executive Officers were as follows: Market value of award as% of base salary Executive Directors 150% Executive Officers 75% These share awards are subject to performance conditions measured over a three-year period. These awards will only vest if pre-determined levels of adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPSA) growth are achieved. The number of shares delivered to executives may then be increased subject to the achievement of superior Total Shareholder Return (TSR) measured against the major companies in the medical devices industry. 69 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Corporate Governance Directors Remuneration Report continued The required EPSA levels used for the awards made in 2011 were as follows: Growth in EPSA over the three years ending 31 December 2013 Percentage of award vesting EPSA growth of 15% (approximately 4.5% compounded annually over three years) 25%  Threshold EPSA growth of 20% (approximately 6% compounded annually over three years) 50%  Target EPSA growth of 30% (approximately 9% compounded annually over three years) 100%  Maximum None of the awards will vest if the growth in EPSA over three years is less than threshold. For EPSA performance falling between the points given in the table above, awards will vest on a straight-line basis up to a maximum of 100%. In addition, if the Companys TSR is positioned above median when compared with the TSR of medical devices companies, then the number of vested shares delivered to participants following the achievement of the EPSA targets will be increased by a multiplier as follows: TSR Ranking within comparator group Multiplier Below or at Median 1.0x Upper quartile 1.3x Upper decile or above 1.5x The multiplier increases on a straight line basis between the above points. TSR is measured in a common currency, with values averaged over three months prior to the start and end of the performance period. We compare the Companys performance against a tailored sector peer group of medical devices companies. The companies in the comparator group for the awards made in 2011 are: Arthrocare KCI Bard Medtronic Baxter Nobel Biocare Becton Dickinson Nuvasive Boston Scientific Orthofix Coloplast Group Stryker Conmed St Jude Medical Covidien Synthes Edwards Life Sciences Corp Wright Medical Johnson & Johnson Zimmer The Groups TSR performance and its performance relative to the comparator group is independently monitored and reported to the Remuneration Committee. The awards made in 2009 were subject to performance conditions determined at that time which were based on a relative EPSA measure with a relative TSR multiplier. The targets for growth in EPSA were related to growth of relevant markets, taking into account both volume and price changes in each of our major markets, and weighted according to our relative turnover in these markets to provide an estimate of global market growth calculated on an annual basis for each year of the plan. The actual EPSA growth over the three years was then compared to the compounded EPSA growth targets to calculate the level of vesting. Global market growth is derived from a range of publicly available sources including individual competitor company press releases, quarterly results and analyst reports, as well as data purchased from a variety of industry surveys. EPSA growth over the three years ending 31 December 2011 was 34% against the compounded market growth rate of 13%. Over the same period the Company was ranked 6th out of 20 companies in the medical devices comparator group which meant that a multiplier of 1.28 was applied to the number of shares vesting under the EPSA target. As a result the following awards will vest on 13 August 2012: Number ofshares under2009 award Number ofshares vestingin 2012 David Illingworth(i)(ii) 177,855 156,510 Adrian Hennah 161,273 141,920 (i) The award granted to David Illingworth will be settled prior to 15 March 2012 in accordance with S409A of the US Internal Revenue Code. (ii) The number of shares under the 2009 award has been pro-rated for service during the performance period. Share Options Grants prior to 2012 During 2011, we granted share options to Executive Directors, Executive Officers, senior executives and to certain high performing managers. Option grants to Executive Directors were made under the 2004 Executive Share Option Plan and option grants to other employees were made under the Global Share Plan 2010. Executive Directors and Executive Officers received options at market value of 100% of base salary. Options granted to Executive Directors are subject to performance conditions measured over a three year period. These awards will only vest if pre-determined levels of TSR rank are achieved measured against the major companies in the medical devices industry. The performance measurement for grants made in 2011 to Executive Directors was based on Total Shareholder Return. TSR is calculated on the same basis as for the Performance Share Awards. If the Companys TSR is positioned at or above median when compared with the TSR of those companies in our tailored sector peer group over a three year period commencing 1 January 2011, then the options become exercisable as follows: TSR Ranking within comparator group Percentage ofoptions vesting Below Median Nil Median 33% Upper Quartile 100% Options vest on a straight line basis between these points. If the Companys TSR performance is below median, no options vest. The comparator group is the same for the Performance Share Awards outlined above. Options granted to Executive Officers and other employees in 2011 are not subject to performance conditions. The options granted to Executive Directors in 2009 were subject to the same performance conditions as described above for options granted in 2011. The Companys TSR performance and its performance relative to the comparator group is independently monitored and reported to the Remuneration Committee by Towers Watson. 70 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Corporate Governance Over the three year period ending 31 December 2011 the Company was ranked 6th out of 20 companies in the medical devices comparator group which meant that 96% of the options granted to Executive Directors in 2009 will vest on 13 August 2012 as follows: Number ofoptions granted in 2009 Number ofoptions vestingin 2012 David Illingworth(i) 118,570 113,825 Adrian Hennah 107,515 103,214 (i) The option granted in 2009 has been pro-rated for service during the performance period. Long term incentive arrangements in 2012 In 2012, no share options will be granted to Executive Directors or Executive Officers. We will however make performance share awards to Executive Directors and Executive Officers under the Global Share Plan 2010. The level of the awards made to Executive Directors and Executive Officers will be as follows: Market value ofaward vesting atmaximum as a% of base salary Market value ofaward vestingat target as a %of base salary Executive Directors 190% 95% Executive Officers 110% 55% These share awards will be subject to performance conditions measured over a three year period. 50% of the Award will vest depending on the Companys TSR performance relative to a selection of comparator companies and 50% of the award will vest subject to the achievement of the free cash flow target over a three year performance period. The threshold, target and maximum levels for the 50% of the Award subject to TSR performance are based on the position of the Companys TSR ranking when compared with the TSR of a bespoke peer group of companies in the medical devices sector over a three year period commencing 1 January 2012 as follows: TSR Ranking within comparator group Percentage ofAward vesting Below Median Nil Median 25% Upper Quartile 100% Awards will vest on a straight line basis between these points. If the Companys TSR performance is below median, none of this part of the award will vest. TSR will be measured relative to a bespoke peer group of companies operating in the medical devices sector. For the awards to be made in 2012, these companies are: Arthrocare Medtronic Bard Nobel Biocare Baxter Nuvasive Becton Dickinson Orthofix Boston Scientific Stryker Coloplast Group St Jude Medical Conmed Synthes Covidien Wright Medical Edwards Life Sciences Corp Zimmer This group is slightly different from the group of companies used for plans in previous years, because of various corporate actions and acquisitions in the market over recent years. TSR will be calculated on the same basis as in 2011. The Groups TSR performance and its performance relative to the comparator group will be independently monitored and reported to the Remuneration Committee by Towers Watson. The cash flow target is a cumulative performance target over the three-year performance period. The inclusion of a cash measure in both the annual and long term plans reflects its importance over both timescales. The measure for the long-term target is free cash flow, which is defined as net cash inflows from operating activities, less capital expenditure. Free cash flow is considered to be the most appropriate measure of cash flow performance because it relates to the cash generated to finance additional investment in business opportunities, debt repayments and distributions to shareholders. This measure includes significant elements of operational and financial performance and helps to align executives rewards with shareholder value creation. The threshold, target and maximum levels for the 50% of the award subject to free cash flow performance are as detailed below: Cumulative Free Cash Flow Percentage ofAward vesting Below $1.41 billion Nil $1.41 billion 25% $1.62 billion 50% $1.83 billion or more 100% Awards will vest on a straight line basis between these points. It is intended that the Committee should have the discretion to adjust, but on an exceptional basis only, the free cash flow target during the performance period for material factors that would otherwise distort the performance measure in either direction. For example, adjustments may be required to reflect exchange rate movements, significant acquisitions or divestments, or major legal and taxation settlements. Any major adjustments to the calculation will be disclosed to shareholders. There is no retesting of performance. We feel that these changes to the long-term element of our remuneration framework simplify the previous arrangements, whilst continuing to drive strong cash flow performance and the delivery of superior relative returns to our shareholders. Shareholding requirements We believe that one of the best ways our senior executives can act and feel like shareholders is for them to hold a significant number of shares in Company. We therefore expect our Executive Directors and Executive Officers to build up a holding of shares in the Company. In order to reinforce this expectation, we require them to retain 50% of all shares vesting under Company share plans (after tax) until this holding has been met. We will take into account their progress towards this shareholding requirement when determining whether they will be allocated awards in the future. We require Executive Directors to hold shares equivalent in value to two times their base salary and for Executive Officers to hold shares equivalent in value to one and a half times their base salary. When calculating whether or not this requirement has been met, we will include Ordinary Shares or ADSs held by the individual or their immediate family and the intrinsic value of any vested but unexercised options. As at 21 February 2012, Olivier Bohuon holds no shares, Adrian Hennah holds 167,968 shares to the value of 181% of his base salary. 71 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Corporate Governance Directors Remuneration Report continued Total reward The following chart shows the split between the different pay elements of the Executive Directors remuneration packages on an expected value basis in both 2011 and 2012: Service contracts We employ Executive Directors on service contracts with notice periods of 12 months from the Company and six months from the Executive Director. On termination of the contract, we may require the Executive Director not to work their notice period and as such pay them an amount equivalent to the salary, pension and benefits they would have received if they had been required to work their notice period. In addition, we may also, in exceptional circumstances, exercise our discretion to pay the Executive Director a proportion of the bonus that they would have received had they been required to work their notice period. The Executive Director will also be required, where possible, to mitigate the loss. We will also seek to enforce the non-compete clause in Executive Directors contracts. In the event that we dismiss an Executive Director for cause, no payment will be made as we have a policy of not rewarding failure. In the case of a change in control which results in the termination of an Executive Director or a material alteration to their responsibilities or duties within 12 months of the change in control the Executive Directors would be entitled to receive 12 months base salary and 12 months bonus at target plus pension and benefits. Executive Director Date ofServiceContract Effective Date Expiry Date Notice period from company Olivier 9 February 1 April 3 January Bohuon 2011 2011 2017 12 months Adrian 1 February 1 June 12 November Hennah 2006 2006 2019 12 months We encourage our Executive Directors to serve as a Non-Executive Director of a maximum of one external company. Such appointments are subject to the approval of the Nominations Committee and any fees earned are retained by the Executive Director. Currently Olivier Bohuon is a Non-Executive Director of Virbac and Adrian Hennah is a non-executive Director of Reed Elsevier. During 2011, Olivier Bohuon received 19,000 and Adrian Hennah received £38,475 in respect of these appointments. Non-Executive Directors Non-Executive Directors are engaged by the Company on the basis of letters of appointment. They are normally appointed for terms of three years, terminable at will, without notice by either the Group or the Director and without compensation. The Board reviews the pay of the Non-Executive Directors and aims to set fees that are competitive with other companies of equivalent size and complexity. Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to receive awards under the Companys long term incentive plans and no part of their fees is paid in shares. Non-Executive Director fees were reviewed and increased in August 2011. Non-Executive Directors are paid a basic annual fee and the Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Ethics and Compliance Committees and the Senior Independent Director each receive an extra fee in recognition of their additional responsibilities. An additional fee is also payable to Non-Executive Directors in cases where intercontinental travel is necessary to attend Board and Committee meetings. The fees currently paid to Non-Executive Directors are as follows: Fee inUK Sterling Fee inUS Dollars Fee inEuros Basic Annual Fee £63,000 $120,000  84,250 Committee Chairman and Senior Independent Director Fee £15,000 $27,000  20,000 Intercontinental Travel fee (per meeting) £3,500 $7,000  5,000 The Remuneration Committee reviews the fee of the Chairman. The Chairmans fee was last reviewed in August 2011 and increased to £400,000, an increase of 6.7%, in recognition of his outstanding work in leading the Company through the period of searching and appointing a new Chief Executive Officer and mentoring him in his new role. The Chairman is engaged on a letter of appointment and has a six month notice period. We also require our Non-Executive Directors to hold a personal stake in the Company equivalent to their basic annual fee. These shares may be held as Ordinary Shares or as ADSs held either by themselves or their immediate family. Special issues in 2011 During 2011, we considered, reviewed and approved the proposed remuneration package for Olivier Bohuon, joining the Company as the new Chief Executive Officer and the retirement arrangements for David Illingworth. The key elements of these arrangements are as follows: We employed Olivier on a standard package, participating in the same incentive plans and on the same basis as Adrian Hennah. As explained last year, on joining the Company, he also received a cash payment of 1,400,000 and a conditional award over 200,000 shares vesting in three equal tranches over three years. The first tranche of this award will vest on 1 April 2012. David Illingworth worked a period of six months notice and retired from the Company on 10 August 2011 receiving pay and benefits in accordance with his service contract. He has also received a bonus in respect of the period he worked in 2011. The outstanding awards under the Companys long-term incentive plans have been pro-rated for time and vest at their normal vesting date subject to the applicable performance conditions. At the end of his period of employment, we continued to engage David in a consultancy capacity up to 10 February 2012 for a total fee of $180,000. 72 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Corporate Governance Directors emoluments and pensions The following sections of the Report up to Total Shareholder Return have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP in accordance with the Regulations. a) Salaries and Fees Salaries and fees Benefits (i) AnnualIncentive SalarySupplement inlieu of pensions Total 2011 (iii) Total 2010 (iii) Thousands Chairman (Non-Executive) Sir John Buchanan £389 £31   £420 £373 Executive Directors Olivier Bohuon (iv) 788 (v) 1,675 808 236 3,507  Adrian Hennah £568 £21 £549 £170 £1,308 £1,157 David Illingworth (vi) $893 $168 $497 (ii) $258 $1,816 $2,742 Non-Executive Directors Ian Barlow £80    £80 £70 Geneviève Berger 87    87 83 Pamela Kirby £75    £75 £64 Brian Larcombe £65    £65 £64 Joseph Papa $173    $173 $134 Richard De Schutter $181    $181 $158 Rolf Stomberg 98    98 125 (i) Benefits shown in the table above include cash allowances and benefits in kind.

As a consequence of the Companys Ordinary Shares being traded on the New York Stock Exchange (in the form of American Depositary Shares) the Directors are responsible for the preparation and filing of an annual report on Form 20-F with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The Directors are required to prepare Group accounts for each financial year, in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union which present fairly the financial position of the Group and the financial performance and cash flows of the Group for that period. In preparing those Group accounts, the Directors are required to:  Select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and then apply them consistently;  Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;  Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Groups financial position and financial performance; and  State that the Group has complied with IFRS, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the accounts. Under United Kingdom law the Directors have elected to prepare the Company accounts in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law), which are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing the Company accounts, the Directors are required to:  Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;  Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;  State whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the accounts; and  Prepare the accounts on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business. The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the accounts. The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and the Company and enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, in the case of the Group accounts, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Groups website. It should be noted that information published on the internet is accessible in many countries with different legal requirements. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of accounts may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 78 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Directors responsibility statement pursuant to disclosure and transparency Rule 4 The Directors confirm that, to the best of each persons knowledge:  the Group accounts in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group taken as a whole;  the Company accounts in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice and the Companies Act 2006, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company; and  the Business Review and Risk management sections contained in the accounts includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the financial position of the Company and the Group taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face. By order of the Board, 22 February 2012 Susan Henderson Company Secretary 79 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Independent auditors UK Report Independent Auditors Report to the Members of Smith & Nephew plc We have audited the Group accounts of Smith & Nephew plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group Balance Sheet, the Group Cash Flow Statement, the Group Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 24. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. This report is made solely to the companys members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the companys members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Companys members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor As explained more fully in the Directors Responsibility Statement set out on page 79 the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Boards (APBs) Ethical Standards for Auditors. Scope of the audit of the accounts An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. Opinion on financial statements In our opinion the Group financial statements:  give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups affairs as at 31 December 2011 and of its profit for the year then ended;  have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion the information given in the Directors Report for the financial year for which the Group financial statements are prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements. 80 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Matters on which we are required to report by exception We have nothing to report in respect of the following: Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:  certain disclosures of directors remuneration specified by law are not made; or  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  the directors statement, set out on page 27, in relation to going concern; and  the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Companys compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and  certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on directors remuneration. Other matter We have reported separately on the Company financial statements of Smith & Nephew plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 and on the information in the Directors Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited. Separate Opinion in Relation to IFRSs As explained in Note 1 to the Group financial statements, the Group in addition to complying with its legal obligation to comply with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, has also compiled with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. In our opinion the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS, of the state of the Groups affairs as at 31 December 2011 and of its profit for the year then ended. Les Clifford (Senior statutory auditor) for and on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP, Statutory Auditor London 22 February 2012 81 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Independent auditors US Reports Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm to the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Smith & Nephew plc We have audited the accompanying Group balance sheets of Smith & Nephew plc as of 31 December 2011 and 2010, and the related Group income statements, Group statements of comprehensive income, Group cash flow statements and Group statements of changes in equity for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2011. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall account presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Smith & Nephew plc at 31 December 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2011, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Smith & Nephew plcs internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated 22 February 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Ernst & Young LLP London, England 22 February 2012 82 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm to the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Smith & Nephew plc We have audited Smith & Nephew plcs internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Smith & Nephew plcs management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Smith & Nephew plc maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2011, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Group balance sheets of Smith & Nephew plc as of 31 December 2011 and 2010, and the related Group income statements, Group statements of comprehensive income, Group cash flow statements and Group statements of changes in equity for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2011 and our report dated 22 February 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

In these accounts, Group means the Company and all its subsidiaries. The principal activities of the Group are to develop, manufacture, market and sell medical devices in the sectors of Orthopaedics, Endoscopy and Advanced Wound Management. As required by the European Unions IAS Regulation and the Companies Act 2006, the Group has prepared its accounts in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) effective as at 31 December 2011. The Group has also prepared its accounts in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) effective as at 31 December 2011. IFRS as adopted by the EU differs in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the IASB. However, the differences have no impact for the periods presented. The preparation of accounts in conformity with IFRS requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The accounting policies requiring management to use significant estimates and assumptions; inventories, impairment, retirement benefits and contingencies and provisions, are discussed under Critical Accounting Policies within the Business Review section on page 28. Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. The Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis for accounting in preparing the annual financial statements. The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Consolidation The Group accounts include the accounts of Smith & Nephew plc (the Company) and its subsidiaries for the periods during which they were members of the Group. A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. Control comprises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee so as to obtain benefit from its activities and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights. Subsidiaries are consolidated in the Group accounts from the date that the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between group companies are eliminated on consolidation. All subsidiaries have year ends which are co-terminus with the Groups. Recognition of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on a trade date basis in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The Group carries borrowings in the Balance Sheet at amortised cost. Foreign currencies Balance sheet items of foreign operations and foreign currency borrowings are translated into US Dollars on consolidation at year-end rates of exchange. Income statement items and the cash flows of overseas subsidiary undertakings and associated undertakings are translated at average rates as an approximation to actual transaction rates, with actual transaction rates used for large one off transactions. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The following are recorded as movements in Other reserves within other comprehensive income: exchange differences on the translation at closing rates of exchange of non-US Dollar opening net assets; the differences arising between the translation of profits into US Dollars at average and closing exchange rates; to the extent that the hedging relationship is effective, the difference on translation of foreign currency borrowings or swaps that are used to finance or hedge the Groups net investments in foreign operations; and the movement in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts used to hedge forecast foreign exchange cash flows. All other exchange differences are taken to the income statement. The exchange rates used for the translation of currencies into US Dollars that have the most significant impact on the Group results were: 2011 2010 2009 Average rates Sterling 1.60 1.54 1.56 Euro 1.39 1.32 1.39 Swiss Franc 1.13 0.96 0.92 Year-end rates Sterling 1.55 1.57 1.61 Euro 1.29 1.34 1.43 Swiss Franc 1.06 1.07 0.97 88 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information New IFRS accounting standards The following IFRS standard, which is relevant to the Group, has been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) but is not yet effective or has not yet been adopted by the Group. Unless otherwise listed below, no other standard, amendment or interpretation is likely to have a material effect on the Groups results of operations or financial position. In November 2009, the IASB issued IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. This standard specifies how the Group should classify and measure financial assets. It requires all financial assets to be either classified on the basis of the entitys business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset or initially measured at fair value. This standard has not been endorsed by the EU. No standard or interpretation coming into effect during the year had a significant effect on the reported results or the financial position of the Group. The significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Groups accounts are explained with the relevant notes to the accounts. 2 Business segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business segments according to the nature of its products and has three business segments  Orthopaedics, Endoscopy and Advanced Wound Management. The types of products and services offered by each business segment are:  Orthopaedic reconstruction implants include hip, knee and shoulder joints as well as ancillary products such as bone cement and mixing systems used in cemented reconstruction joint surgery. Orthopaedic trauma fixation products consist of internal and external devices and other products, including shoulder fixation and orthobiological materials used in the stabilisation of severe fractures and deformity correction procedures. Clinical therapies products are those that are applied in an orthopaedic office or clinic setting and include bone growth stimulation, joint fluid therapies and outpatient spine products.  Smith & Nephews Endoscopy business develops and commercialises endoscopic (minimally invasive surgery) techniques, educational programmes and value-added services for surgeons to treat and repair soft tissue and articulating joints. The business focuses on the arthroscopy sector of the endoscopy market. Arthroscopy is the minimally invasive surgery of joints, in particular the knee, shoulder and hip.  Smith & Nephews Advanced Wound Management business offers a range of products from initial wound bed preparation through to full wound closure. These products are targeted at chronic wounds associated with the older population, such as pressure sores and venous leg ulcers. There are also products for the treatment of wounds such as burns and invasive surgery that impact the wider population. Management monitors the operating results of its business segments separately for the purposes of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Group financing (including interest receivable and payable) and income taxes are managed on a group basis and are not allocated to business segments. The following tables present revenue, profit, asset and liability information regarding the Groups operating segments. The share of results of associates is segmentally allocated to Orthopaedics. 2.1 Revenue by business segment and geography Accounting policy Revenue comprises sales of products and services to third parties at amounts invoiced net of trade discounts and rebates, excluding taxes on revenue. Revenue from the sale of products is recognised upon transfer to the customer of the significant risks and rewards of ownership. This is generally when goods are delivered to customers. Sales of inventory located at customer premises and available for customers immediate use are recognised when notification is received that the product has been implanted or used. Appropriate provisions for returns, trade discounts and rebates are deducted from revenue. Rebates comprise retrospective volume discounts granted to certain customers on attainment of certain levels of purchases from the Group. These are accrued over the course of the arrangement based on estimates of the level of business expected and adjusted at the end of the arrangement to reflect actual volumes.

No revenue from a single customer is in excess of 10% of the Groups revenue. 2.2 Trading and operating profit by business segment Trading profit is a trend measure which presents the long-term profitability of the Group excluding the impact of specific transactions that management considers affects the Groups short-term profitability. The Group presents this measure to assist investors in their understanding of trends. The Group has identified the following items, where material, as those to be excluded from operating profit when arriving at trading profit: acquisition and disposal related items including amortisation of acquisition intangibles and impairments; significant restructuring events; gains and losses arising from legal disputes; and uninsured losses. Operating profit reconciles to trading profit as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Notes $ million $ million $ million Operating profit 862 920 723 Acquisition related costs 3   26 Restructuring and rationalisation expenses 3 40 15 42 Amortisation of acquisition intangibles and impairments 8 & 9 36 34 66 Legal provision 3 23   Trading profit 961 969 857 Trading profit by business segment Orthopaedics 492 536 508 Endoscopy 222 200 189 Advanced Wound Management 247 233 160 961 969 857 Operating profit by business segment reconciled to attributable profit for the year Orthopaedics 415 503 410 Endoscopy 215 197 169 Advanced Wound Management 232 220 144 Operating profit 862 920 723 Net interest payable (8) (15) (40) Other finance costs (6) (10) (15) Share of results of associates   2 Taxation (266) (280) (198) Attributable profit for the year 582 615 472 90 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information 2.3 Assets and liabilities by business segment and geography Business segment 2011 2010 2009 $ million $ million $ million Balance sheet Assets: Orthopaedics 2,550 2,778 2,656 Endoscopy 846 769 705 Advanced Wound Management 819 755 810 Operating assets by business segment 4,215 4,302 4,171 Assets held for sale (relating to Orthopaedics business segment) 125   Unallocated corporate assets 407 431 394 Total assets 4,747 4,733 4,565 Liabilities: Orthopaedics 398 457 426 Endoscopy 128 124 111 Advanced Wound Management 169 146 194 Operating liabilities by business segment 695 727 731 Liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale (relating to Orthopaedics business segment) 19   Unallocated corporate liabilities 846 1,233 1,655 Total liabilities 1,560 1,960 2,386 Unallocated corporate assets and liabilities comprise the following: 2011 2010 2009 $ million $ million $ million Deferred tax assets 223 224 202 Cash and bank 184 207 192 Unallocated corporate assets 407 431 394 Long-term borrowings 16 642 1,090 Retirement benefit obligations 287 262 322 Deferred tax liabilities 66 69 31 Bank overdrafts and loans due within one year 306 57 45 Current tax payable 171 203 167 Unallocated corporate liabilities 846 1,233 1,655 2011 2010 2009 $ million $ million $ million Capital expenditure Orthopaedics 241 227 235 Endoscopy 93 58 41 Advanced Wound Management 31 30 63 365 315 339 Capital expenditure segmentally allocated above comprises: 2011 2010 2009 $ million $ million $ million Additions to property, plant and equipment 229 250 216 Additions to intangible assets 92 65 102 Capital expenditure as per cash flow statement 321 315 318 Acquisitions  Goodwill 44  3 Acquisitions  Intangible assets   12 Acquisitions  Property, plant and equipment   6 Capital expenditure 365 315 339 91 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Notes to the Group accounts continued 2011 2010 2009 $ million $ million $ million Depreciation, amortisation and impairment Orthopaedics 209 195 206 Endoscopy 50 41 52 Advanced Wound Management 38 37 40 297 273 298 Amounts comprise depreciation of property, plant and equipment, amortisation of other intangible assets, impairment of investments and amortisation of acquisition intangibles and impairments as follows: 2011 2010 2009 $ million $ million $ million Impairment of intangibles and goodwill   32 Amortisation of acquisition intangibles 36 34 34 36 34 66 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 217 203 206 Amortisation of other intangible assets 42 34 26 Impairment of investments 2 2  297 273 298 Impairments of $2m were recognised within operating profit in 2011 and included within the administrative expenses line (2010  $2m, 2009  $32m).

Substantially all development expenditure is complete by the time the product is submitted for regulatory approval. Consequently the majority of expenditure on research and development is expensed as incurred. Advertising costs Expenditure on advertising costs is expensed as incurred. 2011 2010 2009 $ million $ million $ million Revenue 4,270 3,962 3,772 Cost of goods sold (i) (1,140) (1,031) (1,030) Gross profit 3,130 2,931 2,742 Research and development expenses (167) (151) (155) Selling, general and administrative expenses: Marketing, selling and distribution expenses (ii) (1,526) (1,414) (1,351) Administrative expenses (iii) (iv) (v) (575) (446) (513) (2,101) (1,860) (1,864) Operating profit 862 920 723 (i) In 2011, $7m of restructuring and rationalisation expenses related to cost of goods sold (2010  no restructuring and rationalisation expenses or acquisition related costs, 2009  $15m of restructuring and rationalisation expenses and $12m of acquisition related costs).

Charges of $14m (2010  $15m, 2009  $42m) related to the earnings improvement programme which was completed in the year. Charges of $26m (2010  $nil) were also incurred, relating mainly to people costs associated with the structural and process changes announced in August 2011. 3.4 Legal provision In 2011, the Group has established a provision of $23m in connection with the previously disclosed investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) into potential violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the medical devices industry. On 6 February 2012, Smith & Nephew announced that it had reached settlement with the SEC and DOJ in connection with this matter. Smith & Nephew has committed to pay slightly less than $23m in fines and profit disgorgement, maintain an enhanced compliance programme, and appoint an independent monitor for at least 18 months to review and report on its compliance programme. 94 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information 4 Interest and Other finance costs 4.1 Interest (payable)/receivable $million123456 $million123456 $million123456 2011 2010 2009 $ million $ million $ million Interest receivable 4 3 2 Interest payable: Bank borrowings (6) (7) (16) Other (6) (11) (26) (12) (18) (42) Net interest payable (8) (15) (40) Interest receivable includes net interest receivable of $1m (2010  $nil, 2009  $nil) on interest rate and currency swaps and interest payable includes $nil (2010  $5m, 2009  $23m) of net interest payable on currency and interest rate swaps. The gross interest receivable on these swaps was $4m (2010  $4m, 2009  $14m) and the gross interest payable was $3m (2010  $9m, 2009  $37m). 4.2 Other finance costs $million123456 $million123456 $million123456 $million123456 2011 2010 2009 Notes $ million $ million $ million Retirement benefits: Interest cost 19 (66) (64) (61) Retirement benefits: Expected return on plan assets 19 59 55 48 Other 1 (1) (2) Other finance costs (6) (10) (15) Foreign exchange gains or losses recognised in the income statement arose primarily on the translation of intercompany and third party borrowings and amounted to a net $3m gain in 2011 (2010  net $8m gain, 2009  net $14m gain). These amounts were fully matched in the income statement by the fair value gains or losses on currency swaps (carried at fair value through profit and loss) held to manage this currency risk. 5 Taxation Accounting policy The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The accounting policy for deferred taxation is set out in Note17. The Group operates in multiple tax jurisdictions around the world and records provisions for taxation liabilities and tax audits when it is considered probable that a tax charge will arise and the amount can be reliably estimated. Although Group policy is to submit its tax returns to the relevant tax authorities as promptly as possible, at any time the Group has unagreed years outstanding and is involved in disputes and tax audits. Significant issues may take many years to resolve. In estimating the probability and amount of any tax charge management takes into account the views of internal and external advisors and updates the amount of the provision whenever necessary. The ultimate tax liability may differ from the amount provided depending on interpretations of tax law, settlement negotiations or changes in legislation. 5.1 Taxation charge attributable to the Group $million123456 $million123456 $million123456 2011 2010 2009 $ million $ million $ million Current taxation: UK corporation tax at 26.5% (2010  28%, 2009  28%) 56 52 50 Overseas tax 214 238 189 Current income tax charge 270 290 239 Adjustments in respect of prior periods (16) (18) (31) Total current taxation 254 272 208 Deferred taxation Origination and reversal of temporary differences 18 4 (7) Changes in tax rates (3) (2)  Adjustments to estimated amounts arising in prior periods (3) 6 (3) Total deferred taxation 12 8 (10) Total taxation as per the income statement 266 280 198 Deferred taxation in other comprehensive income (24) 7 12 Deferred taxation in equity 2  (2) Taxation attributable to the Group 244 287 208 95 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Notes to the Group accounts continued The tax charge was reduced by $17m in 2011 (2010  $10m, 2009  $26m) as a consequence of restructuring and rationalisation expenses, acquisition related costs, amortisation of acquisition intangibles and legal provision. The applicable tax for the year is based on the United Kingdom standard rate of corporation tax of 26.5% (2010  28%, 2009  28%). Overseas taxation is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions. The average effective tax rate differs from the applicable rate as follows: $million $million $million 2011 2010 2009 % % % UK standard rate 26.5 28.0 28.0 Non-deductible/non-taxable items (0.5) 0.2 1.2 Prior year items (1.6) (1.5) (4.8) Tax losses incurred not relieved/(utilised not previously recognised) 0.3 (0.2) (0.1) Overseas income taxed at other than UK standard rate 6.7 4.8 5.3 Total effective tax rate 31.4 31.3 29.6 During the year the enacted UK tax rate applicable from 1 April 2012 was reduced to 25% and the UK Government announced policy to reduce the tax rate to 23% across the following three years. It is expected that if the stated policy is enacted deferred tax credits will arise. 6 Earnings per Ordinary Share Accounting policy Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year, excluding shares held by the Company in the Employees Share Trust or as treasury shares. Adjusted earnings per share Adjusted earnings per share is a trend measure which presents the long-term profitability of the Group excluding the impact of specific transactions that management considers affects the Groups short-term profitability. The Group presents this measure to assist investors in their understanding of trends. Adjusted attributable profit is the numerator used for this measure. The Group has identified the following items, where material, as those to be excluded when arriving at adjusted attributable profit: acquisition and disposal related items including amortisation of acquisition intangible assets and impairments; significant restructuring events; gains and losses arising from legal disputes and uninsured losses; and taxation thereon. The calculations of the basic, diluted and adjusted earnings per Ordinary Share are based on the following earnings and numbers of shares: 2011 2010 2009 $ million $ million $ million Earnings Attributable profit for the year 582 615 472 Adjusted attributable profit (see below) 664 654 580 Adjusted attributable profit Attributable profit is reconciled to adjusted attributable profit as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Notes $ million $ million $ million Attributable profit for the year 582 615 472 Acquisition related costs 3   26 Restructuring and rationalisation expenses 3 40 15 42 Amortisation of acquisition intangibles and impairments 8 & 9 36 34 66 Legal provision 23   Taxation on excluded items 5 (17) (10) (26) Adjusted attributable profit 664 654 580 96 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information The numerators used for basic and diluted earnings per Ordinary Share are the same.

Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over lives ranging between 20 and 50 years. Leasehold land and buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful economic lives and the terms of the leases. Plant and equipment is depreciated over lives ranging between three and 20 years by equal annual instalments to write down the assets to their estimated residual value at the end of their working lives. Assets in course of construction are not depreciated until they are brought into use. The useful lives and residual values of all property, plant and equipment are reviewed each financial year-end, and where adjustments are required, these are made prospectively. Finance costs relating to the purchase or construction of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that take longer than one year to complete are capitalised based on the Group weighted average borrowing costs. All other finance costs are expensed as incurred. Impairment of assets The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment loss. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs. An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use. In assessing value-in-use, its estimated future cash flow is discounted to its present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 97 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Notes to the Group accounts continued Land and buildings Plant and equipment Assets in course of construction $ million Total $ million Freehold $ million Leasehold$ million Instruments$ million Other$ million Cost At 1 January 2010 129 52 889 784 27 1,881 Exchange adjustment (2)  9   7 Additions 1 1 145 48 55 250 Disposals (8)  (81) (43) (3) (135) Transfers 11  2 (3) (12) (2) At 31 December 2010 131 53 964 786 67 2,001 Exchange adjustment  (1) (13) (7)  (21) Additions 4 2 144 32 47 229 Disposals (2) (2) (86)   (90) Transfers    72 (72)  Transferred to assets held for sale    (5)  (5) At 31 December 2011 133 52 1,009 878 42 2,114 Depreciation and impairment At 1 January 2010 29 22 575 502  1,128 Exchange adjustment (1)  7 (2)  4 Charge for the year 4 4 130 65  203 Disposals (5) (1) (74) (41)  (121) Transfers 14   (14)   At 31 December 2010 41 25 638 510  1,214 Exchange adjustment   (9) (6)  (15) Charge for the year 4 3 139 71  217 Disposals (2) (1) (80)   (83) Transferred to assets held for sale    (2)  (2) At 31 December 2011 43 27 688 573  1,331 Net book amounts At 31 December 2011 90 25 321 305 42 783 At 31 December 2010 90 28 326 276 67 787 Land and buildings includes land with a cost of $14m (2010  $10m) that is not subject to depreciation. Assets held under finance leases with a net book amount of $12m (2010  $14m) are included within land and buildings and $8m (2010  $10m) are included within plant and equipment. Group capital expenditure relating to property, plant and equipment contracted but not provided for amounted to $9m (2010  $15m). 8 Goodwill Accounting policy Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment annually. Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating unit (CGU) that is expected to benefit from the acquisition. The recoverable amount of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually. For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related CGUs monitored by management, being the business segment level, Orthopaedics, Endoscopy and Advanced Wound Management. In carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill a number of significant assumptions have to be made when preparing cash flow projections. These include the future rate of market growth, discount rates, the market demand for the products acquired, the future profitability of acquired businesses or products, levels of reimbursement and success in obtaining regulatory approvals. If actual results should differ, or changes in expectations arise, impairment charges may be required which would adversely impact operating results. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount then an impairment loss is determined to have occurred. Any impairment losses that arise are recognised immediately in the income statement and are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill and then to the carrying amounts of the other assets. 98 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information 2011 2010 Notes $ million $ million Cost At 1 January 1,108 1,100 Exchange adjustment (12) 12 Acquisitions 22 44  Transferred to assets held for sale 22 (44)  Adjustment to contingent consideration  (4) At 31 December 1,096 1,108 Impairment At 1 January 7 7 Transferred to assets held for sale 22 (7)  At 31 December  7 Net book amounts 1,096 1,101 Each of the Groups business segments represent a CGU and include goodwill as follows: 2011 2010 $ million $ million Orthopaedics 549 582 Endoscopy 323 280 Advanced Wound Management 224 239 1,096 1,101 In September 2011 and 2010 impairment reviews were performed by comparing the recoverable amount of each CGU with its carrying amount, including goodwill. These are updated during December, taking into account significant events that occurred between September and December. For each CGU, the recoverable amounts are based on value-in-use which is calculated from pre-tax cash flow projections for five years using data from the Groups budget and strategic planning process, the results of which are reviewed and approved by the Board. These projections exclude any estimated future cash inflows or outflows expected to arise from future restructurings. The five-year period is in line with the Groups strategic planning process. The calculation of value-in-use for the three identified CGUs is most sensitive to discount and growth rates as set out below: The discount rate reflects managements assessment of risks specific to the assets of each CGU. The pre-tax discount rate used in the Orthopaedics business is 10% (2010  11%), for the Endoscopy businesses it is 11% (2010  15%) and for the Advanced Wound Management business it is 9% (2010  10%). In determining the growth rate used in the calculation of the value-in-use, the Group considered the annual sales growth and trading profit margins. Projections are based on anticipated volume and value growth in the markets served by the Group and assumptions as to market share movements. Each year the projections for the previous year are compared to actual results and variances are factored into the assumptions used in the current year. Growth rates for the five year period for the Orthopaedics business vary up to 6% (2010  9%), for the Endoscopy business up to 13% (2010  10%) and for the Advanced Wound Management business up to 8% (2010  8%). Specific considerations and strategies taken into account in determining the sales growth and trading profit margin for each CGU are:  Orthopaedics  In the Orthopaedic CGU management intends to deliver growth through continuing to focus on the customer, high quality customer service and innovative product development, and through continuing to improve efficiencies.  Endoscopy  It is managements intent to maintain and grow this CGU as the leading provider of endoscopic techniques and technologies for joint and ligament repair. This is driven partly through the growing acceptance of Endoscopy as a preferred surgical choice amongst physicians and patients, product innovation, high quality customer service, and supporting surgeon educational programmes.  Advanced Wound Management  Management intends to develop this CGU by focusing on the higher added value sectors of exudate and infection management through improved wound bed preparation, moist and active healing and negative pressure wound therapy, and by continuing to improve efficiency. A long-term growth rate of 4% (2010  4%) in pre-tax cash flows is assumed after five years in calculating a terminal value for the Groups CGUs. Management considers this to be an appropriate estimate based on the growth rates of the markets in which the Group operates. Capital expenditure represents the Groups expected annual investment in property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets. This is approximately 8% (2010  8%) of annual revenue. 99 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Notes to the Group accounts continued Management has considered the following sensitivities:  Growth of market and market share  Management has considered the impact of a variance in market growth and market share. The value-in-use calculation shows that if the assumed long-term growth rate was reduced to nil, the recoverable amount of all of the CGUs independently would still be greater than their carrying values.  Discount rate  Management has considered the impact of an increase in the discount rate applied to the calculation. The value-in-use calculation shows that for the recoverable amount of the CGU to be less than its carrying value, the discount rate would have to be increased to 31% (2010  31%) for the Orthopaedics business, 43% (2010  43%) for the Endoscopy business and 51% (2010  53%) for the Advanced Wound Management business. 9 Intangible assets Accounting policies Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately from a business combination (including purchased patents, know-how, trademarks, licences and distribution rights) are initially measured at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a material business combination (referred to as acquisition intangibles) is the fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. All intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives. The estimated useful economic life of an intangible asset ranges between three and 20 years depending on its nature. Internally generated intangible assets are expensed in the income statement as incurred. Purchased computer software and certain costs of information technology projects are capitalised as intangible assets. Software that is integral to computer hardware is capitalised as plant and equipment. Impairment of assets The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment loss. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs. An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use. In assessing value-in-use, its estimated future cash flow is discounted to its present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In carrying out impairment reviews of intangible assets a number of significant assumptions have to be made when preparing cash flow projections. These include the future rate of market growth, discount rates, the market demand for the products acquired, the future profitability of acquired businesses or products, levels of reimbursement and success in obtaining regulatory approvals. If actual results should differ, or changes in expectations arise, impairment charges may be required which would adversely impact operating results. 100 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Acquisitionintangibles$ million Software$ million DistributionRights$ million Patents &IntellectualProperty$ million Total$ million Cost At 1 January 2010 417 111 67 91 686 Exchange adjustment 23 1   24 Additions  32 11 22 65 Disposals  (1 ) (25 )  (26 ) Transfers  2   2 At 31 December 2010 440 145 53 113 751 Exchange adjustment (4 ) 1   (3 ) Additions  32 7 53 92 Disposals  (5 )  (1 ) (6 ) Transferred to assets held for sale  (3 )  (22 ) (25 ) At 31 December 2011 436 170 60 143 809 Amortisation and impairment At 1 January 2010 159 29 35 51 274 Exchange adjustment 7 1   8 Charge for the year 34 17 14 3 68 Disposals   (25 )  (25 ) At 31 December 2010 200 47 24 54 325 Exchange adjustment (2 )    (2 ) Charge for the year 36 22 10 10 78 Disposals  (3 )  (1 ) (4 ) Transferred to assets held for sale  (1 )  (10 ) (11 ) At 31 December 2011 234 65 34 53 386 Net book amounts At 31 December 2011 202 105 26 90 423 At 31 December 2010 240 98 29 59 426 Commitments The Group is contractually committed to four milestone payments, which total $60m (2010 -$60m), related to the US approval and commercialisation of DUROLANE which may become payable under the terms of the agreement with Q-MED AB signed in June 2006. This committment will transfer to the Groups new associate as detailed in Note 22. 10 Investments Accounting policy Investments, other than those related to associates, are initially recorded at fair value plus transaction costs on the trade date. The Group has an investment in an entity that holds mainly unquoted equity securities, which by their very nature have no fixed maturity date or coupon rate. The investment is classed as available-for-sale and carried at fair value. The fair value of the investment is based on the underlying fair value of the equity securities: marketable securities are valued by reference to closing prices in the market; non-marketable securities are estimated considering factors including the purchase price, prices of recent significant private placements of securities of the same issuer and estimates of liquidation value. The Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that the investment is impaired. Any objective evidence would include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost. Changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income except where management considers that there is objective evidence of an impairment of the underlying equity securities, whereupon an impairment is recognised as an expense immediately. 2011 2010 $ million $ million At 1 January 6 7 Impairment (2 ) (1 ) At 31 December 4 6 101 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Notes to the Group accounts continued 11 Investments in associates Accounting policy Investments in associates, being those entities over which the Group has a significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary or a joint venture, are accounted for using the equity method, with the Group recording its share of the associates net income and equity. The Groups share in the results of its associates is included in one separate income statement line and is calculated after deduction of their respective taxes. The Group holds 49% of the Austrian entities Plus Orthopedics GmbH and Intraplant GmbH and 20% of the German entity Intercus GmbH. The following table summarises the financial position of the Groups investment in these associates. 2011 $ million 2010 $ million Share of results of associates: Revenue 11 11 Operating costs and taxation (11 ) (11 ) Profit after taxation recognised in the income statement   Dividends paid  (1 ) Net (loss)/profit attributable to the Group  (1 ) Investments in associates at 1 January 13 13 Exchange adjustment  1 Investments in associates at 31 December 13 13 Investments in associates is represented by: Assets 10 11 Liabilities (1 ) (2 ) Net assets 9 9 Goodwill 4 4 13 13 12 Inventories Accounting policy Finished goods and work-in-progress are valued at factory cost, including appropriate overheads, on a first-in first-out basis. Raw materials and bought-in finished goods are valued at purchase price. All inventories are reduced to net realisable value where lower than cost. Inventory acquired as part of a business acquisition is valued at selling price less costs of disposal and a profit allowance for selling efforts. Orthopaedic instruments are generally not sold but provided to customers and distributors for use in surgery. They are recorded as inventory until they are deployed at which point they are transferred to plant and equipment and depreciated over their useful economic lives of between three and five years. A feature of the orthopaedic business is the high level of product inventory required, some of which is located at customer premises and is available for customers immediate use (referred to as consignment inventory). Complete sets of product, including large and small sizes, have to be made available in this way. These outer sizes are used less frequently than standard sizes and towards the end of the product life cycle are inevitably in excess of requirements. Adjustments to carrying value are therefore required to be made to orthopaedic inventory to anticipate this situation. These adjustments are calculated in accordance with a formula based on levels of inventory compared with historical or forecast usage. This formula is applied on an individual product line basis and is first applied when a product group has been on the market for two years. This method of calculation is considered appropriate based on experience but it involves management judgements on effectiveness of inventory deployment, length of product lives, phase-out of old products and efficiency of manufacturing planning systems. 2011$ million 2010$ million 2009$ million Raw materials and consumables 140 159 157 Work-in-progress 24 23 28 Finished goods and goods for resale 695 741 748 859 923 933 Reserves for excess and obsolete inventories were $322m (2010  $322m, 2009  $303m). During 2011, $65m was recognised as an expense within cost of goods sold resulting from the write down of excess and obsolete inventory (2010  $66m, 2009  $92m). The cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included in cost of goods sold amounted to $991m (2010  $909m, 2009  $866m). No inventory is carried at fair value less costs to sell in any year. 102 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information 13 Trade and other receivables Accounting policy Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost, less any allowances for uncollectible amounts. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets. Loans and other receivables are classified as Trade and other receivables in the balance sheet. The Group manages credit risk through credit limits which require authorisation commensurate with the size of the limit and which are regularly reviewed. Credit limit decisions are made based on available financial information and the business case. Significant receivables are regularly reviewed and monitored at Group level. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers. Furthermore the Groups principal customers are backed by government and public or private medical insurance funding, which historically represent a lower risk of default. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivable. The Group does not hold any collateral as security. 2011$ million 2010$ million 2009$ million Trade receivables 936 952 843 Less: provision for bad and doubtful debts (36 ) (49 ) (47 ) Trade receivables  net (loans and receivables) 900 903 796 Derivatives  forward foreign exchange contracts 21 23 13 Other receivables 50 55 71 Amounts owed by associates   2 Prepayments and accrued income 66 65 64 1,037 1,046 946 Less non-current portion: Trade receivables  (22 )  Current portion 1,037 1,024 946 All non-current receivables are due within five years from the balance sheet date. Management considers that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to the fair value. The provision for bad and doubtful debts is based on specific assessments of risk and reference to past default experience. The bad debt expense (excluding the macrotextured claim) for the year was $42m (2010  $30m, 2009  $33m). Amounts due from insurers in respect of the macrotextured claim of $136m (2010  $133m, 2009  $128m) are included within other receivables and have been provided in full. The amount of trade receivables that were past due but not impaired were as follows: 2011$ million 2010$ million 2009$ million Past due not more than three months 198 168 202 Past due more than three months and not more than six months 51 52 56 Past due more than six months and not more than one year 59 57 46 Past due more than one year 94 59 80 402 336 384 Neither past due nor impaired 534 616 459 Provision for bad and doubtful debts (36 ) (49 ) (47 ) Trade receivables  net (loans and receivables) 900 903 796 Movements in the provision for bad and doubtful debts were as follows: At 1 January 49 47 40 Exchange adjustment (1 )  1 Receivables provided for during the year 42 30 33 Utilisation of provision (34 ) (28 ) (27 ) Provision transferred to assets held for sale (20 )   At 31 December 36 49 47 In 2011, no trade receivables from third parties are held under factoring agreements with recourse (2010  $11m, 2009  $20m).

Gross US Dollar equivalents of $112m (2010  $61m) receivable and $112m (2010  $61m) payable have been netted. Currency swaps comprise foreign exchange swaps and were used in 2011 and 2010 to hedge intragroup loans and other monetary items.

The Group uses derivative financial instruments only to manage the financial risks associated with underlying business activities and their financing. Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is not able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price. The Groups policy is to ensure that there is sufficient funding and facilities in place to meet foreseeable borrowing requirements. The Group manages and monitors liquidity risk through regular reporting of current cash and borrowing balances and periodic preparation and review of short and medium term cash forecasts having regard to the maturities of investments and borrowing facilities. Bank loans and overdrafts represent drawings under total committed facilities of $1,259m (2010  $1,511m) and total uncommitted facilities of $375m (2010  $332m). The Group has undrawn committed facilities of $1,003m (2010  $884m). Of the undrawn committed facilities, $1,000m expires after two but within five years (2010  $7m expired within one year and $877m after two but within five years). The interest payable on borrowings under committed facilities is at floating rate and is typically based on the LIBOR interest rate relevant to the term and currency concerned. Borrowings are shown at book value which approximates to fair value. In December 2010, the Company reviewed and replaced its principal banking facilities ahead of their maturity in May 2012. The Company reduced its $1 billion 5-year term loan to $245m as at 31 December 2011. The interest rate for this multi-currency facility, at 20 basis points over LIBOR, is unchanged. Smith & Nephew also has an undrawn 5 year $1 billion multi-currency revolving facility with an initial interest rate of 70 basis points over LIBOR. The commitment fee on the undrawn amount of the revolving facility is 24.5 basis points. The Company is subject to restrictive covenants under the facility agreement requiring the Groups ratio of net debt to EBITDA to not exceed 3.0 to 1 and the ratio of EBITA to net interest to not be less than 3.0 to 1, with net debt, EBITDA, EBITA and net interest all being calculated as defined in the agreement. These financial covenants are tested at the end of each half year for the 12 months ending on the last day of the testing period. As of 31 December 2011, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. The facility is also subject to customary events of default, none of which are currently anticipated to occur. 15.5 Year-end financial liabilities by contractual maturity The table below analyses the Groups year-end financial liabilities by contractual maturity date, including interest payments and excluding the impact of netting arrangements: Within oneyear or ondemand$ million Betweenone andtwo years$ million Betweentwo andfive years$ million Afterfive years$ million Total$ million At 31 December 2011 Non-derivative financial liabilities: Bank overdrafts and loans 305    305 Trade and other payables 549    549 Finance lease liabilities 4 3 9 9 25 Derivative financial liabilities: Currency swaps/forward foreign exchange contracts  outflow 1,053    1,053 Currency swaps/forward foreign exchange contracts  inflow (1,052 )    (1,052 ) 859 3 9 9 880 At 31 December 2010 Non-derivative financial liabilities: Bank overdrafts and loans 59 500 130  689 Trade and other payables 584    584 Finance lease liabilities 5 4 9 12 30 Derivative financial liabilities: Currency swaps/forward foreign exchange contracts  outflow 1,008    1,008 Currency swaps/forward foreign exchange contracts  inflow (1,000 )    (1,000 ) Interest rate basis swaps  gross outflow 2    2 Interest rate basis swaps  gross inflow (2 )    (2 ) 656 504 139 12 1,311 The amounts in the tables above are undiscounted cash flows, which differ from the amounts included in the balance sheet where the underlying cash flows have been discounted. 106 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information 15.6 Finance leases Accounting policy Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Assets held under finance leases are capitalised as property, plant or equipment and depreciated accordingly. The capital element of future lease payments is included in borrowings and interest is charged to profit before taxation on a reducing balance basis over the term of the lease. Future minimum lease payments under finance leases together with the present value of the minimum lease payments are as follows: 2011$ million 2010$ million Within one year 4 5 After one and within two years 3 4 After two and within three years 3 3 After three and within four years 3 3 After four and within five years 3 3 After five years 9 12 Total minimum lease payments 25 30 Discounted by imputed interest (7 ) (8 ) Present value of minimum lease payments 18 22 Present value of minimum lease payments can be split out as: $3m (2010  $4m) due within one year, $7m (2010  $8m) due between one to five years and $8m (2010  $10m) due after five years. 16 Financial instruments and risk management Accounting policy Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at subsequent balance sheet dates. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments and includes counterparty credit risk. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of forecast third party and intercompany transactions are recognised in other comprehensive income until the associated asset or liability is recognised. Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit and loss. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset, the amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying value of the asset. Currency swaps to match foreign currency net assets with foreign currency liabilities are fair valued at year-end. Changes in the fair values of currency swaps that are designated and effective as net investment hedges are matched in other comprehensive income against changes in value of the related net assets. Interest rate swaps transacted to fix interest rates on floating rate borrowings are accounted for as cash flow hedges and changes in the fair values resulting from changes in market interest rates are recognised in other comprehensive income. Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit and loss. Any ineffectiveness on hedging instruments and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement within other finance income/(costs) as they arise. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is retained there until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement for the period. 16.1 Foreign exchange exposures The Group operates in over 90 countries and as a consequence has transactional and translational foreign exchange exposure. The Groups policy is to limit the impact of foreign exchange movements on equity by holding liabilities where practical in the same currencies as the Groups non US Dollar assets. These liabilities take the form of either borrowings or currency swaps. The Group designates a portion of foreign currency borrowings in non-operating units as net investment hedges. As at 31 December 2011, CHF32m (2010  CHF125m) of Group borrowings were designated as net investment hedges; the movement in the fair value of these hedges attributable to changes in exchange rates is recognised directly in reserves. The fair value of these hedges at 31 December 2011 was $34m (2010  $134m). It is Group policy for operating units not to hold material unhedged monetary assets or liabilities other than in their functional currencies. 107 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Notes to Group accounts continued Foreign exchange variations affect trading results in two ways. Firstly, on translation of overseas sales and profits into US Dollars and secondly, transactional exposures arising where some or all of the costs of sale are incurred in a different currency from the sale. The principal transactional exposures arise as the proportion of costs in US Dollars, Sterling and Swiss Francs exceed the proportion of sales in each of these currencies and correspondingly the proportion of sales in Euros exceeds the proportion of costs in Euros. The impact of currency movements on the cost of purchases is partly mitigated by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts. The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge forecast third party and intercompany trading cash flows for forecast foreign currency inventory purchases for up to one year. When a commitment is entered into, forward foreign exchange contracts are normally used to increase the hedge to 100% of the exposure. Cash flows relating to cash flow hedges are expected to occur within twelve months of inception and profits and losses on hedges are expected to enter into the determination of profit (within cost of goods sold) within a further twelve month period. The principal currencies hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts are US Dollars, Euros and Sterling. At 31 December 2011, the Group had contracted to exchange within one year the equivalent of $940m (2010  $944m). Based on the Groups borrowings as at 31 December 2011, if the US Dollar were to weaken against all currencies by 10%, the Groups net borrowings would increase by $11m (2010  $24m). In respect of borrowings held in a different currency to the relevant reporting entity, if the US_Dollar were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, the Groups borrowings would increase by $16m (2010  $35m). Excluding borrowings designated as net investment hedges, the increase would be $13m (2010  $21m); this increase would be fully offset by corresponding movements in group loan values. If the US Dollar were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2011 would have been $17m lower (2010  $20m), which would be recognised through the hedging reserve. Similarly, if the Euro were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2011 would have been $24m_higher (2010  $19m). A 10% strengthening of the US Dollar or Euro against all other currencies at 31 December 2011 would have had the equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant. Since it is the Groups policy to hedge all actual foreign exchange exposures and the Groups forward foreign exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, the net impact of transaction related foreign exchange on the income statement from a movement in exchange rates on the value of forward foreign exchange contracts is not significant. 16.2 Interest rate exposures The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on cash, borrowings and currency swaps which are all at floating rates. The Group uses floating to fixed interest swaps to meet its objective of protecting borrowing costs within parameters set by the Board. Interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges and, as such, changes in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates are recognised in other comprehensive income, with the fair value of the interest rate swaps recorded in the balance sheet. The cash flows resulting from interest rate swaps match cash flows on the underlying borrowings so that there is no net cash flow from movements in market interest rates on the hedged items. At 31 December 2011 the Group had no interest rate swaps, at 31_December 2010 interest rates had been fixed on borrowings totalling $98m for a period of six months and $112m for a period of one year. Based on the Groups gross borrowings as at 31 December 2011, if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points in all currencies then the annual net interest charge would increase by $4m (2010  $5m). Excluding the impact of the Groups interest rate hedges, the increase in the interest charge would be $4m (2010  $7m). A decrease in interest rates by 100 basis points in all currencies would have an equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above. 16.3 Credit risk exposures The Group limits exposure to credit risk on counterparties used for financial instruments through a system of internal credit limits which, with certain minor exceptions due to local market conditions, require counterparties to have a minimum A rating from one of the major ratings agencies. The financial exposure of a counterparty is determined as the total of cash and deposits, plus the risk on derivative instruments, assessed as the fair value of the instrument plus a risk element based on the nominal value and the historic volatility of the market value of the instrument. The Group does not anticipate non-performance of counterparties and believes it is not subject to material concentration of credit risk as the Group operates within a policy of counterparty limits designed to reduce exposure to any single counterparty. The maximum credit risk exposure on derivatives at 31 December 2011 was $21m (2010  $23m), being the total debit fair values on forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and currency swaps. The maximum credit risk exposure on cash and bank at 31 December 2011 was $184m (2010  $207m). The Groups exposure to credit risk is not material as the amounts are held in a wide number of banks in a number of different countries. Credit risk on trade receivables is detailed in Note 13. 108 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information 16.4 Currency and interest rate profile of interest bearing liabilities and assets Short-term debtors and creditors are excluded from the following disclosures.

In 2011, the Group also had liabilities due for deferred acquisition consideration (denominated in US Dollars, Euro and Yen) totalling $11m (2010  $nil, 2009  $46m) on which no interest was payable (see Note 14). There are no other significant interest bearing financial liabilities. Floating rates on liabilities are typically based on the one or three-month LIBOR interest rate relevant to the currency concerned. The weighted average interest rate on floating rate borrowings as at 31 December 2011 was 2% (2010  1%).

Forward foreign exchange contracts are recorded at fair value. These are regarded as Level 2 financial instruments measured at fair value. Level 2 financial investments are defined as: Valuation techniques for which all observable inputs have a significant effect on the recorded fair values, either directly or indirectly. The Group only has Level 2 financial instruments measured at fair value. The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. Derivatives valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves. 109 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Notes to the Group accounts continued As at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010, the mark-to-market value of a derivative asset position is net of a credit valuation adjustment attributable to derivative counterparty default risk. The changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness for derivatives designated in hedge relationships and other financial instruments recognised at fair value. Long-term borrowings are measured in the balance sheet at amortised cost. As the Groups long-term borrowings are not quoted publicly and as market prices are not available their fair values are estimated by discounting future contractual cash flows to net present values at the current market interest rates available to the Group for similar financial instruments as at the year-end. At 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010, the fair value of the Groups long-term borrowing was not materially different from amortised cost. 17 Deferred taxation Accounting policy Deferred taxation is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the accounts and the corresponding tax bases used in computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of investments in subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that this will not reverse in the foreseeable future; on the initial recognition of non-deductible goodwill; and on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, does not affect the accounting or taxable profit. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Their carrying amount is reviewed at each balance sheet date on the same basis. Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis, and at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled. It is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or equity respectively. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority, when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment. 2011$ million 2010$ million Deferred tax assets 223 224 Deferred tax liabilities (66 ) (69 ) Net position at 31 December 157 155 The movement in the year in the Groups net deferred tax position was as follows: Notes 2011$ million 2010$ million At 1 January 155 171 Exchange adjustment (1 ) (1 ) Movement in income statement  current year (15 ) (4 ) Movement in income statement  prior years 3 (4 ) Movement in other comprehensive income 24 (7 ) Movement in shareholders equity (2 )  Transfers (7 )  At 31 December 157 155 110 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Movements in the main components of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows: Retirementbenefitobligation$ million Macro-texturedclaim$ million Other$ million Total$ million Deferred tax assets: At 1 January 2010 54 52 96 202 Exchange adjustment   1 1 Movement in income statement  current year (5 )  18 13 Movement in income statement  prior years   (1 ) (1 ) Movement in other comprehensive income 6   6 Transfers (1 )  4 3 At 31 December 2010 54 52 118 224 Exchange adjustment   (2 ) (2 ) Movement in income statement  current year (7 )  (11 ) (18 ) Movement in income statement  prior years   (2 ) (2 ) Movement in other comprehensive income 31   31 Charge to equity   (1 ) (1 ) Transfers 1  (10 ) (9 ) At 31 December 2011 79 52 92 223 The Group has unused tax losses of $29m (2010  $21m) available for offset against future profits.

Provision is made for loss contingencies when it is deemed probable that an adverse outcome will occur and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Where the Group is the plaintiff in pursuing claims against third parties legal and associated expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred. Contingent assets are not recognised in the accounts unless they are virtually certain of being realised. The recognition of provisions for legal disputes is subject to a significant degree of estimation. In making its estimates management takes into account the advice of internal and external legal counsel. Provisions are reviewed regularly and amounts updated where necessary to reflect developments in the disputes. The ultimate liability may differ from the amount provided depending on the outcome of court proceedings and settlement negotiations or as new facts emerge. A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. For the purposes of calculating any onerous lease provision, the Group has taken the discounted future lease payments, net of expected rental income. Before a provision is established, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. 18.1 Provisions Rationalisationprovisions$ million Legal andother provision$ million Total$ million At 1 January 2011 14 96 110 Charge to income statement 22 44 66 Utilisation/Released (10 ) (43 ) (53 ) At 31 December 2011 26 97 123 Provisions  due within one year 26 52 78 Provisions  due after one year  45 45 At 31 December 2011 26 97 123 Provisions  due within one year 14 23 37 Provisions  due after one year  73 73 At 31 December 2010 14 96 110 The principal provisions within rationalisation provisions relate to the rationalisation of operational sites (mainly severance and legal costs) arising from the legacy earnings improvement programme and people costs associated with the structural and process changes announced in August 2011. Included within the legal and other provision is:  $17m (2010  $20m) relating to the declination of insurance coverage for macrotextured knee revisions (see Note 18.2).  $23m (2010  $nil) in connection with the previously disclosed investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) into potential violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the medical devices industry. On 6 February 2012, Smith & Nephew announced that it had reached settlement with the SEC and DOJ in connection with this matter. Smith & Nephew has committed to pay approximately $23m in fines and profit disgorgement, maintain an enhanced compliance programme, and appoint an independent monitor for at least 18 months to review and report on its compliance programme.  The remaining balance largely represents provisions for various litigation and patent disputes. All provisions are expected to be substantially utilised within three years of 31 December 2011 and none are treated as financial instruments. 18.2 Contingencies The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings, some of which include claims for substantial damages. The outcome of these proceedings cannot readily be foreseen, but management believes none of them will result in a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group. The Group provides for outcomes that are deemed to be probable and can be reliably estimated. There is no assurance that losses will not exceed provisions or will not have a significant impact on the Groups results of operations in the period in which they are realised. 112 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information In August 2003, the Group withdrew voluntarily from all markets the macrotextured versions of its OXINIUM femoral knee components. A number of related claims have been filed, most of which have been settled. The aggregate cost at 31 December 2011 related to this matter is approximately $214m. The Group has sought recovery from its primary and excess insurers for costs of resolving the claims. The primary insurance carrier has paid $60m in full settlement of its policy liability. However, the excess carriers have denied coverage, citing defences relating to the wording of the insurance policies and other matters. In December 2004, the Group brought suit against them in the US District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, and trial is expected to commence in 2013. An additional $22m was received from a successful settlement with a third party. A charge of $154m was recorded in 2004 for anticipated expenses in connection with macrotexture claims. Most of that amount has since been applied to settlements of such claims. Management believes that the $17m provision remaining is adequate to cover remaining claims. Given the uncertainty inherent in such matters, there can be no assurance on this point. The Group is engaged, as both plaintiff and defendant, in litigation with various competitors and others over claims of patent infringement and, in some cases, breach of licence agreement. These disputes are being heard in courts in the United States and other jurisdictions and also before agencies that examine patents. Outcomes are rarely certain with costs and settlements often significant. 19 Retirement benefit obligations Accounting policy The Groups major pension plans are of the defined benefit type. For these plans, the employers portion of past and current service cost is charged to operating profit, with the interest cost net of expected return on assets in the plans reported within other finance income/(costs). Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in full directly in other comprehensive income such that the balance sheet reflects the plans surpluses or deficits as at the balance sheet date. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by external actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows using interest rates that reference high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. A number of key assumptions have to be made in calculating the fair value of the Groups defined benefit pension plans. These assumptions impact the balance sheet assets and liabilities, operating profit and finance income/(costs). The most critical assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and mortality assumptions to be applied to future pension plan liabilities. The most important assumption for the plan assets is the future expected return. In determining these assumptions management takes into account the advice of professional external actuaries and benchmarks its assumptions against external data. Where defined contribution plans operate, the contributions to these plans are charged to operating profit as they become payable. 19.1 Retirement benefit obligations The Groups retirement benefit obligations comprise: 2011$ million 2010$ million Funded Plans: UK Plan 24 59 US Plan 168 110 Other Plans (i) 33 36 225 205 Unfunded Plans: Other Plans (i) 24 22 Retirement Healthcare 38 35 287 262 (i) The analysis in this note for Other Plans combines both the funded and unfunded retirement benefit obligations. The Group sponsors pension plans for its employees in most of the countries in which it has major operating companies. Pension plans are established under the laws of the relevant country. Funded plans are funded by the payment of contributions to, and the assets held by, separate trust funds or insurance companies. In those countries where there is no company-sponsored pension plan, state benefits are considered adequate. Employees retirement benefits are the subject of regular management review. The Groups major defined benefit pension plans in the UK and US were closed to new employees in 2003 and replaced by defined contribution plans. Defined benefit plans provide employees with an entitlement to retirement benefits varying between 1.3% and 66.7% of final salary on attainment of retirement age. The level of entitlement is dependent on the years of service of the employee. The present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related current service cost are measured using the projected unit method. Under the projected unit method, the current service cost will increase as the members of the defined benefit plans approach retirement. The principal actuarial assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in valuing the major plans in the United Kingdom (UK Plan), the United States (US Plan) and all other plans (Other Plans) and a breakdown of the pension costs charged to income are as follows: 113 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Notes to the Group accounts continued 19.2 Principal actuarial assumptions: 2011 2010% per annum 2009 UK Plan: Discount rate 4.9 5.5 5.7 Expected return on plan assets (i) 5.1 5.9 6.4 Expected rate of salary increases 5.1 5.5 5.6 Future pension increases 3.1 3.5 3.6 Inflation (RPI) 3.1 3.5 3.6 Inflation (CPI) 2.1 3.0 N/A Life expectancy of male aged 60 (in years) 28.6 28.2 28.1 Life expectancy of male aged 60 in 20 years time (in years) 31.0 31.5 31.3 US Plan: Discount rate 4.6 5.6 6.0 Expected return on plan assets (i) 7.1 7.5 7.5 Expected rate of salary increases 4.5 4.7 4.7 Future pension increases    Inflation 2.5 2.7 2.7 Life expectancy of male aged 60 (in years) 22.8 22.8 23.0 Life expectancy of male aged 60 in 20 years time (in years) 24.5 24.7 25.8 Other Plans: Discount rate (ii) 3.9 4.2 4.6 Expected return on plan assets (i) (ii) 4.5 5.1 5.0 Expected rate of salary increases (ii) 3.3 3.0 3.3 Future pension increases (ii) 2.2 2.3 1.9 Inflation (ii) 1.9 2.1 1.0 (i) The assumption for the expected return on plan assets has been determined using a combination of past experience and market expectations.

The interest cost and expected return on plan assets are reported as other finance costs. The total cost charged to income in respect of the Groups defined contribution plans represents contributions payable to these plans by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans. As at 31 December 2011, there were $nil outstanding payments due to be paid over to the plans (2010  $nil, 2009  $nil). 114 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information 19.4 Actuarial (losses)/gains recognised in Group Statement of Comprehensive Income: 2011$ million 2010$ million 2009$ million Experience gains in pension scheme assets 9 34 71 Experience gains on scheme liabilities  21 17 Losses due to changes in assumptions underlying scheme liabilities (79 ) (29 ) (47 ) (70 ) 26 41 The actuarial losses of $70m (2010  gain of $26m, 2009  gain of $41m) were reported in the statement of other comprehensive income making the cumulative charge to date $298m (2010  $228m, 2009  $254m). The contributions made in the year in respect of defined benefit plans were: UK Plan $37m (2010  $37m, 2009  $19m); US Plan $30m (2010  $20m, 2009  $14m); and Other Plans $9m (2010  $8m, 2009  $8m). The agreed contributions for 2012 in respect of the Groups defined benefit plans are: $37m for the UK Plan (including $29m of supplementary payments), $27m for the US Plan and $7m for other defined benefit plans. 19.5 Scheme assets The amount included in the balance sheet arising from the Groups obligations in respect of its defined benefit retirement plans and the expected rates of return on investments were: UK Plan US Plan Other Plans Rate ofReturn % Value$ million Rate ofReturn % Value$ million Rate ofReturn % Value$ million 31 December 2011 Equities 7.2 248 8.8 196 8.2 6 Bonds 3.2 353 3.0 93 3.3 42 Other 6.7 55 2.3 9 4.5 61 Market value of assets 656 298 109 Present value of defined benefit obligations (680 ) (466 ) (166 ) Deficit: non-current liability recognised in the balance sheet (24 ) (168 ) (57 ) 31 December 2010 Equities 7.4 324 8.4 192 8.3 33 Bonds 4.0 262 4.2 70 4.5 33 Property     5.8 5 Other 4.1 9 2.8 10 4.1 29 Market value of assets 595 272 100 Present value of defined benefit obligations (654 ) (382 ) (158 ) Deficit: non-current liability recognised in the balance sheet (59 ) (110 ) (58 ) The following tables set out the pension plan asset allocations in the funded UK, US and Other Plans as at 31 December for the last two years: UK Plan US Plan Other Plans % 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 Asset Category: Equity securities 38 55 66 71 6 33 Debt securities 54 44 31 26 38 33 Property      5 Other 8 1 3 3 56 29 Total 100 100 100 100 100 100 115 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Notes to Group accounts continued A reconciliation of the fair value of plan assets is shown in the following tables: UK Plan$ million US Plan$ million OtherPlans$ million RetirementHealthcare$ million Total$ million Fair value of plan assets at 1 January 2010 534 234 87  855 Expected return on plan assets 33 17 5  55 Settlements to members   (2 )  (2 ) Experience gains/(losses) on plan assets 26 11 (3 )  34 Plan participant contributions 2  6  8 Company contributions 37 20 8  65 Benefits paid (21 ) (10 ) (5 )  (36 ) Exchange adjustment (16 )  4  (12 ) Fair value of plan assets at 31 December 2010 595 272 100  967 Expected return on plan assets 35 19 5  59 Experience gains/(losses) on plan assets 20 (12 ) 1  9 Plan participant contributions 1  3  4 Company contributions 37 30 9  76 Benefits paid (23 ) (11 ) (6 )  (40 ) Exchange adjustment (9 )  (3 )  (12 ) Fair value of plan assets at 31 December 2011 656 298 109  1,063 19.6 Present value of defined benefit obligations A reconciliation of the present value of defined benefit obligations is shown in the following tables: UK Plan$ million US Plan$ million OtherPlans$ million RetirementHealthcare$ million Total$ million Present value of defined benefit obligations at 1 January 2010 668 343 137 29 1,177 Current service cost 9 8 9  26 Settlements to members   (2 )  (2 ) Other finance cost 36 20 6 2 64 Experience (gains)/losses on plan liabilities (21 ) 2 (2 )  (21 ) Losses on change of assumptions 1 19 4 5 29 Plan participant contributions 2  6  8 Benefits paid (21 ) (10 ) (5 ) (1 ) (37 ) Exchange adjustment (20 )  5  (15 ) Present value of defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2010 654 382 158 35 1,229 Current service cost 10 9 9  28 Other finance cost 36 21 7 2 66 Experience losses/(gains) on plan liabilities 6 (1 ) (3 ) (2 )  Losses on change of assumptions 6 66 2 5 79 Plan participant contributions 1  3  4 Benefits paid (23 ) (11 ) (6 )  (40 ) Benefits paid directly by employer (1 )   (2 ) (3 ) Exchange adjustment (9 )  (4 )  (13 ) Present value of defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2011 680 466 166 38 1,350 116 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information 19.7 History of experience adjustments The history of experience adjustments is as follows: Experience(losses)/gains on plan liabilities Experiencegains/(losses) on planassets Present value of Definedbenefitobligations$ million Fair value ofplan assets$ million Deficit inplan$ million Amount gain/(loss)$ million Percentageof planliabilities% Amount gain/(loss)$ million Percentageof planassets% At 31 December 2011: UK Plan (680 ) 656 (24 ) (6 ) 1 20 3 US Plan (466 ) 298 (168 ) 1  (12 ) 4 Other Plans (166 ) 109 (57 ) 3 2 1 1 At 31 December 2010: UK Plan (654 ) 595 (59 ) 21 3 26 4 US Plan (382 ) 272 (110 ) (2 )  11 4 Other Plans (158 ) 100 (58 ) 2 1 (3 ) 3 At 31 December 2009: UK Plan (668 ) 534 (134 ) 10 2 36 7 US Plan (343 ) 234 (109 )   34 15 Other Plans (137 ) 87 (50 ) 7 5 1 1 At 31 December 2008: UK Plan (516 ) 416 (100 ) 1  (126 ) 30 US Plan (337 ) 180 (157 ) (5 ) 1 (100 ) 56 Other Plans (141 ) 76 (65 ) 5 4 (10 ) 13 At 31 December 2007: UK Plan (753 ) 673 (80 )   8 1 US Plan (283 ) 256 (27 ) 1  (5 ) 2 Other Plans (145 ) 98 (47 ) (1 ) 1 12 12 The Group recharges the UK pension plan with the costs of administration and independent advisers.

The amount receivable at 31 December 2011 was $nil (2010  $nil, 2009  $nil). 19.8 Retirement healthcare The cost of providing healthcare benefits after retirement is determined by independent actuaries. The principal actuarial assumptions in determining the cost of providing healthcare benefits are those in the UK and the US and are as follows: 2011 2010 2009 % per annum UK US UK US UK US Discount rate 4.9 4.6 5.5 5.6 5.7 6.0 Medical cost inflation 7.0 8.0 7.0 8.0 7.0 8.0 A one percentage point change in the rate of medical cost inflation would not affect the accumulated retirement benefit obligations, or the aggregate of the current service and interest costs, of the UK or US plans in 2011 by more than $2m (2010  more than $2m, 2009  more than $2m). For the US the retirement healthcare cost trend for 2012 is expected to be 3.4% above the discount rate. Thereafter the healthcare cost trend rate is assumed to decrease by 0.5% per year to an ultimate rate of 5%. For the UK it will remain flat at 7%. 117 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Notes to Group accounts continued 20 Equity 20.1 Share capital Ordinary Shares Deferred Shares (20¢) (£1.00) Total Thousand $ million Thousand $ million $ million Authorised At 31 December 2009 1,223,591 245 50  245 At 31 December 2010 1,223,591 245 50  245 At 31 December 2011 1,223,591 245 50  245 Allotted, issued and fully paid At 1 January 2009 949,890 190 50  190 Share options 1,131     At 31 December 2009 951,021 190 50  190 Share options 1,816 1   1 At 31 December 2010 952,837 191 50  191 Share options 1,991     At 31 December 2011 954,828 191 50  191 The deferred shares were issued in 2006 in order to comply with English Company law. They are not listed on any stock exchange and have extremely limited rights and effectively have no value. These rights are summarised as follows:  The holder shall not be entitled to participate in the profits of the Company;  The holder shall not have any right to participate in any distribution of the Companys assets on a winding up or other distribution except that after the return of the nominal amount paid up on each share in the capital of the Company of any class other than the Deferred Shares and the distribution of a further $1,000 in respect of each such share there shall be distributed to a holder of a Deferred Share (for each Deferred Share held by him) an amount equal to the nominal value of the Deferred Share;  The holder shall not be entitled to receive notice, attend, speak or vote at any general meeting of the Company; and  The Company may create, allot and issue further shares or reduce or repay the whole or any part of its share capital or other capital reserves without obtaining the consent of the holders of the Deferred Shares. The Groups objectives when managing capital are to ensure the Group has adequate funds to continue as a going concern and sufficient flexibility within the capital structure to fund the on-going growth of the business and to take advantage of business development opportunities including acquisitions. The Group determines the amount of capital taking into account changes in business risks and future cash requirements. The Group reviews its capital structure on an on-going basis and uses share buy-backs, dividends and the issue of new shares to adjust the retained capital. The Group considers the capital that it manages to be as follows: 2011$ million 2010$ million 2009$ million Share capital 191 191 190 Share premium 413 396 382 Treasury shares (766 ) (778 ) (794 ) Retained earnings and other reserves 3,349 2,964 2,401 3,187 2,773 2,179 118 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information 20.2 Treasury shares Treasury shares represents the holding of the Companys own shares in respect of the Smith & Nephew Employees Share Trust and shares bought back as part of the share buy-back programme, which was suspended in 2008. The Smith & Nephew 2004 Employees Share Trust (Trust) was established to hold shares relating to the long-term incentive plans referred to in the Directors Remuneration Report. The Trust is administered by an independent professional trust company resident in Jersey and is funded by a loan from the Company. The cost of the Trust is charged to the income statement as it accrues. A partial dividend waiver is in place in respect of those shares held under the long-term incentive plans. The trust only accepts dividends in respect of nil-cost options and deferred bonus plan shares. The waiver represents less than 1% of the total dividends paid.

The fair value of assets includes the taxation benefits resulting from amortisation for income taxation purposes from which a third party separately acquiring the assets would reasonably be expected to benefit. Goodwill, representing the excess of purchase consideration over the Groups share of the fair value of net assets acquired, is capitalised.

On 22 December 2009, the Group acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Nucryst Pharmaceuticals, Corp, which manufactures and licences exclusively to the Group our range of ACTICOAT products, using its nanocrystalline silver technology, SILCRYST. Under the agreement the Group acquired the manufacturing assets from Nucrysts operations in Canada and intellectual property rights relating to the nanocrystalline silver technology used in the manufacture of ACTICOAT product range. Nucryst has manufactured ACTICOAT products for Smith & Nephew since the Groups ascquisition of the product right in 2001.

As the Group was the only material customer of Nucryst Pharmaceuticals, Corp., no contribution to revenue was achieved in 2009. The post-acquisition contribution to attributable profit for 2009 was immaterial. 22.2 Assets held for sale The Group has classified following assets as held for sale: 2011$ million 2010$ million Goodwill 37  Intangible assets 14  Property, plant and equipment 3  Deferred tax assets 7  Inventory 15  Trade and other receivables 49  125  Liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale 19  The Group has announced its intention to dispose of the Clinical Therapies business to an entity in which Smith & Nephew will retain an investment as an associate. The assets and liabilities of the Clinical Therapies business have been classified as held for sale, their net realisable value is estimated to be greater than their net book value. In 2011, this business contributed $237m to revenue and $48m to trading profit. The transaction is expected to complete during the first half of 2012. On completion of this transaction, the Group expects to recognise a profit before taxation in excess of $250m. As part of this disposal the Group commitment of $60m detailed in Note 9 will be transferred to the associate. 23 Operating leases Accounting policy Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Rentals payable under operating leases are expensed in the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases fall due as follows: 2011 2010 $ million $ million Land and buildings: Within one year 31 30 After one and within two years 22 25 After two and within three years 18 19 After three and within four years 15 18 After four and within five years 11 14 After five years 13 21 110 127 Other assets: Within one year 19 23 After one and within two years 12 10 After two and within three years 6 5 After three and within four years 2 1 39 39 122 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information 24 Other Notes to the accounts 24.1 Share based payments Accounting policy The Group operates a number of equity-settled executive and employee share plans. For all grants of share options and awards, the fair value at the grant date is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the corresponding expense is recognised over the vesting period. Employee plans The Smith & Nephew Sharesave Plan (2002) (adopted by shareholders on 3 April 2002) (the Save As You Earn (SAYE) plan) is available to all employees in the UK employed by participating Group companies, subject to three months service. The scheme provides for employees to save up to £250 per month and gives them an option to acquire shares based on the committed amount to be saved. The option price is not less than 80% of the average of middle market quotations of the Ordinary Shares on the three dealing days preceding the date of invitation. The Smith & Nephew International Sharesave Plan (2002) is offered to employees in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates. Employees in Italy, the Netherlands and France are able to participate respectively in the Smith & Nephew Italian Sharesave Plan (2002), the Smith & Nephew Dutch Sharesave Plan (2002) and the Smith & Nephew France Sharesave Plan (2002). Participants in Ireland are able to participate in the Smith & Nephew Irish Employee Share Option Scheme. These plans operate on a substantially similar basis to the Smith & Nephew Sharesave Plan (2002). Together all of the plans referred to above are termed the Employee Plans. These plans have now reached the end of their ten year life and resolutions will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 12 April 2012 to renew these plans. Employees in the US are able to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which gives them the opportunity to acquire shares, in the form of ADSs, at a discount of 15% (or more if the shares appreciate in value during the plans quarterly purchase period) to the market price, through a regular savings plan. Executive plans The Smith & Nephew 2001 UK Approved Share Option Plan, the Smith & Nephew 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan, the Smith & Nephew 2001 US Share Plan (adopted by shareholders on 4 April 2001), the Smith & Nephew 2004 Executive Share Option Plan (adopted by shareholders on 6 May 2004) and the Smith & Nephew Global Share Plan 2010 (adopted by shareholders on 6 May 2010) are together termed the Executive Plans. Under the terms of the Executive Plans, the Remuneration Committee, consisting of Non-Executive Directors, may at their discretion approve the grant of options to employees of the Group to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company. Options granted under the Smith & Nephew 2001 US Share Plan (the US Plan) and the Smith & Nephew 2004 Executive Share Option Plan are to acquire ADSs or Ordinary Shares. For Executive Plans adopted in 2001 and 2004, the market value is the average quoted price of an Ordinary Share for the three business days preceding the date of grant or the average quoted price of an ADS or Ordinary Share, for the three business days preceding the date of grant or the quoted price on the date of grant if higher. For the Global Share Plan adopted in 2010 the market value is the closing price of an Ordinary Share or ADS on the last trading day prior to the grant date. With the exception of options granted under the 2001 US Plan and the Global Share Plan 2010, the vesting of options granted from 2001 are subject to achievement of a performance condition. Options granted under the 2001 US Plan and the Global Share Plan 2010 are not subject to any performance conditions. Prior to 2008, the 2001 US Plan options became cumulatively exercisable as to 10% after one year, 30% after two years, 60% after three years and the remaining balance after four years. With effect from 2008, options granted under the 2001 US Plan became cumulatively exercisable as to 33.3% after one year, 66.7% after two years and the remaining balance after the third year. The 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan was open to certain employees outside the US and the US Plan is open to certain employees in the US, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico. The Global Share Plan 2010 is open to employees globally. The 2004 Plan is open to Executive Directors only. The maximum term of options granted, under all plans, is 10 years from the date of grant. All share option plans are settled in shares. 123 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Notes to the Group accounts continued At 31 December 2011 27,316,000 (2010  25,753,000, 2009  23,383,000) options were outstanding under share option plans as follows: Number ofsharesThousand Range of optionexercise pricesPence Weighted averageexercise pricePence Employee Plans: Outstanding at 1 January 2009 3,533 321.0  640.0 427.4 Granted 1,563 380.0  519.0 381.6 Forfeited (680) 321.0  640.0 436.1 Exercised (1,029) 321.0  507.0 362.7 Expired (4) 321.0  600.5 427.9 Outstanding at 31 December 2009 3,383 348.0  640.0 422.7 Granted 986 459.0  556.0 462.2 Forfeited (364) 348.0  609.0 439.8 Exercised (625) 348.0  576.5 435.2 Expired (22) 348.0  640.0 431.7 Outstanding at 31 December 2010 3,358 348.0  640.0 430.1 Granted 1,090 452.0  585.0 454.8 Forfeited (122) 348.0  609.0 427.6 Exercised (602) 348.0  576.5 454.7 Expired (144) 380.0  609.0 450.7 Outstanding at 31 December 2011 3,580 348.0  640.0 432.8 Options exercisable at 31 December 2011 122 348.0  640.0 470.8 Options exercisable at 31 December 2010 87 425.0  576.5 466.5 Options exercisable at 31 December 2009 109 348.0  498.0 362.4 Executive Plans: Outstanding at 1 January 2009 18,148 183.5  680.5 592.5 Granted 5,849 448.0  595.0 477.0 Forfeited (1,348) 409.5  680.5 565.9 Exercised (1,754) 183.5  637.8 428.3 Expired (895) 185.8  574.5 492.8 Outstanding at 31 December 2009 20,000 265.0  637.5 547.1 Granted 6,249 424.0  675.0 520.9 Forfeited (977) 479.0  680.5 581.3 Exercised (2,386) 265.0  637.5 479.2 Expired (491) 418.0  637.8 575.6 Outstanding at 31 December 2010 22,395 409.5  680.5 544.9 Granted 5,706 580.0  703.0 599.4 Forfeited (763) 479.0  637.8 565.5 Exercised (2,369) 445.0  680.5 536.6 Expired (1,233) 445.0  637.8 549.7 Outstanding at 31 December 2011 23,736 409.5  703.0 561.2 Options exercisable at 31 December 2011 7,979 409.5  680.5 595.6 Options exercisable at 31 December 2010 5,153 409.5  627.0 548.3 Options exercisable at 31 December 2009 6,668 265.0  637.5 532.0 The weighted average remaining contractual life of options outstanding at 31 December 2011 was 6.6 (2010  6.1 years, 2009  5.9 years) years for Executive Plans and 2.6 (2010  2.7 years, 2009  2.7 years) years for Employee Plans. 2011pence 2010pence 2009pence Weighted average share price 639.9 619.3 504.0 124 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Options granted during the year were as follows: OptionsgrantedThousand Weightedaverage fairvalue peroption atgrant datePence Weightedaverageshareprice atgrant datePence WeightedaverageexercisepricePence Weightedaverageoption lifeYears Employee Plans 1,090 189.2 591.0 454.8 3.9 Executive Plans 5,706 176.1 609.0 599.4 10.0 The weighted average fair value of options granted under employee plans during 2010 was 170.2p (2009  212.0p) and those under executive plans during 2010 was 173.7p (2009  147.9p). Options granted under the executive plans are valued using a binomial model. Options granted under employee plans are valued using the Black-Scholes option model as management consider that options granted under these plans are exercised within a short period of time after the vesting date. Options granted under each plans are valued separately and a weighted average fair value calculated. The binomial model is used for executive plans so that proper allowance is made for the possibility of early exercise. At the 2011 grant management expected 90% of the options granted under the Global Share Plan 2010 to vest (2010  90%, 2009  n/a), 90% of the 2004 Executive Scheme to vest (2010  90%, 2009  60%). Each year an assessment is made of the current vesting estimates and they are updated to reflect revised expectations of the number of grants that will vest. For all plans the inputs to the option pricing models are reassessed for each grant. The following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of options granted: Employee plans Executive plans 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Dividend yield (%) 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 Expected volatility (%) (i) 30.0 30.0 30.0 30 30.0 30.0 Risk free interest rate (%) (ii) 2.0 2.5 3.3 2.0 2.5 3.3 Expected life in years (iii) 3.9 3.9 3.9 10.0 9.8 6.8 (i) Volatility is assessed on a historic basis primarily based on past share price movements over the expected life of the options. (ii) The risk free interest rate reflects the yields available on zero coupon government bonds over the option term and currency. (iii) An assessment of an Executive Plans option life is based on an exercise model. This is based on a mixture of historic experience and generally accepted behavioural traits. 5% (2010  5%, 2009  5%) of Executive Plan option holders are assumed to leave and exercise their options (or forfeit them if under water) each year after vesting. In addition, 50% (2010  50%, 2009  50%) of Executive Plan option holders are assumed to exercise by choice per annum providing the gain available is at least 50% for the options granted to executives and 25% for other recipients under the Global Share Plan 2010 (2010  50% for the 2004 Plan and 50% for the options granted to executives and 25% for other recipients under the Global Share Plan 2010, 2009  50% for the 2004 Plan and 25% for the 2001 Plans).

This was materially the same as intrinsic value. 125 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Notes to the Group accounts continued Share based payments  long-term incentive plans In 2004, a share based incentive plan was introduced for Executive Directors, executive officers and the next level of senior executives, which replaced the Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The plan includes a Performance Share Plan (PSP) and a Bonus Co-Investment Plan (CIP). Vesting of the PSP award shares is dependent upon performance relative to the FTSE 100 and an index based on major international companies in the medical devices industry. Under the CIP, participants could elect to use up to a maximum of one-half of their annual bonus to purchase shares. If the shares are held for three years and the Groups EPSA growth targets are achieved participants receive an award of matching shares for each share purchased. From 2009, the CIP was replaced by the Deferred Bonus Plan. This plan is designed to encourage executives to build up and maintain a significant shareholding in the Company. Under the plan, up to one third of any bonus earned at target level or above by an eligible employee will be compulsorily deferred into shares which vest, subject to continued employment, in equal annual tranches over three years (i.e. one third each year). No further performance conditions will apply to the deferred shares. From 2010, Performance Share awards are granted under the Global Share Plan 2010 for all executives other than Executive Directors. Awards granted under both plans are combined to provide the figures below. Vesting of the share awards is dependent upon performance relative to the FTSE 100 and an index based on major international companies in the medical devices industry. The fair values of awards granted under long-term incentive plans are calculated using a binomial model. The exercise price for all awards granted under the long term incentive plans is $nil. Performance Share awards under both the PSP and Global Share Plan 2010 contain vesting conditions based on TSR versus a comparator group which represent market-based performance conditions for valuation purposes and an assessment of vesting probability is therefore factored into the award date calculations. The assumptions include the volatilities for the comparator groups. Given the wide range of companies within the FTSE 100 a correlation of 40% (2010  35%, 2009  30%) has been assumed with the constituents of the group. A correlation of 40% (2010  35%, 2009  30%) has also been assumed for the companies in the medical devices sector as they are impacted by similar factors. The Performance Target for the Global Share Plan 2010 is a combination of EPSA growth and the Groups Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance over the three year performance period. The other assumptions used are consistent with the executive scheme assumptions disclosed in Note 24.1 (a). At 31 December 2011 the maximum number of shares that could be awarded under the Groups long-term incentive plans was: Other Awards PSP CIP DeferredBonus Plan Total Number of shares in thousands Outstanding at 1 January 2009  3,817 750  4,567 Awarded  2,372  305 2,677 Vested  (334) (99) (7) (440) Forfeited  (975) (206) (6) (1,187) Outstanding at 31 December 2009  4,880 445 292 5,617 Awarded  2,386  338 2,724 Vested  (501) (116) (101) (718) Forfeited  (753) (132) (7) (892) Outstanding at 31 December 2010  6,012 197 522 6,731 Awarded 838 2,282  351 3,471 Vested (44) (366)  (375) (785) Forfeited  (1,660) (197) (6) (1,863) Outstanding at 31 December 2011 794 6,268  492 7,554 Other Awards mainly comprises of conditional share awards granted under the Global Share Plan 2010. The weighted average remaining contractual life of awards outstanding at 31 December 2011 was 1.2 years (2010  1.8 years, 2009  1.8 years) for the PSP, 1.7 years (2010  1.9 years, 2009  2.2 years) for the Deferred Bonus Plan and 1.5 years for the other awards. There were no awards outstanding under the CIP, the remaining contractual life of awards under the CIP was 0.2 years for 2010 and 0.7 years for 2009.

The total number of Ordinary Shares which may be issuable in any ten-year period under all share plans operated by the Company may not exceed 10% of the Ordinary Share capital at the date of grant. 24.2 Related party transactions Trading transactions In the course of normal operations, the Group traded with its associates detailed in Note 11.

As consolidated financial information has been disclosed under IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, the Company is exempt from FRS 29, Financial Instruments: Disclosures. The Group accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and are presented on pages 84 to 128. The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 8, Related Party Disclosures not to present its related party disclosures as the Group accounts contain these disclosures. In addition, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 1, Cash Flow Statements not to present its own cash flow statement as the Group accounts contain a consolidated cash flow. In applying these policies management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All exchange differences are dealt with in arriving at profit before taxation. Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, tax. Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse. These are based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 2 Results for the year As permitted by section 408(4) of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account. Profit for the year was $166m (2010: $157m). 3 Investments Accounting policy Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for impairment. $ million At 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2011 3,598 Investments represent holdings in subsidiary undertakings.

On 6 February 2012, Smith & Nephew announced that it had reached settlement with the SEC in connection with this matter. Smith & Nephew has committed to pay slightly less than $23m in fines and profit disgorgement, maintain an enhanced compliance programme, and appoint an independent monitor for at least 18 months to review and report on its compliance programme. Of this total amount of slightly less than $23m, $5.4m specifically relates to profit disgorgement imposed by the SEC on Smith & Nephew plc. 7 Cash and borrowings Accounting policy Financial instruments Currency swaps are used to match foreign currency net assets with foreign currency liabilities. They are initially recorded at fair value and then for reporting purposes remeasured to fair value at exchange rates and interest rates at subsequent balance sheet dates. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the profit and loss account as they arise. 2011 $ million 2010 $ million Bank loans and overdrafts due within one year or on demand 245 1 Bank loans due after one year  623 Borrowings 245 624 Cash and bank (25) (21) Net debt 220 603 All currency swaps are stated at fair value.

In accordance with the exemption permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account. The attributable profit for the year dealt with in the accounts of the Company is $166m (2010  $157m). Fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP for audit and non-audit services to the Company itself are not disclosed in the individual accounts because group financial statements are prepared which are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated basis. The fees for the consolidated Group are disclosed in Note 3 of the Notes to the Group Accounts. 9 Share based payments The Company operates a number of equity-settled executive and employee share plans. For all grants of share options and awards, the fair value as at the date of grant is calculated using an appropriate option pricing model and the corresponding expense is recognised over the vesting period. Subsidiary companies are recharged for the fair value of share options that relate to their employees. The disclosure relating to the Company is detailed in Note 24 of the Notes to the Group accounts. 10 Contingencies 2011$ million 2010$ million Guarantees in respect of subsidiary undertakings 42 33 The Company has given guarantees to banks to support liabilities under foreign exchange and other contracts and cross guarantees to support overdrafts. Such guarantees are not considered to be liabilities as all subsidiary undertakings are trading as going concerns. The Company operated defined benefit pension plans in 2004 but at the end of 2005 its pension plan obligations were transferred to Smith & Nephew UK Limited. The Company has provided guarantees to the Trustees of the pension plans to support future amounts due from participating employers (see Note 19 of the Notes to the Group Accounts). 133 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Group information Group Information Business overview and Group history 135 Property, plant and equipment 135 Contractual obligations 136 Off balance sheet arrangements 136 Related party transactions 136 134 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Business overview and Group history Smith & Nephews operations are organised into three primary business units that operate globally: Orthopaedics, Endoscopy and Advanced Wound Management. The Group has a history dating back over 150 years to the family enterprise of Thomas James Smith who opened a small pharmacy in Hull, UK in 1856. On his death in 1896, his nephew Horatio Nelson Smith took over the management of the business. By the late 1990s, Smith & Nephew had expanded into being a diverse healthcare conglomerate with operations across the globe, including various medical devices, personal care products and traditional and advanced woundcare treatments. In 1998, Smith & Nephew announced a major restructuring to focus management attention and investment on three global business units  advanced wound management, endoscopy and orthopaedics  which offered high growth and margin opportunities. Smith & Nephew was incorporated and listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1937 and in 1999 the Group was also listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In 2001, Smith & Nephew became a constituent member of the FTSE-100 index in the UK. This means that Smith & Nephew is included in the top 100 companies traded on the London Stock Exchange measured in terms of market capitalisation. Today, Smith & Nephew is a public limited company incorporated and headquartered in the UK and carries out business around the world.

Following the capital restructuring and dividend reduction in 2000 the Group adopted a policy of increasing its dividend cover (the ratio of EPSA, as set out in the Selected financial data, to ordinary dividends declared for the year). This was intended to increase the financing capability of the Group for acquisitions and other investments. From 2000 to 2004 the dividend increased in line with inflation and, in 2004, dividend cover stood at 4.1 times. Having achieved this level of dividend cover the Board changed its policy, from that of increasing dividends in line with inflation, to that of increasing dividends for 2005 and after by 10%. Following the redenomination of the Companys share capital into US Dollars the Board re-affirmed its policy of increasing the dividend by 10% a year in US Dollar terms. An interim dividend in respect of each fiscal year is normally declared in August and paid in November. A final dividend will be recommended by the Board of Directors and paid subject to approval by shareholders at the Companys Annual General Meeting. Future dividends of Smith & Nephew will be dependent upon: future earnings; the future financial condition of the Group; the Boards dividend policy; and the additional factors that might affect the business of the Group set out in Special note regarding forward-looking statements and Risk Factors.

The depositary may generally refuse to provide fee-attracting services until its fee for those services are paid. 141 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Information for shareholders continued Persons depositing or withdrawing shares must pay: For: $5.00 (or less) per 100 ADSs (or portion of 100 ADSs) Issuance of ADSs, including issuances resulting from a distribution of shares or rights or other property Cancellation of ADSs for the purpose of withdrawal, including if the deposit agreement terminates $0.02 (or less) per ADS Any cash distribution to ADS registered holders, including payment of dividend A fee equivalent to the fee that would be payable if securities distributed to holders had been shares and the shares had been deposited for issuance of ADSs Distribution of securities distributed to holders of deposited securities which are distributed by the depositary to ADS registered holders $0.02 (or less) per ADS per calendar year Depositary services Registration or transfer fees Transfer and registration of shares on our share register to or from the name of the depositary or its agent when shares are deposited or withdrawn Taxes and other governmental charges the depositary or the custodian have to pay on any ADS or share underlying an ADS, for example, stock transfer taxes, stamp duty or withholding taxes As necessary Any charges incurred by the depositary or its agents for servicing the deposited securities As necessary A fee of 2 US cents per ADS was paid on the 2010 final dividend and a fee of 1 US cent per ADS was deducted from the 2011 first interim dividend paid in November. In the period 1 January 2011 to 21 February 2012 the total reimbursed by The Bank of New York Mellon was $148,885. 142 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Share capital The principal trading market for the Ordinary Shares is the London Stock Exchange. The Ordinary Shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange on 16 November 1999, trading in the form of ADSs evidenced by ADRs. Each ADS represents five Ordinary Shares. The ADS facility is sponsored by The Bank of New York Mellon acting as depositary. All the Ordinary Shares, including those held by Directors and Executive Officers, rank pari passu with each other. On 23 January 2006 the Ordinary Shares of 12 2/9 pence were redenominated as Ordinary Shares of US 20 cents (following approval by shareholders at the extraordinary general meeting in December 2005). The new US Dollar Ordinary Shares carry the same rights as the previous Ordinary Shares. The share price continues to be quoted in Sterling and the ADSs continue to represent five Ordinary Shares. In 2006 the Company issued £50,000 of shares in Sterling in order to comply with English law. These were issued as Deferred Shares, which are not listed on any stock exchange. They have extremely limited rights and therefore effectively have no value. These shares were allotted to the Chief Executive Officer, although the Board reserves the right to transfer them to another member of the Board should it so wish. Shareholdings As at 21 February 2012, 7,864,895 ADSs equivalent to 39,324,475 Ordinary Shares or approximately 4.1% of the total Ordinary Shares in issue, were outstanding and were held by 93 registered holders. As at 21 February 2012, to the knowledge of the Group, there were 19,830 registered holders of Ordinary Shares, of whom 82 had registered addresses in the US and held a total of 72,735 Ordinary Shares (less than 0.1% of the total issued). Because certain Ordinary Shares are registered in the names of nominees, the number of shareholders with registered addresses in the US is not representative of the number of beneficial owners of Ordinary Shares resident in the US. Major shareholders As far as is known to Smith & Nephew, the Group is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by another corporation or by any government and the Group has not entered into arrangements, the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change in control of the Group. As at 21 February 2012, no persons are known to Smith & Nephew to have any interest (as defined in the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the FSA) in 3% or more of the Ordinary Shares, other than as shown below. The following tables show changes over the last three years in the percentage and numbers of the issued share capital owned by shareholders holding 3% or more of Ordinary Shares, as notified to the Company under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules: 21 February 2012 % As at 31 December2011 % 2010% 2009% Invesco 5.0 5.0   BlackRock, Inc. 5.0 5.0 5.0  Newton Investment Management Limited 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.1 Legal and General Group plc 4.0 4.0 5.0 4.0 Capital Group of Companies Inc.  0.7 5.1 5.1 FMR LLC    3.9 Thornburg Investment Management Inc.   4.1 4.8 21 February 2012000 As at 31 December2011 000 2010000 2009000 Invesco 44,901 44,901   BlackRock, Inc. 44,811 44,811 44,322  Newton Investment Management Limited 44,337 44,337 44,735 45,129 Legal and General Group plc 35,676 35,676 44,704 35,329 Capital Group of Companies Inc.  6,138 44,594 44,594 FMR LLC    34,101 Thornburg Investment Management Inc.   36,164 44,852 In addition to the above, the Company is aware that Walter Scott & Partners Limited held approximately 38m Ordinary Shares (4.2%) at 21 February 2012. The Company is not aware of any person who has a significant direct or indirect holding of securities in the Company, and is not aware of any persons holding securities which may control the Company. There are no securities in issue which have special rights as to the control of the Company. 143 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Share capital continued Purchase of Ordinary Shares on behalf of the Company The share buy-back programme was suspended in November 2008, in light of conditions in the financial markets. The programme is kept under review and, although there is no current intention to re-instate the programme, the Company will seek a renewal of its permission from shareholders to purchase up to 10% of its own shares at the AGM on 12 April 2012. As at 31 December 2011, 68,240,200 (2010  68,240,200) ordinary shares had been purchased under the share buy-back programme that commenced in February 2007. No shares were purchased in 2011, 2010 or 2009. Exchange controls and other limitations affecting security holders There are no UK governmental laws, decrees or regulations that restrict the export or import of capital or that affect the payment of dividends, interest or other payments to non-resident holders of Smith & Nephews securities, except for certain restrictions imposed from time to time by Her Majestys Treasury of the United Kingdom pursuant to legislation, such as the United Nations Act 1946 and the Emergency Laws Act 1964, against the government or residents of certain countries. There are no limitations, either under the laws of the UK or under the articles of association of Smith & Nephew, restricting the right of non-UK residents to hold or to exercise voting rights in respect of Ordinary Shares, except that where any overseas shareholder has not provided to the Company a UK address for the service of notices, the Company is under no obligation to send any notice or other document to an overseas address. It is, however, the current practice of the Company to send every notice or other document to all shareholders regardless of the country recorded in the register of members, with the exception of details of the Companys dividend re-investment plan, which are not sent to shareholders with recorded addresses in the US and Canada. 144 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Selected financial data 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million Income statement Revenue 4,270 3,962 3,772 3,801 3,369 Cost of goods sold (1,140) (1,031) (1,030) (1,077) (994) Gross Profit 3,130 2,931 2,742 2,724 2,375 Selling, general and administrative expenses (2,101 ) (1,860 ) (1,864 ) (1,942 ) (1,740 ) Research and development expenses (167) (151) (155) (152) (142) Operating profit 862 920 723 630 493 Net interest payable (8 ) (15 ) (40 ) (66 ) (30 ) Other finance (costs)/income (6 ) (10 ) (15 ) (1 ) 6 Share of results of associates   2 1  Profit before taxation 848 895 670 564 469 Taxation (266) (280) (198) (187) (153) Attributable profit for the year 582 615 472 377 316 Earnings per Ordinary Share Basic 65.3¢ 69.3¢ 53.4¢ 42.6¢ 34.2¢ Diluted 65.0¢ 69.2¢ 53.3¢ 42.4¢ 34.1¢ Adjusted attributable profit Attributable profit for the year 582 615 472 377 316 Acquisition related costs   26 61 111 Restructuring and rationalisation expenses 40 15 42 34 42 Legal settlement 23    30 Amortisation of acquisition intangibles and impairments 36 34 66 51 30 Taxation on excluded items (17) (10) (26) (30) (49) Adjusted attributable profit 664 654 580 493 480 Adjusted basic earnings per Ordinary Share (EPSA) (i) 74.5¢ 73.6¢ 65.6¢ 55.6¢ 52.0¢ Adjusted diluted earnings per Ordinary Share (ii) 74.2¢ 73.6¢ 65.5¢ 55.4¢ 51.7¢ (i) Adjusted basic earnings per Ordinary Share is calculated by dividing adjusted attributable profit by the average number of shares.

The comments address the material US and UK tax consequences generally applicable to a person who is the beneficial owner of ADSs or Ordinary Shares and who, for US federal income tax purposes, is a citizen or resident of the United States, a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation) created or organised in or under the laws of the United States, or an estate or trust the income of which is included in gross income for US federal income tax purposes regardless of its source (each a US Holder). The comments set out below do not purport to address all tax consequences of the ownership of ADSs or Ordinary Shares which may be material to a particular holder and in particular do not deal with the position of shareholders who directly or indirectly own 10% or more of the Companys issued Ordinary Shares. This discussion does not apply to (i) persons whose holding of ADSs or Ordinary Shares is effectively connected with or pertains to either a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom through which a US Holder carries on a business in the United Kingdom or a fixed base from which a US Holder performs independent personal services in the United Kingdom, or (ii) persons whose registered address is inside the UK. This discussion does not apply to certain investors subject to special rules, such as certain financial institutions, tax-exempt entities, insurance companies, broker-dealers, traders in securities that elect to mark to market, partnerships or other entities treated as partnerships for US federal income tax purposes, US Holders holding ADSs or Ordinary Shares as part of a hedging, conversion or other integrated transaction or whose functional currency for US federal income tax purposes is other than the US Dollar and investors liable for alternative minimum tax. In addition, the comments below do not address US state, local or non-US (other than UK) taxes. The summary deals only with US Holders who hold ADSs or Ordinary Shares as capital assets. The summary is based on current UK and US law and practice which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. US Holders are recommended to consult their own tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences to them of the ownership of ADSs or Ordinary Shares. The Company believes, and this discussion assumes, that the Company was not a passive foreign investment company for its taxable year ended 31 December 2011. This discussion is based in part on representations by the depositary and assumes that each obligation under the deposit agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms. For purposes of US federal income tax law, US Holders of ADSs will generally be treated as owners of the Ordinary Shares represented by the ADSs. However, the US Treasury has expressed concerns that parties to whom depositary shares are released before shares are delivered to the depositary (pre-released) may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming of foreign tax credits by owners of depositary shares. Such actions would also be inconsistent with the claiming of the reduced rate of tax, described below, applicable to dividends received by certain non-corporate US Holders. Accordingly, the availability of the reduced tax rate for dividends received by certain non-corporate US Holders of ADSs could be affected by actions that may be taken by parties to whom ADSs are pre-released. Taxation of dividends in the United Kingdom and the United States The UK does not currently impose a withholding tax on dividends paid by a UK corporation, such as the Company. Distributions paid by the Company will be treated for US federal income tax purposes as foreign source ordinary dividend income to a US Holder to the extent paid out of the Companys current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for US federal income tax purposes. Such dividends will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to corporate US Holders. Dividends paid to certain non-corporate US Holders of Ordinary Shares or ADSs in taxable years beginning before 1 January 2013 may be subject to US federal income tax at lower rates than other types of ordinary income if certain conditions are met. Non-corporate US Holders should consult their own tax advisors to determine whether they are subject to any special rules that limit their ability to be taxed at these favourable rates. Taxation of capital gains US Holders, who are not resident or ordinarily resident for tax purposes in the UK, will not generally be liable for UK capital gains tax on any capital gain realised upon the sale or other disposition of ADSs or Ordinary Shares unless the ADSs or Ordinary Shares are held in connection with a trade carried on in the UK through a permanent establishment (or in the case of individuals, through a branch or agency). Furthermore, UK resident individuals who acquire ADSs or Ordinary Shares before becoming temporarily non-UK residents may remain subject to UK taxation of capital gains on gains realised while non-resident. For US federal income tax purposes, gains or losses realised upon a taxable sale or other disposition of ADSs or Ordinary Shares by US Holders generally will be US source capital gains or losses and will be long-term capital gains or losses if the ADSs or Ordinary Shares were held for more than one year. The amount of a US Holders gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the amount realised on the sale or other disposition and such holders tax basis in the ADSs, or Ordinary Shares, determined in US Dollars. Inheritance and estate taxes The HM Revenue & Customs imposes inheritance tax on capital transfers which occur on death, and in the seven years preceding death. The HM Revenue & Customs considers that the US/UK Double Taxation Convention on Estate and Gift Tax applies to inheritance tax. Consequently, a US citizen who is domiciled in the United States and is not a UK national or domiciled in the United Kingdom will not be subject to UK inheritance tax in respect of ADSs and Ordinary Shares. A UK national who is domiciled in the United States will be subject to both UK inheritance tax and US federal estate tax but will be entitled to a credit for US federal estate tax charged in respect of ADSs and Ordinary Shares in computing the liability to UK inheritance tax. Conversely, a US citizen who is domiciled or deemed domiciled in the United Kingdom will be entitled to a credit for UK inheritance tax charged in respect of ADSs and Ordinary Shares in computing the liability for US federal estate tax. Special rules apply where ADSs and Ordinary Shares are business property of a permanent establishment of an enterprise situated in the United Kingdom. 147 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Taxation information for shareholders continued US information reporting and backup withholding A US Holder may be subject to US information reporting and backup withholding on dividends paid on or the proceeds of sales of ADSs or Ordinary Shares made within the US or through certain US-related financial intermediaries, unless the US Holder is an exempt recipient or, in the case of backup withholding, provides a correct US taxpayer identification number and certain other conditions are met. US backup withholding may also apply if there has been a notification from the US Internal Revenue Service of a failure to report all interest or dividends. Any backup withholding deducted may be credited against the US Holders US federal income tax liability, and, where the withholding tax exceeds the actual liability, the US Holder may obtain a refund by timely filing the appropriate refund claim with the US Internal Revenue Service. For taxable years ending after December 19, 2011, certain US Holders who are individuals are required to report information relating to their ownership of an interest in certain foreign financial assets, including stock of a non-US person, subject to exceptions (including an exception for stock held in custodial accounts maintained by US financial institutions or by US branches of certain non-US financial institutions). Certain US Holders that are entities may be subject to similar rules in the future. US Holders are recommended to consult their own tax advisors regarding the particular consequences, if any, of these requirements on their ownership and disposition of the Ordinary Shares or ADSs. UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax UK stamp duty is charged on documents and in particular instruments for the transfer of registered ownership of Ordinary Shares. Transfers of Ordinary Shares in certificated form will generally be subject to UK stamp duty at the rate of 1/2% of the consideration given for the transfer with the duty rounded up to the nearest £5. UK stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT) arises when there is an agreement to transfer shares in UK companies for consideration in money or moneys worth, and so an agreement to transfer Ordinary Shares for money or other consideration may give rise to a charge to SDRT at the rate of 1/2% (rounded up to the nearest penny). The charge of SDRT will be cancelled, and any SDRT already paid will be refunded, if within six years of the agreement an instrument of transfer is produced to HM Revenue & Customs and the appropriate stamp duty paid. Transfers of Ordinary Shares into CREST (an electronic transfer system) are exempt from stamp duty so long as the transferee is a member of CREST who will hold the Ordinary Shares as a nominee for the transferor and the transfer is in a form that will ensure that the securities become held in uncertificated form within CREST. Paperless transfers of Ordinary Shares within CREST for consideration in money or moneys worth are liable to SDRT rather than stamp duty. SDRT on relevant transactions will be collected by CREST at 1/2%, and this will apply whether or not the transfer is affected in the United Kingdom and whether or not the parties to it are resident or situated in the United Kingdom. A charge of stamp duty or SDRT at the rates of 1 1/2% of the consideration (or, in some circumstances, the value of the shares concerned) will arise on a transfer or issue of Ordinary Shares to the Depositary or to certain persons providing a clearance service (or their nominees or agents) for the conversion into ADRs and will generally be payable by the Depositary or person providing clearance service. In accordance with the terms of the Deposit Agreement, any tax or duty payable by the Depositary on deposits of Ordinary Shares will be charged by the Depositary to the party to whom ADRs are delivered against such deposits. No liability for stamp duty or SDRT will arise on any transfer of, or agreement to transfer, an ADS or beneficial ownership of an ADS, provided that the ADS and any instrument of transfer or written agreement to transfer remains at all times outside the United Kingdom, and provided further that any instrument of transfer or written agreement to transfer is not executed in the United Kingdom and the transfer does not relate to any matter or thing done or to be done in the United Kingdom (the location of the custodian as a holder of Ordinary Shares not being relevant in this context). In any other case, any transfer of, or agreement to transfer, an ADS or beneficial ownership of an ADS could, depending on all the circumstances of the transfer, give rise to a charge to stamp duty or SDRT. 148 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Articles of association The following summarises certain material rights of holders of the Companys Ordinary Shares under the material provisions of the Companys articles of association and English law. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Companies Act and the Companys articles of association. In the following description, a shareholder is the person registered in the Companys register of members as the holder of an Ordinary Share. The Company is incorporated under the name Smith & Nephew plc and is registered in England and Wales with registered number 324357. The Companys Ordinary Shares may be held in certificated or uncertificated form. No holder of the Companys shares will be required to make additional contributions of capital in respect of the Companys shares in the future. In accordance with English law the Companys Ordinary Shares rank equally. Directors Under the Companys articles of association, a Director may not vote in respect of any contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal in which he, or any person connected with him, has any material interest other than by virtue of his interests in securities of, or otherwise in or through, the Company. This is subject to certain exceptions relating to proposals (a) indemnifying him in respect of obligations incurred on behalf of the Company, (b) indemnifying a third party in respect of obligations of the Company for which the Director has assumed responsibility under an indemnity or guarantee, (c) relating to an offer of securities in which he will be interested as an underwriter, (d) concerning another body corporate in which the Director is beneficially interested in less than one percent of the issued shares of any class of shares of such a body corporate, (e) relating to an employee benefit in which the Director will share equally with other employees and (f) relating to any insurance that the Company is empowered to purchase for the benefit of Directors of the Company in respect of actions undertaken as Directors (and/or officers) of the Company. A Director shall not vote or be counted in any quorum present at a meeting in relation to a resolution on which he is not entitled to vote. The Directors are empowered to exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money, subject to the limitation that the aggregate amount of all monies borrowed after deducting cash and current asset investments by the Company and its subsidiaries shall not exceed the sum of $6,500,000,000. Any Director who has been appointed by the Directors since the previous Annual General Meeting of shareholders, either to fill a casual vacancy or as an additional Director holds office only until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting and then shall be eligible for re-election by the shareholders. The other Directors retire and are eligible for re-appointment at the third Annual General Meeting after the meeting at which they were last re-appointed. If not re-appointed a Director retiring at a meeting shall retain office until the meeting appoints someone in his place, or if it does not do so, until the conclusion of the meeting. The Directors are subject to removal with or without cause by the Board or the shareholders. Directors are not required to hold any shares of the Company by way of qualification. Under the Companys articles of association and English law, a Director may be indemnified out of the assets of the Company against liabilities he may sustain or incur in the execution of his duties. Rights attaching to Ordinary Shares Under English law, dividends are payable on the Companys Ordinary Shares only out of profits available for distribution, as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom and by the Companies Act 2006. Holders of the Companys Ordinary Shares are entitled to receive final dividends as may be declared by the Directors and approved by the shareholders in general meeting, rateable according to the amounts paid up on such shares, provided that the dividend cannot exceed the amount recommended by the Directors. The Companys Board of Directors may declare such interim dividends as appear to them to be justified by the Companys financial position. If authorised by an ordinary resolution of the shareholders, the Board may also direct payment of a dividend in whole or in part by the distribution of specific assets (and in particular of paid up shares or debentures of the Company). Any dividend unclaimed after 12 years from the date the dividend was declared, or became due for payment, will be forfeited and will revert to the Company. There were no material modifications to the rights of shareholders under the Articles during 2011. Voting rights of Ordinary Shares Voting at any general meeting of shareholders is by a show of hands unless a poll, which is a written vote, is duly demanded and held. On a show of hands, every shareholder who is present in person at a general meeting has one vote regardless of the number of shares held. On a poll, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy has one vote for each Ordinary Share held by that shareholder. A poll may be demanded by any of the following:  the chairman of the meeting;  at least five shareholders present or by proxy entitled to vote on the resolution;  any shareholder or shareholders representing in the aggregate not less than one-tenth of the total voting rights of all shareholders entitled to vote on the resolution; or  any shareholder or shareholders holding shares conferring a right to vote on the resolution on which there have been paid-up sums in aggregate equal to not less than one-tenth of the total sum paid up on all the shares conferring that right. A form of proxy will be treated as giving the proxy the authority to demand a poll, or to join others in demanding one, as above. The necessary quorum for a general meeting is two shareholders present in person or by proxy carrying the right to vote upon the business to be transacted. Matters are transacted at general meetings of the Company by the processing and passing of resolutions of which there are two kinds; ordinary or special resolutions:  Ordinary resolutions include resolutions for the re-election of Directors, the approval of financial statements, the declaration of dividends (other than interim dividends), the appointment and re-appointment of auditors or the grant of authority to allot shares. An ordinary resolution requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes of those persons voting at the meetings at which there is a quorum. 149 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Articles of association continued  Special resolutions include resolutions amending the Companys articles of association, dis-applying statutory pre-emption rights or changing the Companys name; modifying the rights of any class of the Companys shares at a meeting of the holders of such class or relating to certain matters concerning the Companys winding up. A special resolution requires the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the votes of the persons voting at the meeting at which there is a quorum. Annual General Meetings must be convened upon advance written notice of 21 days. Other general meetings must be convened upon advance written notice of at least 14 clear days. The days of delivery or receipt of notice are not included. The notice must specify the nature of the business to be transacted. Meetings are convened by the Board of Directors. Members with 5% of the Ordinary Share capital of the Company may requisition the Board to convene a meeting. Variation of rights If, at any time, the Companys share capital is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class may be varied, subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, with the consent in writing of holders of three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class or upon the adoption of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. At every such separate meeting, all the provisions of the articles of association relating to proceedings at a general meeting apply, except that the quorum is to be the number of persons (which must be two or more) who hold or represent by proxy not less than one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class and at any such meeting a poll may be demanded in writing by any person or their proxy who hold shares of that class. Where a person is present by proxy or proxies, he is treated as holding only the shares in respect of which the proxies are authorised to exercise voting rights. Rights in a winding-up Except as the Companys shareholders have agreed or may otherwise agree, upon the Companys winding up, the balance of assets available for distribution:  after the payment of all creditors including certain preferential creditors, whether statutorily preferred creditors or normal creditors; and  subject to any special rights attaching to any other class of shares; is to be distributed among the holders of Ordinary Shares according to the amounts paid-up on the shares held by them. This distribution is generally to be made in US Dollars. A liquidator may, however, upon the adoption of any extraordinary resolution of the shareholders and any other sanction required by law, divide among the shareholders the whole or any part of the Companys assets in kind. Limitations on voting and shareholding There are no limitations imposed by English law or the Companys articles of association on the right of non-residents or foreign persons to hold or vote the Companys Ordinary shares or ADSs, other than the limitations that would generally apply to all of the Companys shareholders. Transfers of shares The Board may refuse to register the transfer of shares held in certificated form which:  are not fully paid (provided that it shall not exercise this discretion in such a way as to prevent stock market dealings in the shares of that class from taking place on an open and proper basis);  are not duly stamped or duly certified or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Board to be exempt from stamp duty, lodged at the Transfer Office or at such other place as the Board may appoint and (save in the case of a transfer by a person to whom no certificate was issued in respect of the shares in question) accompanied by the certificate for the shares to which it relates, and such other evidence as the Board may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer and, if the instrument of transfer is executed by some other person on his behalf, the authority of that person so to do;  are in respect of more than one class of shares; or  are in favour of more than four transferees. Deferred shares Following the redenomination of share capital on 23 January 2006 the Ordinary Shares nominal value became 20 US cents each. There were no changes to the rights or obligations of the Ordinary Shares. In order to comply with the Companies Act 2006, a new class of Sterling shares was created, Deferred Shares, of which £50,000 were issued and allotted in 2006 as fully paid to the Chief Executive Officer though the Board reserves the right to transfer them to another member of the Board should it so wish. These Deferred Shares have no voting or dividend rights and on winding up only are entitled to repayment at nominal value only if all ordinary shareholders have received the nominal value of their shares plus an additional $1,000 each. Amendments The Company does not have any special rules about amendments to its articles of association beyond those imposed by law. 150 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Accounts and other information Cross Reference to Form 20-F This table provides a cross reference from the information included in this Annual Report to the requirements of Form 20-F.
