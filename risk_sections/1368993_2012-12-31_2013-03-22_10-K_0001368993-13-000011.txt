Item 1A. Risk Factors We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. This discussion highlights some of the risks that may affect future operating results. These are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important to consider. We cannot be certain that we will successfully address these risks. If we are unable to address these risks, our business may not grow, our stock price may suffer and we may be unable to stay in business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business operations. Risks Related to Our Company and Our Business We have generated only limited sales, have a history of operating losses and we may not be able to reach profitability. We have a history of losses and expect to continue to incur operating and net losses for the foreseeable future. We incurred a net loss of $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, our accumulated deficit was $64.6 million. We have not achieved operating profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Historically, there have been limited sales of any of our products, and having sold ten systems in the fifteen months ended March 31, 2011, we experienced no system sales during the fifteen months ended June 30, 2012, and have sold two systems in the six months ended December 31, 2012. Our revenues were $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, and $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. We will need to significantly grow our revenues to become profitable. We will need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future and such capital raising may be costly or difficult to obtain and could dilute current stockholders’ ownership interests. We have incurred losses since inception and expect to continue to incur losses until we are able to significantly grow our revenues. In our May 2011 private placement transaction (the “May 2011 Private Placement”), we issued convertible promissory notes in the initial aggregate face value of $15,275,000, which accrue interest at a rate of 5% per annum through November 27, 2014, and which had accrued a total of $1,262,028 in interest added to principal as of December 31, 2012. These convertible promissory notes mature in November 2014. Accordingly we will need additional financing to maintain and expand our business and to repay the convertible promissory notes at maturity. Such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or equity linked securities may dilute current stockholders’ ownership percentages and could also result in a decrease in the market value of our equity securities. The terms of any securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect on the holders of any of our securities then outstanding. Furthermore, any additional debt or equity financing that we may need may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain such additional financing on a timely basis, we may have to curtail our development activities and growth plans and/or be forced to sell assets, perhaps on unfavorable terms, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and ultimately could be forced to discontinue our operations and liquidate, in which event it is unlikely that stockholders would receive any distribution on their shares. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. Further, we may not be able to continue operating if we do not generate sufficient revenues from operations needed to stay in business. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we issue, such as convertible promissory notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our financial results. 9 Table of Contents We are highly leveraged. In the May 2011 Private Placement, we issued convertible promissory notes in the initial aggregate face value of $15,275,000, which accrue interest at a rate of 5% per annum through November 27, 2014, and which had accrued a total of $1,262,028 in interest added to principal as of December 31, 2012. The principal, including the accrued interest added to principal under these convertible promissory notes, is convertible into our common stock at $0.57 per share. Based on our current and anticipated operations we do not expect to have the ability to repay these convertible notes at maturity without significant additional financing. These securities may have additional negative consequences for us, such as limiting our ability to obtain additional financing. We may not be able to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have a history of operating losses that are likely to continue in the future. We have included an explanatory paragraph in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012, to the effect that our significant losses from operations and our dependence on equity and debt financing raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our accumulated deficit at December 31, 2012, was $64.6 million. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. We have a limited history of commercial sales of systems and consumable products, and our success depends on our ability to develop commercially successful products and on market acceptance of our new and relatively unproven technologies. Our future is dependent upon the success of the current and future generations of one or more of the products we sell or propose to sell, including the SmartChip System. We may not possess all of the resources, capability and intellectual property rights necessary to develop and commercialize all of the products or services that may result from our technologies. Our long-term viability, growth and profitability will depend upon successful testing, approval and commercialization of the SmartChip System incorporating our technology resulting from our research and development activities. Adverse or inconclusive results in the development and testing of our SmartChip System could significantly delay or ultimately preclude commercialization of our technology. Accordingly, there is only a limited basis upon which to evaluate our business and prospects. An investor in our Company should consider the challenges, expenses, and difficulties we will face as an emerging company seeking to develop and manufacture a new product in a relatively new market. We must conduct a substantial amount of additional research and development before some of our products will be ready for sale. We currently have fewer resources available for research and development activities than many of our competitors. We may not be able to develop or launch new products in a timely manner, or at all, or they may not meet customer requirements or be of sufficient quality or at a price that enables us to compete effectively in the marketplace. Challenges frequently encountered in connection with the development or early commercialization of products and services using new and relatively unproven technologies might limit our ability to develop and successfully commercialize these products and services. In addition, we may need to enter into agreements to obtain the intellectual property rights necessary to commercialize some of our products or services, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. We have a limited operating history for investors to evaluate our business. We have had limited operations in the genetic analysis segment of the life science industry. Since we are a company with a limited operating history developing products focused on the analysis of genetic function and variation, it is difficult for potential investors to evaluate our business. Our future operations and growth will likely depend on our ability to fully develop and market our SmartChip products and services. Our proposed operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in developing and growing a new business in light of the expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the development of any new business, as well as those risks that are specific to the life science industry. In evaluating us, investors should consider the delays, expenses, problems and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies developing markets for new products, services and technologies. We may never overcome these obstacles and become profitable. 10 Table of Contents Currency risk related to assets, obligations and expenses denominated in foreign currencies could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. At December 31, 2012, the Company had approximately $0.5 million in net assets denominated in the local currency in Luxembourg, for which the functional reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The Company’s Malaysia subsidiary had net assets of $5.5 million denominated in U.S. dollars which are revalued in the local reporting currency at the end of each reporting period, with exchange gains or losses being credited or charged against income. Further, both subsidiaries incur significant amounts of their expenses in their respective local currency. Fluctuations in exchange rates could negatively impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in exchange losses or increased expenses. Translation adjustments in any particular reporting period could significantly affect, positively or negatively, our reported operating results. Because our business depends on research and development spending levels for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic and governmental research institutions, our success and our operating results will substantially depend on these customers. We expect that our revenues in the foreseeable future will be derived primarily from products and services provided to a relatively small number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic, governmental and other research institutions. Our success will depend upon their demand for and use of our products and services. Our operating results may fluctuate substantially due to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures by these customers. For example, reductions in capital or operating expenditures by these customers may result in lower than expected instrumentation sales and similarly, reductions in operating expenditures by these customers could result in lower than expected sales by us. We expect that our results of operations will fluctuate, which could cause our stock price to decline. Our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of high-value products and service projects, the impact of seasonal spending patterns, the timing and size of research projects our customers perform, changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry, the timing and amount of government grant funding programs and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns. Given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services, we may experience quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in revenue and/or a sequential decline in quarterly revenue. If revenue does not grow significantly, we will not be able to achieve and maintain profitability. Any significant delays in the commercial launch of our products, unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines, or impacts from the other factors mentioned above could adversely affect our revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenues. Due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and expenses, we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance. If our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors, our stock price probably would decline. If we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, we may be unable to achieve our goals. We are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. The loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives. We compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science companies, universities and research institutions, particularly those focusing on genomics. Competition for these individuals, particularly in the San Francisco Bay area, is intense, and the turnover rate can be high. Failure to attract and retain management and scientific personnel could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or detect fraud. Consequently, investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting and this may decrease the trading price of our common stock. We must maintain effective disclosure and internal controls to provide reliable financial reports. We have been assessing our controls to identify areas that need improvement. Based on our evaluation as of December 31, 2012, we concluded that our internal controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2012, however we have identified material weaknesses in 11 Table of Contents the past and may do so again in the future. Failure to maintain the improvements in our controls as necessary to maintain an effective system of such controls could harm our ability to accurately report our operating results and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. Any such loss of confidence would have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. Litigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our products or services or adversely impact our stock price. Our commercial success depends in part on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties and the ability to protect our own intellectual property. Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization even if we are not. As we enter new markets, we expect that competitors will likely assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful entry into those markets. Third parties such as Life Technologies Corporation, the Roche family of companies, Biometra Biomedizinische Analytik GmbH, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Eppendorf AG, Enzo Biochem, Inc., Affymetrix, Inc., Illumina, Inc., Agilent Technologies, Inc., GE Healthcare, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Sequenom, Inc., RainDance Technologies, Inc., Qiagen N.V., Idaho Technology, Inc., PerkinElmer, Inc., Fluidigm Corporation, Cepheid, Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc., the Exiqon family of companies, Luminex Corporation, and others may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents and claim that manufacture, use and/or sale of our technologies, methods or products infringes these patents. We could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against these claims even if we are eventually successful in defending ourselves against these claims. Furthermore, parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief, which effectively could block our ability to further develop, commercialize, manufacture, use and sell methods and products, and could result in the award of substantial damages against us. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties, or be prohibited from making, using or selling certain methods and/or products. We may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost, or at all. In that event, we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing products, and the prohibition of sale of any of our products could materially affect our ability to grow and to attain profitability. Our proprietary intellectual property rights may not adequately protect our products and technologies. Although we have filed a number of United States and international patent applications, we presently have four patents issued in the United States, which do not cover all of our products and technologies. Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection for our products and technologies. Patent law relating to claims in the technology fields in which we operate is uncertain, so we cannot be assured the patent rights we have, or may obtain in future, will be valuable or enforceable. We may only be able to protect products and technologies from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets cover them. Furthermore, the degree of future protection of our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep a competitive advantage. The patent positions of life sciences companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in such companies’ patents has emerged to date in the United States. The laws of some countries other than the United States do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology and/or pharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of any patents we may obtain in such countries. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States or other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. For example: • we might not have been the first to conceive or reduce to practice one or more inventions disclosed in our pending patent applications; • we might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions; 12 Table of Contents • others may independently develop similar or alternative products and technologies or duplicate any of our products and technologies; • it is possible that none of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents, and even if they issue as patents, they may not provide a basis for commercially viable products, and/or may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be challenged and invalidated by third parties; • we may not develop additional proprietary products and technologies that are patentable; and • third-party patents may have an adverse effect on our ability to continue to grow our business. We have applied, and continue to apply, for patents covering our intellectual property (e.g., products and technologies and uses thereof), as we deem appropriate. However, we may fail to apply for patents on products and/or technologies in a timely fashion or at all. We also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we attempt to use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, or scientific and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. If we were to attempt to enforce a claim that a third-party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, it could be expensive and time consuming, and the outcome could be unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets than courts inside the United States. Moreover, if our competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, it may be difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property and our business could be harmed. If we are not able to defend the patent or trade secret protection position of our products and technologies, then we may not be able to exclude competitors from developing or marketing competing products, and we may not generate enough revenue from product sales to justify the cost of development of our products and to achieve or maintain profitability. We may be unable to protect the intellectual property rights of the third parties from whom we license certain of our intellectual property or with whom we have entered into other strategic relationships, which could negatively impact our competitive advantage. None of our intellectual property rights are currently licensed from third parties but, in the future, we may have to license intellectual property from key strategic partners. We may become reliant upon such third parties to protect their intellectual property rights to any licensed technology. Such third parties may not protect the intellectual property rights that we license from them and we may be unable defend such intellectual property rights on our own or we may have to undertake costly litigation to defend the intellectual property rights of such third parties. There can be no assurances that we will continue to have proprietary rights to any of the intellectual property that we license from such third parties or otherwise have the right to use through similar strategic relationships. Any loss or limitations on use with respect to our right to use such intellectual property licensed from third parties or otherwise obtained from third parties or with whom we have entered into strategic relationships could negatively impact our competitive advantage. We expect intense competition in our target markets, which could render our products and/or technologies obsolete, result in significant price reductions or substantially limit the volume of products that we sell. This would limit our ability to compete and achieve and maintain profitability. If we cannot continuously develop and commercialize new products, our revenue may not grow as intended. Future competition will likely come from existing competitors as well as other companies seeking to develop new technologies for analyzing genetic information, such as next generation sequencing. Some of our competitors have various products and/or methodologies for gene detection, expression, characterization, and/or analyses that may be competitive with our products and/or methodologies. In addition, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have significant needs for genomic information and may choose to develop or acquire competing technologies to meet these needs. In the molecular diagnostics field, competition will likely come from established diagnostic companies, companies developing and marketing DNA probe tests for genetic and other diseases and other companies conducting research on new technologies to ascertain and analyze genetic information. Further, in the event that we develop new technology and products that compete with existing technology and products of well-established companies, there can be no guarantee that the marketplace will readily adopt any such new technology and products that we may introduce in the future. 13 Table of Contents The market for genetic research and molecular diagnostic products is highly competitive, with several large companies already having significant market share. Established genetic research and diagnostic companies also have an installed base of instruments in several markets, including clinical and reference laboratories. In addition, these companies have formed alliances with genomics companies that provide them access to genetic information that may be incorporated into their diagnostic tests. We may not be able to compete effectively with these companies. Our manufacturing capacity may limit our ability to sell our products. There are uncertainties inherent in expanding our manufacturing capabilities and we may not be able to increase our capacity in a timely manner. For example, manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facility and launch new products. As a result, we may experience difficulties in meeting customer demand, in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions, and demand for our products could decline. Due to the intricate nature of manufacturing products, we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields, impact our ability to launch or sell these products, or to produce them economically, prevent us from achieving expected performance levels or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by customers. If we are unable to develop and maintain our manufacturing capability, we may not be able to launch or support our products in a timely manner, or at all. We currently possess only one facility capable of manufacturing our products and services for both sale to our customers and internal use. If a natural disaster were to significantly damage our facility or if other events were to cause our operations to fail, these events could prevent us from developing and manufacturing our products and services. If our networks or storage infrastructure were to fail for an extended period of time, it would adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis and may prevent us from achieving our expected shipments in any given period. Our reliance on outside manufacturers and suppliers to provide certain instruments could subject us to risks that may harm our business. From time to time we may change manufacturers, and any new manufacturer engaged by us may not perform as expected. If our vendors experience shortages or delays in their manufacture of our instruments, or if we experience quality problems with our vendors, then our shipment schedules could be significantly delayed or costs significantly increased. Certain of our instruments may be manufactured by a single vendor, which could magnify the risk of shortages. We may be adversely affected by environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and liabilities. As we pursue our business plan, we will become subject to a variety of federal, state and municipal environmental, health and safety laws based on our use of hazardous materials in both our manufacturing and research and development operations. These laws and regulations can often require expensive compliance procedures or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment. A violation of these laws and regulations can result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions and/or operational shutdown. Furthermore, we may become liable for the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination, whether intentional or unintentional, and we could be responsible for damages related to the clean-up of such contamination or individual injury caused by such contamination. We may also be subject to related claims by private parties alleging property damage and personal injury due to exposure to hazardous or other materials as a result of such contamination. Some of these matters may require expending significant amounts for investigation, cleanup or other costs. Events such as these could negatively impact our financial position. Our sales, marketing and technical support organization may limit our ability to sell our products. We currently have limited resources available for sales, marketing and technical support services as compared to some of our primary competitors. In order to effectively commercialize our genetic analysis systems and other products to follow, we will need to expand our sales, marketing and technical support staff both domestically and internationally. We may not be successful in establishing or maintaining either a direct sales force or distribution arrangements to market our products and services. In addition, we compete primarily with much larger companies that have larger sales and distribution staffs and a significant installed base of products in place, and the efforts from a limited sales and marketing force may not be sufficient to build the market acceptance of our products required to support continued growth of our business. 14 Table of Contents We may be exposed to liability due to product defects. The risk of product liability claims is inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of research products for therapeutic and diagnostic development. We may seek to acquire additional insurance for clinical liability risks. We may not be able to obtain such insurance or general product liability insurance on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts. A product liability claim or recall could negatively impact our financial position. Risks Related to Our Industry Our success depends upon the continued emergence and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function. We design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries. The usefulness of our technology depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease. We are initially focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function, namely gene expression profiling. This market is new and emerging, and may not develop as quickly as we anticipate, or reach its full potential. Other methods of analysis of genetic variation and biological function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing. Also, researchers may not seek or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information through the analysis of genetic variation and biological function. In addition, factors affecting research and development spending generally, such as changes in the regulatory environment affecting life sciences and pharmaceutical companies, and changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions, could harm our business. If useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner, demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we expect, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability. We may not be able to deliver acceptable products to our customers due to the rapidly evolving nature of genetic sequence information upon which our products are based. The genetic sequence information upon which we may rely to develop and manufacture our products is contained in a variety of public and private databases throughout the world. These databases are rapidly expanding and evolving. In addition, the accuracy of such databases and resulting genetic research is dependent on various scientific interpretations, and it is not expected that global genetic research efforts will result in standardized genetic sequence databases for particular genomes in the near future. Although we have implemented ongoing internal quality control efforts to help ensure the quality and accuracy of our products, the fundamental nature of our products requires us to rely on genetic sequence databases and scientific interpretations which are continuously evolving. As a result, these variables may cause us to develop and manufacture products that incorporate sequence errors or ambiguities. The magnitude and importance of these errors depends on multiple and complex factors that would be considered in determining the appropriate actions required to remedy any inaccuracies. Our inability to timely deliver acceptable products as a result of these factors would likely adversely affect our relationship with customers, and could negatively impact our financial condition. We face risks associated with technological obsolescence and emergence of standardized systems for genetic analysis. High throughput genetic analyses and quantitative detection methodologies (including, for example, PCR) are undergoing rapid evolution and technological changes. New technologies, techniques or products could emerge which might allow the packaging and analysis of genomic information at densities similar to, or even higher than, our existing or future technology. Other companies may begin to offer products that are directly competitive with, or are technologically superior to, our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our technological advantages over emerging technologies in the future. Over time, we will need to respond to technological innovation in a rapidly changing industry. Standardization of tools and systems for genetic research is still ongoing and there can be no assurance that our products will emerge as the standard for genetic research. The emergence of competing technologies and systems as market standards for genetic research may result in our products becoming uncompetitive which would have an adverse effect on our business. 15 Table of Contents Our success depends on the continuous development of new products and our ability to manage the transition from our older products to new products. We compete in markets that are new, intensely competitive, highly fragmented and rapidly changing, and many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, many current and potential competitors have greater name recognition, more extensive customer bases and access to proprietary genetic content. The continued success of our products will depend on our ability to produce products with smaller feature sizes and create greater information capacity at our current or lower costs. The successful development, manufacture and introduction of our new products is a complicated process and depend on our ability to manufacture and supply enough products in sufficient quantity and quality and at acceptable cost in order to meet customer demand. If we fail to keep pace with emerging technologies or are unable to develop, manufacture and introduce new products, we will become uncompetitive, our pricing and margins will decline, and our business will suffer. Our failure to successfully manage the transition between our older products and new products may adversely affect our financial results. As we introduce new or enhanced products, we must successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and provide sufficient supplies of new products to meet customer demands. When we introduce new or enhanced products, we face numerous risks relating to product transitions, including the inability to accurately forecast demand and difficulties in managing different sales and support requirements due to the type or complexity of the new products. Ethical, legal and social concerns surrounding the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our products. Genetic testing has raised ethical issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information. For these reasons, governmental authorities and others may call for limits on or regulation of the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for those that have no known cure. Similarly, such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible. Any of these scenarios could reduce the potential markets for our products. Risks Related to Our Organization Even though we are not a California corporation, our common stock could still be subject to a number of key provisions of the California General Corporation Law. Under Section 2115 of the California General Corporation Law (“CGCL”), corporations not organized under California law may still be subject to a number of key provisions of the CGCL. This determination is based on whether the corporation has significant business contacts with California and if more than 50% of its voting securities of record are held by persons having addresses in California. In the immediate future, the majority of our business operations, revenue and payroll will be conducted in, derived from, and paid to residents of California. Therefore, depending on our ownership, we could be subject to some provisions of the CGCL. Among the more important provisions are those relating to the election and removal of directors, cumulative voting, standards of liability and indemnification of directors, distributions, dividends and repurchases of shares, stockholder meetings, approval of some corporate transactions, dissenters’ and appraisal rights, and inspection of corporate records. If we are required to comply with these provisions, this compliance could cause us to incur additional administrative and legal expenses and divert our management’s time and attention from the operation of our business. Because we have become public by means of a reverse merger, we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms. There may be risks associated with our becoming a public company through a “reverse merger.” Securities analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide coverage of us since there is no incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. No assurance can be given that brokerage firms will, in the future, want to conduct any secondary offerings on our behalf. Also, if securities analysts do not cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect its market price. 16 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our stock price could be volatile and investors may have difficulty selling their shares. Our common stock is currently available for trading in the over-the-counter market and is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol “WGBS.OB.” For the three-month period ended December 31, 2012, the daily trading volume for shares of our common stock ranged from 0 to 863,100 shares traded per day, and the average daily trading volume during such three-month period was 65,387 shares traded per day. Accordingly, our investors who wish to dispose of their shares of common stock on any given trading day may not be able to do so or may be able to dispose of only a portion of their shares of common stock. We may never be able to satisfy the qualitative or quantitative listing requirements for our common stock to be listed on an exchange. These factors may severely limit the liquidity of our common stock and may likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and on our ability to raise additional capital. The market price of the common stock has fluctuated significantly since it was first quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board on June 6, 2007. Since this date, through December 31, 2012, the intra-day trading price has fluctuated from a low of $0.02 to a high of $3.15. The price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following: • actual or anticipated variations in operating results; • the limited number of holders of the common stock, and the limited liquidity available through the OTC Bulletin Board; • changes in the economic performance and/or market valuations of other biotechnology companies; • our announcement of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; • additions or departures of key personnel; and • sales or other transactions involving our capital stock. Our common stock may be considered “penny stock” and may be difficult to sell. The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define “penny stock” to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The market price of our common stock is currently less than $5.00 per share and therefore is designated as a “penny stock” according to SEC rules. This designation requires any broker or dealer selling these securities to disclose some information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. These rules may restrict the ability of brokers or dealers to sell the common stock and may affect the ability of investors to sell their shares. These regulations may likely have the effect of limiting the trading activity of our common stock and reducing the liquidity of an investment in our common stock. In addition, since the common stock is currently traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, investors may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations of the common stock and may experience a lack of buyers to purchase our stock or a lack of market makers to support the stock price. The Company’s capital structure includes significant amounts of debt and preferred stock and securities that are convertible into a substantial number of shares of common stock and stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests upon future conversion and exercise of these securities or because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock and our preferred stock. The Company’s capital structure includes significant amounts of debt and preferred stock. As of December 31, 2012, (i) the outstanding principal and interest due on the convertible promissory notes issued in the May 2011 Private Placement totaled $16,537,028, and (ii) the holders of our 2,937,499.97 outstanding shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock were entitled to an aggregate liquidation preference equal to $16,534,742. In addition, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 1,000,000 additional shares preferred stock without further stockholder approval. Any such shares of preferred stock will have preferences and rights as may be determined by our board of directors at the time of issuance. Specifically, our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our 17 Table of Contents assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of common stock. In addition, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than our common stock or that is convertible into common stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of the common stock or result in dilution to our existing stockholders. The Company’s capital structure includes securities that are convertible into a substantial number of shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2012, (i) our 2,937,499.97 outstanding shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock were convertible into 31,797,580 shares of our common stock, (ii) our outstanding convertible promissory notes were convertible into 29,012,332 shares of our common stock, (iii) our Malaysian subsidiary had outstanding 4,567,066 Convertible Preference Shares not held by the Company which were potentially convertible into an aggregate of 69,659,199 shares of our common stock, and (iv) we had 7,500 outstanding unvested restricted stock units, outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 11,424,498 shares of our common stock and outstanding warrants and comparable instruments to purchase an aggregate of 70,379,320 shares of our common stock, 8,577,389 shares of which are subject to certain anti-dilution protections against future dilutive events (including the issuance of stock at a price below their exercise price). Further, as of November 27, 2014, 3,157,340 additional shares of our common stock will be issuable upon the conversion of our outstanding shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, assuming maximum accrual of unpaid dividends on such shares of preferred stock after December 31, 2012, and 2,881,934 additional shares of our common stock will be issuable upon the conversion of our outstanding convertible promissory notes, assuming maximum accrual of unpaid interest on such notes after December 31, 2012. The future conversion of debt and exercise of these options and warrants will subject our existing stockholders to experience dilution of their ownership interests. We may also issue additional shares of common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any additional shares of our common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with any capital raising efforts, including at a price (or exercise prices) below the price at which shares of our common stock are then traded. Our principal stockholders will have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interests of other stockholders. Our officers and directors, and their affiliates, control approximately 14% of our outstanding common stock. Additionally, our officers and directors and their affiliates hold securities that are convertible into a substantial number of shares of common stock. If our officers and directors and their affiliates converted all convertible securities held by them, they would hold approximately 39% of our outstanding common stock. If all of these security holders act together, they will be able to exert significant control over our management and affairs requiring stockholder approval, including approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock. This concentration of ownership may not be in the best interests of all our stockholders. Stockholders should not anticipate receiving cash dividends on our common stock. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings to support operations and to finance expansion and therefore do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
