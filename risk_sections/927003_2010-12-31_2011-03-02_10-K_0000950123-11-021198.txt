ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves a number of very significant risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this Annual Report before deciding whether to purchase our shares of common stock. 10 Table of Contents Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow, could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The value of our shares of common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. This Annual Report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by us described below. Raw material, part, component and subassembly shortages, exacerbated by our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers, could affect our ability to manufacture products and systems and could delay our shipments. Our business depends on our ability to manufacture products that meet the rapidly changing demands of our customers. Our ability to manufacture our products timely depends in part on the timely delivery of raw materials, parts, components and subassemblies from suppliers. We rely on sole and limited source suppliers for some of our raw materials, parts, components and subassemblies that are critical to the manufacturing of our products. This reliance involves several risks, including the following:  the inability to obtain an adequate supply of required parts, components or subassemblies;  supply shortages, if a sole or limited source provider ceases operations;  the need to fund the operating losses of a sole or limited source provider;  reduced control over pricing and timing of delivery of raw materials and parts, components or subassemblies;  the need to qualify alternative suppliers; and  the inability of our suppliers to develop technologically advanced products to support our growth and development of new products. Qualifying alternative suppliers could be time consuming and lead to delays in, or prevention of delivery of products to our customers, as well as increased costs. If we are unable to qualify additional suppliers and manage relationships with our existing and future suppliers successfully, if our suppliers experience financial difficulties including bankruptcy or if our suppliers cannot meet our performance or quality specifications or timing requirements, we may experience shortages, delays or increased costs of raw materials, parts, components or subassemblies. This in turn could limit or prevent our ability to manufacture and ship our products, which could materially and adversely affect our relationships with our current and prospective customers and our business, financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, our sole or limited source suppliers have given us notice that they are ending supply of critical parts, components and subassemblies that are required for us to deliver product. In those cases, we have been required to make last time buys of such supplies in advance of product demand from our customers. If we cannot qualify alternative suppliers before these end-of-life supplies are utilized in our products, we may be unable to deliver further product to our customers. To mitigate the risk of not having a supply of critical parts, components and subassemblies for our products, we proactively make additional purchases which we believe addresses such risk. Our orders of raw materials, parts, components and subassemblies are based on demand forecasts. We place orders with many of our suppliers based on our customers quarterly forecasts and our annual forecasts. These forecasts are based on our customers and our expectations as to demand for our products. As the quarter and the year progress, such demand can change rapidly or we may realize that our customers expectations were overly optimistic or pessimistic, especially when industry or general economic conditions change. Orders with our suppliers cannot always be amended in response. In addition, in order to assure availability of certain components or to obtain priority pricing, we have entered into contracts with some of our suppliers that require us to purchase a specified amount of components and subassemblies each quarter, even if we are not able to use such components or subassemblies. Moreover, we have obligations to 11 Table of Contents some of our customers to hold a minimum amount of finished goods in inventory, in order to fulfill just in time orders, regardless of whether the customers expect to place such orders. We currently have firm purchase commitments and agreements with various suppliers to ensure the availability of components. Our obligation to our suppliers at December 31, 2010 under these purchase commitments and agreements was $63.5 million. If demand for our products does not continue at current levels, we might not be able to use all of the components that we are required to purchase under these commitments and agreements, and our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory may increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If demand for our products exceeds our customers and our forecasts, we may not be able to timely obtain sufficient raw materials, parts, components or subassemblies, on favorable terms or at all, to fulfill the excess demand. We generally have no long-term contracts with our customers requiring them to purchase any specified quantities from us. Our sales are primarily made on a purchase order basis, and we generally have no long-term purchase commitments from our customers, which is typical in the industries we serve. As a result, we are limited in our ability to predict the level of future sales or commitments from our current customers, which may diminish our ability to allocate labor, materials and equipment in the manufacturing process effectively. In addition, we may accumulate inventory in anticipation of sales that do not materialize, resulting in excess and obsolete inventory write-offs. We are exposed to risks associated with worldwide financial markets and the global economy. Our business depends on the expansion of manufacturing capacity in our end markets and the installation base for the products we sell. In the past, severe tightening of credit markets, turmoil in the financial markets and a weakening global economy have contributed to slowdowns in the industries in which we operate. Our markets depend largely on consumer spending. Economic uncertainty exacerbates negative trends in consumer spending and may cause our customers to push out, cancel or refrain from placing equipment orders. Difficulties in obtaining capital and uncertain market conditions may also lead to a reduction of our sales and greater instances of nonpayment. These conditions may similarly affect our key suppliers, which could affect their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for our products. Further, these conditions and uncertainty about future economic conditions could make it challenging for us to forecast our operating results and evaluate the risks that may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As discussed in Our orders of raw materials, parts, components and subassemblies are based on demand forecasts, a significant percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed and based in part on expectations of future net sales. If a sudden decrease in demand for our products from one or more customers were to occur, the inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for any shortfall would magnify the adverse impact of a shortfall in net sales on our results of operations. Conversely, if market conditions were to unexpectedly recover and demand for our products were to increase suddenly, we might not be able to respond quickly enough, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations and customer relations. The industries in which we compete are subject to volatile and unpredictable cycles. As a supplier to the global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar and related industries, we are subject to business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict. These industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes in customers manufacturing capacity requirements and spending, which depend in part on capacity utilization, demand for customers products, inventory levels relative to demand and access to affordable capital. These changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers purchases and investments in technology, and continue to affect our orders, net sales, operating expenses and net income. In addition, we may not be able to respond adequately or quickly to the declines in demand by reducing our costs. We may be required to record significant reserves for excess and obsolete inventory as demand for our products changes. 12 Table of Contents To meet rapidly changing demand in each of the industries we serve, we must effectively manage our resources and production capacity. During periods of decreasing demand for our products, we must be able to appropriately align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage our supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. During periods of increasing demand, we must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage our supply chain; and attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified individuals. If we are not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes in our business environment or to accurately assess where we are positioned within a business cycle, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Cyclicality in the semiconductor equipment industry impacts our results of operations. Our business is affected by the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn is affected by the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products using integrated circuits. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has experienced periodic and severe downturns and upturns. Business conditions, therefore, historically have changed rapidly and unpredictably. Fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers could continue to materially affect our revenues and operating results. Where appropriate, we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, which sometimes result in restructuring charges. Even during periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which may have a temporary adverse effect on our results of operations. During periods of increased demand, we may have difficulty obtaining sufficient components and subassemblies or increasing production quickly enough to meet our customers requirements. We are exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the solar inverter industry. A significant portion of our business is in the emerging solar inverter market, which, in addition to the general industry changes described above in the risk factor The industries in which we compete are subject to volatile and unpredictable cycles, is also characterized by ongoing changes particular to the solar inverter industry. Our business is subject to changes in technology or demand for solar products arising from, among other things, adoption of our inverter products by our customers, compatibility of our solar inverter technology with our customers products or certain solar panel providers, customers and end-users access to affordable financial capital, the cost and performance of solar technology compared to other energy sources, the adequacy of or changes in government energy policies, including the availability and amount of government incentives for solar power, the continuation of renewable portfolio standards and the extent of investment or participation in solar by utilities or other companies that generate, transmit or distribute power to end users. There is also increased market volatility as the size of utility scale solar projects is increasing to hundreds of megawatts of capacity. Such large scale solar projects require significant financial resources on our part should we be selected as the supplier for solar inverters. We are beginning to see requirements in the solar industry for performance guarantees related to solar inverters and associated liquidated damages provisions. This could result in financial exposure for our business if our solar inverters do not meet reliability or uptime requirements. Lastly, customers using our solar inverters are beginning to evaluate multi-year service agreements from us for onsite maintenance and support of our inverters and even the solar site. These agreements, however, are subject to annual renewal and may not be renewed by the customers. If we do not successfully manage the risks resulting from these ongoing changes occurring in the solar industry, we may miss out on substantial opportunities for revenue and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 13 Table of Contents Businesses, consumers and utilities might not adopt alternative energy solutions as a means for providing or obtaining their electricity and power needs. On-site distributed power generation solutions, such as PV systems, which utilize our inverter products, provide an alternative means for obtaining electricity and are relatively new methods of obtaining electrical power that businesses, consumers and utilities may not adopt at levels sufficient to grow this part of our business. Traditional electricity distribution is based on the regulated industry model whereby businesses and consumers obtain their electricity from a government regulated utility. For alternative methods of distributed power to succeed, businesses, consumers and utilities must adopt new purchasing practices and must be willing to rely upon less traditional means of providing and purchasing electricity. As larger solar projects come online, utilities are becoming increasingly concerned with grid stability, power management and the predictable loading of such power onto the grid. We cannot be certain that businesses, consumers and utilities will choose to utilize on-site distributed power at levels sufficient to sustain our business in this area. The development of a mass market for our products may be impacted by many factors which are out of our control, including:  market acceptance of PV systems that incorporate our solar inverter products;  the cost competitiveness of these systems;  regulatory requirements; and  the emergence of newer, more competitive technologies and products. If a mass market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate, we may be unable to recover the costs we will have incurred to develop these products. We might make substantial capital expenditures and commitments to meet anticipated demand for our solar inverters. We have invested and will continue to invest significant human and financial resources in the development, marketing and sale of our solar inverters. To increase our manufacturing capacity for our solar inverters in order to meet anticipated demand, we have purchased equipment, leased new facilities and made other capital expenditures and commitments. Commitments for capital expenditures to support our solar inverters totaled $0.6 million at December 31, 2010. These additional expenditures and commitments have increased, and may continue to increase, our overhead expenses during a time when our operations are not fully absorbing current overhead expenses. The impact could lower gross margins until such time that revenue related to sale of our solar inverters can fully absorb overhead expenses. As mentioned above, we have experienced a shortage of components for our solar inverters that could affect our ability to manufacture products and systems. We and other participants in the industry have seen shortages of insulated gate bipolar transistors, capacitors, switchgear and other discrete electrical components. To mitigate the risk of not having such critical parts, we pro-actively make additional purchases which we believe addresses such risk. A significant portion of our sales and accounts receivable are concentrated among a few customers. Our ten largest customers accounted for 48.8% of our sales in 2010, 51.6% of our sales in 2009, and 52.1% of our sales in 2008. Applied Materials Inc., our largest customer, accounted for 18.8% of our sales in 2010, 21.4% of our sales in 2009, and 21.8% of our sales in 2008. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of our sales during 2010, 2009 or 2008. At December 31, 2010 our accounts receivable from ULVAC, Inc. comprised 10.5% of our total accounts receivable. At December 31, 2009 our accounts receivable from Applied Materials, Inc. represented 15.6% of our total accounts receivable. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2010 or 2009. If we were to lose any of our significant customers or suffer a material reduction in their purchase orders, revenue could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 14 Table of Contents Market pressures may reduce or eliminate our profitability. Our customers continually exert pressure on us to reduce our prices and extend payment terms. Given the nature of our customer base and the highly competitive markets in which we compete, we may be required to reduce our prices or extend payment terms to remain competitive. We may not be able to reduce our expenses in an amount sufficient to offset potential margin declines. The decrease in cash flow could adversely impact our financial condition. If we are unable to adjust our business strategy successfully for some of our product lines to reflect the increasing price sensitivity on the part of our customers, our business and financial condition could be harmed. Our business strategy for many of our product lines has been focused on product performance and technology innovation to provide enhanced efficiencies and productivity. As a result of recent economic conditions and changes in various markets that we serve, our customers have experienced significant cost pressures. We have observed increased price sensitivity on the part of our customers. If competition against any of our product lines should come to focus solely on price rather than on product performance and technology innovation, we will need to adjust our business strategy and product offerings accordingly and, if we are unable to do so, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We face substantial competition, primarily from established companies, some of which have greater financial, marketing and technical resources than we do. We expect our competitors will continue to develop new products in direct competition with ours, improve the design and performance of their products and introduce new products with enhanced performance characteristics. To remain competitive, we must improve and expand our products and product offerings. In addition, we may need to maintain a high level of investment in research and development and expand our sales and marketing efforts, particularly outside of the United States. We might not be able to make the technological advances and investments necessary to remain competitive. If we were unable to improve and expand our products and product offerings, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our competitive position could be weakened if we are unable to convince end users to specify that our products be used in the equipment sold by our customers. The end users in our markets may direct equipment manufacturers to use a specified suppliers product in their equipment at a particular facility. This occurs with frequency because our products are critical in manufacturing process control for thin-film applications. Our success therefore, depends in part on our ability to have end users specify that our products be used at their facilities. In addition, we may encounter difficulties in changing established relationships of competitors that already have a large installed base of products within such facilities. We must achieve design wins to retain our existing customers and to obtain new customers, although design wins achieved do not necessarily result in substantial sales. The constantly changing nature of technology in the markets we serve causes equipment manufacturers to continually design new systems. We must work with these manufacturers early in their design cycles to modify our equipment or design new equipment to meet the requirements of their new systems. Manufacturers typically choose one or two vendors to provide the components for use with the early system shipments. Selection as one of these vendors is called a design win. It is critical that we achieve these design wins in order to retain existing customers and to obtain new customers. 15 Table of Contents We believe that equipment manufacturers often select their suppliers based on factors including long-term relationships and end user demand. Accordingly, we may have difficulty achieving design wins from equipment manufacturers who are not currently our customers. In addition, we must compete for design wins for new systems and products of our existing customers, including those with whom we have had long-term relationships. Our efforts to achieve design wins are time consuming and expensive, and may not be successful. If we are not successful in achieving design wins, or if we do achieve design wins but our customers systems that utilize our products are not successful, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. Once a manufacturer chooses a component for use in a particular product, it is likely to retain that component for the life of that product. Our sales and growth could experience material and prolonged adverse effects if we fail to achieve design wins. However, design wins do not always result in substantial sales, as sales of our products are dependent upon our customers sales of their products. Our products may suffer from defects or errors leading to damage or warranty claims. Our products use complex system designs and components that may contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions. If any of our products are defective, we might be required to redesign or recall those products or pay damages or warranty claims and suffer significant harm to our reputation. We accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services, including the cost of technical support, product repairs, and product replacement for units that cannot be repaired. Our estimate of costs to fulfill our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions. To the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, our warranty accrual will increase, resulting in decreased gross profit. We conduct manufacturing at only a few sites and our sites are not generally interchangeable. Our power products for the semiconductor industry are manufactured in Shenzhen, PRC. Our thermal instrumentation products that are used in the semiconductor industry are manufactured in Vancouver, Washington. Each facility manufactures different products and, therefore, is not interchangeable. Natural or other uncontrollable occurrences at any of our manufacturing facilities could significantly reduce our productivity at such site and could prevent us from meeting our customers requirements in a timely manner, or at all. Our losses from any such occurrence could significantly affect our operations and results of operations for a prolonged period of time. Our PV Powered solar inverters are manufactured in Bend, Oregon and we have entered into a contract manufacturing relationship in Canada. Our Solaron inverter products are manufactured at our Fort Collins, Colorado facility and we have entered into contract manufacturing relationships in the PRC and Canada as well. While manufacturing could be shifted to a different manufacturing location for the Solaron and PV Powered inverters if a natural or other uncontrollable occurrence occurred, it may take significant time to transition to another site and delivery times and costs would likely increase preventing us from meeting our customers requirements in a timely manner, or at all. To the extent that local content requirements exist, we may also be limited in such transitions. We are subject to risks inherent in international operations. Sales to our customers outside the United States were approximately 41.1% of our total sales in 2010, 55.9% in 2009, and 57.1% in 2008. Our success producing goods internationally and competing in international markets is subject to our ability to manage various risks and difficulties, including, but not limited to:  our ability to effectively manage our employees at remote locations who are operating in different business environments from the United States;  our ability to develop and maintain relationships with suppliers and other local businesses; 16 Table of Contents  compliance with product safety requirements and standards that are different from those of the United States;  variations and changes in laws applicable to our operations in different jurisdictions, including enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights;  trade restrictions, political instability, disruptions in financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions;  customs regulations and the import and export of goods (including, but not limited to, any United States imposition of antidumping or countervailing duty orders, safeguards, remedies or compensation with respect to our products or subcomponents of our products, particularly those produced in the PRC);  the ability to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations;  our ability to obtain business licenses that may be needed in international locations to support expanded operations;  timely collecting accounts receivable from foreign customers including $67.7 million in accounts receivable from foreign customers as of December 31, 2010 ; and  changes in tariffs, taxes and foreign currency exchange rates. Our profitability and ability to implement our business strategies, maintain market share and compete successfully in international markets will be compromised if we are unable to manage these and other international risks successfully. Our operations in the Peoples Republic of China are subject to significant political and economic uncertainties over which we have little or no control and may be unable to alter our business practice in time to avoid reductions in revenues. A significant portion of our operations outside the United States are located in the PRC, which exposes us to risks, such as exchange controls and currency restrictions, changes in local economic conditions, changes in PRC laws and regulations, possible expropriation or other PRC government actions, and unsettled political conditions. These factors may have a material adverse effect on our operations, business, results of operations and financial condition. The PRCs economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including with respect to the amount of government involvement, level of development, rate of growth, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. While the economy of the PRC has experienced significant growth in the past 20 years, growth has been uneven across different regions and among various economic sectors of the PRC. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic development and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall economy of the PRC, but may also have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us. We transitioned a significant amount of our supply base to Asian suppliers. We transitioned the purchasing of a substantial portion of components for our thin film products, and continue to consider transitioning additional purchasing related to our solar inverters to Asian suppliers to lower our materials costs and shipping expenses. These components might require us to incur higher than anticipated testing or repairing costs, which would have an adverse effect on our operating results. Customers who have strict and extensive qualification requirements might not accept our products if these lower-cost components do not meet their requirements. A delay or refusal by our customers to accept such products, as well as an inability of our suppliers to meet our purchasing requirements, might require us to purchase higher-priced components from our existing suppliers or might cause us to lose sales to these customers, either of 17 Table of Contents which could lead to decreased revenue and gross margins and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We have entered into contract manufacturing relationships with international suppliers for certain of our inverter products. We have entered into contract manufacturing relationships with well-established suppliers in Canada and the PRC for the manufacture of certain of our inverters. These relationships will facilitate our compliance with localization requirements in some world regions where incentives and benefits are granted for local manufacturing. These relationships will also afford us a more flexible manufacturing capacity, thereby enabling us to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace for our inverter products. These partners, working closely with us, will in turn be developing a common supply chain for the components that are incorporated into our inverters. While we believe that our contract manufacturers are qualified to manufacture these inverters for us, we may need to address short-term quality and delivery scheduling issues as we develop this new supply chain for these inverters. If we were to encounter significant quality or delivery schedule concerns it might materially and adversely affect our relationships with customers for these inverters and our results of operations. As with many contract manufacturing relationships, costs may be incurred if manufacturing capacity is not fully utilized. Changes in tax rules, tax liabilities or utilization of our deferred tax assets could materially affect our results. Our future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the applicable tax laws, composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates or our valuation and utilization of net deferred tax assets. In the second half of 2009, we reconfigured our legal entity structure to realign our Chinese manufacturing operations with the intellectual property utilized in such manufacturing. On December 31, 2009, we transferred the economic rights to our patents and know-how from other affiliates throughout the world, including the parent company. In general, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates and reserves against deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions are reasonable, including those relied upon in the execution of our entity restructuring, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our current or historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Feed-in tariff and other subsidy cuts could impact revenue growth in the renewable energy markets. Feed-in tariffs have been a significant driver in the growth of the solar industry, with countries throughout the world providing incentives to spur adoption of renewable energy. While many countries are beginning to adopt feed-in tariffs and varying subsidies, others are re-evaluating the level of incentive they wish to provide. Recently, a number of countries have proposed reductions to their feed-in tariffs. As new political parties take office in countries throughout the world, agendas on renewable energy and governments desire or ability to provide incentives may shift or change. Proposed feed-in tariff reductions in regions in which we do significant business could negatively affect the results of our operations. Such a reduction in the feed-in tariff, including any potential further reductions, could result in a significant decline in demand and price levels for renewable energy products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations may lead to lower operating margins, or may cause us to raise prices, which could result in reduced sales. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations and we could experience losses with respect to forward exchange contracts into which we may enter. Unfavorable currency fluctuations could require us to increase prices to foreign customers, which could 18 Table of Contents result in lower net sales by us to such customers. Alternatively, if we do not adjust the prices for our products in response to unfavorable currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, most sales made by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the currency of the country in which these products are sold and the currency they receive in payment for such sales could be less valuable at the time of receipt as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. From time to time, we enter into forward exchange contracts and local currency purchased options to reduce currency exposure arising from intercompany sales of inventory. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be adequate to protect us against significant currency fluctuations or that such efforts will not expose us to additional exchange rate risks, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Changes in the value of the Chinese yuan could impact the cost of our operation in Shenzhen, PRC. The PRC government is continually pressured by its trading partners to allow its currency to float in a manner similar to other major currencies. Any change in the value of the Chinese yuan may impact our ability to control the cost of our products in the world market. Specifically, the decision by the PRC government to allow the yuan to begin to float against the United States dollar could significantly increase the labor and other costs incurred in the operation of our Shenzhen facility and the cost of raw materials, parts, components and subassemblies that we source in the PRC, thereby having a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are highly dependent on our intellectual property. Our success depends significantly on our proprietary technology. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents and non-disclosure agreements; however, we might not be able to protect our technology, and competitors might be able to develop similar technology independently. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries might not afford our intellectual property the same protections as do the laws of the United States. Our intellectual property is not protected by patents in several countries in which we do business, and we have limited patent protection in other countries, including the PRC. The cost of applying for patents in foreign countries and translating the applications into foreign languages requires us to select carefully the inventions for which we apply for patent protection and the countries in which we seek such protection. Generally, our efforts to obtain international patents have been concentrated in the European Union and certain industrialized countries in Asia, including Korea, Japan and Taiwan. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The PRC commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared to the commercial law in the United States. Limited protection of intellectual property is available under PRC law. Consequently, manufacturing our products in the PRC may subject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties may attempt to copy our products or otherwise obtain or use our intellectual property. We cannot give assurance that we will be able to protect our intellectual property rights effectively or have adequate legal recourse in the event that we encounter infringements of our intellectual property in the PRC. We have been, and in the future may again be, involved in litigation. Litigation is costly and could result in further restrictions on our ability to conduct business or an inability to prevent others from using technology or make use of market relationships we have developed. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our commercial or property rights, to defend ourselves against claimed violations of such rights or to protect our interests in regulatory disputes or similar matters. Litigation often requires substantial management time and attention, as well as financial and other resources, including:  substantial costs in the form of legal fees, fines and royalty payments;  restrictions on our ability to sell certain products or in certain markets;  an inability to prevent others from using technology we have developed; and  a need to redesign products or seek alternative marketing strategies. 19 Table of Contents Any of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Funds associated with our marketable securities that we have traditionally held as short-term investments may not be liquid or readily available. In the past, certain of our investments have been affected by external market conditions that impacted the liquidity of the investment. We do not currently have investments with reduced liquidity, but external market conditions that we cannot anticipate or mitigate may impact the liquidity of our marketable securities. We plan to increase the variety of our investments during 2011. The lack of liquidity associated with these investments may require us to borrow funds at terms that are not favorable or repatriate cash from international locations at a significant cost. We cannot be certain that we will be able to borrow funds or continue to repatriate cash, on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to do so, our available cash may be reduced until those investments can be liquidated. The lack of available cash may prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise and may prevent us from executing some of our business plans, either of which could cause our business, financial condition or results of operations to be materially and adversely affected. Our intangible assets may become impaired. We currently have $48.4 million of goodwill and $48.4 million in intangible assets. We periodically review the estimated useful lives of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in either a diminished fair value or, for intangible assets, a revised useful life. The events and circumstances include significant changes in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators and competition. Any impairment or revised useful life could have a material and adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations, and could harm the trading price of our common stock. We are subject to numerous governmental regulations. We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign regulations, including environmental regulations and regulations relating to the design and operation of our products and control systems. We might incur significant costs as we seek to ensure that our products meet safety and emissions standards, many of which vary across the states and countries in which our products are used. In the past, we have invested significant resources to redesign our products to comply with these directives. Compliance with future regulations, directives and standards could require us to modify or redesign some products, make capital expenditures or incur substantial costs. If we do not comply with current or future regulations, directives and standards:  we could be subject to fines;  our production or shipments could be suspended; and  we could be prohibited from offering particular products in specified markets. If we were unable to comply with current or future regulations, directives and standards our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Recently enacted financial reform legislation will result in new laws and regulations that may increase our costs of operations. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) was enacted. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many months or years. The Dodd-Frank Act includes a requirement for disclosure regarding certain minerals necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured by reporting companies. Complying 20 Table of Contents with this disclosure requirement and other requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act may increase our costs of operations. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate for reasons over which we have no control. The stock market has from time to time experienced, and is likely to continue to experience, extreme price and volume fluctuations. Prices of securities of technology companies have been especially volatile and have often fluctuated for reasons that are unrelated to their operating performance. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we were the subject of securities class action litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources. Our Chairman of the Board owns a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock, which could enable him to influence our business and affairs, and future sales of our common stock by our Chairman of the Board may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Douglas S. Schatz, our Chairman of the Board, beneficially owned approximately 9.9% of our outstanding common stock as of March 1, 2011. This stockholding gives Mr. Schatz significant voting power and influence. Depending on the number of shares that abstain or otherwise are not voted on a particular matter, Mr. Schatz may be able to influence our business affairs for the foreseeable future in a manner with which our other stockholders may not agree. In addition, the sale of a substantial amount of the shares beneficially owned by him could negatively affect the market price of our common stock. The loss of any of our key personnel could significantly harm our results of operations and competitive position. Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of our key management, technical, marketing and sales employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining our key employees or that we can attract or retain additional skilled personnel as required. Many of the stock options held by our employees have exercise prices that are higher than the current trading price of our common stock, and these underwater options do not serve their purpose as incentives for our employees to remain with the Company. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could significantly harm our results of operations and competitive position. Activities necessary to integrate acquisitions may result in costs in excess of current expectations or be less successful than anticipated. We recently acquired PV Powered, Inc., and we may acquire other businesses in the future. The success of such transactions will depend on, among other things, our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to apply our internal controls process to these acquired businesses. The integration of acquisitions may require significant attention from our management, and the diversion of managements attention and resources could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business. Furthermore, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipated when we first enter into the acquisition transaction. If actual integration costs are higher than amounts originally anticipated, if we are unable to integrate the assets and personnel acquired in an acquisition as anticipated, or if we are unable to fully benefit from anticipated synergies, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The disposition of the Aera® mass flow control business and related product lines may impact our ongoing business relationships. We recently sold our gas flow control business, which includes our Aera® mass flow control and related product lines and real property in Japan to Hitachi Metals, Ltd. (Hitachi Metals). Our business may be impacted by unforeseen difficulties in transitioning the gas flow control business, customers or suppliers to 21 Table of Contents Hitachi Metals. As part of the transition of this product line to Hitachi Metals, we have agreed to provide (i) cost-plus contract manufacturing services for a period of twelve months (with a potential one-time extension of six months), (ii) supplemental information technology and customer order processing services for up to six months, and (iii) sales support and materials procurement services (along with access to certain engineering tools) for a period of up to three months. We also are required to work with Hitachi Metals contractors with respect to the creation of an enterprise resource planning system for Hitachi Metals, to manage the acquired product lines. Our provision of these transition services requires diversion of management attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our own business and operations. Further, we continue to sell or seek to sell other products and services to customers who are expected to purchase mass flow control and products from Hitachi Metals. Some of these customers are significant customers of the product lines we retained. If Hitachi Metals is unsuccessful in its integration of the gas flow control business into its business or otherwise is unable to keep our mutual customers satisfied, such customers may reduce or discontinue their purchases of our products as well, which reductions or discontinuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations.
