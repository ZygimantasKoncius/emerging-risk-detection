Item 1a. Risk Factors An investment in the Corporations common stock is subject to risks inherent to the Corporations business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Corporation are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Corporation. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on, or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the Corporations business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Corporations financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of the Corporations common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related To The Corporations Business The Corporation is subject to interest rate risk. The Corporations earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Corporations control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest the Corporation receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) the Corporations ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of the Corporations financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of the Corporations mortgage-backed securities portfolio. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates 10 received on loans and other investments, the Corporations net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the Corporations results of operations, any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Corporations financial condition and results of operations. The Corporation is subject to lending risk There are inherent risks associated with the Corporations lending activities. These risks include, among other things, the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where the Corporation operates as well as those across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the United States. Increases in interest rates and/or weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans. The Corporation is also subject to various laws and regulations that affect its lending activities. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject the Corporation to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment of significant civil money penalties against the Corporation. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 17% of the Corporations loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial loans. These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or consumer loans. These types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans. Because the Corporations loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and industrial loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non-performing loans. An increase in non-performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for possible loan losses and an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporations financial condition and results of operations. If the Corporations allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, its earnings could decrease. The Corporations loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of their loans, and the collateral securing the payment of their loans may be insufficient to assure repayment. The Corporation may experience 11 significant credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results. The Corporation makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of its loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of its borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of its loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, the Corporation reviews its loans and its loss and delinquency experience, and the Corporation evaluates economic conditions. If its assumptions prove to be incorrect, its allowance for loan losses may not cover inherent losses in its loan portfolio at the date of its financial statements. Material additions to the Corporations allowance would materially decrease its net income. At December 31, 2005, its allowance for loan losses totaled $ 2,129,000, representing 0.93% of its total loans. Although the Corporation believes it has underwriting standards to manage normal lending risks, it is difficult to assess the future performance of its loan portfolio due to the relatively recent origination of many of these loans. The Corporation can give you no assurance that its non-performing loans will not increase or that its non-performing or delinquent loans will not adversely affect its future performance. In addition, federal and state regulators periodically review the Corporations allowance for loan losses and may require it to increase its allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in its allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition. The Corporation is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities A significant portion of the Corporations loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, the Corporation may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, the Corporation may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require the Corporation to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected propertys value or limit the Corporations ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the Corporations exposure to environmental liability. Although the Corporation has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be 12 sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the Corporations financial condition and results of operations. The Corporations profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania The Corporations success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the specific local markets in which the Corporation operates. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, the Corporation provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in the Franklin County, Pennsylvania and Washington County, Maryland area. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for the Corporations products and services as well as the ability of the Corporations customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of the Corporations deposit funding sources. A significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences, unemployment, changes in securities markets or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the Corporations financial condition and results of operations. Competition from other financial institutions may adversely affect the Corporations profitability. The Corporations banking subsidiary faces substantial competition in originating, both commercial and consumer loans. This competition comes principally from other banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking companies and other lenders. Many of its competitors enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources and higher lending limits, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives, as well as lower origination and operating costs. This competition could reduce the Corporations net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that its banking subsidiary originate and the interest rates they may charge on these loans. In attracting business and consumer deposits, its banking subsidiary faces substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks, savings institutions and credit unions, as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives, including money market funds. Many of the Corporations competitors enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources, more aggressive marketing campaigns, better brand recognition and more convenient 13 branch locations. These competitors may offer higher interest rates than the Corporation, which could decrease the deposits that it attracts or require it to increase its rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. Increased deposit competition could adversely affect the Corporations ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations. As a result, it may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain and could increase its cost of funds. The Corporations banking subsidiary also competes with non-bank providers of financial services, such as brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, credit unions, insurance agencies and governmental organizations which may offer more favorable terms. Some of its non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern its banking operations. As a result, such non-bank competitors may have advantages over the Corporations banking subsidiary in providing certain products and services. This competition may reduce or limit its margins on banking services, reduce its market share and adversely affect its earnings and financial condition. The Corporation is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision The Corporation, primarily through the Bank, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not shareholders. These regulations affect the Corporations lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect the Corporation in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject the Corporation to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products the Corporation may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporations business, financial condition and results of operations. While the Corporation has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur. 14 The Corporations controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented Management regularly reviews and updates the Corporations internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the Corporations controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Corporations business, results of operations and financial condition. New lines of business or new products and services may subject the corporation to additional risks From time to time, the Corporation may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services the Corporation may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the Corporations system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the Corporations business, results of operations and financial condition. The Corporations ability to pay dividends depends primarily on dividends from its banking subsidiary, which is subject to regulatory limits. The Corporation is a bank holding company and its operations are conducted by its subsidiary. Its ability to pay dividends depends on its receipt of dividends from its subsidiary. Dividend payments from its banking subsidiary are subject to legal and regulatory limitations, generally based on net profits and retained earnings, imposed by the various banking regulatory agencies. The ability of its subsidiary to pay dividends is also subject to its profitability, financial condition, capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements. There is no assurance that its subsidiary will be able to pay dividends in the future or that the Corporation will generate adequate cash flow to pay dividends in the future. The Corporations failure to pay dividends on its common stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of its common stock. 15 The Corporations future acquisitions could dilute your ownership and may cause it to become more susceptible to adverse economic events. The Corporation may use its common stock to acquire other companies or make investments in banks and other complementary businesses with its common stock in the future. The Corporation may issue additional shares of common stock to pay for future acquisitions, which would dilute your ownership interest in the Corporation. Future business acquisitions could be material to the Corporation, and the degree of success achieved in acquiring and integrating these businesses into the Corporation could have a material effect on the value of the Corporations common stock. In addition, any acquisition could require it to use substantial cash or other liquid assets or to incur debt. In those events, it could become more susceptible to economic downturns and competitive pressures. The Corporation May Not Be Able To Attract and Retain Skilled People The Corporations success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by the Corporation can be intense and the Corporation may not be able to hire people or to retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of the Corporations key personnel could have a material adverse impact on the Corporations business because of their skills, knowledge of the Corporations market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. The Corporation does not currently have employment agreements or non-competition agreements with any of its senior officers. The Corporations information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security The Corporation relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the Corporations customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While the Corporation has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of its information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of the Corporations information systems could damage the Corporations reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Corporation to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose the Corporation to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporations financial condition and results of operations. 16 The Corporation continually encounters technological change The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Corporations future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Corporations operations. Many of the Corporations competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Corporation may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the Corporations business and, in turn, the Corporations financial condition and results of operations. The Corporation is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility From time to time, customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to the Corporations performance of its fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to the Corporations performance of its fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Corporation they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of the Corporation and its products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on the Corporations business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporations financial condition and results of operations. Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the corporations business Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Corporations ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of the Corporations deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Corporation to incur additional expenses. Severe weather or natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events may occur in the future. Although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such 17 event could have a material adverse effect on the Corporations business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporations financial condition and results of operations. Risks Associated With The Corporations Common Stock The Corporations stock price can be volatile Stock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive. The Corporations stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:  Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations.  Recommendations by securities analysts.  Operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the Corporation.  News reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry.  Perceptions in the marketplace regarding the Corporation and/or its competitors.  New technology used, or services offered, by competitors.  Significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving the Corporation or its competitors.  Failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions.  Changes in government regulations.  Geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts. General market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause the Corporations stock price to decrease regardless of operating results. The trading volume in the Corporations common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies The Corporations common stock is listed for trading on OTCBB, and the trading volume in its common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of the Corporations common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which the Corporation has no control. Given 18 the lower trading volume of the Corporations common stock, significant sales of the Corporations common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause the Corporations stock price to fall. An investment in the Corporations common stock is not an insured deposit The Corporations common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in the Corporations common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, if you acquire the Corporations common stock, you may lose some or all of your investment. The Corporations Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws and Shareholders Rights Plan as well as certain banking laws may have an anti-takeover effect Provisions of the Corporations articles of incorporation and by-laws, federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, and the Corporations stock purchase rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Corporation, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to the Corporations shareholders. The combination of these provisions effectively inhibits a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of the Corporations common stock. Risks Associated With The Corporations Industry Future governmental regulation and legislation could limit the Corporations future growth. The Corporation is a registered bank holding company, and its subsidiary bank is a depository institution whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). As a result, the Corporation is subject to various regulations and examinations by various regulatory authorities. In general, statutes establish the corporate governance and eligible business activities for the Corporation, certain acquisition and merger restrictions, limitations on inter-company transactions such as loans and dividends, and capital adequacy requirements, requirements for anti-money laundering programs and other compliance matters, among other regulations. The Corporation is extensively regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole. Compliance with these statutes and regulations is important to its ability to engage in new activities and to consummate additional acquisitions. 19 In addition, the Corporation is subject to changes in federal and state tax laws as well as changes in banking and credit regulations, accounting principles and governmental economic and monetary policies. The Corporation cannot predict whether any of these changes may adversely and materially affect it. Federal and state banking regulators also possess broad powers to take supervisory actions as they deem appropriate. These supervisory actions may result in higher capital requirements, higher insurance premiums and limitations on the Corporations activities that could have a material adverse effect on its business and profitability. While these statutes are generally designed to minimize potential loss to depositors and the FDIC insurance funds, they do not eliminate risk, and compliance with such statutes increases the Corporations expense, requires managements attention and can be a disadvantage from a competitive standpoint with respect to non-regulated competitors. The earnings of financial services companies are significantly affected by general business and economic conditions The Corporations operations and profitability are impacted by general business and economic conditions in the United States and abroad. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, money supply, political issues, legislative and regulatory changes, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, broad trends in industry and finance, and the strength of the U.S. economy and the local economies in which the Corporation operates, all of which are beyond the Corporations control. Deterioration in economic conditions could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and non-performing assets, decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for the Corporations products and services, among other things, any of which could have a material adverse impact on the Corporations financial condition and results of operations. Financial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, the Corporation may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. The Corporation may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on the Corporations business and, in turn, the Corporations financial condition and results of operations. 20 Consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions Technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as disintermediation, could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on the Corporations financial condition and results of operations. Item 1b.
