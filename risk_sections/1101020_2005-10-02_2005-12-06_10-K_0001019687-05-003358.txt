ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS ------------ OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE FOOD INDUSTRY MAY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. The food industry is highly competitive, and our continued success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry. We face competition in all of our markets from large, national companies and smaller, regional operators. Some of our competitors, including other diversified food companies, are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do. From time to time, we experience price pressure in certain of our markets as a result of competitors' promotional pricing practices as well as market conditions generally. Our ability to reduce costs is limited to the extent efficiencies have already been achieved. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains would weaken our competitive position. Competition is based on product quality, distribution effectiveness, brand loyalty, price, effective promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy emerging consumer preferences. We may not be able to effectively compete with these larger, more diversified companies. 2 THE LOSS OR CONSOLIDATION OF ANY OF OUR KEY CUSTOMERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS BY DECREASING OUR EXISTING SALES OPPORTUNITIES AND PRICES AND INCREASING OUR MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES. The largest purchasers of our products, Panda Restaurant Group, Inc. and Jenny Craig, Inc., accounted for approximately 31.1% and 19.0%, respectively, of our total net revenues during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2005. We expect that our sales to these customers will continue to constitute a significant percentage of our net revenues. The loss of either of these customers as an outlet for our products could adversely affect our competitive position and operating results. FUTURE DECLINES IN AIR TRAVEL AND BANKRUPTCIES OR OTHER FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OF OUR AIRLINE CUSTOMERS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES, COSTS AND COLLECTIONS. In fiscal year 2005, sales to airline customers were approximately $30.5 million, or 18.8% of total net revenues, as compared to sales of $29.2 million in fiscal year 2004 and $29.4 million in fiscal year 2003, representing 21.8% and 21.4% of total net revenues in fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Additionally, accounts receivable from airline-related customers accounted for approximately 20.8% and 33.3% of the total accounts receivable balance at October 2, 2005 and September 26, 2004, respectively. The events of September 11, 2001 significantly reduced our sales to airline customers during fiscal year 2003 and in the first half of fiscal year 2004. Two of our airline customers, Delta Airlines and Northwest Airlines, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in fiscal year 2005. Approximately $134,000 of Delta Airlines receivables was written-off in fiscal year 2005. Northwest Airlines' bankruptcy filing had no financial impact on us since our receivables are due from a financially stable independent third-party distributor. Given the financial stresses now facing the airline industry, we carefully monitor our receivables from all of our customers in this sector. The ongoing effect of these events on the airline industry, airline revenues, and on our business in particular, or the impact of a future occurrence of a similar event, cannot be accurately determined and could further adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows by, among other things, decreasing our sales to and making it more difficult to collect receivables from airline customers. WE ARE SUBJECT TO COST FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATIONS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. Our business operations may experience operating cost volatility caused by external conditions, market fluctuations and changes in governmental policies. Any substantial increase in our manufacturing or operating costs, if not offset by product price increases, hedging activities or improved efficiencies, may adversely affect our operating performance, business and financial condition. WE ARE A MAJOR PURCHASER OF MANY COMMODITIES THAT WE USE FOR RAW MATERIALS AND PACKAGING, AND PRICE CHANGES FOR THE COMMODITIES WE DEPEND ON MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. We enter into contracts for the purchase of raw materials at fixed prices, which are designed to protect us against raw material price increases during their term. However, when necessary, we attempt to recover our commodity cost increases by increasing prices, promoting a higher-margin product mix and creating additional operating efficiencies. Nevertheless, the raw materials used in our business are largely commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural programs. We also use paper products, such as corrugated cardboard, aluminum products, and films and plastics to package our products. Substantial increases in prices of packaging materials or higher prices of our raw materials could adversely affect our operating performance and financial results. Commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material and packaging costs, and we may be unable to increase our prices to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume, revenue and income. Any substantial fluctuation in the prices of raw materials, if not offset by increases in our sales prices, could adversely affect our profitability. 3 CONCERNS WITH THE SAFETY AND QUALITY OF FOOD PRODUCTS COULD CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO AVOID OUR PRODUCTS. We could be adversely affected if our customers and the ultimate consumers of our products lose confidence in the safety and quality of various food products. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, like the publicity about genetically modified organisms, "mad cow disease" and foot and mouth disease in Europe, whether or not valid, may discourage our customers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. Any negative change in customer perceptions about the safety and quality of our products could adversely affect our business and financial condition. IF OUR FOOD PRODUCTS BECOME ADULTERATED OR MISBRANDED, WE WOULD NEED TO RECALL THOSE ITEMS AND MAY EXPERIENCE PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS IF CONSUMERS ARE INJURED AS A RESULT. Food products occasionally contain contaminants due to inherent defects in those products or improper storage or handling. Under adverse circumstances, food manufacturers may need to recall some of their products if they become adulterated or misbranded and may also be liable if the consumption of any of their products causes injury. While we have never been required to recall any of our products and we maintain insurance that we believe is adequate to cover this type of loss, a widespread product recall could result in changes to one or more of our business processes, product shortages, a loss of customer confidence in our food, or other adverse effects on our business. If we are required to defend against a product liability claim, whether or not we are found liable under the claim, we could incur substantial costs, our reputation could suffer and our customers might substantially reduce their existing or future orders from us. OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. Food manufacturing operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local government entities and agencies. As a producer of food products for human consumption, our operations are subject to stringent production, packaging, quality, labeling and distribution standards, including regulations mandated by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. We cannot predict whether future regulation by various federal, state and local governmental entities and agencies would adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, our business operations and the past and present ownership and operation of our properties are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, the handling and disposition of wastes (including solid and hazardous wastes) or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. We cannot assure that environmental issues relating to presently known matters or identified sites or to other matters or sites will not require additional, currently unanticipated investigation, assessment or expenditures. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULTING IN DECREASED REVENUE. We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and competitive position. Accordingly, we devote what we believe are adequate resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and proprietary rights. We have taken actions to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights. However, these actions may be inadequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from claiming violations of their trademarks and proprietary rights by us. From time to time we license content from third parties. While we generally require adequate indemnifications, it is possible that in the future we could face infringement actions based upon the content licensed from these third parties. If any of these claims are proved valid, through litigation or otherwise, we may be required to do any of the following, which could adversely affect our business: 4 o cease using the third party trademarks; o develop our own proprietary marks; or o pay financial damages. SOME OF OUR SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIER CONTRACTS ARE SHORT-TERM. Some of our customers and suppliers operate through purchase orders or short-term contracts. Though we have long-term business relationships with many of our customers and suppliers, we cannot be sure that any of these customers or suppliers will continue to do business with us on the same basis. Additionally, though we try to renew these contracts as they come due, there can be no assurance that these customers or suppliers will renew the contracts on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. The termination of any number of these contracts may adversely affect our business and prospects, including our financial performance and results of operations. OUR COMMON STOCK PRICE IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY, WHICH COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES FOR INVESTORS. During the 52-week period ended December 5, 2005, the high and low sales prices of our common stock on Amex were $4.40 per share and $1.10 per share, respectively. Prices for our shares are determined in the marketplace and may accordingly be influenced by many factors, including, but not limited to: o the depth and liquidity of the market for the shares; o quarter-to-quarter variations in our operating results; o announcements about our performance as well as the announcements of our competitors about the performance of their business; o investors' evaluations of our future prospects and the food industry generally; o changes in earnings estimates by, or failure to meet the expectations of, securities analysts; o our dividend policy; and o general economic and market conditions. In addition, the stock market often experiences significant price fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is traded. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our shares. The price at which investors purchase shares of our common stock may not be indicative of the price that will prevail in the trading market. Investors may be unable to sell their shares of common stock at or above their purchase price, which may result in substantial losses. OUR FAILURE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. Our business requires managerial, financial and operational expertise, and our future success depends upon the continued service of key personnel. As a value-added manufacturer of quality frozen food products and custom prepared foods, we operate in a specialized industry. Our key personnel have experience and skills specific to this industry, and there are a limited number of individuals with the relevant experience and skills. Though we have employment agreements with Mr. Rudis and Mr. Steinbrun, each of these agreements provides for voluntary resignation on the part of the executive prior to the end of the term of the agreement. If we lose any of our key personnel, our business operations could be adversely affected. 5 THE LOSS OF CERTAIN OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WOULD CONSTITUTE A CHANGE IN CONTROL AND, THEREFORE, AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER OUR SECURITIES PURCHASE AND LOAN AGREEMENTS, AND WOULD LIKELY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. The loss of the services of Mr. Rudis or Mr. Steinbrun and other key personnel would likely adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition unless and until we were able to locate suitable replacements. In addition, our securities purchase and loan agreements with Levine Leichtman Capital Partners II, L.P. ("LLCP"), our senior subordinated creditor, and Pleasant Street Investors, LLC ("PSI"), our senior secured creditor, provide that a change in control would occur if Mr. Rudis or Mr. Steinbrun ceases to have certain management responsibilities in our business, or if Mr. Rudis does not continue to hold a minimum number of shares of our common stock. The occurrence of a change in control would permit LLCP to accelerate all indebtedness owing under the senior subordinated note we issued to it and would constitute an event of default under the securities purchase agreement. LLCP would then have the right to require us to immediately repay all of our obligations then owing to it. We may not have sufficient funds to repay this indebtedness upon an event of default. Accordingly, the occurrence of a change in control could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ANY FUTURE DEFAULTS UNDER OUR SECURITIES PURCHASE AND LOAN AGREEMENTS COULD RESULT IN INCREASES IN APPLICABLE INTEREST RATES, AN ACCELERATION OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND A FORECLOSURE ON OUR ASSETS. Substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral to secure our obligations to PSI and LLCP. We have been successful in obtaining waivers, curing defaults or renegotiating the terms of our securities purchase and loan and security agreements in the past. However, we may become in default or not in compliance with applicable terms in the future. If that occurs and we are unable to cure the defaults or non-compliance, obtain waivers or renegotiate terms, then the interest rates on our indebtedness would increase, our indebtedness could become immediately due and payable, and PSI and LLCP could foreclose on our assets. A SMALL GROUP OF STOCKHOLDERS BENEFICIALLY OWNS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND CONTROLS NOMINATIONS FOR UP TO FOUR SEATS ON OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. After giving effect to the shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of options and warrants and conversion of shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, our executive officers and directors and stockholders who own greater than 5% of our common stock would own, in the aggregate, approximately 59% of our outstanding common stock as of December 6, 2005. In addition, our amended investor rights agreement with LLCP provides that LLCP has the right to designate for nomination and election up to three members of our board of directors, together with the right to fill the first vacancy that was created on the board of directors after October 31, 2003. These stockholders, if acting together, could be able to significantly influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. OUR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION, OUR BYLAWS AND PROVISIONS OF NEVADA LAW COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR A THIRD PARTY TO ACQUIRE US, EVEN IF DOING SO COULD BE IN OUR STOCKHOLDERS' BEST INTEREST. Provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be in the best interest of our stockholders. It could be difficult for a potential bidder to acquire us because our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage takeover attempts. These provisions may limit stockholders' ability to approve a transaction that stockholders may think is in their best interests. These provisions include a requirement that certain procedures must be followed before matters can be proposed for consideration at meetings of our stockholders and also include the ability of our board of directors to fix the rights and preferences of an issue of shares of preferred stock without stockholder action. Provisions of Nevada's business combinations statute also restrict certain business combinations with interested stockholders. We have elected not to be governed by these provisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation. However, this election may not be effective unless we meet certain conditions under the Nevada statute. 6 The provisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Nevada law are intended to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with us and allow the board of directors the opportunity to consider alternative proposals in the interest of maximizing stockholder value. However, those provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS ------------------------- Not applicable.
