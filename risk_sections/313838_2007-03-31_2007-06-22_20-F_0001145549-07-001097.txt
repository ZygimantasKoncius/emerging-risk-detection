Item 4A. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects OPERATING RESULTS Operating Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2007 compared with the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2006 Overview Sonys sales and operating revenue (sales) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 increased 10.5 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. Sales within the Electronics segment, the Game segment and the Pictures segment increased while Financial Services revenue decreased. In the Electronics segment, although there was a decline in sales of such products as cathode ray tube (CRT) televisions, sales to outside customers increased 13.4 percent compared with the previous fiscal year mainly due to an increase in sales of liquid crystal display (LCD) televisions. Sales within the Game segment increased 6.1 percent compared to the previous fiscal year as a result of the launch of the PLAYSTATION®3 (PS3) in Japan, North America and Europe. In the Pictures segment, sales increased 29.5 percent compared to the previous fiscal year due to higher worldwide theatrical and home entertainment revenue from films released in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 as compared to those released in the previous fiscal year. Revenues decreased 12.6 percent within the Financial Services segment primarily due to lower valuation gains in the general account and the separate account at Sony Life, compared to the previous fiscal year, when there was a significant increase in the Japanese stock market. Operating income decreased 68.3 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. The operating income for the previous fiscal year included a one time net gain of 73.5 billion yen resulting from the transfer to the Japanese government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund, of which 64.5 billion yen was recorded within the Electronics segment. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, Sony recorded a 51.2 billion yen provision that relates to the recalls by Dell Inc., Apple Inc. and Lenovo, Inc. of notebook computer battery packs that use lithium-ion battery cells manufactured by Sony and the subsequent global replacement program initiated by Sony for certain notebook computer battery packs used by Sony and several other notebook computer manufacturers that use lithium-ion battery cells manufactured by Sony. Despite the recording of this provision, operating income within the Electronics segment increased 2,167.4 percent mainly as a result of an increase in sales to outside customers and a positive impact from the depreciation of the yen versus the U.S. dollar and the Euro. In the Game segment, an operating loss was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 as a result of the sale of the PS3 at strategic price points lower than its production cost during the introductory period. In the Pictures segment, operating income increased 55.7 percent compared with the previous fiscal year due to strong worldwide theatrical and home entertainment revenue on feature films released in the current fiscal year. In the Financial Services segment, operating income decreased 55.3 percent compared with the previous fiscal year as a result of decreased valuation gains from investments in the general account, including valuation gains from convertible bonds at Sony Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (Sony Life). Operating income in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 included a gain on the sale of a portion of the site of Sonys former headquarters in the amount of 21.7 billion yen, of which 2.6 billion yen was recorded within All 31 Table of Contents Other and the remaining amount was recorded in Corporate. Operating income related to an additional gain on sale for the remaining portion of the site under contract, which is expected to be recognized in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2008 is estimated to be approximately 59.0 billion yen, and this entire amount will be recorded in Corporate. Operating income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 was negatively affected by the recording of certain provisions for outstanding legal proceedings including the European Commissions investigation in connection with professional videotape claims, partially offset by the reversal of a portion of provisions related to the resolution of certain patent claims recorded in prior periods. Restructuring In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, Sony recorded restructuring charges of 38.8 billion yen, a decrease from the 138.7 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. The primary restructuring activities were in the Electronics segment. Of the total 38.8 billion yen, Sony recorded 10.8 billion yen in personnel-related costs including early retirement programs. Electronics Restructuring charges in the Electronics segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 were 37.4 billion yen, compared to 125.8 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Due to the worldwide market shrinkage as a result of demand shift from CRT televisions to LCD and plasma televisions, Sony has been implementing a worldwide plan to rationalize CRT and CRT television production facilities and has been downsizing its business over several years. As a part of this restructuring program, in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 Sony recorded a non-cash impairment charge of 1.7 billion yen for CRT television manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. The impairment charge was calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the present value of estimated future cash flows. The charge was recorded in loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net in the consolidated statements of income. While continuing to manufacture and sell CRT televisions in countries and territories where demand remains, Sony is actively shifting its focus in those areas to LCD televisions. As a result, Sony plans to cease manufacturing CRTs by March 2008, after it has stockpiled a sufficient quantity for future use. As a result of the contraction of the European rear projection television market, Sony has decided to discontinue the production of LCD rear projection televisions in Europe. In association with this action, Sony has recorded inventory writedowns and charges for supplier claims of 3.8 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, with most of these expenses being recorded as cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income. In addition to the above restructuring efforts, Sony undertook headcount reduction programs to further reduce operating costs in the Electronics segment. As a result of these programs, Sony recorded restructuring charges of 9.7 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, and these charges were included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The remaining liability balance as of March 31, 2007 was 7.2 billion yen and will be paid through the fiscal year ending March 31, 2008. For more detailed information about restructuring, please refer to Note 17 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 32 Table of Contents Operating Performance Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2006 2007 Percent change (Yen in billions) Sales and operating revenue 7,510.6 8,295.7 +10.5 % Operating income 226.4 71.8 −68.3 Income before income taxes 286.3 102.0 −64.4 Equity in net income of affiliated companies 13.2 78.7 +496.9 Net income 123.6 126.3 +2.2 Sales Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 increased by 785.1 billion yen, or 10.5 percent, to 8,295.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. A further breakdown of sales figures is presented under Operating Performance by Business Segment below. Sales in this analysis of the ratio of cost of sales, including research and development costs, and selling, general and administrative expenses to sales refers only to the net sales and other operating revenue portions of consolidated sales and operating revenue, and excludes financial service revenue. This is because financial service expenses are recorded separately from cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. The calculations of all ratios below that pertain to business segments include intersegment transactions. Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 increased by 738.2 billion yen, or 14.3 percent, to 5,889.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, and increased from 75.9 percent to 76.8 percent as a percentage of sales. Year on year, the cost of sales ratio decreased from 80.6 percent to 78.8 percent in the Electronics segment, increased from 80.4 percent to 102.8 percent in the Game segment, and increased from 60.2 percent to 60.3 percent in the Pictures segment. In the Electronics segment, there was an improvement in the cost of sales ratio for several products, in particular digital cameras, LCD televisions and video cameras. In the Game segment, there was a deterioration in the cost of sales ratio. This deterioration was primarily the result of the loss arising from the sale of the PS3 at strategic price points lower than its production cost during the introductory period, as well as the recording of other charges in association with preparation for the launch of the PS3 platform. In the Pictures segment, operating income increased due to substantially higher revenue. However, the cost of sales ratio was flat compared to the previous fiscal year due to the recording of production expenses associated with several new network television shows in the television business in the current fiscal year and the absence of a licensing agreement extension for Wheel of Fortune, which was recognized in the previous fiscal year. The personnel-related costs included in cost of sales were 457.3 billion yen, an increase of 1.0 billion yen, primarily recorded within the Electronics segment. Research and development costs (all research and development costs are included within cost of sales) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 increased by 12.1 billion yen to 543.9 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of research and development costs to sales was 7.1 percent compared to 7.8 percent in the previous fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 increased by 261.4 billion yen, or 17.1 percent, to 1,788.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales increased from 22.5 percent in the previous fiscal year to 23.3 percent. Year on year, the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales increased from 18.0 percent to 18.2 percent in the Electronics segment and from 18.7 percent to 20.0 percent in the Game segment. On the other hand, the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales decreased from 36.0 percent to 35.2 percent in the Pictures segment. 33 Table of Contents Personnel-related costs in selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 54.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year mainly due to the recording of a gain resulting from the transfer to the Japanese government of the substitutional portion of Sonys employee pension fund in the previous fiscal year. In addition, advertising and publicity expenses for the fiscal year increased by 86.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year primarily due to increased advertising and publicity expenses within the Pictures segment. Loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net was 5.8 billion yen, compared with 73.9 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. This decrease was mainly due to losses on the sale, disposal and impairment of CRT and CRT television production equipment in the Electronics segment, as well as an asset impairment write-down associated with the sale of the Metreon, a U.S. entertainment complex, in the previous fiscal year. Operating Income Operating income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 decreased by 154.7 billion yen, or 68.3 percent, to 71.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The operating income margin decreased from 3.0 percent to 0.9 percent. In descending order by amount of financial impact, the Electronics segment, Financial Services segment, the Pictures segment and All Other contributed to operating income. On the other hand, an operating loss was recorded within the Game segment primarily due to a loss arising from the sale of the PS3 at strategic price points lower than its production cost during the introductory period, as well as the recording of other charges in association with preparation for the launch of the PS3 platform. For a further breakdown of operating income (loss) for each segment, please refer to Operating Performance by Business Segment below. Other Income and Expenses For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, other income decreased by 23.3 billion yen, or 19.6 percent, to 95.2 billion yen, while other expenses increased by 6.4 billion yen, or 10.9 percent, to 64.9 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. The net amount of other income and other expenses was net other income of 30.3 billion yen, a decrease of 29.6 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. The gain on change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees decreased by 29.3 billion yen, or 48.2 percent compared to the previous fiscal year, to 31.5 billion yen. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, there was a gain recorded on the sale of a portion of the stock held in StylingLife Holdings Inc. (StylingLife). However, the total gain on change in ownership interests declined as Sony recorded a gain on change in interest of 60.8 billion yen in the previous fiscal year resulting from the initial public offering of So-net Entertainment Corporation (So-net), and the sale of a portion of the stock held in both Monex Beans Holdings, Inc., and So-net M3 Inc., a consolidated subsidiary of So-net. Interest and dividends in other income of 28.2 billion yen was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, an increase of 3.3 billion yen, or 13.2 percent, compared with the previous year. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, interest expense totaling 27.3 billion yen was recorded, a decrease of 1.7 billion yen, or 5.9 percent, compared with the previous year. In addition, a net foreign exchange loss of 18.8 billion yen was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, an increase of 15.8 billon yen from the previous fiscal year. The net foreign exchange loss was recorded because the value of the yen, especially during the second through fourth quarters of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, was lower than the value of the yen at the time that Sony entered into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts. These contracts are entered into by Sony to mitigate the foreign exchange rate risk to cash flows that arises from settlements of foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and accounts payable, as well as foreign currency denominated transactions between consolidated subsidiaries. Income before Income Taxes Income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 decreased 184.3 billion yen, or 64.4 percent, to 102.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, as a result of the decrease in operating income and the decrease in the net amount of other income and other expenses mentioned above. 34 Table of Contents Income Taxes During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, Sony recorded 53.9 billion yen of income taxes at an effective tax rate of 52.8 percent. This effective tax rate exceeded the Japanese statutory tax rate as a result of the recording of losses by certain overseas subsidiaries with tax rates that are lower than the rate in Japan. The effective tax rate was 61.6 percent in the previous fiscal year and exceeded the Japanese statutory tax rate due to the recording of additional valuation allowances against deferred tax assets by Sony Corporation and several of Sonys Japanese and overseas consolidated subsidiaries due to continued losses recorded by these entities and the recording of an additional tax provision for the undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries. Results of Affiliated Companies Accounted for under the Equity Method Equity in net income of affiliated companies during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 was 78.7 billion yen, an increase of 65.5 billion yen, or 496.9 percent compared to the previous fiscal year. Equity in net income of affiliated companies reported for Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB (Sony Ericsson) was 85.3 billion yen, an increase of 56.3 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year, due to the increase in sales of hit models such as Walkman® and Cyber-shot phones. Sony recorded equity in net income of 5.0 billion yen for SONY BMG MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT (SONY BMG), a decrease of 0.8 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year. Although there was a favorable impact due to an industry-related legal settlement, a year-on-year reduction in restructuring charges, and reductions in overhead costs from continued restructuring, sales declined due to the accelerated decline in the worldwide physical music market. Sony recorded equity in net income of 6.4 billion yen (before the elimination of unrealized intercompany profits of 1.4 billion yen), a 13.6 billion yen improvement compared to the prior fiscal year, for S-LCD Corporation (S-LCD), a joint-venture with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Samsung) for the manufacture of amorphous thin film transistor (TFT) LCD panels. Sony recorded equity in net loss of 18.9 billion yen for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. (MGM), an increase in the amount of equity in net loss of 2.0 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year. The equity in net loss for MGM includes non-cash interest expense of 9.6 billion yen on cumulative preferred stock compared to the 6.0 billion yen of non-cash interest expense on cumulative preferred stock recorded in the previous fiscal year. With respect to equity in net income of affiliated companies, MGM is expected to have no effect on equity in net income or loss during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2008, due to the fact that Sony no longer has any book basis in MGM as of March 31, 2007. Minority Interest in Income (Loss) of Consolidated Subsidiaries In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries of 0.5 billion yen was recorded compared to minority interest in loss of 0.6 billion yen in the previous year. Net Income Net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 increased by 2.7 billion yen, or 2.2 percent, to 126.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Despite the decrease in income before income taxes, net income increased mainly due to the decrease of income taxes and increase in equity in net income of affiliated companies. As a percentage of sales, net income decreased from 1.6 percent to 1.5 percent. Return on stockholders equity decreased from 4.1 percent to 3.8 percent. (This ratio is calculated by dividing net income by the simple average of stockholders equity at the end of the previous fiscal year and at the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007.) Basic net income per share was 126.15 yen compared with 122.58 yen in the previous fiscal year, and diluted net income per share was 120.29 yen compared with 116.88 yen in the previous fiscal year.

Operating income increased by 149.8 billion yen, or 2,167.4 percent, to 156.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year and the operating income to sales ratio increased from 0.1 percent to 2.6 percent. Sales to outside customers on a yen basis increased 13.5 percent compared to the previous fiscal year. Regarding sales to outside customers by geographical area, sales increased by 7 percent in Japan, by 9 percent in the U.S., by 24 percent in Europe, and by 14 percent in non-Japan Asia and other geographic areas (Other Areas). In Japan, there was a significant increase in the sales of mobile phones, principally to Sony Ericsson, and LCD televisions, while sales decreased for DVD-Video recorders, personal computers (PCs) and CRT televisions. In the U.S., sales of LCD televisions significantly increased, while sales decreased for rear projection and CRT televisions. In Europe, sales increased for LCD televisions and PCs, while sales declined for CRT televisions and home-use video cameras. In Other Areas, sales of LCD televisions and digital cameras increased, while sales of mobile phones, primarily to Sony Ericsson, and CRT televisions decreased. The decrease in sales of mobile phones 36 Table of Contents was due to the impact of the deconsolidation resulting from the transfer to Sony Ericsson in the previous fiscal year of the stock of a Chinese subsidiary that mainly assembled mobile phones. Performance by Product Category Sales and operating revenue by product category discussed below represent sales to outside customers, which do not include intersegment transactions. Refer to Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Audio sales decreased by 13.3 billion yen, or 2.5 percent, to 522.9 billion yen. Sales of flash memory and hard drive digital audio players decreased due to a change in model mix, as unit shipments of approximately 4.5 million units were flat compared to the previous fiscal year. On the other hand, there was a significant decrease in sales of both CD and MiniDisc (MD) format headphone stereos due to a shift in market demand. However, car audio and home audio sales increased. Video sales increased by 121.8 billion yen, or 11.9 percent, to 1,143.1 billion yen. Sales of digital cameras increased in Japan, the U.S. and Europe. Worldwide shipments of digital cameras increased by approximately 3.5 million units to approximately 17.0 million units. Sales of DVD recorders decreased as worldwide shipments decreased by approximately 150,000 units to approximately 1.85 million units. Worldwide shipments of home-use video cameras decreased by approximately 150,000 units to approximately 7.45 million units. DVD-Video player unit shipments decreased by approximately 100,000 units to approximately 7.9 million units. Televisions sales increased by 299.2 billion yen, or 32.2 percent, to 1,227.0 billion yen. There was a significant increase in worldwide sales of LCD televisions, as worldwide shipments of LCD televisions increased by approximately 3.5 million units, to approximately 6.3 million units. Sales of LCD rear projection televisions decreased significantly as a result of declining sales prices, despite an increase in worldwide shipments of approximately 50,000 units, as compared to the previous fiscal year, to approximately 1.10 million units. There was also a significant decrease in worldwide sales of CRT televisions, primarily as a result of a decrease in worldwide shipments of CRT televisions by approximately 2.1 million units to approximately 4.7 million units. Information and Communications sales increased by 107.9 billion yen, or 12.8 percent, to 950.5 billion yen. Sales of PCs increased due to strong sales in Europe and Other Areas, and overall sales of PCs increased. Worldwide unit shipments of PCs increased approximately 300,000 units to approximately 4.0 million units. Sales of broadcast- and professional-use products increased as a result of favorable sales of high-definition related products. Semiconductors sales increased by 33.5 billion yen, or 19.5 percent, to 205.8 billion yen. The increase was due to an increase in sales of charged coupled devices (CCDs) and CMOS image sensors. Components sales increased by 52.3 billion yen, or 6.5 percent, to 853.0 billion yen. This increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of lithium-ion batteries, primarily for use in PCs and power tools, and Memory Sticks. On the other hand, sales of CD-R/RW drives and optical pickups declined, primarily as a result of significant unit price declines. Sales of DVD+/-R/RW drives increased, despite a deterioration in unit selling prices, as a result of a significant growth in units sold in association with the expansion of the market. Other sales increased by 37.8 billion yen, or 7.9 percent, to 519.2 billion yen. This increase was the result of an increase in sales of mobile phones, primarily to Sony Ericsson. In the Electronics segment, cost of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 increased by 594.4 billion yen, or 14.2 percent to 4,769.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The cost of sales ratio improved by 1.8 percentage points to 78.8 percent compared to 80.6 percent in the previous fiscal year. There was also an improvement in the cost of sales ratio for such products as digital cameras, LCD televisions and home-use video cameras, although the cost of sales ratio deteriorated for products such as LCD rear projection televisions due to sales price reductions associated with severe sales competition in North America. Restructuring charges recorded in cost of sales amounted to 12.6 billion yen, a decrease of 11.2 billion yen compared with the 23.8 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. Research and development costs increased 22.2 billion yen, or 5.3 percent, from 418.1 billion yen in the previous fiscal year to 440.4 billion yen. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 170.6 billion yen, or 18.3 percent to 1,101.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. A provision of 51.2 billion yen was recorded for the fiscal year ended 37 Table of Contents March 31, 2007 for recalls by Dell Inc., Apple Inc. and Lenovo, Inc. of notebook computer battery packs that use lithium-ion batteries manufactured by Sony as well as the subsequent global replacement program initiated by Sony for certain notebook computer battery packs used by Sony and several other notebook computer manufacturers that use lithium-ion battery cells manufactured by Sony. Also, an additional provision was recorded due to the expansion of models subject to free repairs and an extension of the repair period for Sony products and the products of other companies that are equipped with Sony CCDs. Results for the Electronics segment were also negatively impacted by an adjustment to reflect a more accurate method of calculating the provision for free repairs of Sony CCDs, which had the effect of further increasing the provision. Although there was a reversal of a portion of provisions related to the resolution of certain patent claims recorded in prior periods, this reversal was more than offset by the negative impact of the recording of certain provisions for outstanding legal proceedings including the European Commissions investigation in connection with professional videotape claims. Finally, a 64.5 billion yen gain recorded as a result of the transfer to the Japanese government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund was included in the previous fiscal year. Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased because the cumulative impact of the above-mentioned items exceeded the decrease in restructuring charges that were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. Of the restructuring charges recorded in the Electronics segment, the amount recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 35.5 billion yen from 49.5 billion yen in the previous fiscal year to 14.0 billion yen. Of the restructuring charges recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, the amount recorded for headcount reductions, including reductions through the early retirement program, was 9.7 billion yen, a decrease of 35.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales increased 0.2 percentage points from the 18.0 percent recorded in the previous fiscal year to 18.2 percent. Loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net decreased 12.3 billion yen to 10.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. This amount includes 10.8 billion yen of restructuring charges, including 5.2 billion yen of restructuring charges related to the recording of an impairment loss for goodwill for a CRT television glass manufacturing subsidiary in the U.S. The amount of restructuring charges included in loss on sale, disposal or impairment, net in the previous fiscal year was 52.5 billion yen. The amount of operating income recorded in the Electronics segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, increased significantly due to an increase in sales to outside customers and the positive impact of the depreciation of the yen. This result is in spite of the above-mentioned recording by Sony of a 51.2 billion yen provision that relates to recalls of notebook computer battery packs and the subsequent global replacement program and the recording of an additional provision related to free repairs of Sony CCDs. The operating income from the previous year included a 64.5 billion yen gain that was recorded as a result of the transfer to the Japanese government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund. Regarding profit performance by product, excluding restructuring charges and the impact of the net gain resulting from the transfer to the Japanese government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund, digital cameras and LCD televisions, which experienced favorable sales, and video cameras, which experienced an increase in sales of high value-added models, contributed to the increase in the operating income of the segment. Manufacturing by Geographic Area Slightly more than 50 percent of the Electronics segments total annual production during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 took place in Japan, including the production of digital cameras, video cameras, flat panel televisions, PCs, semiconductors and components such as batteries and Memory Sticks. Approximately 60 percent of the annual production in Japan was destined for other regions. China accounted for slightly more than 10 percent of total annual production, approximately 80 percent of which was destined for other regions. Asia, excluding Japan and China, accounted for approximately 10 percent of total annual production, with approximately 60 percent destined for Japan, the U.S. and Europe. The Americas and Europe together accounted for the remaining balance of approximately 25 percent of total annual production, most of which was destined for local distribution and sale. 38 Table of Contents Game Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 increased by 58.2 billion yen, or 6.1 percent, to 1,016.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. An operating loss of 232.3 billion yen was recorded for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, which was a deterioration of 241.1 billion yen from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. By region, although sales decreased slightly in Japan, there was a significant increase in sales in North America and Europe. Overall hardware sales increased as a result of the launch of the PS3 in Japan, North America and Europe. However, the sales of the PlayStation®2 (PS2) and PSP®(PlayStation®Portable) (PSP) declined due to lower unit sales compared with the previous fiscal year, and also because of a price reduction of the PS2. On the other hand, overall software sales decreased as a result of lower PS2 software sales, despite an increase in PSP software sales, as well as the contribution from PS3 software sales, compared to the previous fiscal year. Total worldwide production shipments of hardware and software were as follows: Worldwide hardware production shipments (decrease compared to the previous fiscal year):* à PS2: 14.20 million units (a decrease of 2.02 million units) à PSP: 8.36 million units (a decrease of 5.70 million units) à PS3: 5.50 million units Worldwide software production shipments (increase/decrease compared to the previous fiscal year):*/** à PS2: 193 million units (a decrease of 30 million units) à PSP: 54.1 million units (an increase of 12.5 million units) à PS3: 13.2 million units * Production shipments of hardware and software are counted upon shipment of the products from manufacturing bases. Sales of such products are recognized when the products are delivered to customers. ** Including those both from Sony and third parties under Sony licenses. Operating performance deteriorated significantly compared with the previous fiscal year. This deterioration was primarily the result of the loss arising from the sale of the PS3 at strategic price points lower than its production cost during the introductory period, as well as the recording of other charges in association with the preparation for the launch of the PS3 platform. Operating income for the PS2 business decreased due to a decrease in software sales while operating income in the PSP business increased primarily due to continued cost reductions in hardware production. A write-down of PS3-related inventory of 81.4 billion yen was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 compared with a write-down of 25.0 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. The cost of sales to sales ratio deteriorated 22.4 percentage points, from 80.4 percent in the previous fiscal year, to 102.8 percent and the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales increased 1.3 percentage points from 18.7 percent in the previous fiscal year, to 20.0 percent for the reasons mentioned for the decrease in operating income above. A significant reduction in the operating loss is expected in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2008 due to rapid reductions in hardware production costs and an enhanced line-up of software titles in the PS3 business. Pictures Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 increased by 220.4 billion yen, or 29.5 percent, to 966.3 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating income increased by 15.3 billion yen, or 55.7 percent , to 42.7 billion yen and the operating margin increased from 3.7 percent to 4.4 percent. The results in the Pictures segment consist of the results of Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. (SPE), a U.S. based subsidiary. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales for the fiscal year in the Pictures segment increased approximately 26 percent and operating income increased by approximately 53 percent. Sales increased significantly due to higher worldwide theatrical and home entertainment revenue from films released in the current fiscal year, as compared to those 39 Table of Contents released in the previous fiscal year. Major films released in the fiscal year that contributed to both theatrical and home entertainment revenue included The Da Vinci Code, Casino Royale, Click, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby and The Pursuit of Happyness. Sales for the fiscal year release slate increased approximately 1.8 billion U.S. dollars as compared to the previous fiscal year. Television product revenues increased by approximately 160 million U.S. dollars primarily as a result of higher advertising and subscription sales from several international channels. Operating income for the segment increased significantly, primarily due to the performance of films released in the current fiscal year. Operating loss from the current fiscal year release slate decreased approximately 530 million U.S. dollars as compared to the previous years release slate due to the same factors contributing to the increase in film revenue noted above. Partially offsetting this was a decrease in operating income of 98 million U.S. dollars for television product primarily due to the recording of production and marketing expenses in the current fiscal year associated with several new network and made-for-syndication television shows, combined with the absence of a licensing agreement extension for Wheel of Fortune, which was recognized in the previous fiscal year. Results for the Pictures segment were also negatively impacted by an adjustment to increase its reserve for returns of home entertainment catalog product. As of March 31, 2007, unrecognized license fee revenue at SPE was approximately 1.1 billion U.S. dollars. SPE expects to record this amount in the future having entered into contracts with television broadcasters to provide those broadcasters with completed motion picture and television products. The license fee revenue will be recognized in the fiscal year in which the product is made available for broadcast. Financial Services Note that the revenue and operating income at Sony Life, Sony Assurance Inc. (Sony Assurance) and Sony Bank Inc. (Sony Bank) discussed below on a U.S. GAAP basis differ from the results that Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank disclose on a Japanese statutory basis. Financial Services segment revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 decreased by 93.9 billion yen, or 12.6 percent, to 649.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income decreased by 104.2 billion yen, or 55.3 percent, to 84.1 billion yen and the operating income margin decreased to 13.0 percent compared with the 25.3 percent of the previous fiscal year. At Sony Life, revenue decreased by 100.0 billion yen, or 15.5 percent, to 545.1 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Although revenue from insurance premiums increased at Sony Life reflecting an increase in insurance-in-force, the main reason for this decrease was lower valuation gains in the general and separate accounts as compared to the previous fiscal year, when there was a significant increase in the Japanese stock market. Operating income at Sony Life decreased by 106.8 billion yen or 56.7 percent to 81.7 billion yen, primarily due to a decrease in valuation gains from investments in the general account, including valuation gains from convertible bonds. At Sony Assurance, revenue increased due to higher insurance revenue brought about by an expansion in automobile insurance-in-force. Operating income increased due to an increase in insurance revenue and an improvement in the expense ratio (the ratio of sales, general and administrative expenses and commissions to net premiums written). At Sony Bank, revenue rose mainly due to a significant decrease of foreign exchange losses from part of Sony Banks foreign currency deposits, as compared with the previous fiscal year, and an increase in interest revenue associated with an increase in the balance of assets from investing activities. As a result, Sony Bank recorded operating income in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, as compared to an operating loss in the previous fiscal year. At Sony Finance International, Inc. (Sony Finance), a leasing and credit financing business subsidiary in Japan, overall revenue decreased and the operating loss increased primarily due to decreases in revenue and profit at leasing and installment businesses. However, revenue increased at the credit card business which resulted in a decrease in the operating loss recorded for that business. 40 Table of Contents Condensed Statements of Income Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following schedule shows unaudited condensed statements of income for the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding Financial Services as well as condensed consolidated statements of income. This presentation is not required under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP), which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony believes that a comparative presentation may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding Financial Services are eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below. Condensed Statements of Income Fiscal Year ended March 31 Financial Services 2006 2007 (Yen in millions) Financial service revenue 743,215 649,341 Financial service expenses 554,892 565,199 Operating income 188,323 84,142 Other income (expenses), net 24,522 9,886 Income before income taxes 212,845 94,028 Income taxes and other 78,527 33,536 Net income 134,318 60,492 Fiscal Year ended March 31 Sony without Financial Services 2006 2007 (Yen in millions) Net sales and operating revenue 6,799,068 7,680,578 Costs and expenses 6,762,194 7,694,375 Operating income 36,874 (13,797 ) Other income (expenses), net 36,610 27,917 Income before income taxes 73,484 14,120 Income taxes and other 84,186 (57,991 ) Net income (loss) (10,702 ) 72,111 Fiscal Year ended March 31 Consolidated 2006 2007 (Yen in millions) Financial service revenue 720,566 624,282 Net sales and operating revenue 6,790,031 7,671,413 7,510,597 8,295,695 Costs and expenses 7,284,181 8,223,945 Operating income 226,416 71,750 Other income (expenses), net 59,913 30,287 Income before income taxes 286,329 102,037 Income taxes and other 162,713 (24,291 ) Net income 123,616 126,328 41 Table of Contents All Other During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, sales within All Other were comprised mainly of sales from Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) Inc. (SMEJ), a Japanese domestic recorded music business; Sony Music Entertainment Inc.s (SMEI) music publishing business; So-net, an Internet-related service business subsidiary operating mainly in Japan; a contactless IC card business; and an advertising agency business in Japan. In June 2006, Sony Corporation sold 51 percent of the stock of StylingLife Holdings Inc. (StylingLife), a holding company comprised of six retail businesses within Sony previously included within All Other, to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nikko Principal Investments Japan Ltd. Sony Corporation sold additional shares of StylingLife in December 2006, and currently holds approximately 23 percent of the total outstanding stock in StylingLife. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 decreased by 48.4 billion yen, or 11.4 percent, to 377.6 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. During the fiscal year, the sales decrease within All Other reflects the deconsolidation of the six retail businesses noted above after the sale of a majority of the stock of StylingLife. Of total segment sales, 82 percent were sales to outside customers. In terms of profit performance, operating income for All Other increased from 20.5 billion yen in the previous fiscal year to 32.4 billion yen. Sales at SMEJ declined mainly due to lower intersegment sales in association with the transfer of business activity relating to Sonys disc custom press business, which was carried out at SMEJ during the previous fiscal year, to other segments within Sony Group. Best selling albums during the fiscal year included CHEMISTRYs ALL THE BEST, Yuna Itos HEART and Angela Akis HOME. Excluding sales recorded within Sonys music business, there was a decrease in sales within All Other. This decrease was mainly due to the above-mentioned deconsolidation of Sonys retail businesses, partially offset by an increase in sales at the contactless IC card business and So-net, where there was a favorable increase in fiber optic connection service subscribers. Regarding profit performance within All Other, operating income of 32.4 billion yen was recorded, an 11.9 billion yen increase compared to the 20.5 billion yen of operating income recorded in the previous fiscal year. Operating income at SMEJ declined approximately 37 percent compared to the previous fiscal year, mainly due to a decrease in album and single sales and the recognition of a gain in the previous fiscal year resulting from the transfer to the Japanese government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund. Excluding the decrease in operating income in the music business, there was an increase in operating income within All Other, mainly due to an asset impairment write-down associated with the sale of the Metreon, a U.S. entertainment complex, recorded in the previous fiscal year. Operating income at So-net increased mainly due to an increase in profit resulting from greater fee revenue from new subscribers. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, a gain on the sale of a portion of Sonys former headquarters site in the amount of 2.6 billion yen is included in operating income within All Other. Foreign Exchange Fluctuations and Risk Hedging During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, the average value of the yen was 116.0 yen against the U.S. dollar, and 148.6 yen against the Euro, which was 3.2 percent lower against the U.S. dollar and 8.2 percent lower against the Euro, respectively, compared with the average of the previous fiscal year. In the Pictures segment, Sony translates into yen the U.S. dollar consolidated results of SPE (a U.S.-based operation that has worldwide subsidiaries). Therefore, analysis and discussion of certain portions of the operating results of SPE are specified as being on a U.S. dollar basis. Results on a U.S. dollar basis are not on the same basis as Sonys consolidated financial statements and do not conform with U.S. GAAP. In addition, Sony does not believe that these measures are a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures. However, Sony believes that results presented on a local currency basis provide additional useful information to investors regarding operating performance. Sonys consolidated results are subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations mainly derived from the fact that the countries where manufacturing takes place may be different from those where such products are sold. In order to 42 Table of Contents reduce the risk caused by such fluctuations, Sony employs derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, in accordance with a consistent risk management strategy. Such derivatives are used primarily to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows generated by anticipated intercompany transactions and intercompany accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies. Sony Global Treasury Services Plc (SGTS) in London provides integrated treasury services for Sony Corporation and its subsidiaries. Sonys policy is that Sony Corporation and all subsidiaries with foreign exchange exposures should enter into commitments with SGTS for hedging their exposures. Sony Corporation and most of its subsidiaries utilize SGTS for this purpose. The concentration of foreign exchange exposures at SGTS means that, in effect, SGTS hedges the net foreign exchange exposure of Sony Corporation and its subsidiaries. SGTS in turn enters into foreign exchange transactions with creditworthy third-party financial institutions. Most of the transactions are entered into against projected exposures before the actual export and import transactions take place. In general, SGTS hedges the projected exposures on average three months before the actual transactions take place. However, in certain cases SGTS partially hedges the projected exposures one month before the actual transactions take place when business requirements such as shorter production-sales cycles for certain products arise. Sony enters into foreign exchange transactions with financial institutions primarily for hedging purposes. Sony does not use these derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes except for certain derivatives in the Financial Services segment utilized for portfolio investments and Asset Liability Management (ALM). To minimize the adverse effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on its financial results, particularly in the Electronics segment, Sony seeks, when appropriate, to localize material and parts procurement, design, and manufacturing operations in areas outside of Japan. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, including foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts and other derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are marked-to-market with changes in value recognized in Other Income and Expenses. The notional amounts of foreign exchange forward contracts, currency option contracts purchased and currency option contracts written as of March 31, 2007 were 1,768.6 billion yen, 287.8 billion yen and 67.2 billion yen, respectively. Operating Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2006 compared with the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2005 Overview Sonys sales and operating revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased 4.4 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. This increase is mainly due to an increase in revenues within the Financial Services segment, as a result of an improvement in gains and losses on investments at Sony Life due to favorable Japanese domestic equity market conditions, and increased sales within the Game segment, due to the contribution from the PSP. In the Electronics segment, although sales benefited from the depreciation of the yen as well as an increase in sales of LCD televisions, sales to outside customers decreased 0.9 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. There was a decline in sales of CRT televisions, due to a continued shift in demand towards flat panel televisions, and in plasma televisions, where new product development has been terminated. Operating income increased 55.5 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income includes a one-time net gain of 73.5 billion yen, which resulted from the transfer to the Japanese government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund. Of this amount, a gain of 64.5 billion yen was recorded within the Electronics segment. In the Financial Services segment, operating income increased due to an improvement in gains and losses on investments at Sony Life resulting from the above-mentioned favorable Japanese domestic equity market conditions. In the Electronics segment, although restructuring charges increased compared with the previous fiscal year, the amount of operating loss decreased as a result of a net gain resulting from the transfer to the Japanese government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund mentioned above and favorable exchange rates. Operating income within the Game segment declined primarily as a result of an increase in research and development costs associated mainly with the PS3. In the Pictures segment, 43 Table of Contents operating income also declined due to lower worldwide theatrical and home entertainment revenues on feature films. Restructuring In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, Sony recorded restructuring charges of 138.7 billion yen, an increase from the 90.0 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. The primary restructuring activities were in the Electronics segment and All Other. Of the total 138.7 billion yen, Sony recorded 48.3 billion yen in personnel-related costs. This expense was incurred because 5,700 people, mainly in Japan, the U.S. and Western Europe, left Sony primarily through early retirement programs. For more detailed information about restructuring, please refer to Note 17 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Electronics Restructuring charges in the Electronics segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 were 125.8 billion yen, compared to 83.2 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Due to the worldwide market shrinkage and demand shift from CRT televisions to plasma and LCD panel televisions, Sony has been implementing a worldwide plan to rationalize CRT and CRT television production facilities and has been downsizing its business over several years. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, as part of this restructuring program, Sony recorded a non-cash impairment charge of 25.5 billion yen for CRT TV display manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. The impairment charge was calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and the present value of estimated future cash flows. The charge was recorded in loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net in the consolidated statements of income. In addition to the above restructuring efforts, Sony undertook several headcount reduction programs to further reduce operating costs in the Electronics segment. As a result of these programs, Sony recorded restructuring charges of 45.1 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, and these charges were included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. These staff reductions were achieved worldwide mostly through the implementation of early retirement programs. The remaining liability balance as of March 31, 2006 was 19.4 billion yen and will be paid through the fiscal year ending March 31, 2007. Sony will continue to seek the appropriate headcount level to optimize the workforce in the Electronics segment. All Other Restructuring charges within All Other for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 were 10.4 billion yen, compared to 5.3 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. The main component of the restructuring charges recorded during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 was an 8.5 billion yen asset impairment write-down associated with the sale of the Metreon, a U.S. entertainment complex. Operating Performance Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2005 2006 Percent change (Yen in billions) Sales and operating revenue 7,191.3 7,510.6 +4.4 % Operating income 145.6 226.4 +55.5 Income before income taxes 157.2 286.3 +82.1 Equity in net income of affiliated companies 29.0 13.2 −54.6 Net income 163.8 123.6 −24.5 44 Table of Contents Sales Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased by 319.3 billion yen, or 4.4 percent, to 7,510.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. A further breakdown of sales figures is presented under Operating Performance by Business Segment below. Sales in this analysis of the ratio of cost of sales, including research and development costs, and selling, general and administrative expenses to sales refers only to the net sales and other operating revenue portions of consolidated sales and operating revenue, and excludes financial service revenue. This is because financial service expenses are recorded separately from cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. The calculations of all ratios below that pertain to business segments include intersegment transactions. Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased by 151.3 billion yen, or 3.0 percent, to 5,151.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, and increased from 75.1 percent to 75.9 percent as a percentage of sales. Year on year, the cost of sales ratio decreased from 80.7 percent to 80.6 percent in the Electronics segment, increased from 73.0 percent to 80.4 percent in the Game segment, and increased from 58.7 percent to 60.2 percent in the Pictures segment. In the Electronics segment, there was a deterioration in the cost of sales ratio for several products, in particular image sensors and CRT televisions. In the Game segment, there was an increase in the cost of sales ratio as a result of research and development costs associated with the PS3. In the Pictures segment, the cost of sales ratio also increased primarily due to lower worldwide theatrical and home entertainment revenues from feature films. There was a decrease in personnel-related costs included in cost of sales of 9.8 billion yen, primarily within the Electronics segment, compared with the previous fiscal year. Research and development costs (all research and development costs are included within cost of sales) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased by 29.8 billion yen to 531.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of research and development costs to sales was 7.8 percent compared to 7.5 percent in the previous fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 decreased by 8.0 billion yen, or 0.5 percent, to 1,527.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales improved from 23.1 percent in the previous fiscal year to 22.5 percent. Year on year, the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales improved from 18.8 percent to 18.0 percent in the Electronics segment and from 21.0 percent to 18.7 percent in the Game segment. On the other hand, the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales increased from 32.5 percent to 36.0 percent in the Pictures segment. Personnel-related costs in selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 60.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year mainly due to a decrease in severance-related expenses in the Electronics segment resulting from the implementation of restructuring initiatives. In addition, advertising and publicity expenses for the fiscal year increased by 59.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. This was primarily due to the fact that advertising and publicity expenses increased within the Pictures and Game segments. Loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net was 73.9 billion yen, compared with 28.0 billion in the previous fiscal year. This increase was due to losses recorded on the sale, disposal and impairment of CRT and CRT television production equipment in the Electronics segment, as well as an asset impairment write-down associated with the sale of the Metreon, a U.S. entertainment complex. Operating Income Operating income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased by 80.8 billion yen, or 55.5 percent, to 226.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The operating income margin increased from 2.0 percent to 3.0 percent. In descending order by the amount of financial impact, the Financial Services segment, the Pictures segment, All Other and the Game segment contributed to operating income. On the other hand, although there was a 45 Table of Contents net gain from the transfer to the Japanese government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund and the depreciation of the yen, the Electronics segment recorded an operating loss mainly due to a decrease in sales to outside customers, an increase in loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets and a deterioration in the cost of sales ratio associated with a decline in unit selling prices. For a further breakdown of operating income for each segment, please refer to Operating Performance by Business Segment below. Other Income and Expenses In the consolidated results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, other income increased by 52.5 billion yen, or 79.7 percent, to 118.4 billion yen, while other expenses increased by 4.2 billion yen, or 7.7 percent, to 58.5 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. The net amount of other income and other expenses was net other income of 59.9 billion yen, an increase of 48.3 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. The gain on change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees increased by 44.5 billion yen, or 272.7 percent compared to the previous fiscal year to 60.8 billion yen. This was mainly the result of a gain of 21.5 billion yen on the change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees resulting from the initial public offering of So-net, a gain of 20.6 billion yen on the change in interest resulting from the partial sale of Sonys investment in Monex Beans Holdings, Inc., and gains of 12.0 billion yen and 6.6 billion yen, respectively, on the change of interest at So-net M3 Inc., a consolidated subsidiary of So-net and at DeNA Co., Ltd., an equity affiliate of So-net accounted for by the equity method. Interest and dividends of 24.9 billion yen were recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, an increase of 10.2 billion yen, or 69.5 percent, compared with the previous year. This increase was mainly the result of an increase in interest received resulting from an improvement in the rate of return on overseas investments. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, interest payments totaling 29.0 billion yen were recorded, an increase of 4.4 billion yen, or 18.0 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. In addition, a net foreign exchange loss of 3.1 billion yen was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, compared to a net foreign exchange loss of 0.5 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. The net foreign exchange loss was recorded because the value of the yen, especially during the first and third quarters of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, was lower than the value of the yen at the time that Sony entered into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts. These contracts were entered into by Sony to mitigate the foreign exchange rate risk to cash flows that arises from settlements of foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and accounts payable, as well as foreign currency denominated transactions between consolidated subsidiaries. Income before Income Taxes Income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased 129.1 billion yen, or 82.1 percent compared with the previous fiscal year, to 286.3 billion yen as a result of the increase in operating income and the increase in the net amount of other income and other expenses mentioned above. Income Taxes Income taxes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased by 160.5 billion yen to 176.5 billion yen. Compared to an effective tax rate of 10.2 percent in the previous fiscal year, the effective tax rate was 61.6 percent in the current fiscal year. This effective tax rate exceeded the Japanese statutory tax rate primarily due to the recording of additional valuation allowances against deferred tax assets by Sony Corporation and several of Sonys Japanese domestic and overseas consolidated subsidiaries, mainly within the Electronics segment, due to continued losses recorded at these businesses and the recording of an additional tax provision for the undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. The effective tax rate was significantly lower than the Japanese statutory rate in the previous fiscal year as a result of the reversal of valuation allowances at Sonys U.S. subsidiaries associated with an improvement in operating performance. On June 30, 2006, Sony Corporation and Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. (SCEI) each received notification from the Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau (TRTB) of a reassessment of the profits they reported 46 Table of Contents from transactions between SCEI and its subsidiary Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc. (SCEA), for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2000 through 2005. On the same date, Sony Corporation also received notification of a reassessment of the profits reported from transactions related to CD and DVD disc manufacturing operations with a number of its overseas subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004 and 2005. Sony Corporation and SCEI believe that their allocation of income for the periods in question was appropriate and that they have paid the proper amount of taxes in each of the jurisdictions. Therefore Sony Corporation and SCEI disagree with the position of the TRTB and have lodged an objection. In addition, Sony Corporation and SCEI plan to formally request bilateral consultations (where available) to obtain relief from double taxation under the applicable tax treaties of various countries and is currently in the process of obtaining an Advanced Price Agreement. Transfer pricing was reassessed in accordance with the notification from the TRTB, resulting in additional Japanese income of 74.4 billion yen, which led to Sony Corporation and SCEI incurring an estimated additional cash tax (including corporate tax and others) of approximately 27.9 billion yen. Sony Corporation and SCEI believe that double taxation will be avoided through the procedure described above, and therefore Sony does not expect any material impact on its consolidated profit and loss as a result of this reassessment. Results of Affiliated Companies Accounted for under the Equity Method Equity in net income of affiliated companies during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 was 13.2 billion yen, a decrease of 15.9 billion yen, or 54.6 percent compared to the previous fiscal year. Equity in net income of affiliated companies for the previous fiscal year included the recording of 12.6 billion yen as equity in net income for InterTrust Technologies Corporation (InterTrust), which reflected InterTrusts proceeds from a license agreement arising from the settlement of a patent-related suit. In the current fiscal year, Sony Ericsson, as a result of increased sales of products including camera phone and Walkman ® phone models, contributed 29.0 billion yen to equity in net income, an increase of 11.6 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year. Sony recorded equity income of 5.8 billion yen for SONY BMG during the current fiscal year, compared to an equity loss of 3.4 billion yen in the previous fiscal year as a result of a reduction in restructuring charges and the realization of incremental cost savings. However, Sony recorded an equity in net loss of 7.2 billion yen for S-LCD, a joint-venture with Samsung for the manufacture of amorphous TFT LCD panels and equity in net loss of 16.9 billion yen for MGM. The equity in net loss for MGM includes non-cash interest of 6.0 billion yen on cumulative preferred stock. Minority Interest in Income (Loss) of Consolidated Subsidiaries In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiaries of 0.6 billion yen was recorded compared to minority interest in income of 1.7 billion yen for the previous fiscal year. This loss was primarily due to the recording of loss at ST Mobile Display Corporation, a joint venture with Toyota Industries Corporation for the manufacture of low-temperature polysilicon thin film transistor liquid crystal display panels for mobile products. Net Income Net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 decreased by 40.2 billion yen, or 24.5 percent, to 123.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. This decrease was primarily the result of the above-mentioned increase in income taxes and decrease in equity in net income of affiliated companies. As a percentage of sales, net income decreased from 2.3 percent to 1.6 percent. Return on stockholders equity decreased from 6.2 percent to 4.1 percent. (This ratio is calculated by dividing net income by the simple average of stockholders equity at the end of the previous fiscal year and at the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006.) Basic net income per share was 122.58 yen compared with 175.90 yen in the previous fiscal year, and diluted net income per share was 116.88 yen compared with 158.07 yen in the previous fiscal year.

The newly formed company, SONY BMG, is 50 percent owned by each parent company. Under U.S. GAAP, SONY BMG is accounted for by Sony using the equity method and, since August 1, 2004, 50 percent of net profits or losses of this business have been included under Equity in net income (loss) of affiliated companies. In connection with the establishment of this joint venture, Sonys non-Japan-based disc manufacturing and physical distribution businesses, formerly included within the Music segment, a separate reporting segment until the end of the previous fiscal year, have been reclassified to the Electronics segment to recognize the new management reporting structure whereby Sonys Electronics segment has now assumed responsibility for these businesses. Effective April 1, 2005, a similar change was made with respect to Sonys Japan-based disc manufacturing business. Results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 in the Electronics segment have been restated to account for these reclassifications. Effective April 1, 2005, Sony no longer breaks out its music business as a reportable segment as it no longer meets the materiality threshold. Accordingly, the results for Sonys music business are now included within All Other, and the results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 have been reclassified to All Other for comparative purposes. Results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 in All Other include the results of SMEI music publishing business and SMEJ, excluding Sonys Japan-based disc manufacturing business which, as noted above, 48 Table of Contents has been reclassified to the Electronics segment. However, results for the previous fiscal year in All Other include the consolidated results for SMEIs recorded music business for the period through August 1, 2004, as well as the results for SMEIs music publishing business and SMEJ excluding Sonys Japan-based disc manufacturing business. Electronics Sales and operating revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased 81.8 billion yen, or 1.6 percent, to 5,176.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating profit of 6.9 billion in the Electronics segment was recorded compared to operating profit of 2.9 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Despite the increase in sales, sales to outside customers, on a yen basis, decreased 1.0 percent compared to the previous fiscal year. With respect to sales to outside customers by geographical area, sales decreased by 12 percent in Japan, by 3 percent in the U.S., by 4 percent in Europe and increased by 12 percent in Other Areas. In Japan, although there was a significant increase in the sales of LCD televisions, as well as increased sales for flash memory and hard drive digital audio players, sales decreased for such products as mobile phones, principally to Sony Ericsson, CRT televisions and plasma televisions. In the U.S., although there was an increase in sales of LCD and rear projection televisions, sales decreased for such products as CRT and plasma televisions. In Europe, although sales increased for such products as LCD televisions, there was a decline in sales of such products as CRT and plasma televisions, and mobile phones, primarily to Sony Ericsson. In Other Areas, sales of such products as LCD televisions and PCs increased, while sales of such products as CD-R/RW drives and CRT televisions decreased. Performance by Product Category Sales and operating revenue by product category discussed below represent sales to outside customers, which do not include intersegment transactions. Refer to Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Audio sales decreased by 35.7 billion yen, or 6.2 percent, to 536.2 billion yen. Sales of flash memory and hard drive digital audio players increased significantly, in conjunction with an increase in shipments to approximately 4.5 million units, compared to approximately 850,000 unit shipments recorded in the previous fiscal year. On the other hand, there was a significant decrease in the unit shipments of both CD and MD format headphone stereos due to a shift in market demand. In addition, car audio experienced a decrease in sales, and there was a slight decrease in home audio sales. Video sales decreased by 15.0 billion yen, or 1.4 percent, to 1,021.3 billion yen. In addition to a decrease in sales of digital cameras in Japan, the U.S. and Europe, there was a decrease in sales of VHS video recorders. Sales of digital cameras decreased, coupled with a decrease in worldwide shipments by approximately 0.5 million units to approximately 13.5 million units. Worldwide shipments of DVD recorders increased by approximately 300,000 units to approximately 2.0 million units, while sales increased slightly. Worldwide shipments of home-use video cameras increased by approximately 250,000 units to approximately 7.6 million units. DVD-Video player unit shipments decreased by approximately 1.5 million units to approximately 8.0 million units. Televisions sales increased by 6.6 billion yen, or 0.7 percent, to 927.8 billion yen. There was a significant increase in worldwide sales of LCD televisions, as worldwide shipments of LCD televisions increased by approximately 1.8 million units, to approximately 2.8 million units. Sales of rear projection televisions increased as the sales percentage of higher priced units increased, although worldwide shipments remained largely unchanged at approximately 1.2 million units. On the other hand, there was a significant decrease in worldwide sales of CRT televisions, primarily as a result of both a decrease in worldwide shipments of CRT televisions, by approximately 2.7 million units to approximately 6.8 million units and a fall in unit prices due to the continued shift in demand towards flat panel televisions. In addition, sales of plasma televisions, where new product development has been terminated, also decreased worldwide. Information and Communications sales increased by 26.4 billion yen, or 3.2 percent, to 842.5 billion yen. Although sales of desktop PCs decreased, overall sales increased as a result of favorable worldwide sales of notebook PCs. Worldwide unit shipments of PCs increased approximately 400,000 units to approximately 49 Table of Contents 3.7 million units. Sales of broadcast- and professional-use products increased as a result of favorable sales of high-definition related products. Semiconductors sales decreased by 12.0 billion yen, or 6.5 percent, to 172.2 billion yen. The decrease was due to a decrease in sales of CCDs as the result of pricing pressures. Components sales increased by 49.6 billion yen, or 6.6 percent, to 800.7 billion yen. This increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of lithium-ion batteries, primarily for use in PCs and power tools, and Memory Sticks. On the other hand, sales of CD-R/RW drives and optical pickups declined, primarily as a result of significant unit price declines. Sales of DVD+/-R/RW drives increased, despite a deterioration in unit selling prices, as a result of a significant growth in units sold in association with the expansion of the market. Other sales decreased by 65.4 billion yen, or 12.0 percent, to 481.4 billion yen. This decrease was the result of a decrease in sales of mobile phones, primarily to Sony Ericsson. In the Electronics segment, cost of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased by 63.3 billion yen, or 1.5 percent to 4,174.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The cost of sales ratio decreased by 0.1 percent to 80.6 percent compared to 80.7 percent in the previous fiscal year. Although there was an improvement in the cost of sales ratio for such products as video cameras and PCs, products that contributed to the deterioration in the cost of sales ratio included image sensors and CRT televisions, which experienced decreased sales. Restructuring charges recorded in cost of sales amounted to 23.8 billion yen, an increase of 14.2 billion yen compared with the 9.6 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. Research and development costs decreased 15.2 billion yen, or 3.5 percent, from 433.3 billion yen in the previous fiscal year to 418.1 billion yen. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 25.4 billion yen, or 2.7 percent to 931.1 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The primary reason for this decrease was the recording of a 64.5 billion yen net gain resulting from the transfer to the Japanese government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund. Of the restructuring charges recorded in the Electronics segment, the amount recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 4.1 billion yen from 53.6 billion yen in the previous fiscal year to 49.5 billion yen. Of the restructuring charges recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, the amount recorded for headcount reductions, including reductions through the early retirement program, was 45.1 billion yen, a decrease of 5.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. On the other hand, royalty expenses decreased 17.2 billion yen. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales decreased 0.8 percentage points from the 18.8 percent recorded in the previous fiscal year to 18.0 percent. Loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net increased 40.0 billion yen to 63.9 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. This amount includes 52.5 billion yen in restructuring charges, which includes 25.5 billion yen of restructuring charges related to CRT and CRT television manufacturing facilities in the U.S. The amount of restructuring charges included in loss on sale, disposal or impairment, net in the previous fiscal year was 19.2 billion yen. The amount of operating profit recorded in the Electronics segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased as a result of the net gain resulting from the transfer to the Japanese government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund, despite the recording of increased restructuring charges. Excluding the impact of restructuring charges and the net gain resulting from the transfer to the Japanese government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund, profit performance by product reflected an increase in operating losses recorded by CRT televisions and LCD televisions and a decrease in operating income recorded by image sensors. On the other hand, there was a decrease in the operating loss recorded by DVD recorders (including PSXTM) as well as an increase in operating income for video cameras and PCs. Manufacturing by Geographic Area Slightly more than 50 percent of the Electronics segments total annual production during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 took place in Japan, including the production of digital cameras, video cameras, flat panel televisions, PCs, semiconductors and components such as batteries and Memory Sticks. Approximately 65 percent of the annual production in Japan was destined for other regions. China accounted for slightly more than 10 percent of total annual production, approximately 70 percent of which was destined for other regions. Asia, excluding Japan 50 Table of Contents and China, accounted for slightly more than 10 percent of total annual production, with approximately 60 percent destined for Japan, the U.S. and Europe. The Americas and Europe together accounted for the remaining balance of slightly less than 25 percent of total annual production, most of which was destined for local distribution and sale. Game Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased by 228.9 billion yen, or 31.4 percent compared with the previous fiscal year, to 958.6 billion yen. Operating income decreased by 34.4 billion yen, or 79.7 percent, to 8.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, and the operating income margin decreased from 5.9 percent to 0.9 percent. By region, although sales decreased slightly in Japan, there was an increase in sales in the U.S. and Europe. There was a significant increase in hardware sales compared to the previous fiscal year. Sales increased significantly, mainly in the U.S and Europe, and sales in Japan remained relatively unchanged compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily due to a significant contribution to sales from the PSP, which experienced favorable growth in all geographic areas and the fact that PlayStation®2 (PS2) sales were on a par with those in the previous fiscal year. In addition, although PS2 software sales decreased, as a result of the contribution to sales from PSP software, software sales in Japan, the U.S. and Europe were relatively unchanged compared to the previous fiscal year. Total worldwide production shipments of hardware and software were as follows: Worldwide hardware production shipments (increase compared to the previous fiscal year):* à PS2: 16.22 million units (an increase of 0.05 million units) à PSP: 14.06 million units (an increase of 11.09 million units) Worldwide software production shipments (increase/decrease compared to the previous fiscal year):*/** à PS2: 223 million units (a decrease of 29 million units) à PSP: 41.6 million units (an increase of 35.9 million units) * Production shipments of hardware and software are counted upon shipment of the products from manufacturing bases. Sales of such products are recognized when the products are delivered to customers. ** Including those both from Sony and third parties under Sony licenses. Operating income decreased significantly compared with the previous fiscal year. Although profits from the PS2 and PSP businesses exceeded those in the previous fiscal year, the decrease in operating income was mainly the result of continued high research and development costs associated with the PS3, as well as the recording of charges associated with preparation for the launch of the PS3 platform including a write-down of approximately 25.0 billion yen for semiconductor components used in the PS3. The cost of sales to sales ratio deteriorated by 7.4 percent, from 73.0 percent in the previous fiscal year, to 80.4 percent for the reasons mentioned above for operating income. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales decreased by 2.3 percent, compared to 21.0 percent in the previous fiscal year, to 18.7 percent as a result of the sales increase. Pictures Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased by 12.2 billion yen, or 1.7 percent, to 745.9 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income decreased by 36.5 billion yen, or 57.1 percent, to 27.4 billion yen and the operating income margin decreased from 8.7 percent to 3.7 percent. The results in the Pictures segment consist of the results of SPE, a U.S.-based subsidiary. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales for the fiscal year in the Pictures segment decreased approximately 4 percent and operating income decreased by approximately 61 percent. Sales decreased primarily due to lower worldwide theatrical and home entertainment revenues on feature films, partially offset by an increase in television product revenues. The lower theatrical and home entertainment revenues primarily resulted from the strong performance of 51 Table of Contents Spider-Man 2 in the prior fiscal year coupled with the disappointing performance of certain films in the current fiscal year film slate, particularly Stealth, Zathura and the Legend of Zorro. Sales for the fiscal year release slate decreased 967 million U.S. dollars as compared to the previous fiscal year. Television product revenues increased by approximately 220 million U.S. dollars primarily due to higher advertising and subscription sales from several of SPEs international channels, higher sales of television library product and the extension of a licensing agreement for Wheel of Fortune. Operating income for the segment decreased significantly, primarily due to the disappointing overall performance of the current fiscal years film slate in both the theatrical and home entertainment markets. Operating loss from the current fiscal year release slate increased 623 million U.S. dollars as compared to the prior fiscal years release slate due to the same factors contributing to the decrease in film revenue noted above. Partially offsetting this was an increase in operating income of 83 million U.S. dollars for television product due to the same factors noted above for revenue. As of March 31, 2006, unrecognized license fee revenue at SPE was approximately 1.2 billion U.S. dollars. SPE expects to record this amount in the future having entered into contracts with television broadcasters to provide those broadcasters with completed motion picture and television products. The license fee revenue will be recognized in the fiscal year that the product is available for broadcast. Financial Services Please note that the revenue and operating income at Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank discussed below on a U.S. GAAP basis differ from the results that Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank disclose on a Japanese statutory basis. Financial Services revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased by 182.7 billion yen, or 32.6 percent, to 743.2 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income increased by 132.8 billion yen, or 239.4 percent, to 188.3 billion yen and the operating income margin increased to 25.3 percent compared with the 9.9 percent of the previous fiscal year. At Sony Life, revenue increased by 170.8 billion yen, or 36.0 percent, to 645.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The main reasons for this increase were an improvement in gains and losses from investments at Sony Life, primarily within the general account, as well as an increase in revenue from insurance premiums reflecting an increase of insurance-in-force. The improvement in gains and losses from investments in the general account was principally a result of an improvement in valuation gains from stock conversion rights in convertible bonds resulting from the aforementioned favorable Japanese domestic stock market conditions. Operating income at Sony Life increased by 127.4 billion yen or 208.8 percent to 188.4 billion yen, mainly as a result of a significant improvement in gains and losses on investments in the general account mentioned above. At Sony Assurance, revenue increased due to higher insurance revenue brought about by an expansion in automobile insurance-in-force. Operating income increased due to an increase in insurance revenue and an improvement in the expense ratio (the ratio of sales, general and administrative expenses to premiums). At Sony Bank, which started operations in June 2001, although foreign exchange losses were recorded as a result of the depreciation of the yen on part of Sony Banks foreign currency deposits, revenue rose as there was an increase in interest revenue associated with an increase in the balance of assets from investing activities, in addition to revenues from other investing activities. The amount of the operating loss decreased compared with the previous fiscal year, as a result of the increase in revenue. At Sony Finance, a leasing and credit financing business subsidiary in Japan, revenue increased due to an increase in leasing and credit card revenue. In terms of profitability, a reduced operating loss was recorded compared to the previous fiscal year, as a result of improved profitability at a credit card business at Sony Finance. 52 Table of Contents Condensed Statements of Income Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following schedule shows unaudited condensed statements of income for the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding Financial Services as well as condensed consolidated statements of income. This presentation is not required under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony believes that a comparative presentation may be useful for understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding Financial Services are eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below. Condensed Statements of Income Fiscal Year ended March 31 Financial Services 2005 2006 (Yen in millions) Financial service revenue 560,557 743,215 Financial service expenses 505,067 554,892 Operating income 55,490 188,323 Other income (expenses), net 9,177 24,522 Income before income taxes 64,667 212,845 Income taxes and other 23,634 78,527 Income before cumulative effect of an accounting change 41,033 134,318 Cumulative effect of an accounting change (4,713 )  Net income 36,320 134,318 Fiscal Year ended March 31 Sony without Financial Services 2005 2006 (Yen in millions) Net sales and operating revenue 6,664,437 6,799,068 Costs and expenses 6,575,354 6,762,194 Operating income 89,083 36,874 Other income (expenses), net 9,957 36,610 Income before income taxes 99,040 73,484 Income taxes and other (34,979 ) 84,186 Income (loss) before cumulative effect of an accounting change 134,019 (10,702 ) Cumulative effect of an accounting change   Net income (loss) 134,019 (10,702 ) 53 Table of Contents Fiscal Year ended March 31 Consolidated 2005 2006 (Yen in millions) Financial service revenue 537,715 720,566 Net sales and operating revenue 6,653,610 6,790,031 7,191,325 7,510,597 Costs and expenses 7,045,697 7,284,181 Operating income 145,628 226,416 Other income (expenses), net 11,579 59,913 Income before income taxes 157,207 286,329 Income taxes and other (11,344 ) 162,713 Income before cumulative effect of an accounting change 168,551 123,616 Cumulative effect of an accounting change (4,713 )  Net income 163,838 123,616 All Other During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, sales within All Other were comprised mainly of sales from SMEJ, a Japanese domestic recorded music business; SMEIs music publishing business; So-net, an Internet-related service business subsidiary operating mainly in Japan; a retailer of imported general merchandise in Japan; an in-house facilities management business in Japan; and an advertising agency business in Japan. Results for the first four months of the previous fiscal year in All Other incorporated the results for SMEIs recorded music business, which, as noted above, was combined with Bertelsmann AGs recorded music business to form the SONY BMG joint venture which is accounted for by the equity method. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 decreased by 44.9 billion yen, or 9.5 percent, to 426.0 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. Of total segment sales, 81 percent were sales to outside customers. In terms of profit performance, operating income for All Other increased for the fiscal year from 5.1 billion yen to 20.5 billion yen. During the fiscal year, the sales decrease within All Other reflects the fact that, as noted above, the results for the first four months of the previous fiscal year in All Other incorporated the results for SMEIs recorded music business. Sales at SMEJ were relatively unchanged compared with the previous fiscal year. Best selling albums during the fiscal year included Ken Hirai 10th Anniversary Complete Single Collection 95-05 Uta Baka by Ken Hirai, NATURAL by ORANGE RANGE and BEST by Mika Nakashima. Excluding sales recorded within Sonys music business, there was an increase in sales within All Other. This increase was mainly due to strong sales at a business engaged in the production and marketing of animation products, favorable sales both at So-net and its subsidiaries, as well as an increase in sales recorded at an imported general merchandise retail business. Regarding profit performance within All Other, operating income of 20.5 billion yen was recorded, a 15.5 billion yen increase compared to the 5.1 billion yen of operating income recorded in the previous fiscal year. This increase was mainly the result of the fact that the results for SMEIs recorded music business, which recorded an operating loss in the previous fiscal year, are now recorded as part of the results of the SONY BMG joint venture, and the continued strong performance at SMEJ, where operating income increased approximately 40 percent compared to the previous fiscal year mainly due to an improvement in the cost of sales ratio and the recording of a net gain resulting from the transfer to the Japanese government of the substitutional portion of Sonys Employee Pension Fund. 54 Table of Contents Excluding the operating income recorded in the music business, a loss was recorded within All Other mainly as the result of an asset impairment write-down associated with the sale of the Metreon, a U.S. entertainment complex. This was offset to some extent by cost reductions at network related businesses within Sony Corporation. Foreign Exchange Fluctuations and Risk Hedging During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, the average value of the yen was 112.3 yen against the U.S. dollar, and 136.3 yen against the Euro, which was 5.1 percent lower against the U.S. dollar and 2.0 percent lower against the Euro, respectively, compared with the average of the previous fiscal year. In the Pictures segment, Sony translates into yen the U.S. dollar consolidated results of SPE (a U.S.-based operation that has worldwide subsidiaries). Therefore, analysis and discussion of certain portions of the operating results of SPE are specified as being on a U.S. dollar basis. Results on a U.S. dollar basis are not on the same basis as Sonys consolidated financial statements and do not conform with U.S. GAAP. In addition, Sony does not believe that these measures are a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures. However, Sony believes that results presented on a local currency basis provide additional useful information to investors regarding operating performance. Sonys consolidated results are subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations mainly derived from the fact that the countries where manufacturing takes place may be different from those where such products are sold. In order to reduce the risk caused by such fluctuations, Sony employs derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, in accordance with a consistent risk management strategy. Such derivatives are used primarily to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows generated by anticipated intercompany transactions and intercompany accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies. SGTS in London provides integrated treasury services for Sony Corporation and its subsidiaries. Sonys policy is that Sony Corporation and all subsidiaries with foreign exchange exposures should enter into commitments with SGTS for hedging their exposures. Sony Corporation and most of its subsidiaries utilize SGTS for this purpose. The concentration of foreign exchange exposures at SGTS means that, in effect, SGTS hedges the net foreign exchange exposure of Sony Corporation and its subsidiaries. SGTS in turn enters into foreign exchange transactions with creditworthy third-party financial institutions. Most of the transactions are entered into against projected exposures before the actual export and import transactions take place. In general, SGTS hedges the projected exposures on average three months before the actual transactions take place. However, in certain cases SGTS partially hedges the projected exposures one month before the actual transactions take place when business requirements such as shorter production-sales cycle for certain products arise. Sony enters into foreign exchange transactions with financial institutions primarily for hedging purposes. Sony does not use these derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes except for certain derivatives in the Financial Services segment utilized for portfolio investments and ALM. To minimize the adverse effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on its financial results, particularly in the Electronics segment, Sony seeks, when appropriate, to localize material and parts procurement, design, and manufacturing operations in areas outside of Japan. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, including foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts and other derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are marked-to-market with changes in value recognized in Other Income and Expenses. The notional amounts of foreign exchange forward contracts, currency option contracts purchased and currency option contracts written as of March 31, 2006 were 1,489.2 billion yen, 457.4 billion yen and 163.7 billion yen, respectively. 55 Table of Contents Assets, Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Assets Total assets on March 31, 2007 increased by 1,108.6 billion yen, or 10.5 percent, to 11,716.4 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Total assets on March 31, 2007 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment increased by 711.3 billion yen, or 11.1 percent, to 7,098.1 billion yen and total assets on March 31, 2007 in the Financial Services segment increased by 409.5 billion yen, or 9.0 percent, to 4,977.6 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Current Assets Current assets on March 31, 2007 increased by 777.2 billion yen, or 20.6 percent, to 4,546.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Current assets on March 31, 2007 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased by 538.4 billion yen, or 18.2 percent, to 3,495.0 billion yen. Cash and cash equivalents on March 31, 2007 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased 62.6 billion yen, or 10.7 percent, to 522.9 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Notes and accounts receivable, trade (net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns) on March 31, 2007, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased 369.5 billion yen, or 37.9 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year-end to 1,343.1 billion yen. This was primarily the result of an increase in sales of the PS3. Inventories on March 31, 2007 increased by 136.2 billion yen, or 16.9 percent, to 940.9 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This increase was primarily a result of both increased semiconductor inventory, primarily for use in the PS3, and LCD television inventory in the Electronics segment and increased inventory in the Game segment resulting from the world-wide introduction of the PS3 platform. The inventory to cost of sales turnover ratio (based on the average of inventories at the end of each fiscal year and the previous fiscal year) was 1.78 months compared to 1.67 months at the end of the previous fiscal year. Sony considers this level of inventory to be appropriate in the aggregate. Current assets on March 31, 2007 in the Financial Services segment increased by 237.8 billion yen, or 27.9 percent, to 1,089.3 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This increase was primarily due to an expansion of the life insurance and banking businesses. Investments and Advances Investments and advances on March 31, 2007 increased by 368.8 billion yen, or 10.5 percent, to 3,888.7 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Investments and advances on March 31, 2007 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased by 148.8 billion yen, or 31.3 percent, to 623.3 billion yen. This was primarily a result of an increase in investments and advances towards affiliated companies such as Sony Ericsson and S-LCD. Investments and advances on March 31, 2007 in the Financial Services segment increased by 216.6 billion yen, or 6.9 percent, to 3,347.9 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This increase was primarily due to investments mainly in Japanese fixed income securities by Sony Life, which increased assets as a result of an expansion of business, and an increase in mortgage loans at Sony Bank. Also refer to Investments below. Property, Plant and Equipment (after deduction of accumulated depreciation) Property, plant and equipment on March 31, 2007 increased by 33.0 billion yen, or 2.4 percent, to 1,421.5 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Property, plant and equipment on March 31, 2007 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased by 31.7 billion yen, or 2.3 percent, to 1,382.9 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. 56 Table of Contents Capital expenditures (part of the increase in property, plant and equipment) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 increased by 29.8 billion yen, or 7.8 percent, to 414.1 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Capital expenditures in the Electronics segment increased by 22.9 billion yen, or 7.0 percent, to 351.5 billion yen. Capital expenditures in the semiconductor business within the Electronics segment, including capital expenditures related to the Cell Broadband Enginetm (Cell/B.E.), totaled approximately 150.0 billion yen. Capital expenditures increased in the Game segment by 8.4 billion yen, or 99.5 percent, to 16.8 billion yen. In the Pictures segment, capital expenditures increased by 0.9 billion yen, or 8.6 percent to 11.0 billion yen. In All Other, which includes Sonys consolidated music business, 5.6 billion yen of capital expenditures were recorded, compared to the 4.2 billion yen of capital expenditures recorded in the previous fiscal year. Property, plant and equipment on March 31, 2007 in the Financial Services segment increased by 1.2 billion yen, or 3.3 percent, to 38.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Capital expenditures in the Financial Services segment increased by 2.4 billion yen, or 53.4 percent, to 6.8 billion yen. Other Assets Other assets on March 31, 2007 decreased by 18.7 billion yen, or 1.2 percent, to 1,550.7 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year end. Other assets on March 31, 2007 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased by 44.1 billion yen to 1,100.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Deferred tax assets on March 31, 2007 increased by 38.2 billion yen, or 21.4 percent, to 217.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year end. The increase is due primarily to an increase of deferred tax assets recorded in connection with tax loss carryforwards of foreign subsidiaries in the Game segment. Other assets in the Financial Services segment on March 31, 2007 decreased by 46.2 billion yen, or 8.4 percent, to 501.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Liabilities Total current and long-term liabilities on March 31, 2007 increased by 939.9 billion yen, or 12.8 percent, to 8,306.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Total current and long-term liabilities on March 31, 2007 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased by 589.0 billion yen, or 16.6 percent, to 4,140.9 billion yen. Total current and long-term liabilities in the Financial Services segment on March 31, 2007 increased by 363.2 billion yen, or 9.1 percent, to 4,337.7 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Current Liabilities Current liabilities on March 31, 2007 increased by 351.6 billion yen, or 11.0 percent, to 3,551.9 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Current liabilities on March 31, 2007 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment increased by 311.3 billion yen, or 13.4 percent, to 2,640.6 billion yen. Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt on March 31, 2007 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased 144.1 billion yen, or 64.0 percent, to 80.9 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This was principally as a result of a decrease in the current portion of long-term debt, due to the redemption of straight bonds and medium-term notes. Notes and accounts payable, trade on March 31, 2007 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased by 362.9 billion yen, or 45.1 percent, to 1,167.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Current liabilities on March 31, 2007 in the Financial Services segment increased by 39.1 billion yen, or 4.3 percent, to 957.5 billion yen, mainly due to an increase in deposits from customers at Sony Bank. 57 Table of Contents Long-term Liabilities Long-term liabilities on March 31, 2007 increased by 588.3 billion yen, or 14.1 percent, to 4,754.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Long-term liabilities on March 31, 2007 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased by 277.7 billion yen, or 22.7 percent, to 1,500.3 billion yen. In addition, long-term debt on March 31, 2007 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased by 223.9 billion yen, or 31.9 percent, to 925.3 billion yen. Long-term debt increased primarily due to the execution of yen-denominated syndicated loans for the purpose of allocating funds for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, and for debt redemption. Long-term liabilities on March 31, 2007 in the Financial Services segment increased by 324.0 billion yen, or 10.6 percent, to 3,380.2 billion yen. This was due to an increase in insurance-in-force in the life insurance business which resulted in an increase in future insurance policy benefits and other of 293.3 billion yen, or 10.7 percent, to 3,037.7 billion yen. Total Interest-bearing Debt Total interest-bearing debt on March 31, 2007 decreased by 4.8 billion yen, or 0.4 percent, to 1,096.5 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Total interest-bearing debt on March 31, 2007 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased by 79.7 billion yen, or 8.6 percent, to 1,006.2 billion yen. Stockholders Equity Stockholders equity on March 31, 2007 increased by 166.9 billion yen, or 5.2 percent, to 3,370.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Retained earnings increased 116.9 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end, and accumulated other comprehensive income (net of tax) was 115.5 billion yen. This was primarily due to accumulated other comprehensive income of 86.3 billion yen arising from foreign currency translation adjustments in the current fiscal year due to the depreciation of the yen, partially offset by a decrease in unrealized gains on securities in accumulated other comprehensive income of 14.7 billion yen in the current fiscal year. The ratio of stockholders equity to total assets decreased 1.4 percentage points compared to the end of the previous fiscal year, from 30.2 percent to 28.8 percent. 58 Table of Contents Condensed Balance Sheets Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following schedule shows an unaudited condensed balance sheet for the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding Financial Services as well as the condensed consolidated balance sheet. This presentation is not required under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony believes that a comparative presentation may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding Financial Services are eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below.

Factors that are considered by Sony in determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred include: the length of time and extent to which the market value of the security has been less than its original cost, the financial condition, operating results, business plans and estimated future cash flows of the issuer of the security, other specific factors affecting the market value, deterioration of issuers credit condition, sovereign risk, and whether or not Sony is able to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in market value. 61 Table of Contents In evaluating the factors for available-for-sale securities with readily determinable fair values, management presumes a decline in value to be other-than-temporary if the fair value of the security is 20 percent or more below its original cost for an extended period of time (generally a period of up to six months). The presumption of an other-than-temporary impairment in such cases may be overcome if there is evidence to support the conclusion that the decline is temporary in nature due to the existence of other factors which overcome the duration or magnitude of the decline. On the other hand, there may be cases where impairment losses are recognized when the decline in the fair value of the security is not more than 20 percent or such decline has not existed for an extended period of time, as a result of considering specific factors which may indicate the decline in the fair value is other-than-temporary. The assessment of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other-than-temporary is often judgmental in nature and involves certain assumptions and estimates concerning the expected operating results, business plans and future cash flows of the issuer of the security. Accordingly, it is possible that investments in Sonys portfolio that have had a decline in value that Sony currently believes to be temporary may be determined to be other-than-temporary in the future based on Sonys evaluation of additional information such as continued poor operating results, future broad declines in value of worldwide equity markets and the effect of worldwide interest rate fluctuations. As a result, unrealized losses recorded for investments may be recognized into income in future periods. The following table contains available-for-sale and held to maturity securities, breaking out the unrealized gains and losses by investment category. March 31, 2007 Unrealized Unrealized Fair Market Cost Gain Loss Value (Yen in millions) Financial Services Business: Available-for-sale Debt securities Sony Life 2,129,352 17,679 (3,052 ) 2,143,979 Other 381,663 5,983 (5,794 ) 381,852 Equity securities Sony Life 210,009 105,376 (3,579 ) 311,806 Other 7,341 1,657 (40 ) 8,958 Held to maturity Debt securities Sony Life     Other 34,931 165 (127 ) 34,969 Total Financial Services 2,763,296 130,860 (12,592 ) 2,881,564 Non-Financial Services: Available-for-sale securities 70,496 21,909 (3,770 ) 88,635 Held to maturity securities 1,104   1,104 Total Non-Financial Services 71,600 21,909 (3,770 ) 89,739 Consolidated 2,834,896 152,769 (16,362 ) 2,971,303 The most significant portion of these unrealized losses relate to investments held by Sony Life. Sony Life principally invests in debt securities in various industries. Almost all of these securities were rated BBB or higher by Standard & Poors, Moodys or other rating agencies. As of March 31, 2007, Sony Life had debt and equity securities which had gross unrealized losses of 3.1 billion yen and 3.6 billion yen, respectively. Of the unrealized loss amounts recorded by Sony Life, approximately 46 percent relate to securities being in an unrealized loss position for periods greater than 12 months as of March 31, 2007. These unrealized losses related to numerous investments, with no single investment being in a material unrealized loss position for the above-mentioned periods. In addition, there was no individual security with unrealized losses that met the test discussed above for impairment 62 Table of Contents as the declines in value were observed to be small both in amounts and percentage, and therefore, the decline in value for those investments was still determined to be temporary in nature. The percentage of non-investment grade securities held by Sony Life represents approximately 0.1 percent of Sony Lifes total investment portfolio, while the percentage of unrealized losses that relate to those non-investment grade securities was approximately 1 percent of Sony Lifes total unrealized losses as of March 31, 2007. For fixed maturity securities with unrecognized losses held by Sony Life as of March 31, 2007 (3.1 billion yen), maturity dates vary as follows:  Within 1 year: 0.4 percent  1 to 5 years: 96.0 percent  5 to 10 years: 3.4 percent  Above 10 years: 0.2 percent Sony also maintains long-term investment securities issued by a number of non-public companies. The aggregate carrying amount of the investments in non-public companies at March 31, 2007 was 64.9 billion yen. A non-public equity investment is valued at cost as fair value is not readily determinable. If the value is estimated to have declined and such decline is judged to be other-than-temporary, the impairment of the investment is recognized and the carrying value is reduced to its fair value. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, total impairment losses were 4.2 billion yen, 4.0 billion yen and 7.4 billion yen, of which 0.5 billion yen, 0.2 billion yen and 6.1 billion yen, respectively, were recorded by Sony Life in Financial Services revenue. Impairment losses other than at Sony Life in each of the three years were reflected in non-operating expenses and primarily relate to certain strategic investments in non-financial services businesses. These investments primarily relate to the certain strategic investments in Japan and the U.S. with which Sony has strategic relationships for the purposes of developing and marketing new technologies. The impairment losses were recorded for each of the three fiscal years as these companies failed to successfully develop and market such technology, the operating performance of the companies was more unfavorable than previously expected and the decline in fair value of these companies was judged as other-than-temporary. None of these impairment losses was individually material to Sony. Upon determination that the value of an investment is impaired, the value of the investment is written down to its fair value. For publicly traded investments, fair value is determined by the closing stock price as of the date on which the impairment determination is made. For non-public investments, fair value is determined through the use of such methodologies as discounted cash flows, valuation of recent financings and comparable valuations of similar companies. The impairment losses that were recorded in each of the three fiscal years related to the unique facts and circumstances of each individual investment and did not significantly impact other investments. Sony Life and Sony Banks investments constitute the majority of the investments in the Financial Services segment. Sony Life and Sony Bank account for approximately 85 percent and 13 percent of the investments of the Financial Services segment, respectively. Sony Lifes fundamental investment policy is to build an investment portfolio capable of ensuring stable mid- to long-term returns through the efficient investment of funds, taking into account both expected returns and investment risks and responding flexibly to changes in financial conditions and the investment environment, while maintaining a sound asset base. Moreover, as its fundamental stance towards ALM, a method of managing interest rate fluctuation risk through the comprehensive identification of differences in duration and cash flows between assets and liabilities, Sony Life takes the distinct characteristics of liability into account in order to control price fluctuation risks and establish a portfolio that ensures a certain level of returns. Sony Life adjusts its investing style depending on changes in the investment environment. In the first half of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, when interest rates in Japan were increasing, Sony Life invested mainly in long-term Japanese government bonds. Sony Life concentrated its investments in convertible bonds whose prices had declined due to the issuers falling stock price. Sony Bank operates using a similar basic investment policy as Sony Life, taking expected returns and investment risks into account in order to disperse associated risks, and structuring its asset portfolio to ensure steady returns from investments. In addition, Sony Bank is careful to match the duration of its asset portfolio with the 63 Table of Contents duration of liabilities resulting from customer deposits, in order to ensure that significant discrepancies do not occur. Government bonds and corporate bonds in yen or other currencies constitute a majority of Sony Banks current portfolio. To safeguard its assets Sony Bank does not invest in equity securities but invests in various types of government and corporate bonds in many countries, companies and industries, to diversify associated risks. With respect to loans, Sony Bank mainly offers housing loans to individuals and does not have any corporate loan exposure. Contractual obligations, commitments, and contingent liabilities The following table summarizes Sonys contractual obligations and major commitments as of March 31, 2007. The references to the Notes below refer to a corresponding note within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The commitments include major purchase obligations as shown above. In the ordinary course of business, Sony makes commitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment. As of March 31, 2007, such commitments outstanding were 43.3 billion yen. A subsidiary in the Pictures segment has committed to fund a portion of the production costs of completed films and is responsible for all distribution and marketing expenses relating to these films under a distribution agreement with a third party. Further, certain subsidiaries in the Pictures segment have entered into agreements with creative talent for the development and production of films and television programming as well as agreements with third parties to acquire completed films, or certain rights therein. As of March 31, 2007, the total amount of the expected cost for the production or purchase of films and television programming or certain rights under the above commitments was 67.7 billion yen. Sony Corporation has entered into a partnership program contract with Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). Through this program Sony Corporation will be able to exercise various rights as an official sponsor of FIFA events from 2007 to 2014. As of March 31, 2007, Sony Corporation was committed to make payments of 30.9 billion yen under such contract. In July 2006, Sony Corporation and Samsung signed the final contract with respect to the construction of an 8th generation amorphous TFT-LCD panel manufacturing line at their joint venture, S-LCD. As of March 31, 2007, Sony Corporation was committed to make payments of 50.2 billion yen under such contract. In order to fulfill its commitments, Sony will use cash generated by its operating activities, intra-group loans and borrowings from subsidiaries with excess funds to subsidiaries that are short of funds through its finance subsidiaries, and, when necessary, raise funds from the global capital markets and banks. The following table summarizes Sonys contingent liabilities as of March 31, 2007. Total Amounts of Contingent Liabilities Contingent Liabilities: (Note 23) (Yen in millions ) Loan guarantees to related parties 11,100 Other 10,581 Total contingent liabilities 21,681 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Sony has several off-balance sheet arrangements to provide liquidity, capital resources and/or credit risk support. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, Sony entered into accounts receivable sales programs that provide for the accelerated receipt of up to 47.5 billion yen of eligible trade accounts receivable of Sony Corporation. Through these programs, Sony can sell receivables to special purpose entities owned and operated by banks. These transactions are accounted for as a sale in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because Sony has relinquished control of the receivables. Accordingly, accounts receivable sold under these transactions are excluded from receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The initial sale of these receivables was in March 2005, and Sony sold a total of 10.0 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. Total receivables sold for the fiscal years ended March 2006 and 2007 were 146.2 billion yen and 152.5 billion yen, respectively. Losses from these transactions were insignificant. Although Sony continues servicing the sold receivables, no servicing liabilities are recorded because costs regarding collection of the sold receivables are insignificant. Refer to Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the accounts receivable securitization. 65 Table of Contents Sony has, from time to time, entered into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs). In several of the arrangements in which Sony holds a significant variable interest, Sony is the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidates these VIEs. These arrangements include facilities which provide for the leasing of certain property, the financing of film production and the U.S. based music publishing business. In addition, Sony holds a significant variable interest in VIEs in which Sony is not the primary beneficiary and therefore does not consolidate. These VIEs include the film production/co-financing arrangements noted as follows. On December 30, 2005, a subsidiary in the Pictures segment entered into a production/co-financing agreement with a VIE to co-finance 11 films that were released over the 15 months ended March 31, 2007. The subsidiary received 373 million U.S. dollars over the term of the agreement to fund the production or acquisition cost of films (including fees and expenses). The subsidiary is responsible for the marketing and distribution of the product through its global distribution channels. The VIE shares in the net profits, as defined, of the films after the subsidiary recoups a distribution fee, its marketing and distribution expenses, and third party participation and residual costs, each as defined. The subsidiary did not make any equity investment in the VIE nor issue any guarantees with respect to the VIE. On April 28, 2006, the subsidiary entered into a second production/co-financing agreement with a VIE to co-finance additional films. Nine films are anticipated to be released under this financing arrangement. The subsidiary will receive approximately 240 million U.S. dollars over the term of the agreement to fund the production or acquisition cost of the films (including fees and expenses). Similar to the first agreement, the subsidiary is responsible for the marketing and distribution of the product through its global distribution channels. The VIE shares in the net profits, as defined, of the films after the subsidiary recoups a distribution fee, its marketing and distribution expenses, and third party participation and residual costs, each as defined. As of March 31, 2007, three co-financed films have been released by the subsidiary and 37 million U.S. dollars has been received from the VIE under this agreement. The subsidiary did not make any equity investment in the VIE nor issue any guarantees with respect to the VIE. On January 19, 2007, the subsidiary entered into a third production/co-financing agreement with a VIE to co-finance a majority of the films to be submitted through March 2012. The subsidiary has received a commitment from the VIE that the VIE will fund up to 525 million U.S. dollars on a revolving basis to fund the production or acquisition cost of films (including fees and expenses). As of March 31, 2007, no films of the subsidiary have been funded by this VIE. Similar to the first two agreements, the subsidiary is responsible for marketing and distribution of the product through its global distribution channels. The VIE shares in the net profits, as defined, of the films after the subsidiary recoups a distribution fee, its marketing and distribution expenses, and third party participation and residual costs, each as defined. The subsidiary did not make any equity investment in the VIE nor issue any guarantees with respect to the VIE.

Cash Flows (The fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006) Operating Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, Sony generated 561.0 billion yen of net cash from operating activities, an increase of 161.2 billion yen, or 40.3 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. Of this total, all segments excluding the Financial Services segment generated 305.6 billion yen of net cash from operating activities, an increase of 53.6 billion yen, or 21.3 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year, and the Financial Services segment generated 256.5 billion yen of net cash from operating activities, an increase of 109.4 billion yen, or 74.3 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. During the fiscal year, there was a positive impact on operating cash flow from an increase in notes and accounts payable, trade, and an increase in future insurance policy benefits and other as well as the contribution of net income after taking into account depreciation and amortization. However, primarily offsetting these contributions was an increase in notes and accounts receivable, trade, and inventory, particularly within the Electronics and Game segments. Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash provided by operating activities increased mainly as a result of an increase in net income after taking into account depreciation and amortization recorded during the fiscal year as compared to the previous fiscal year, as well as the effect of the gain on the transfer to the Japanese government of 66 Table of Contents the substitutional portion of the employee pension fund in the previous fiscal year, and the effect of an increase in revenue from insurance premiums, primarily reflecting an increase in insurance-in-force at Sony Life. Investing Activities: During the fiscal year, Sony used 715.4 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, a decrease of 155.8 billion yen, or 17.9 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. Of this total, all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, used 431.1 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, an increase of 134.7 billion yen, or 45.5 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year, and the Financial Services segment used 276.7 billion yen in net cash, a decrease of 287.0 billion yen, or 50.9 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. During the fiscal year, purchases of fixed assets (capital expenditures) in the Electronics segment were made primarily for semiconductor manufacturing facilities. Part of an investment in S-LCD was also made for manufacturing facilities for 8th generation TFT LCD panels. Within the Financial Services segment, payments for investments and advances, such as investments mainly in Japanese fixed income securities at Sony Life and an increase in the outstanding balance of mortgage loans at Sony Bank, exceeded proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities, sales of securities investments and collections of advances. Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash used in investing activities increased within all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, reflecting the additional investment in S-LCD and the purchases of fixed assets noted above. On the other hand, net cash used in the Financial Services segment for investing activities decreased compared to the previous fiscal year due to the fact that there was an increase in the collections of investments and advances as compared to the previous fiscal year. In all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, the difference between cash generated from operating activities and cash used in investing activities was a net use of cash of 125.5 billion yen, an increase of 81.1 billion yen, or 182.7 percent, as compared to a net use of cash of 44.4 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Financing Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, 247.9 billion yen of net cash was provided by financing activities. Of the total, 59.6 billion yen of net cash was generated from financing activities in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, a decrease of 15.0 billion yen or 20.1 percent, compared to net cash generated in the previous fiscal year of 74.6 billion yen. This was a result, as noted above, of financing carried out through yen-denominated syndicated loans during the current fiscal year. In the Financial Services segment, as a result of an increase in policyholder accounts at Sony Life and an increase in deposits from customers at the banking business, financing activities generated 179.6 billion yen of net cash. Accounting for all these factors and the effect of exchange rate changes, the total outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fiscal year increased by 96.8 billion yen, or 13.8 percent, to 799.9 billion yen, compared with the end of the previous fiscal year. The total outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents of all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 62.6 billion yen, or 10.7 percent, to 522.9 billion yen, and for the Financial Services segment, increased by 159.4 billion, or 135.5 percent, to 277.0 billion yen, compared with the end of the previous fiscal year. 67 Table of Contents Condensed Statements of Cash Flows Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following schedule shows unaudited condensed statements of cash flow for the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding the Financial Services segment as well as condensed consolidated statements of cash flow. These presentations are not required under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony believes that a comparative presentation may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements.

During the fiscal year, there was a positive impact on operating cash flow mainly from the effect of the profit contribution from the Financial Services segment, and after taking into account depreciation and amortization, as well as the effect of the loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net. However, primarily offsetting these contributions was an increase in inventory, particularly within the Electronics and Game segments, the effect of the non-cash net gain on the transfer to the Japanese Government of the substitutional portion of the employee pension fund, an increase in deferred acquisition costs within the Financial Services segment and effect of the gain on change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees. Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash provided by operating activities decreased mainly as a result of lower net income recorded during the fiscal year as compared to the previous fiscal year, and, as noted above, the increase in inventory during the fiscal year compared with the previous fiscal year, the effect of the gain on the transfer to the Japanese Government of the substitutional portion of the employee pension fund, and of the gain on change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees. Investing Activities: During the fiscal year, Sony used 871.3 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, a decrease of 59.9 billion yen, or 6.4 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. Of this total, all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, used 296.4 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, a decrease of 175.7 billion yen, or 37.2 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year, and the Financial Services segment used 563.8 billion yen in net cash, an increase of 142.4 billion yen, or 33.8 percent. During the fiscal year, purchases of fixed assets (capital expenditures) were made, primarily due to proactive capital expenditures in semiconductors mainly within the Electronics segment, mostly associated with image sensors. Within the Financial Services segment, payments for investments and advances exceeded proceeds from maturities of marketable securities, sales of securities investments and collections of advances, primarily as a result of investments, mainly in Japanese fixed income securities, resulting from an increase in insurance premiums at Sony Life, and an increase in the outstanding balance of mortgage loans at Sony Bank. Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash used in investing activities decreased, primarily due to the fact that in the previous fiscal year, investments were carried out principally in relation to S-LCD and in semiconductor fabrication equipment, particularly investments associated with the Cell/B.E. On the other hand, within the Financial Services segment, net cash used in investing activities increased due to an increase in investments and advances compared to the previous fiscal year. In all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, the difference between cash generated from operating activities and cash used in investing activities was a use of cash of 44.4 billion yen, as compared to the 13.3 billion yen of cash generated in the previous fiscal year. Financing Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, 359.9 billion yen of net cash was provided by financing activities. Of the total, 74.6 billion yen of net cash was generated from financing activities in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, compared to a use of net cash in the previous fiscal year of 95.4 billion yen. This was a result of straight bonds issued in order to redeem bonds maturing during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and March 31, 2007.

Sony intends to continue various investments for future growth. Funding requirements that arise from its business strategy are principally covered by free cash flow generated from business operations and by cash and cash equivalents (cash balance) however as needed, Sony will procure funds from the financial and capital markets. 70 Table of Contents For these financing activities, Sony has sufficient access to financial and capital markets as described below. In addition, to sustain sufficient liquidity, Sony has committed lines of credit with financial institutions, together with cash balances. The description below covers liquidity and capital resources for consolidated Sony and excludes the Financial Services segment, which secures liquidity on its own. Market Access Sony Corporation and SGTS, a finance subsidiary in the U.K., procure funds from the financial and capital markets. In order to meet long-term funding requirements, Sony Corporation utilizes its access to global equity and bond markets and borrowings from financial institutions. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, Sony issued an 80 billion yen syndicated loan in June 2006 (3 years maturity), and a 130 billion yen syndicated loan in December 2006 (4 years and 7 years maturity), for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures, and debt redemption. Sony maintains a bond shelf registration of 300 billion yen filed in Japan, effective until April 2008; however Sony has not issued a bond using this shelf registration during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. In order to meet the working capital requirements of Sony, SGTS maintains commercial paper (CP) programs and a medium-term note (MTN) program. SGTS maintains CP programs for the U.S., Euro and Japanese CP markets. As of March 31, 2007, the total maximum amount to be issued under these CP programs, translated into yen, was 1,326.6 billion yen. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, the largest month-end outstanding balance of CP was 348.2 billion yen in November 2006. There was no outstanding balance of CP as of March 31, 2007. SGTS maintains a Euro MTN program with a program limit amount, translated into yen as of March 31, 2007, of 590.5 billion yen. There was no outstanding balance as of that date. Liquidity Management Sonys working capital needs grow significantly in the third quarter (from October to December) as a result of the general seasonality of Sonys business. Sonys basic liquidity management policy is to secure sufficient liquidity throughout the relevant fiscal year, covering such factors as short-term cash flow volatility mentioned above, repayments for debts whose due date fall within a year, and possible downward earnings risk due to changes in the business environment. Sony defines its liquidity sources as the amount of cash balance, and committed lines of credit contracted with financial institutions. Regarding its cash balance, Sonys policy is to maintain more than a certain level of cash balance to absorb any daily and monthly working capital needs. The balance of cash and marketable securities on March 31, 2007 was 525.9 billion yen. A short-term shortage in the cash balance is financed by the issuance of CP. However, Sony controls the outstanding CP amount through internal limits as part of its short-term debt risk management strategy. For general corporate purposes, including the support of CP programs and for emergency purposes, Sony has a total, translated into yen, of 689.3 billion yen in committed lines of credit with various financial institutions, of which the unused amount was 684.9 billion yen as of March 31, 2007. Major committed lines of credit include a total, translated into yen, of 505.4 billion yen of Global Commitment Facilities contracted with a syndicate of global banks effective until March 2009, and a 150 billion yen committed line of credit contracted with Japanese financial institutions, effective until July 2009. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, the contract period of the committed line of credit with Japanese financial institutions was extended for one year, from the previous contract which was effective until July 2008. In the event of a downgrade in Sonys credit ratings, even though the cost of borrowing could increase, there are no financial covenants in any of Sonys material financial agreements that would cause an acceleration of the obligation. In general, there are no restrictions on the uses of proceeds except that some borrowings may not be used to acquire securities listed on a U.S. exchange or traded over-the-counter in the U.S., and the use of such borrowings must comply with the rules and regulations issued by authorities such as the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board. 71 Table of Contents Ratings Sony considers one of managements top priorities to be the maintenance of a stable and appropriate credit ratings in order to ensure financial flexibility for liquidity and capital management and continued adequate access to sufficient funding resources in the financial and capital markets. In order to facilitate access to global capital markets, Sony obtains credit ratings from two rating agencies, Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) and Standard and Poors Rating Services (S&P). In addition, Sony maintains a rating from Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I), a rating agency in Japan, for access to the Japanese capital market. Sonys current debt ratings from each agency are noted below: Moodys S&P R&I Long-term debt A2 (Outlook: Stable) A- (Outlook: Negative) AA- (Outlook: Stable) Short-term debt P-1 A-2 a-1+ In October 2006, S&P changed its outlook of Sonys long-term debt rating from stable to negative. This change was made based upon their view of increased uncertainty for Sonys business recovery in fiscal year 2007 onwards. Despite this change in outlook, Sony believes its access to the global capital markets and its ability to issue CP for its working capital needs have not been restricted. Cash Management Sony is centralizing and working to make more efficient its global cash management activities through SGTS. The excess or shortage of cash at most of Sonys subsidiaries is invested or funded by SGTS after having been netted out, although Sony recognizes that fund transfers are limited in certain countries and geographical areas due to restrictions on capital transactions. In order to pursue more efficient cash management, Sony manages uneven cash distribution among its subsidiaries directly or indirectly through SGTS so that Sony can reduce unnecessary cash and cash equivalents as well as borrowings as much as possible. Financial Services segment In the Financial Services segment, the management of Sony Financial Holdings Inc. (SFH), Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank recognize the importance of securing sufficient liquidity to cover the payment of obligations that they incur in the ordinary course of business, and these companies abide by the regulations imposed by regulatory authorities and establish and operate under company guidelines that comply with these regulations. Their purpose in doing so is to maintain sufficient cash and cash equivalents and secure sufficient means to pay their obligations. For instance, cash inflows for Sony Life and Sony Assurance come mainly from policyholders insurance premiums and Sony Life and Sony Assurance keep sufficient liquidity in the form of investments primarily in various securities. Sony Bank, on the other hand, uses its cash inflows, which come mainly from customers deposits in local or foreign currencies, in order to offer mortgage loans to individuals or to make bond investments, and establish a necessary level of liquidity for the smooth settlement of transactions. Sony Life currently obtains ratings from five rating agencies: A+ by S&P for insurer financial strength rating, Aa3 by Moodys for insurance financial strength rating, A+ by AM Best Company Inc. for financial strength rating, AA by R&I for insurance claims paying ability and AA by the Japan Credit Rating Agency Ltd. for ability to pay insurance claims. Sony Bank obtained an A- rating from S&P for its long-term local/foreign currency issuer ratings and an A-2 rating from S&P for its short-term local/foreign currency issuer rating. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT In its mid-term corporate strategy announced on September 22, 2005, Sony stressed that the most pressing issue confronting Sony today is the revitalization of its electronics business. The strengthening of the competitiveness of Sonys technologies and its products is an important element of both the revitalization of the Electronics business and Sonys growth strategy, and Sony expects that research and development activities that support this competitiveness will remain pivotal to its mid- to long term strategy. 72 Table of Contents Research and development is focused in four key domains: a common development platform technology for home and mobile electronics and the technologies essential for product differentiation and for creating value-added products, semiconductor, device, and software technologies. Reflecting Sonys mid-term corporate strategy, in October 2005, Sony established the Display Device Development Group, to accelerate the development of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays, and the Technology Development Group, to strengthen software development. In April 2007, Sony expressed its intention to begin selling 11- inch OLED flat panel televisions during 2007. Research and development costs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 increased 12.1 billion yen, or 2.3 percent, to 543.9 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of research and development costs to net sales (which excludes financial service revenue) decreased from 7.8 percent to 7.1 percent. The bulk of research and development costs were incurred in the Electronics and Game segments. Expenses in the Electronics segment increased 22.3 billion yen, or 5.3 percent, to 440.4 billion yen, whereas expenses in the Game segment decreased 10.8 billion yen, or 9.9 percent, to 97.9 billion yen. In the Electronics segment, approximately 62 percent of expenses were for the development of new product prototypes while the remaining approximately 38 percent were for the development of mid- to long-term new technologies in such areas as semiconductors, communications and displays. In the Game segment, research and development costs decreased mainly due to the completion of most of the PS3s research and development phase. Research and development costs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased 29.8 billion yen, or 5.9 percent, to 531.8 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of research and development costs to net sales (which excludes financial service revenue) increased from 7.5 percent to 7.8 percent. The bulk of research and development costs were incurred in the Electronics and Game segments. Expenses in the Electronics segment decreased 15.2 billion yen, or 3.5 percent, to 418.1 billion yen, whereas expenses in the Game segment increased 40.2 billion yen, or 58.7 percent, to 108.7 billion yen. In the Electronics segment, approximately 64 percent of expenses were for the development of new product prototypes while the remaining 36 percent were for the development of mid- to long-term new technologies in such areas as semiconductors, communications, displays and next generation optical discs. In addition, within the Game segment, there was an increase primarily of hardware-related research and development costs associated with the PS3. Research and development costs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased 12.5 billion yen, or 2.4 percent, to 502.0 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of research and development costs to net sales (which excludes financial service revenue) increased from 7.4 percent to 7.5 percent. The bulk of research and development costs were incurred in the Electronics and Game segments. Expenses in the Electronics segment increased 2.4 billion yen, or 0.6 percent, to 433.3 billion yen, and expenses in the Game segment decreased 14.9 billion yen, or 17.9 percent, to 68.5 billion yen. In the Electronics segment, approximately 62 percent of expenses were for the development of new product prototypes while the remaining 38 percent were for the development of mid- to long-term new technologies in such areas as semiconductors, communications, displays and next generation optical discs. There was an increase in research and development costs related to semiconductor process technology associated with the transfer of Sony Computer Entertainments semiconductor manufacturing operations from the Game segment to the Electronics segment. However, the stringent selection of research and development activities resulted in a small increase in research and development expenses within the Electronics segment. Research and development expenses in the Game segment remained high due to the research and development associated with the PSP and the PS3. TREND INFORMATION This section contains forward-looking statements about the possible future performance of Sony and should be read in light of the cautionary statement on that subject, which appears on the inside front cover page and applies to this entire document. Issues Facing Sony and Managements Response to those Issues Competition in many of Sonys business segments continues to intensify and price erosion, especially in the Electronics segment, remains persistent. Competition has intensified due to the penetration of broadband, which has 73 Table of Contents led to an augmentation of network infrastructure, making it easier for companies in other sectors to enter the markets in which Sony competes. In response to these challenges, Sony has been undertaking initiatives to improve its competitiveness and strengthen the quality of its management, such as a reduction in the number of business categories and the number of models, a rationalization of manufacturing sites and the creation of a more efficient administrative structure, as well as the sale of non-core assets (refer to Restructuring in Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects for more detailed information about restructuring). This plan, developed in consultation with Sonys stakeholders both inside and outside the company, moved to strengthen Sonys competitiveness in three core sectors  Electronics, Game and Entertainment  through a balanced mix of restructuring and growth initiatives combined with a new organizational structure. In particular, it is the revitalization of Electronics that management regards as the most pressing issue confronting Sony today. As well as reorganizing its Electronics business to place centralized decision-making authority over key areas under the Electronics CEO, Sony is implementing reorganization initiatives to strengthen horizontal coordination in the key areas of product planning, technology, procurement, manufacturing, and sales and marketing. For Sonys growth strategy in Electronics, resources will be focused on the development and commercialization of high-definition products, mobile products and advanced semiconductors and other key devices that can further differentiate these products, targeting enhanced competitiveness and improved profitability. In the Game segment, Sony intends to expand the PS3 platform while developing its PS2 and PSP businesses. In addition to this cost-cutting and investment for growth, each of Sonys business segments grappled with issues specific to that segment. Below is a description of the issues management believes each segment continues to face and an explanation as to how each segment is approaching those issues. Electronics Although the Electronics segment continues to hold a very strong position in the worldwide consumer audio visual products market, that position has become increasingly threatened as a result of the entrance of new manufacturers and distributors. These new entrants are threatening Sonys position due to the industry shift from analog to digital technology. In the analog era, complicated functionality of electronics products was made possible through the combination of several complex parts, and Sony held a competitive advantage in the design and manufacture of those parts as a result of its accumulated expertise. In the digital era, however, complicated functionality has become concentrated on semiconductors and other key digital devices. Since these semiconductors and key devices are able to be mass produced, they have become readily available to new market entrants, and the functionality that once commanded a high premium has become more affordable. This has led to intense price erosion in the consumer audio visual products market. To respond to these challenges, Sony is striving to keep pace with price erosion by reducing its manufacturing and other costs. It is seeking to maintain the premium pricing it enjoys on many of its end-user products by adding functionality to those products and developing new applications and ways of use that appeal to the consumer. In addition, it is taking steps to increase its competitive edge by developing high value-added semiconductors and other digital key devices in-house. By enhancing the in-house production of key devices, Sony aims to incorporate added-value into these key devices. In the area of semiconductors, in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and 2007, Sony carried out 140 billion yen and 150 billion yen, respectively, of capital expenditures mainly on system large scale integrations (LSI) and CCDs. These totals also include Sonys investment in semiconductor fabrication equipment built at the 65 nanometer process technology level. Chips that will be manufactured using this equipment will be some of the most highly advanced on the market, and will include system LSI, in particular the Cell/B.E. microprocessor for the broadband era, which is already used in the computer entertainment system, PS3, and is anticipated for use in digital consumer electronics products. Over the last five years, Sony Corporation, Sony Computer Entertainment, IBM Corporation (IBM) and Toshiba Corporation (Toshiba) have carried out joint development focused on 90 and 65 nanometer process technology for utilization in the design and manufacturing of the Cell/B.E. Moreover, in 2006 Sony Corporation, IBM, and Toshiba concluded a new joint development agreement and an alliance for the research and development of advanced semiconductor technology has begun. 74 Table of Contents Sony has reconsidered its investment policy in the semiconductor business. In the future, Sony will carefully select investments and adopt a strategy to more clearly focus on the CCD and CMOS image sensor, television- and video-related, and Game-related businesses. In the area of other key devices, S-LCD, Sonys joint venture with Samsung, which is based in South Korea, started production of 7th generation amorphous TFT LCD panel (glass panel size: 1,870mm x 2,200mm) in April 2005 and since October 2005 has been producing 60,000 sheets a month. In July 2006, S-LCD increased its production capacity to 75,000 sheets a month and further increased its production capacity to 90,000 sheets in January 2007. In July 2006, Sony and Samsung signed the final contract regarding the manufacturing of 8th generation TFT LCD panels (glass panel size: 2,200mm x 2,500mm) at the S-LCD joint venture. The total amount of the investment is expected to be approximately 200 billion yen (approximately 50 percent of which will be borne by Sony), the major part of which has already been completed. The start of mass production is targeted for summer 2007 with production capacity expected to be 50,000 sheets a month. Game In the Game segment, for the PS2, which is in its eighth year since release, Sony estimated a decrease in production shipment volume, including hardware and software, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. However, as the PS2 platform is still recording favorable sales around the world, Sony will continue to try to maintain the scale of this business. Sony is strongly promoting the PSP platform by offering new ways to enjoy it, such as by increasing interconnectivity with the PS3, along with expanding the line-up of software unique to the PSP. Sony expects a significant reduction in the operating loss of the PS3 business with the rollout of an exciting software lineup, in addition to seeking rapid cost reductions, mainly by shrinking the size of semiconductor chips and reducing the number of parts in the console. Pictures In the Pictures segment, Sony faces intense competition, rising expenses, including advertising and promotion expenses, and a growing trend toward digital piracy. In addition, the DVD format is ten years old and is showing signs of maturation. To meet these challenges, Sony is working to distribute a diversified portfolio of motion pictures with broad worldwide appeal on existing and new home entertainment formats, including Blu-ray, and on other emerging platforms, including digital download. Financial Services In the Financial Services segment, the value of assets accumulated by the businesses in the segment has grown continuously over the past several years, resulting in a large portion (approximately 42 percent as of March 31, 2007) of Sonys total assets being accounted for by the Financial Services segment. To strengthen asset management and risk management in parallel with this growing asset value, enhance disclosure of business details, and offer customers integrated financial services tailored to their individual needs, Sony established SFH in April 2004. SFH functions as a holding company overseeing Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank, with the aim of increasing the synergies among these businesses. With respect to the environment in the financial services industry, Sony expects increasingly intense competition as it confronts changes in its business environment. In particular, Sony expects competition to result from the deregulation and liberalization of additional insurance premiums, postal privatization and the complete lifting of the ban on the sale of insurance products at banks, as well as changes in the macroeconomic environment brought about by Japans declining population, low birthrate and growing proportion of elderly citizens. In response to this changing environment, each of Sonys financial services businesses, which are latecomers to the life insurance, property and casualty insurance and banking industries, make use of distinctive, individual industry-specific business models and plan to achieve further business expansion and even higher levels of customer satisfaction. 75 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, Sony evaluates its estimates which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these evaluations form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. Sony considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to its financial condition and results, and requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management in its application. Sony believes that the following represent the critical accounting policies of the company. Investments Sonys investments are comprised of debt and equity securities accounted for under both the cost and equity method of accounting. If it has been determined that an investment has sustained an other-than-temporary decline in its value, the investment is written down to its fair value by a charge to earnings. Sony regularly evaluates its investment portfolio to identify other-than-temporary impairments of individual securities. Factors that are considered by Sony in determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred include: the length of time and extent to which the market value of the security has been less than its original cost, the financial condition, operating results, business plans and estimated future cash flows of the issuer of the security, other specific factors affecting the market value, deterioration of credit condition of the issuers, sovereign risk, and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in market value. In evaluating the factors for available-for-sale securities whose fair values are readily determinable, management presumes a decline in value to be other-than-temporary if the fair value of the security is 20 percent or more below its original cost for an extended period of time (generally a period of up to six months). This criteria is employed as a threshold to identify securities which may have a decline in value that is other-than-temporary. The presumption of an other-than-temporary impairment in such cases may be overcome if there is evidence to support that the decline is temporary in nature due to the existence of other factors which overcome the duration or magnitude of the decline. On the other hand, there may be cases where impairment losses are recognized when the decline in the fair value of the security is not more than 20 percent or such decline has not existed for an extended period of time, as a result of considering specific factors which may indicate the decline in the fair value is other-than-temporary. The assessment of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other-than-temporary often requires management judgment based on evaluation of relevant factors. Those factors include business plans and future cash flows of the issuer of the security, the regulatory, economic or technological environment of the investee, and the general market condition of either the geographic area or the industry in which the investee operates. Accordingly, it is possible that investments in Sonys portfolio that have had a decline in value that are currently believed to be temporary may determine to be other-than-temporary in the future based on Sonys evaluation of additional information such as continued poor operating results, future broad declines in value of worldwide equity markets or circumstances in market interest rate fluctuations. As a result, unrealized losses recorded for investments may be recognized into income in future periods. Valuation of inventory Sony values its inventory based on the lower of cost or market. Sony writes down inventory to an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the net realizable value  i.e., less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal. However, if actual market conditions are less favorable than projected and further price decreases are needed, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Additionally, as Sony evaluates its manufacturing cost in yen while it sets its sales prices in euros and U.S. dollars for some products, Sonys results may be negatively impacted by future exchange rate fluctuations. 76 Table of Contents Impairment of long-lived assets Sony reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets held and used and long-lived assets to be disposed of whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. This review is performed using estimates of future cash flows by product category (e.g. CRT TV display) or entity (e.g. an entertainment complex in the U.S.). If the carrying value of the asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined using the present value of estimated net cash flows or comparable market values. Management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value are reasonable; however, changes in estimates resulting in lower future cash flows and fair value due to unforeseen changes in business assumptions could negatively affect the valuations of those long-lived assets. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, Sony recorded impairment charges for long-lived assets totaling 19.2 billion yen, which included 7.5 billion yen for the impairment of long-lived assets of CRT TV display manufacturing facilities to be held and used in Europe in connection with certain restructuring activities in the Electronics segment. Fair value of these assets was determined using estimated future discounted cash flows which were based on the best information available. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, Sony recorded impairment charges for long-lived assets totaling 59.8 billion yen, which included 25.5 billion yen for the impairment of long-lived assets of CRT TV display manufacturing facilities to be held and used in the U.S. in connection with certain restructuring activities in the Electronics segment. Fair value of these assets was determined using estimated future discounted cash flows which were based on the best information available. The impairment charge also included 8.5 billion yen for the impairment of long-lived assets of Sonys entertainment complex to be held for sale in the U.S. in connection with restructuring activities of non-core businesses in All Other. The impairment charge was based on the negotiated sales price of the complex. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, Sony recorded impairment charges for long-lived assets totaling 16.8 billion yen, which included 3.6 billion yen for the impairment of long-lived assets of CRT TV display manufacturing facilities to be held and used in the U.S., East Asia and Southeast Asia in connection with certain restructuring activities in the Electronics segment. Fair value of these assets was determined using estimated future discounted cash flows which were based on the best information available. Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill and other intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite life are not amortized, but are tested annually for impairment in accordance with FAS No. 142 during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and the assets are also tested between the annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of these assets below their carrying amount. Such an event would include unfavorable variances from established business plans, significant changes in forecasted results or volatility inherent to external markets and industries, which are periodically reviewed by Sonys management. Specifically, goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit (Sonys operating segments or one level below the operating segments) with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. Other intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 77 Table of Contents Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions could significantly impact whether or not an impairment charge is recognized as well as the magnitude of any such charge. In its impairment review, Sony performs internal valuation analyses or utilizes third-party valuations when management believes it to be appropriate, and considers other market information that is publicly available. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flow analysis. This approach uses significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, the timing of such cash flows, discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates, determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, Sony recorded impairment losses of 5,620 million yen in reporting units in the Electronics segment, of which 5,320 million yen was related to the CRT TV business which was downsized in the U.S., and an impairment loss of 237 million yen in a reporting unit included in All Other. These impairment charges reflected the overall decline in the fair value of the subsidiaries. The fair value of the subsidiaries was estimated principally using the expected present value of future cash flows. Management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value are reasonable; however, changes in estimates resulting in lower future cash flows and fair value due to unforeseen changes in business assumptions could negatively affect the valuations, which may result in Sony recognizing impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets in the future. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the impairment analysis, Sony applied a hypothetical 10 percent decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit. As of March 31, 2007, a hypothetical 10 percent decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit would not have resulted in a material impairment loss. Pension benefits costs Employee pension benefit costs and obligations are dependent on certain assumptions including discount rates, retirement rates and mortality rates, which are based upon current statistical data, as well as expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and other factors. Specifically, the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on assets are two critical assumptions in the determination of periodic pension costs and pension liabilities. Assumptions are evaluated at least annually, or at the time when events occur or circumstances change and these events or changes could have a significant effect on these critical assumptions. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods. Therefore, actual results generally affect recognized costs and the recorded obligations for pensions in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Sonys pension obligations and future costs. Sonys principal pension plans are its Japanese pension plans. Foreign pension plans are not significant, individually, to total plan assets and pension obligations. To determine the benefit obligation of the Japanese pension plans, Sony used a discount rate of 2.3 percent for its Japanese pension plans as of March 31, 2007. The discount rate was determined by using currently available information about rates of return on high-quality fixed-income investments available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefit obligation in consideration of amounts and timing of cash outflows for expected benefit payments. Such available information about rates of returns is collected from Bloomberg and credit rating agencies. The 2.3 percent discount rate represents a 10 basis point increase from the 2.2 percent discount rate used for fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 and reflects current market interest rate conditions. For Japanese pension plans, a 10 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease pension costs by approximately 0.8 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2008. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, Sony considers the current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on various categories of plan assets. For Japanese pension plans, the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets was 3.5 percent and 3.7 percent as of March 31, 2006 and 2007 respectively. The actual gain on pension plan assets for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 was 0.8 percent. Actual results that differ from the expected return on plan assets are 78 Table of Contents accumulated and amortized as a component of pension costs over the average future service period, thereby reducing the year-to-year volatility in pension costs. As of March 31, 2006 Sony had unrecognized actuarial losses of 169.9 billion yen and as of March 31, 2007 Sony had a net actuarial loss of 200.6 billion yen, including losses related to plan assets. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, the net actuarial loss increased due to the difference between the actual rate of return on pension plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. The net actuarial loss reflects the overall unfavorable return on investment over the past several years and will result in an increase in pension costs as they are recognized. Sony recorded a minimum pension liability adjustment for the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation for Japanese pension plans of 35.8 billion yen as of March 31, 2006. FAS No. 158 was adopted by Sony in the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2007. As a result, Sony recorded a pension liability adjustment for the prior service cost, net actuarial loss and obligation existing at transition for Japanese pension plans of 73.5 billion yen as of March 31, 2007. Both adjustments were established by a charge to stockholders equity, resulting in no impact to the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding Sonys pension and severance plans. The following table illustrates the effect of changes in the discount rate and the expected return on pension plan assets, while holding all other assumptions constant, for Japanese pension plans as of March 31, 2007. Pre-Tax Pension Equity Change in Assumption PBO Costs (Net of Tax) (Yen in billions) 25 basis point increase/decrease in discount rate −/+24.9 −/+2.0 +/−1.2 25 basis point increase/decrease in expected return on assets  −/+1.3 +/−0.8 Stock-based compensation Sony accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair value based method. The fair value is measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Sony estimates the forfeiture rate based on its historical experience for the stock acquisition rights plans, and recognizes this compensation expense, net of an estimated forfeiture rate, only for the stock acquisition rights expected to vest over the requisite service period. The expense is mainly included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected stock price volatility and the expected life of each award. In addition, judgment is also required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those rights expected to vest. Management believes that these estimates are reasonable; however, if actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. Deferred tax asset valuation Sony records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. In establishing the appropriate valuation allowance for deferred tax assets (including deferred tax assets on tax loss carry-forwards), all available evidence, both positive and negative, is considered. Information on historical results is supplemented by all currently available information on future years, because realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on whether each tax-filing unit generates sufficient taxable income. The estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in Sonys approved forecasts of future operations. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets, less valuation allowance, will be realized. SCEI and SCEA have recorded cumulative losses in recent years primarily due to the sale of the PS3 at a price lower than production cost during the introductory period, the recording of other charges in association with the preparation for the launch of the PS3 platform and a write-down for semiconductor components used in the PS3. However, Sony expects to establish the same successful business model with the PS3 that it achieved with the PS2, 79 Table of Contents which has sold over 100 million units. Taxable income is expected to increase during the tax carryforward period due to the rapid reduction in hardware production costs and an enhanced line-up of software titles in the PS3 business. Accordingly, both companies expect to recover these losses within the next five years. Given sufficiently strong evidence to support the conclusion that a valuation allowance is not necessary, Sony has decided not to record a valuation allowance for SCEI and SCEAs deferred tax assets. Film accounting An aspect of film accounting that requires the exercise of judgment relates to the process of estimating the total revenues to be received throughout a films life cycle. Such estimate of a films ultimate revenue is important for two reasons. First, while a film is being produced and the related costs are being capitalized, it is necessary for management to estimate the ultimate revenue, less additional costs to be incurred, including exploitation costs which are expensed as incurred, in order to determine whether the value of a film has been impaired and thus requires an immediate write off of unrecoverable film costs. Second, the amount of film costs recognized as cost of sales for a given film as it is exhibited in various markets throughout its life cycle is based upon the proportion that current period actual revenues bear to the estimated ultimate total revenues. Management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue for each film on several factors including the historical performance of similar genre films, the star power of the lead actors and actresses, the expected number of theaters at which the film will be released, anticipated performance in the home entertainment, television and other ancillary markets, and agreements for future sales. Management updates such estimates based on the actual results to date of each film. For example, a film that has resulted in lower than expected theatrical revenues in its initial weeks of release would generally have its theatrical, home entertainment and television distribution ultimate revenues adjusted downward; a failure to do so would result in the understatement of amortized film costs for the period. Future insurance policy benefits Liabilities for future insurance policy benefits are established in amounts adequate to meet the estimated future obligations of policies in force. These liabilities are computed by the net level premium method based upon estimates as to future investment yield, mortality, morbidity, withdrawals and other factors. Future policy benefits are computed using interest rates ranging from 0.90 percent to 5.00 percent. Mortality, morbidity and withdrawal assumptions for all policies are based on either the life insurance subsidiarys own experience or various actuarial tables. Generally these assumptions are locked-in upon the issuance of new insurance. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Sonys future insurance policy benefits. RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Inventory Costs - In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of FAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4. This statement requires certain abnormal expenditures to be recognized as expenses in the current period. It also requires that the amount of fixed production overhead allocated to the inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. Sony adopted FAS No. 151 on April 1, 2006. The adoption of FAS No. 151 did not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Effective April 1, 2006, Sony adopted FAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (FAS No. 123(R)). This statement requires the use of the fair value based method of accounting for employee stock-based compensation and eliminates the alternative to use the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principle Board Opinion (APB) No. 25. With limited exceptions, FAS No. 123(R) requires that the grant-date fair value of share-based payments to employees be expensed over the period the service is received. Sony had accounted for its employee stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions prescribed by APB No. 25 and its related interpretations and had disclosed the net effect on net income and net income per share (EPS) 80 Table of Contents allocated to the common stock as if Sony had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FAS No. 123 to stock-based compensation as described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Significant accounting policies  Stock-based compensation. Sony has elected the modified prospective method of transition prescribed in FAS No. 123(R), which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock acquisition rights as the requisite service is rendered beginning with the first period of adoption. As a result of the adoption of FAS No. 123(R), Sonys operating income decreased by 3,670 million yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - In February 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, an amendment of FAS No. 133 and FAS No. 140. This statement permits an entity to elect fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument if the hybrid instrument contains an embedded derivative that would otherwise be required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately under FAS No. 133. The election to measure the hybrid instrument at fair value is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irreversible. The statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired, issued, or subject to a remeasurement event occurring after the beginning of an entitys fiscal year beginning after September 15, 2006, with earlier adoption permitted as of the beginning of the fiscal year, provided that financial statements for any interim period of that fiscal year have not been issued. Sony early adopted FAS No. 155 on April 1, 2006. As a result of the adoption of FAS No. 155, Sonys operating income increased by 3,828 million yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. Additionally, on April 1, 2006, Sony recognized a net charge of 3,785 million yen (net of income taxes of 2,148 million yen) as a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings, which consisted of 1,754 million yen (net of income taxes of 996 million yen) of gross gains and 5,539 million yen (net of income taxes of 3,144 million yen) of gross losses. Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans - In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment to FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). FAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income. FAS No. 158 was adopted by Sony in the financial statements for the year ending March 31, 2007. FAS No. 158 also requires companies to measure the funded status of the plan as of the date of its fiscal year-end, effective for years ending after December 15, 2008. Sony expects to adopt the measurement provisions of FAS No. 158 effective March 31, 2009. Refer to Note 14, Pension and severance plans, for further details. Quantifying Effects of Prior Year Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements - In September 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effect of Prior Year Misstatement when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. SAB No. 108 requires that registrants quantify errors using both a balance sheet approach, generally referred to as the Iron Curtain method, and a statement of operations approach, generally referred to as the Rollover method, and evaluate whether either approach results in a misstated amount that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered, is material. SAB No. 108 became effective for Sony as of April 1, 2006. Prior to the application of SAB No. 108, Sony used a statement of operations approach to quantify errors. The application of SAB No. 108 did not have a material impact on Sonys consolidated financial statements. RECENT PRONOUNCEMENTS Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs in Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts - In September 2005, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AcSEC) issued the Statement of Position (SOP) 05-1, Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs in Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance 81 Table of Contents Contracts. SOP 05-1 provides guidance on accounting for deferred acquisition costs on internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts other than those specifically described in FAS No. 97, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sales of Investments. This statement will be effective for Sony as of April 1, 2007. Although Sony is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new pronouncement, the adoption of SOP 05-1 is not expected to have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets - In March 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets  an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140. This statement amends FAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. This statement will be effective for Sony as of April 1, 2007. Sony is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new pronouncement. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN No. 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. This statement will be effective for Sony as of April 1, 2007. Sony is currently evaluating the potential cumulative impact of FIN No. 48 on the consolidated financial statements, and the final evaluation is expected to result in a charge to beginning retained earnings and an increase in tax liabilities. How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should be Presented in the Income Statement - In June 2006, the EITF issued EITF Issue No. 06-3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should be Presented in the Income Statement. EITF Issue No. 06-3 requires disclosure of the accounting policy for any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is imposed concurrently on a specific revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer. EITF Issue No. 06-3 should be applied to financial reports for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2006. This statement will be effective for Sony as of April 1, 2007. Although Sony is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new pronouncement, the adoption of EITF Issue No. 06-3 is not expected to have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Fair Value Measurements - In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. FAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value, clarifies the definition of fair value, and expands disclosures about the use of fair value measurements. FAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and does not require any new fair value measurements. FAS No. 157 will be effective for Sony beginning April 1, 2008. Sony is currently assessing the potential effect of FAS No. 157 on the financial statements. Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. FAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. Sony is currently evaluating whether to elect the option provided for in this statement. If elected, FAS No. 159 would be effective for Sony as of April 1, 2008. 82 Table of Contents Item 6.

There is no arrangement or understanding with major shareholders, customers, suppliers, or others pursuant to which any person named above was selected as a Director or a Corporate Executive Officer. Compensation The aggregate amount of remuneration, including bonuses paid and benefits in kind granted by Sony during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 to all Directors and Corporate Executive Officers (refer to Board Practices below) of Sony Corporation who served during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, as a group (18 people), totaled 2,600 million yen. Also, as a part of Sonys incentive compensation arrangements, Sony Corporation issued stock acquisition rights during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. The stock acquisition rights, which represent rights to subscribe for shares of common stock of Sony Corporation, have been granted to the Directors, Corporate Executive Officers, Corporate Executives, Group Executives, and selected employees. The stock acquisition rights generally vest ratably up to three years from the date of grant and are generally exercisable up to ten years from the date of grant. The portion of those stock acquisition rights which was granted by Sony during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 to the Directors and Corporate Executive Officers confers rights to purchase a total number of 686,800 shares of Sony Corporations Common Stock. The exercise price for these yen-denominated stock acquisition rights issued as of November 16, 2006 was 4,756 yen per share, and the exercise price for these U.S. dollar-denominated stock acquisition rights issued as of November 16, 2006 was 40.05 U.S. dollars. Regarding the above compensation plans, refer to Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, the retirement allowance scheme was terminated and a new stock-based retirement remuneration (phantom restricted stock plan) was introduced. With the introduction of this plan, there was no amount accrued for lump-sum severance indemnities by Sony during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 for Directors and Corporate Executive Officers of Sony Corporation as of March 31, 2007, as a group (18 people). Under this new plan, points fixed every year by the Compensation Committee shall be granted to Directors and Corporate Executive Officers every year during his/her tenure in office, and at the time of resignation, the remuneration amount shall be calculated by multiplying Sonys common stock price by accumulated points. The resigning Directors and Corporate Executive Officers shall purchase Sonys common stock with this remuneration. The aggregate number of points granted to Directors and Corporate Executive Officers of Sony Corporation as of March 31, 2007, as a group (16 people) totaled 57,000 points. 89 Table of Contents Board Practices Sony has adopted a Company with Committees corporate governance system under the Japanese Company Law (Kaishaho) and related legislation (collectively the Company Law). Under this system, Sony Corporation has three committees: the Nominating Committee, the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. Under the Company Law, each committee is required to consist of not less than three Directors, the majority of whom must be outside Directors. Under the committee system, Directors as such have no power to execute the business of Sony Corporation except for limited circumstances as permitted by law. The Board of Directors must elect Corporate Executive Officers (Shikko-yaku), who are responsible for the execution of the business of Sony Corporation. A summary of the governance system adopted by Sony Corporation is set forth below. The Board of Directors determines fundamental management policy and other important matters related to the management of Sony and oversees the performance of the duties of Directors and Corporate Executive Officers. Under the Company Law, all Directors must be elected at the General Meeting of Shareholders from the candidates determined by the Nominating Committee. Under the Company Law, the term of office of Directors expires at the conclusion of the General Meeting of Shareholders held with respect to the last business year ending within one year after their election. Directors may serve any number of consecutive terms although, under the Charter of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation, outside Directors may not be reelected more than five times without the consent of all Directors. The Nominating Committee, which pursuant to the Charter of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation consists of five or more Directors, determines the content of proposals to be submitted for approval at the General Meeting of Shareholders regarding the appointment and dismissal of Directors. As stated above, under the Company Law, a majority of the members of the Nominating Committee must be outside Directors. In order to qualify as an outside Director under the Company Law, a Director must be a person (i) who is not a director of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries engaged in the business operations of Sony Corporation or such subsidiary, as the case may be, or a corporate executive officer or general manager or other employee of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, and (ii) who has never been a director of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries engaged in the business operations of Sony Corporation or such subsidiary, as the case may be, or a corporate executive officer or general manager or other employee of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries. Under the Charter of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation, at least two members of the Nominating Committee must concurrently be Corporate Executive Officers. The Nominating Committee is comprised of the following members as of June 21, 2007: Yotaro Kobayashi, who is the Chairman of the Nominating Committee and an outside Director; Hirobumi Kawano, Peter Bonfield and Fujio Cho, who are outside Directors; and Howard Stringer and Ryoji Chubachi, who are Corporate Executive Officers. Under the Charter of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation, the Audit Committee must consist of three or more Directors, a majority of whom, as stated above, must be outside Directors. In addition, under the Company Law, a member of the Audit Committee may not concurrently be a director of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries who is engaged in the business operations of Sony Corporation or such subsidiary, as the case may be, or a corporate executive officer of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, or an accounting counselor, general manager or other employee of any of such subsidiaries. Further, under the Charter of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation, members of the Audit Committee must meet the independence and other equivalent requirements of U.S. securities laws and regulations to the extent applicable to Sony Corporation. The Audit Committees primary responsibility is to review the consolidated and non-consolidated financial statements and business reports to be submitted by the Board of Directors at the General Meeting of Shareholders; to monitor the performance of duties by Directors and Corporate Executive Officers (with respect to the preparation process of financial statements, disclosure controls and procedures, internal controls, compliance structure, risk management structure, internal audit structure, internal hotline system and other matters), in each case pursuant to the Company Law; and to propose appointment/dismissal or non-reappointment of, approve the compensation of, and oversee and evaluate the work of Sonys independent auditor. Under the Company Law, the Audit Committee has a statutory duty to prepare and submit each year its audit report to the Corporate Executive Officer designated by the Board of Directors. A member of the Audit Committee may note his or her opinion in the audit report if it is different from the opinion of the Audit Committee that is expressed in the audit report. 90 Table of Contents The Audit Committee discusses with Sony Corporations independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata, the scope and results of audits by the independent auditor including their evaluation of Sony Corporations internal controls, compatibility with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S., and the overall quality of financial reporting. The Audit Committee makes an assessment of the independence of PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata by overseeing their activities through regular communications and discussions with them, and by pre-approving audit and non-audit services to be provided. The Audit Committee is comprised of the following members as of June 21, 2007: Yoshiaki Yamauchi, who is the Chairman of the Audit Committee and an outside Director; and Fueo Sumita and Ryuji Yasuda, who are also outside Directors. Both Yoshiaki Yamauchi and Fueo Sumita are audit committee financial experts within the meaning of Item 16A of this report. As required by the Company Law, the Compensation Committee determines the policy and the contents of compensation, bonus and any other benefits (including equity-related rights or options given for the purpose of stock incentive options) to be received by each Director and Corporate Executive Officer in consideration of the execution of their duties. In addition to such statutory duties, the Compensation Committee sets policy on the composition of individual compensation to be received by other senior management of Sony Group (Directors or other officers of Sony Group companies whose appointment is subject to approval by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Sony Corporation), and also submits proposals to the Board of Directors regarding the issuance of stock acquisition rights for the purpose of granting stock options and other forms of stock price-based compensation utilizing shares etc. of Sony Group, as individual compensation to the aforementioned senior management. Under the Charter of the Board of Directors, the Compensation Committee shall consist of three or more Directors, and as a general rule, at least one member shall concurrently serve as Corporate Executive Officer; provided, however, that a Director who is the CEO or the COO (Chief Operating Officer) of Sony Group or in any equivalent position shall not be a member of the Compensation Committee. As stated above, a majority of the members of the Compensation Committee must be outside Directors. The Compensation Committee is comprised of the following members as of June 21, 2007: Akishige Okada, who is the Chairman of the Compensation Committee and an outside Director; and Yoshihiko Miyauchi and Sakie T. Fukushima,who are also outside Directors. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, the Board of Directors convened 8 times. The Nominating Committee met 5 times, the Audit Committee met 14 times and the Compensation Committee met 6 times. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, no incumbent Director attended less than 75 percent of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and Committees on which he/she served (during the period that he/she served). No Directors have service contracts with Sony providing for benefits upon termination of service as a Director. Under the Company Law and the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation, Sony Corporation may, by a resolution of the Board of Directors, exempt Directors from liabilities to Sony Corporation to the extent permitted by law arising in connection with their failure to execute their duties. Also, in accordance with the Company Law and its Articles of Incorporation, Sony Corporation has entered into a liability limitation agreement with each outside Director that limits the maximum amount of their liabilities owed to Sony Corporation arising in connection with their failure to execute their duties to the greater of either 30 million yen or an amount equal to the aggregate sum of the amounts prescribed in each item of Article 425, Paragraph 1 of the Company Law. The Board of Directors must appoint one or more Corporate Executive Officers who are authorized to determine matters delegated to them by the Board of Directors. The Corporate Executive Officers are responsible for conducting all the business operations of Sony within the scope of authority delegated by the Board of Directors. As of June 21, 2007, there are 7 Corporate Executive Officers, some of whom are also Directors. Significant decision-making authority has been delegated to the CEO and also to each Corporate Executive Officer with respect to investments, strategic alliances and other actions related to the execution of business operations. Sony Corporation believes that this significant delegation enables Sony to be managed in a dynamic and responsive manner. The terms of office of Corporate Executive Officers must expire at the conclusion of the first meeting of the Board of Directors held immediately after the conclusion of the General Meeting of Shareholders held with respect to the last business year ending within one year after their election. From among the Corporate Executive Officers who as a general rule are also Directors, the Board of Directors shall elect Representative Corporate Executive Officers. Each Representative Corporate Executive Officer has the statutory authority to represent Sony Corporation in the conduct of its affairs. 91 Table of Contents (Reference) At a Board meeting held on April 26, 2006, the Board of Directors reaffirmed the existing internal control and governance framework and determined to continue to evaluate and improve such framework going forward, as appropriate. This determination was required by and met the requirements of the Company Law. Details of the determination are posted on the following website: http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/library/control.html For an explanation as to the significant differences between the New York Stock Exchanges corporate governance standards and Sonys corporate governance practices, please visit Sonys website at: http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/NYSEGovernance.html Employees As of March 31, 2007, Sony had approximately 163,000 employees, an increase of approximately 4,500 employees from the end of March 2006. Although there was a reduction in the number of employees associated with the deconsolidation of StylingLife Holdings Inc. (StylingLife) and restructuring at a number of manufacturing facilities, the total number of employees increased as a result of a significant increase at manufacturing facilities in East Asia. As of March 31, 2007, approximately 59,100 employees were located in Japan and approximately 103,900 employees were located outside Japan. Approximately 24 percent of the total employees were members of labor unions. As of March 31, 2006, Sony had approximately 158,500 employees, an increase of approximately 7,000 from March 31, 2005. As of March 31, 2006, approximately 61,600 employees were located in Japan and approximately 96,900 employees were located outside Japan. Approximately 19 percent of employees were members of labor unions. The following table shows the number of employees by segment as of March 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007. Number of Employees by Segment March 31 2005 2006 2007 Electronics 124,500 130,800 136,900 Game 4,300 4,700 5,100 Pictures 5,900 6,900 7,300 Financial Services 6,800 6,500 6,600 All Other 8,000 7,400 4,700 Unallocated  Corporate employees 1,900 2,200 2,400 Total 151,400 158,500 163,000 In addition, the average number of employees for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007 calculated by averaging the total number of employees at the end of each quarter, was 154,200, 156,200 and 162,900, respectively. Sony generally considers its labor relations to be good. Regarding labor relations in the Electronics segment by area, in Asia, where Sony operates many manufacturing facilities, a few manufacturing facilities have labor unions that have union contracts. In the U.S., no manufacturing facilities have labor unions. In Mexico, one manufacturing facility has a labor union that has a union contract, but labor relations are good and there have been no significant problems in renegotiating the contract. In Europe, Sony maintains good labor relations with the Work Councils in each country, and, while some employees belong to unions, they are not eligible for union contracts. In the Pictures segment, Sony also generally considers its labor relations to be good. A number of Pictures subsidiaries are signatories to union contracts. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, negotiations of new three-year agreements for Electronic Digital and Area Standards, and negotiations of new three-year agreements for Local 764, Local 829, Local 798 and Local 873 were successfully concluded with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE); a three-year agreement was negotiated with the Association of Canadian Cinema, 92 Table of Contents Television and Radio Artists (ACTRA) and a two and a half year agreement for made-for-basic cable live action performers was negotiated with the Screen Actors Guild (SAG).

On March 13 and 16, 2007, Sony France S.A., Sony Europe Holding B.V., and Sony Corporation received a Statement of Objections issued by the European Commission competition authorities following inspections carried out in 2002. The Statement of Objections alleges that one or more of these Sony entities entered into agreements and/or engaged in concerted practices with competing manufacturers of professional videotape in violation of Article 81 of the EC Treaty. The Statement of Objections is a procedural step to provide the addressees with an opportunity to be heard, and the European Commission has not adopted a decision finding the Sony entities in breach of Article 81 EC.
