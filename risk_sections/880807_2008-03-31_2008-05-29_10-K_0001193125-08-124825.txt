Item 1A. RISK FACTORS We have a history of operating losses, and we expect to incur losses in the future. We have incurred net losses in each year since our inception, driven primarily by the research and development activities in our AMSC Superconductors business unit. Our net losses were $25.4 million, $34.7 million and $30.9 million for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our accumulated deficit at the end of fiscal 2007 was $410.5 million. We expect to continue to incur operating losses until at least the end of fiscal 2008, and we cannot be certain that we will ever achieve profitability. We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $106.2 million at the end of fiscal 2007. We believe our available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the next several years. However, we may need additional funds if our performance deviates significantly from our current business plan, if there are significant changes in competitive or other market factors, or if unforeseen circumstances arise. Such funds may not be available, or may not be available under terms acceptable to us. A significant portion of our revenues are derived from a single customer. Revenue growth in fiscal 2007 was driven largely by our prior acquisitions, particularly Windtec. Our largest customer is Sinovel in China. For fiscal 2007, Sinovel accounted for approximately 51% of our total revenues. Revenues from Sinovel are supported by purchase orders for electrical system components which generally specify delivery schedules for a 12 month period, as well as development contracts for the design of wind energy systems. If Sinovel cancelled purchase orders or development contracts, or discontinued future purchases from us, we might be unable to replace the related revenues. This would have a serious negative impact on our operating results and financial position. There are a number of technological challenges that must be successfully addressed before our superconductor products can gain widespread commercial acceptance, and our inability to address such technological challenges could adversely affect our ability to acquire customers for our products. Many of our superconductor products are in the early stages of commercialization, while others are still under development. There are a number of technological challenges that we must successfully address to complete our development and commercialization efforts for superconductor products. We also believe that several years of further development in the cable, fault current limiter and motor industries will be necessary before a substantial number of additional commercial applications for our HTS wire in these industries can be developed and proven. We will also need to improve the performance and reduce the cost of our HTS wire to expand the number of commercial applications for it. We may be unable to meet such technological challenges or to sufficiently improve the performance and reduce the costs of our HTS wire. Delays in development, as a result of technological challenges or other factors, may result in the introduction or commercial acceptance of our superconductor products later than anticipated. The commercial uses of superconductor products are limited today, and a widespread commercial market for our products may not develop. To date, there has been no widespread commercial use of HTS products. Even if the technological hurdles currently limiting commercial uses of HTS products are overcome, it is uncertain whether a robust commercial market for those new and unproven products will ever develop. To date, many projects to install HTS cables and products in power grids have been funded or subsidized by the governmental authorities. If this funding is curtailed, grid operators may not continue to utilize HTS cables and products in their projects. It is possible that the market demands we currently anticipate for our HTS products will not develop and that they will never achieve widespread commercial acceptance. 22 Table of Contents We have limited experience manufacturing our Power Systems products in commercial quantities, and failure to manufacture our Power Systems products in commercial quantities at acceptable cost and quality levels would impair our ability to meet customer delivery requirements. To be financially successful, we will have to manufacture our Power Systems products in commercial quantities at acceptable costs while also preserving the necessary performance and quality levels. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in developing product designs and manufacturing processes that permit us to manufacture our Power Systems products in commercial quantities at acceptable costs while preserving the necessary performance and quality. In addition, we may incur significant unforeseen expenses in our product design and manufacturing efforts. We recently commenced production of our primary Power Systems product, the PM1000, at our new manufacturing facility in China. We do not have significant experience managing foreign manufacturing operations, and such operations are subject to complexities that we may not be able to adequately anticipate or manage. Our inability to successfully manufacture our PM1000 product through our China facility may affect our future revenue and profit potential. We have not manufactured our 344 superconductors in commercial quantities, and a failure to manufacture our 344 superconductors in commercial quantities at acceptable cost and quality levels would substantially limit our future revenue and profit potential. We are developing commercial-scale manufacturing processes for our 344 superconductors, which, while very different from our 1G HTS wire manufacturing processes, are also extremely complex and challenging. In November 2007, we started initial production of our 344 superconductors and completed installing the manufacturing line capable of an annual capacity of 720,000 meters. However, in order to be able to offer our wire at pricing that we believe will be commercially competitive, we estimate that we will need to develop the capacity to manufacture nine million meters of our 344 superconductors annually. We believe it will cost between approximately $28 million and $35 million to purchase and install the additional equipment to achieve this commercial-scale manufacturing capability. We may not be able to manufacture satisfactory commercial quantities of 344 superconductors of consistent quality with an acceptable yield and cost. Failure to successfully scale up manufacturing of our 344 superconductors would result in a significant limitation of the broad market acceptance of our HTS products and of our future revenue and profit potential. We have limited experience in marketing and selling our superconductor products and system-level solutions, and our failure to effectively market and sell our products and solutions could adversely affect our revenue and cash flow. To date, we have limited experience marketing and selling our superconductor products and system-level solutions, and there are few people who have significant experience marketing or selling superconductor products and system-level solutions. Once our products and solutions are ready for widespread commercial use, we will have to develop a marketing and sales organization that will effectively demonstrate the advantages of our products over both more traditional products and competing superconductor products or other technologies. We may not be successful in our efforts to market this new technology, and we may not be able to establish an effective sales and distribution organization. We may decide to enter into arrangements with third parties for the marketing or distribution of our products, including arrangements in which our products, such as HTS wire, are included as a component of a larger product, such as a power cable system or a motor. By entering into marketing and sales alliances, the financial benefits to us of commercializing our products are dependent on the efforts of others. 23 Table of Contents Our success in addressing the wind energy system market is dependent on the system manufacturers that license our system designs. Because an important element of our strategy for addressing the wind energy system market involves the license of our system designs to manufacturers of wind energy systems, the financial benefits to us of our products for the wind energy market are dependent on the success of these manufacturers in selling wind energy systems that incorporate our designs. We may not be able to enter into marketing or distribution arrangements with third parties on financially acceptable terms, and third parties may not be successful in selling our products or applications incorporating our products. Growth of the wind energy market depends largely on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives. At present, the cost of wind energy exceeds the cost of conventional power generation in many locations around the world. Various governments have used different policy initiatives to encourage or accelerate the development and adoption of wind energy and other renewable energy sources. Renewable energy policies are in place in the European Union, most notably Germany and Spain, certain countries in Asia, including China, Japan and South Korea, and many of the states in Australia and the United States. Examples of government sponsored financial incentives include capital cost rebates, feed-in tariffs, tax credits, net metering and other incentives to end-users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of wind energy products to promote the use of wind energy and to reduce dependency on other forms of energy. Governments may decide to reduce or eliminate these economic incentives for political, financial or other reasons. Reductions in, or eliminations of, government subsidies and economic incentives before the wind energy industry reaches a sufficient scale to be cost-effective in a non-subsidized marketplace could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business prospects and results of operations. Many of our revenue opportunities are dependent upon subcontractors and other business collaborators. Many of the revenue opportunities for our business involve projects, such as the installation of superconductor cables in power grids and electrical system hardware in wind energy systems, in which we collaborate with other companies, including suppliers of cryogenic systems, manufacturers of electric power cables and manufacturers of wind energy systems. In addition, a key element of our business strategy is the formation of business alliances with motor manufacturers and/or marine propulsion system integrators. As a result, most of our current and planned revenue-generating projects involve business collaborators on whose performance our revenue is dependent. If these business partners fail to deliver their products or perform their obligations on a timely basis or fail to generate sufficient demand for the systems they manufacture, our revenue from the project may be delayed or decreased, and we may not be successful in selling our products. We may not realize all of the sales expected from our backlog of orders and contracts. At March 31, 2008, we had approximately $199.1 million of backlog. There can be no assurances that the revenue we expect to generate from our backlog will be realized in the periods we expect to realize such revenue, or at all. In addition, the backlog of orders, if realized, may not result in profitable revenue. Backlog represents the value of contracts and purchase orders received, less the revenue recognized to date on those contracts and purchase orders. Our customers have the right under some circumstances and with some penalties or consequences to terminate, reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. In addition, our government contracts are subject to the risks described below. If our customers terminate, reduce or defer firm orders, we may be protected from certain costs and losses, but our sales will nevertheless be adversely affected and we may not generate the revenue we expect. Although we strive to maintain ongoing relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that orders may be cancelled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers business needs or purchasing budgets. 24 Table of Contents Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to audit, modification or termination by the U.S. government, and the continued funding of such contracts remains subject to annual congressional appropriation which, if not approved, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. As a company that contracts with the U.S. government, we are subject to financial audits and other reviews by the U.S. government of our costs and performance, accounting and general business practices relating to these contracts. For fiscal 2007, 13% of our total revenues were derived from government contracts. Based on the results of these audits, the U.S. government may adjust our contract-related costs and fees. We cannot be certain that adjustments arising from government audits and reviews would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. All of our U.S. government contracts can be terminated by the U.S. government for its convenience. Termination-for-convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed, and for settlement of expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination. In addition to the right of the U.S. government to terminate its contracts with us, U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by Congress of the necessary spending to honor such contracts. Congress often appropriates funds for a program on a fiscal-year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. Consequently, at the beginning of many major governmental programs, contracts often may not be fully funded, and additional monies are then committed to the contract only if, as and when appropriations are made by Congress for future fiscal years. We cannot be certain that our U.S. government contracts will not be terminated or suspended in the future. The U.S. governments termination of, or failure to fully fund, one or more of our contracts would have a negative impact on our operating results and financial condition. Further, in the event that any of our government contracts are terminated for cause, it could affect our ability to obtain future government contracts which could, in turn, seriously harm our ability to develop our technologies and products. In July 2007, we learned that the United States House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce (the Committee) and its Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations has sent a letter to the United States DHS indicating that it is reviewing the origins of the sole source contract that DHS awarded to American Superconductor and Consolidated Edison for a project to develop electricity grids in New York City that can withstand major disruptions. The Committee also sent a letter to the Department of the Navy in July 2007 seeking information and documents regarding completed contracts between the U.S. Navy and us. The Committee did not state the reason for its review of these matters. On August 2, 2007, we received a letter requesting that we provide certain information to the Committee. We believe we have complied with the Committees request for information. We entered into a final contract with DHS on January 22, 2008. The cumulative value of the contract is $39.1 million, of which up to $24.9 million is expected to be funded by DHS. The balance is being funded by Consolidated Edison and by us. As of March 31, 2008, DHS has provided us with $9.8 million of the expected $24.9 million of funding. In April 2008, DHS provided an additional $0.5 million to bring the total obligated funding up to $10.3 million. We expect the contract to continue to be incrementally funded subject to governmental approvals through September 2010. We are becoming increasingly reliant on contracts that require the issuance of performance bonds. While we have been required to obtain performance bonds in the form of surety bonds or letters of credit in the past, the size of the bonds was not material. Recently, we have entered into contracts which require us to post bonds of significant magnitude. In many instances, we are required to deposit cash in escrow accounts as collateral for these instruments, which is unavailable to us for general use for significant periods of time. At the end of fiscal 2007, $13.2 million of our cash was classified as restricted, the majority of which is used as collateral for performance bonds. Should we be unable to obtain performance bonds in the future, significant 25 Table of Contents future potential contract revenue could become unavailable to us. Further, should our working capital situation deteriorate, we would not be able to access the escrowed cash to meet working capital requirements. Our products face intense competition both from superconductor products developed by others and from traditional, non-superconductor products and alternative technologies, which could limit our ability to acquire or retain customers. The market for superconductor products is intensely competitive. We face competition both from competitors in the superconductor field and from vendors of traditional products and new technologies. There are many companies in the United States, Europe, Japan and China engaged in the development of HTS wire, including EHTS (a division of Bruker Biospin), Evico, Fujikura, Furukawa Electric, Innova Superconductor Technology, Nexans, MetOx, Showa, Sumitomo Electric Industries, SuperPower (a subsidiary of Royal Philips Electronics) and Zenergy. The superconductor industry is characterized by rapidly changing and advancing technology. Our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to keep pace with advancing HTS technology and developing industry standards. Our power electronic products, such as D-VAR, or STATCOMS, SVC, or static VAR compensators, and PQ-SVC products, compete with a variety of other power reliability products such as dynamic voltage restorers, or DVRs, flywheels, battery-based power quality systems and competing power electronic converter systems. The manufacturers of products that compete with our power electronic products and PowerModule products include ABB, Alstom, Mitsubishi Electric, S&C Electric and Siemens. Our AMSC Windtec business faces competition for the supply of wind turbine engineering design services from design engineering firms, such as Garrad Hassan, and from licensors of wind turbine systems, such as Aerodyn, DeWind and REpower. We also face indirect competition in the wind energy market from manufacturers of wind energy systems, such as Gamesa, General Electric, Suzlon and Vestas. The stand-alone FCL products that we are developing in collaboration with Siemens face competition from several competitors developing alternative solutions, including Beijing Superconductor, Hypertech, Hyundai, Innopower, KEPRI, LS Industrial Systems, Nexans, Rolls-Royce, SC Power, SuperPower and Toshiba. The HTS motor and generator products that we are developing face competition from copper wire-based motors and generators, from permanent magnet motors that are being developed, including by DRS Technologies, and from companies developing HTS rotating machinery, including Baldor Electric, Converteam, Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction, General Electric, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co. and Siemens. Research efforts and technological advances made by others in the superconductor field, in the wind energy market or in other areas with applications to the power quality and reliability markets may render our development efforts obsolete. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources, research and development, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we have. In addition, as the HTS wire, HTS electric motors and generators, and power electronic systems markets develop, other large industrial companies may enter those fields and compete with us. If we are unable to compete successfully, it may harm our business, which in turn may limit our ability to acquire or retain customers. Third parties have or may acquire patents that cover the materials, processes and technologies we use or may use in the future to manufacture our HTS products, and our success depends on our ability to license such patents or other proprietary rights. We expect that some or all of the HTS materials, processes and technologies we use in designing and manufacturing our products are or will become covered by patents issued to other parties, including our competitors. The owners of these patents may refuse to grant licenses to us, or may be willing to do so only on terms that we find commercially unreasonable. If we are unable to obtain these licenses, we may have to contest 26 Table of Contents the validity or scope of those patents or re-engineer our products to avoid infringement claims by the owners of these patents. It is possible that we will not be successful in contesting the validity or scope of a patent, or that we will not prevail in a patent infringement claim brought against us. Even if we are successful in such a proceeding, we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in prosecuting or defending such a proceeding. Our patents may not provide meaningful protection for our technology, which could result in us losing some or all of our market position. We own or have licensing rights under many patents and pending patent applications. However, the patents that we own or license may not provide us with meaningful protection of our technologies and may not prevent our competitors from using similar technologies, for a variety of reasons, such as:  the patent applications that we or our licensors file may not result in patents being issued;  any patents issued may be challenged by third parties; and  others may independently develop similar technologies not protected by our patents or design around the patented aspects of any technologies we develop. Moreover, we could incur substantial litigation costs in defending the validity of our own patents. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect our intellectual property. However, our non-disclosure agreements and other safeguards may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and other proprietary information. If the patents that we own or license or our trade secrets and proprietary know-how fail to protect our technologies, our market position may be adversely affected. Our success is dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel, and our inability to do so could significantly damage our business and prospects. Our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified research and development, management, manufacturing, marketing and sales personnel. Hiring those persons may be especially difficult due to the specialized nature of our business. We may acquire additional complementary businesses or technologies, which may require us to incur substantial costs for which we may never realize the anticipated benefits. We may in the future acquire complementary businesses or technologies, although we currently have no commitments or agreements to do so. As a result of any acquisitions we pursue, managements attention and resources may be diverted from our other businesses. An acquisition may also involve significant purchase price and significant transaction-related expenses. Achieving the benefits of any acquisition involves additional risks, including:  difficulty assimilating acquired operations, technologies and personnel;  inability to retain management and other key personnel of the acquired business;  changes in management or other key personnel that may harm relationships with the acquired businesss customers and employees; and  diversion of management attention as a result of the integration process. We cannot ensure that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, and if we fail to realize these anticipated benefits, our operating performance could suffer. 27 Table of Contents Our international operations are subject to risks that we do not face in the U.S., which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. We are expanding our sales and service operations in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, including a new operation in China. We expect our revenue and operations outside the United States will continue to expand in the future. For fiscal 2007, 74% of our consolidated revenues were derived from customers outside of the United States. Our international operations are subject to a variety of risks that we do not face in the U.S., including:  difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign offices and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;  potentially longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;  additional withholding taxes or other taxes on our foreign income, and tariffs or other restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including export duties and quotas, trade and employment restrictions;  imposition of, or unexpected adverse changes in, foreign laws or regulatory requirements;  increased exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk;  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; and  political unrest, war or acts of terrorism. Our overall success in international markets depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions. We may not be successful in developing and implementing policies and strategies that will be effective in managing these risks in each country where we do business or conduct operations. Our failure to manage these risks successfully could harm our international operations and reduce our international sales, thus adversely affecting our business, operating results and financial condition. Our common stock may experience extreme market price and volume fluctuations, which may prevent our stockholders from selling our common stock at a profit and could lead to costly litigation against us that could divert our managements attention. The market price of our common stock has historically experienced significant volatility and may continue to experience such volatility in the future. Factors such as technological achievements by us and our competitors, the establishment of development or strategic relationships with other companies, our introduction of commercial products, and our financial performance may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, the stock market in general, and the stock of high technology companies in particular, have in recent years experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which are often unrelated to the performance or condition of particular companies. Such broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Due to these factors, the price of our common stock may decline and investors may be unable to resell their shares of our common stock for a profit. Following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular companys securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. If we become subject to this kind of litigation in the future, it could result in substantial litigation costs, a damages award against us and the diversion of our managements attention. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable.
