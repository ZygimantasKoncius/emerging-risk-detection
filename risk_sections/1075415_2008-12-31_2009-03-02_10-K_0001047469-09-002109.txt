Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business faces many risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, may also impair our business operations or financial results. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline. Investors and prospective investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading "Warning Concerning Forward Looking Statements" before deciding whether to invest in our securities. 37 Financial and other difficulties at Five Star could adversely affect us. At December 31, 2008, Five Star pays approximately 63% of our current total rents and operates approximately 66% of our assets, at cost. Five Star has not been consistently profitable since it became a public company in 2001. Also, while Five Star has access to two working capital lines of credit from two financial institutions, one a $40.0 million line maturing in May 2010 and another a non-recourse line for up to 60% of the market value of pledged securities ($63.0 million at December 31, 2008), Five Star has limited resources and has substantial lease obligations to us, and others. Five Star's business is subject to a number of risks, including the following: Five Star has high operating leverage. A small percentage decline in Five Star's revenue or increase in Five Star's expenses could have a material negative impact on Five Star's operating results. Five Star's growth strategy, including recent acquisitions, may not succeed and may result in reduced profits or recurring losses. Increases in liability insurance costs have in the past negatively impacted Five Star's operating results and may adversely impact its future results. Increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on Five Star. Extensive regulation applicable to Five Star's business increases Five Star's costs and may result in losses. Medicare and Medicaid payments account for some of Five Star's total revenues. A reduction in these rates or a failure of these rates to match Five Star's cost increases may materially adversely affect Five Star. Current general economic conditions may adversely affect Five Star's operations. For example, tight credit market conditions may make it more expensive for Five Star to access the working capital it requires for its operations. Similarly, the current slowing of the housing market may make it more difficult for potential residents of our properties operated by Five Star to sell their homes, causing these persons to defer relocating to Five Star facilities and reducing Five Star's occupancies, revenues and operating income. If Five Star's operations are unprofitable, Five Star might default on its rent obligations to us. Five Star may not be able to operate the two rehabilitation hospitals we own profitably. We lease two rehabilitation hospitals to Five Star. Although Five Star expects to operate these rehabilitation hospitals profitably, Five Star is currently experiencing losses from these operations and may be unable to operate these hospitals profitably. In addition, these hospitals may be subject to retroactive rate adjustments. A significant amount of the revenues at these rehabilitation hospitals is paid by Medicare and Five Star became more dependent upon revenues from the Medicare program when they began to operate these hospitals. For cost reporting periods beginning on and after July 1, 2006, 60% of a facility's total inpatient population must require intensive rehabilitation services associated with treatment of at least one of 13 designated medical conditions. If the hospitals' operations do not remain in compliance with this 60% rule, these facilities may be subject to Medicare reclassification as a different type of provider and would receive lower Medicare reimbursement rates. Unprofitable operations at these hospitals could jeopardize Five Star's ability to pay rent to us. Sunrise's operation of our properties may adversely affect us. In March 2003, Marriott sold its subsidiary, MSLS, to Sunrise. Sunrise's annual rent to us for the 14 properties it leases is $32.5 million, or 12% of our total annualized current rents; this rent is 38 guaranteed by Marriott. Sunrise has recently reported significant losses and Sunrise may become unable to pay rent due to us. Marriott is no longer in the senior living business and if Marriott assumes these operations pursuant to its guarantee, these operations may deteriorate and the value of our investment in these properties may decline materially. The financial markets are currently in a period of disruption and recession and we do not expect these conditions to improve in the near future. The financial markets are currently experiencing very difficult conditions and volatility. These market conditions have resulted in a decrease in availability of corporate credit and have led to the insolvency, closure or acquisition of a number of financial institutions. A continued recession or a depression in this economy generally can adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of our tenants, which would impact the ability of our tenants to pay rent to us. If the current weakness in the U.S. economy continues for a substantial period, our operating and financial results may be harmed by further declines in occupancy at our senior living facilities, wellness centers and MOBs. The performance of the U.S. healthcare industry has historically been correlated with the performance of the U.S. economy in general. During 2008, the U.S. economy experienced significant weakness due primarily to weakness in the housing market, reduced consumer and business spending and constrained credit markets. As a result, the U.S. healthcare industry generally, and our senior housing properties specifically, experienced declines in occupancy, revenues and profitability in 2008 that are expected to continue into 2009 and potentially beyond 2009. If the current economic recession in the U.S. continues or gets worse, our operating and financial results could decline. The operations at our wellness centers may be particularly adversely impacted by the deteriorating economic conditions as consumers may reduce discretionary spending for wellness activities. We may be unable to access the capital necessary to repay our debts or to grow. To retain our status as a REIT, we are required to distribute 90% of our taxable income to shareholders and we generally cannot retain sufficient income from operations to repay our debts, to invest in our properties or fund our acquisitions. Accordingly, our business and growth strategies depend, in part, upon our ability to raise additional capital at reasonable costs to repay our debts and to fund new investments. We believe we will be able to raise additional debt and equity capital at reasonable costs to refinance our debts at or prior to their maturities, to maintain our properties and to invest at yields that exceed our cost of capital. However, at present there is a significant contraction in financial liquidity globally. In these circumstances, our ability to raise reasonably priced capital is not guaranteed; we may be unable to raise reasonably priced capital because of reasons related to our business or for reasons beyond our control, such as market conditions. Our business and growth strategy is not assured and may fail. Increasing interest rates may adversely affect us and the value of your investment in our shares. There are three principal ways that increasing interest rates may adversely affect us and the value of your investment in our shares: Funds borrowed under our credit facility bear interest at variable rates. If interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which could adversely affect our cash flow, our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt, our cost of refinancing our debt when it becomes due and our abilities to pay distributions to you. 39 An increase in interest rates could decrease the amount buyers may be willing to pay for our properties, thereby reducing the market value of our properties and limiting our ability to sell properties or to obtain mortgage financing secured by our properties. We pay regular distributions on our shares. When interest rates on investments available to investors rise, the trading market prices of distribution paying securities often decline. Accordingly, if interest rates rise, the market price of our shares may decline. The operations of some of our facilities are dependent upon payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Ten percent (10%) of our annual rents come from properties where a majority of the operating revenues are received from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Even at properties where less than a majority of the revenues come from Medicare or Medicaid payments, a reduction in such payments can materially adversely impact profits or result in losses by our tenants. The federal government and most states are now experiencing fiscal deficits and other budget pressures as a result of the recession and worsening economic conditions. Historically when governmental deficits or budget pressures have increased, cutbacks in Medicare and Medicaid funding have followed. These cutbacks sometimes include rate reductions, but more often result in a failure of Medicare and Medicaid rates to increase by sufficient amounts to offset increasing costs. Pursuant to the SCHIP Extension Act, effective April 1, 2008, the Medicare rate increase for rehabilitation hospitals reimbursed as IRFs was set at zero for fiscal year 2008 and 2009. Also, on July 1, 2008, CMS updated the Medicare IRF prospective rate formulas for fiscal year 2009, estimating that the changes will result in a decrease of 0.7% to total Medicare payments to IRFs for fiscal year 2009. If and to the extent Medicare or Medicaid rates are reduced from current levels or if rate increases are less than increases in our tenants' operating costs, it could have a material adverse effect on the ability of some of our tenants, including Five Star, to pay rent to us. Our tenants are faced with significant potential litigation and rising insurance costs that not only affect their ability to obtain and maintain adequate liability and other insurance, but also may affect their ability to pay their lease payments and fulfill their insurance and indemnification obligations to us. In some states, advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at skilled nursing facilities and assisted and independent living facilities, and these groups have brought litigation against operators. Also, in several instances, private litigations by skilled nursing facility patients, assisted and independent living facility residents or their families have succeeded in winning very large damage awards for alleged neglect. The effect of this litigation and potential litigation has been to materially increase the costs of monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance incurred by our tenants. In addition, the cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance has increased and may continue to increase so long as the present litigation environment continues. This has affected the ability of some of our tenants to obtain and maintain adequate liability and other insurance and manage their related risk exposures. In addition to being unable to fulfill their insurance, indemnification and other obligations to us under their leases and thereby potentially exposing us to those risks, these litigation risks and costs could cause some of our tenants to become unable to pay rents due to us. Our properties and their operations are subject to complex regulations. Physical characteristics of senior housing properties, hospitals, clinics and biotech laboratories are mandated by various governmental authorities. Changes in these regulations may require significant expenditures. Our leases generally require our tenants to maintain our properties in compliance with applicable laws and we try to monitor their compliance. However, if our tenants suffer financial distress, maintenance of our properties may be neglected. Under some of our leases, we have agreed to 40 fund capital expenditures in return for rent increases. Our available financial resources or those of our tenants may be insufficient to fund expenditures required to keep our properties operating in accordance with regulations, and if we fund these expenditures, our tenants' financial resources may be insufficient to meet increased rental obligations to us. Licensing, Medicare and Medicaid laws also require our tenants who operate senior living communities, hospitals, clinics and other healthcare facilities to comply with extensive standards governing operations. There are also various laws prohibiting fraud by senior living operators, hospitals and other healthcare facilities, including criminal laws that prohibit false claims for Medicare and Medicaid and that regulate patient referrals. In recent years, the federal and state governments have devoted increasing resources to monitoring the quality of care at senior living communities and to anti-fraud investigations in healthcare. When quality of care deficiencies are identified or improper billing is uncovered, various sanctions may be imposed, including denial of new admissions, exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid program participation, monetary penalties, governmental oversight or loss of licensure. Our tenants receive notices of potential sanctions and remedies from time to time, and such sanctions are imposed from time to time on our facilities which they operate. If our tenants are unable to cure deficiencies which have been identified or which are identified in the future, these sanctions may be imposed, and if imposed, may adversely affect our tenants' ability to pay rents to us and our ability to identify substitute tenants. Acquisitions that we make may not be successful. Our business strategy contemplates acquisitions of additional senior housing properties, MOBs or wellness centers. We cannot assure our investors that acquisitions we make will prove to be successful. We might encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties. Newly acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. We might never realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions. Competition may adversely affect some of our facilities. Recently, a large number of new assisted living properties were developed. In most states these properties are subject to less stringent regulations than nursing homes and can operate with comparatively fewer personnel and at comparatively lower costs. As a result of offering newer accommodations at equal or lower costs, these assisted living properties and other senior living alternatives, including home healthcare, often attract persons who would have previously become nursing home residents. Many of the residents attracted to new assisted living properties were the most profitable nursing home patients, since they paid higher rates than Medicaid or Medicare would pay and they required lesser amounts of care. Historically, nursing homes have been somewhat protected from competition by state requirements of obtaining certificates of need to develop new properties; however, these barriers are being eliminated in many states. Also, there are few regulatory barriers to competition for home healthcare or for independent and assisted living services. These competitive factors have caused some nursing homes which we own to decline in value. This decline may continue as assisted living facilities or other elderly care alternatives such as home healthcare expand their businesses. Similar risks face each of our tenants. These competition risks may prevent our tenants and operators from maintaining or improving occupancy at our properties, which may increase the risk of default under our leases. Increasing investor interest in healthcare related real estate may increase competition and reduce our growth. Our business is highly competitive and we expect that it may become more competitive in the future. We compete with a number of healthcare REITs, private equity funds and other financing sources, some of which are larger and have a lower cost of capital than we do. In the past, periods of 41 economic recession in the economy generally have caused investors to focus on healthcare and healthcare real estate investments because some investors believe these types of investments may be less affected by general economic circumstances than most other investments. These developments could result in increased competition for investments, fewer investment opportunities available to us and lower spreads over our cost of our capital, all of which would limit our ability to grow our business. We are dependent upon RMR to manage our business and implement our growth strategy. Our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on RMR and its ability to manage our properties, source and complete new acquisitions for us on favorable terms and to execute our financing strategy on favorable terms. Because we are externally managed, our business is dependent upon RMR's business contacts, its ability to successfully hire, train, supervise and manage its personnel and its ability to maintain its operating systems. If we lose the services provided by RMR or its key personnel, our business and growth prospects may decline. We may be unable to duplicate the quality and depth of management available to us by becoming a self managed company or by hiring another manager. Also, in the event RMR is unwilling or unable to continue to provide management services to us, our cost of obtaining substitute services may be greater than the management fees we pay RMR, and as a result our earnings and cash flows may decline. Our business dealings with our managing trustees and related persons may create conflicts of interest. We have no employees. Personnel and services which we require are provided to us under contract by RMR. RMR is authorized to follow broad operating and investment guidelines and, therefore, has great latitude in determining the types of properties that are proper investments for us, as well as the individual investment decisions. Our board of trustees periodically reviews our operating and investment guidelines and our properties but it does not review or approve each decision made by RMR on our behalf. In addition, in conducting periodic reviews, our board of trustees relies primarily on information provided to it by RMR. RMR is beneficially owned by our managing trustees, Barry Portnoy and Adam Portnoy. Barry Portnoy is Chairman and Adam Portnoy is President, Chief Executive Officer and a director of RMR. Our President, David Hegarty, is an Executive Vice President and a director of RMR and our Treasurer, Richard Doyle, is a Senior Vice President of RMR. All of the members of our board of trustees, including our Independent Trustees, are members of one or more boards of trustees or directors of various companies to which RMR provides management services. The foregoing individuals may hold equity in or positions with other companies to which RMR provides management services. Such equity ownership and positions by our trustees and officers could create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving us, RMR and its affiliates. We cannot assure you that the provisions in our declaration of trust or bylaws will adequately address potential conflicts of interest or that such actual or potential conflicts of interest will be resolved in our favor. We pay RMR fees based in part upon the historical cost of our investments, the gross rents we collect from tenants in our MOB portfolio and the costs of construction we incur at our MOB properties which is supervised by RMR, plus an incentive fee based upon certain increases in our funds from operations per share (as defined in our business management agreement). Our fee arrangements with RMR could encourage RMR to advocate acquisitions of properties and discourage sales of properties by us or to undertake unnecessary construction activities. RMR also acts as the manager for two other publicly traded REITs: HRPT, which primarily owns and operates office and industrial buildings and leased industrial land; and Hospitality Properties Trust, or HPT, which owns hotels and travel centers. RMR also provides management services to other public and private companies, including: Five Star, our largest tenant; and TravelCenters of America LLC, or TravelCenters, which operates and franchises travel centers. These multiple responsibilities to public companies and other businesses could create competition for the time and efforts of RMR and Messrs. Barry Portnoy and 42 Adam Portnoy. Also, RMR's multiple responsibilities to us and Five Star could create actual and potential conflicts of interest, and these conflicts can be especially severe in periods of financial stress such as the present. A termination of our business management agreement with RMR is a default under our credit facility unless approved by a majority of our lenders. The quality and depth of management available to us by contracting with RMR may not be able to be duplicated by our being a self managed company or by our contracting with unrelated third parties, without considerable cost increases. For these reasons, our management agreements with RMR may discourage a change of control of us, including a change of control which might result in payment of a premium for your securities. Our contracts with RMR and Five Star have all been approved by our Independent Trustees. In the past, in particular following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company's securities, shareholder litigation, dissident trustee nominations and dissident proposals have often been instituted against companies alleging conflicts of interest in business dealings with trustees, related persons and entities. Our relationship with RMR, with Messrs. Barry Portnoy and Adam Portnoy and with RMR affiliates may precipitate such activities. These activities, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources. Our business dealings with Five Star may create conflicts of interest. Five Star was originally organized as our subsidiary. We distributed substantially all our Five Star ownership to our shareholders on December 31, 2001. One of our managing trustees, Mr. Barry Portnoy, serves as a managing director of Five Star. RMR provides management services to both us and Five Star. As of December 31, 2008, our leases with Five Star accounted for 63% of our current annualized rents. In the future, we expect to do additional business with Five Star. We believe that our current leases and other business dealings with Five Star were entered on commercially reasonable terms and that our historical, continuing and increasing business dealings with Five Star has been beneficial to both us and Five Star. However, because of the historical and continuing relationships which we have with Five Star, these historical, continuing and expanding business dealings may not be on the same or as favorable terms as we might achieve with a third party with whom we do not have such relationships. Our transactions with Five Star have been approved by our Independent Trustees. Ownership limitations and anti-takeover provisions in our declaration of trust, bylaws and rights agreement, as well as certain provisions of Maryland law, may prevent shareholders from implementing beneficial changes or prevent our shareholders from receiving a takeover premium for their shares. Our declaration of trust prohibits any shareholder, other than HRPT, RMR and their affiliates, from owning more than 9.8% of our outstanding shares or common shares. This provision of the declaration of trust may assist with our REIT compliance under the IRC and otherwise promote our orderly governance. However, this provision will also inhibit acquisitions of a significant stake in us and may prevent a change in our control. Additionally, many provisions contained in our declaration of trust and bylaws and under Maryland law may further deter persons from attempting to acquire control of us and implement changes that may be beneficial to shareholders, including, for example, provisions relating to: the division of our trustees into three classes, with the term of one class expiring each year, which could delay a change in our control; required qualifications for an individual to serve as a trustee and a requirement that certain of our trustees be "Managing Trustees" and other trustees be "Independent Trustees"; 43 limitations on the ability of shareholders to propose nominees for election as trustees and propose other business before a meeting of shareholders; the two-thirds shareholder vote required for removal of trustees; the authority of our board of trustees, and not our shareholders, to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws; the fact that only the board of trustees may call shareholder meetings and that shareholders are not entitled to act without a meeting; and the authority of our board of trustees to adopt certain amendments or supplements to our declaration of trust without shareholder approval, including the authority to increase or decrease the number of our shares, to create new classes or series of shares (including a class or series of shares that could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in our control that might involve a premium for our shares or otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders), to increase or decrease the number of shares of any class, and to classify or reclassify any unissued shares from time to time by setting or changing the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to distributions, qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption of our shares or any new class or series of shares created by our board of trustees. We maintain a rights agreement whereby, in the event a person or group of persons acquires 10% or more of our outstanding common shares, our shareholders, other than such person or group, will be entitled to purchase additional shares or other securities or property at a discount. In addition, certain provisions of Maryland law may have an anti-takeover effect. For all of these reasons, our shareholders may be unable to realize a change of control premium for shares they own. Our rights and the rights of our shareholders to take action against our trustees and officers are limited. Our declaration of trust limits the liability of our trustees and officers to us and our shareholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland law. Under current Maryland law, our trustees and officers will not have any liability to us and our shareholders for money damages other than liability resulting from: actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or active and deliberate dishonesty by the trustee or officer that was established by a final judgment as being material to the cause of action adjudicated. Our declaration of trust requires us to indemnify each trustee or officer, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, from and against any claim or liability to which such person may become subject or which such person may incur by reason of his or her status as our present or former trustee or officer. We have similar obligations under individual indemnification agreements with each of our trustees and executive officers. In addition, we may be obligated to pay or reimburse the expenses incurred by our present and former trustees and officers without requiring a preliminary determination of their ultimate entitlement to indemnification. As a result, we and our shareholders may have more limited rights against our present and former trustees and officers than might otherwise exist absent the current provisions in our declaration of trust or that might exist with other companies, which could limit your recourse in the event of actions not in your best interest. We may change our operational and investment policies without shareholder approval. Our board of trustees determines our operational and investment policies and may amend or revise our policies, including our policies with respect to our intention to qualify for taxation as a REIT, acquisitions, dispositions, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and distributions, or approve 44 transactions that deviate from these policies, without a vote of, or notice to, our shareholders. Policy changes could adversely affect the market value of our shares and our ability to make distributions to you. The loss of our tax status as a REIT or tax authority challenges would have significant adverse consequences to us and reduce the market price of our securities. As a REIT, we generally do not pay federal and state income taxes. However, our continued qualification as a REIT is dependent upon our compliance with complex provisions of the IRC, for which there are available only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. We believe we have operated and are operating as a REIT in compliance with the IRC. However, we cannot assure that, upon review or audit, the IRS will agree with this conclusion. If we cease to be a REIT, we would violate a covenant in our revolving credit facility, our ability to raise capital could be adversely affected, we may be subject to material amounts of federal and state income taxes and the value of our securities would likely decline. Real estate ownership creates risks and liabilities. Our business is subject to risks associated with real estate acquisitions and ownership, including: property and casualty losses, some of which may be uninsured; defaults and bankruptcies by our tenants; the illiquid nature of real estate markets which impairs our ability to purchase or sell our assets rapidly to respond to changing economic conditions; leases which are not renewed at expiration or for property which is relet at lower rents; costs that may be incurred relating to maintenance and repair, and the need to make expenditures due to changes in governmental regulations, including the Americans with Disabilities Act; and environmental hazards at our properties for which we may be liable, including those created by prior owners or occupants, existing tenants, adjacent land or other parties. There is no assurance that we will make distributions in the future. We intend to continue to pay quarterly distributions to our shareholders consistent with our historical practice. However, our ability to pay distributions will be adversely affected if any of the risks described herein occur. Our payment of distributions is subject to compliance with restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and our note indenture. All distributions are made at the discretion of our board of trustees and our future distributions will depend upon our earnings, cash available for distribution, our financial condition, maintenance of our REIT tax status and such other factors as our board of trustees may deem relevant from time to time. In the future, our distribution rate may decline or we may cease making distributions. Also, our distributions in the past have included, and may in the future include, a return of capital. We have substantial debt obligations and may incur additional debt. At February 27, 2009, we have $663.5 million in debt outstanding, which was approximately 27.7% of our total book capitalization. Our note indenture and revolving credit facility permit us and our subsidiaries to incur additional debt, including secured debt. If we default in paying any of our debts or honoring our debt covenants, it may create one or more cross-defaults; these debts may be accelerated and we could be forced to liquidate our assets for less than the values we would receive in a more orderly process. 45 Any notes we may issue will be effectively subordinated to the debts of our subsidiaries and to our secured debt. We conduct substantially all of our business through, and all of our properties are owned by, subsidiaries. Consequently, our ability to pay debt service on our outstanding notes and any notes we issue in the future will be dependent upon the cash flow of our subsidiaries and payments by those subsidiaries to us as dividends or otherwise. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and may have their own liabilities. Payments due on our outstanding notes, and any notes we may issue, are, or will be, effectively subordinated to liabilities of our subsidiaries, including guarantee liabilities. Substantially all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our revolving credit facility; none of our subsidiaries guarantee our outstanding notes. At February 27, 2009, our subsidiaries have approximately $151.0 million of secured debt. In addition, our outstanding notes and any notes we may issue are, or will be, effectively subordinated to our secured debt. We may be required to prepay our debts upon a change of control. In certain change of control circumstances, our current and future noteholders and some of our other lenders may have the right to require us to purchase our notes which they own at their principal amount plus accrued interest and a premium. Our notes may be redeemed before maturity, and our noteholders may be unable to reinvest proceeds at the same or a higher rate. We may redeem all or a portion of our outstanding notes or notes we may issue in the future after a certain amount of time. Generally, the redemption price will equal the principal amount being redeemed, plus accrued interest to the redemption date, plus a premium. If a redemption occurs, our noteholders may be unable to reinvest the money they receive in the redemption at a rate that is equal to or higher than the rate of return on the redeemed notes. There may be no public market for notes we may issue and one may not develop. Generally, any notes we may issue will be a new issue for which no trading market currently exists. We do not intend to list our notes on any securities exchange or to seek approval for quotation through any automated quotation system. We can provide no assurance that an active trading market for any of our notes will exist in the future. Even if a market does develop, the liquidity of the trading market for any of our notes and the market price quoted for any such notes may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for fixed income securities, by changes in our financial performance or prospects, or by changes in the prospects for REITs or for the senior living industry generally.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings None. Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders None. 47 PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Our common shares are traded on the NYSE (symbol: SNH). The following table sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low sale prices for our common shares as reported by the NYSE. High Low 2007 First Quarter $ 26.83 $ 21.75 Second Quarter 24.83 20.10 Third Quarter 22.85 16.22 Fourth Quarter 24.66 19.20 2008 First Quarter $ 25.21 $ 18.01 Second Quarter 25.08 19.21 Third Quarter 24.98 18.82 Fourth Quarter 23.66 9.82 The closing price of our common shares on the NYSE on February 27, 2009 was $12.62. As of February 27, 2009, there were approximately 2,600 shareholders of record, and we estimate that as of such date there were in excess of 60,300 beneficial owners of our common shares. Information about distributions declared to common shareholders is summarized in the table below. Common share distributions to our shareholders are generally paid in the quarter following the quarter to which they relate. Distributions Per Common Share 2008 2007 First Quarter $ 0.35 $ 0.34 Second Quarter 0.35 0.34 Third Quarter 0.35 0.35 Fourth Quarter 0.35 0.35 All common share distributions shown in the table above have been paid. We currently intend to continue to declare and pay common share distributions on a quarterly basis. However, distributions are made at the discretion of our board of trustees and depend on our earnings, funds from operations, cash available for distribution, financial condition, capital market conditions, growth prospects and other factors which our board of trustees deems relevant. We issued unregistered shares during the fourth quarter on December 11, 2008, pursuant to our incentive share award plans, to certain employees of our manager, RMR, totaling 11,900 common shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share, valued at $11.53 per share, the closing price of our common shares on the NYSE on that day. All of these grants were made pursuant to an exemption from registration contained in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 48 Item 6.

Beginning in 2003 until November 2006, we were involved in litigation with HealthSouth seeking to increase the rent due under a lease of two hospitals to HealthSouth and to terminate the lease and repossess the hospitals. On November 8, 2006, we and HealthSouth agreed to settle our litigation, to recognize HealthSouth's lease until September 30, 2006 and to increase the annual rent due under the lease from $8.7 million to $9.9 million for the period from January 2, 2002 to September 30, 2006. As a result of the settlement, HealthSouth paid us additional rent of $5.7 million, or $0.08 per share, for periods through September 30, 2006, which we recognized as rental income in the fourth quarter of 2006. On October 1, 2006, Five Star assumed the operations of these two hospitals and began leasing them from us for an annual rent of $10.25 million. (2)Includes an impairment of assets charge of $8.4 million ($0.08 per share) in 2008. Includes an impairment of assets charge of $1.4 million ($0.02 per share) and loss on early extinguishment of debt of $2.0 million ($0.02 per share) in 2007. Includes an impairment of assets charge of $1.4 million ($0.02 per share) and loss on early extinguishment of debt of $6.5 million ($0.09 per share) in 2006. Includes an impairment of assets charge of $1.8 million ($0.03 per share) in 2005. (3)Includes a gain on sale of properties of $266,000 (less than $0.01 per share), $5.9 million ($0.09 per share) and $1.2 million ($0.01 per share) in 2008, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (4)On January 7, 2009, we declared a distribution of $0.35 per share, or $40.1 million, to be paid to common shareholders of record on January 22, 2009, with respect to our results for the quarter ended December 31, 2008. This distribution was paid on February 13, 2009. 49 Item 7.

(3)In August 2008, we acquired four wellness centers that are leased to a subsidiary of Life Time Fitness. These wellness centers have 458,000 square feet of floor space. In October and November 2007, we acquired six wellness centers that are leased to subsidiaries of Starmark. These wellness centers have 354,000 square feet of floor space. (4)From June 2008 through December 2008, we acquired a total of 38 MOBs. These MOBs have a total of approximately 1.6 million square feet. (5)In June 2008, we realigned three of our leases with Five Star. The rent payable by Five Star to us was unchanged as a result of this lease realignment. The increased rent payable, if and as we purchase improvements to the leased properties, will be the greater of 8.0% per annum or the 10 year Treasury rate plus 300 basis points but not to exceed 11.5%. (6)In July 2008, we sold three assisted living properties with 259 living units that were formerly operated by NewSeasons to Five Star for $21.4 million. Five Star also assumed the NewSeasons and IBC lease obligations to us for the remaining seven properties that were formerly operated by NewSeasons. The data provided above represents the seven properties we continue to own. (7)Marriott guarantees the lease for the 14 properties leased to Sunrise. (8)All tenant operating data presented are based upon the operating results provided by our tenants for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, or the most recent prior period for which tenant operating results are available to us from our tenants. Rent coverage is calculated as operating cash flow from our tenants' operations of our properties, before subordinated charges, divided by rent payable to us. We have not independently verified our tenants' operating data. (9)Excludes data for periods prior to our ownership of some of these properties. 51 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Year Ended December 31, 2008, Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Change % Change (in thousands, except per share amounts) Rental income $ 233,210 $ 185,952 $ 47,258 25.4% Interest and other income 2,327 2,070 257 12.4% Property operating expenses 2,792  2,792 100.0% Interest expense 40,154 37,755 2,399 6.4% Depreciation expense 60,831 47,384 13,447 28.4% General and administrative expense 17,136 14,154 2,982 21.1% Loss on early extinguishment of debt  2,026 (2,026 ) (100.0)% Impairment of assets 8,379 1,400 6,979 498.5% Income before gain on sale of properties 106,245 85,303 20,942 24.6% Gain on sale of properties 266  266 100.0% Net income $ 106,511 $ 85,303 $ 21,208 24.9% Weighted average shares outstanding 105,153 83,168 21,985 26.4% Per share amounts: Income before gain on sale of properties $ 1.01 $ 1.03 $ (0.02 ) (1.9)% Gain on sale of properties     Net income $ 1.01 $ 1.03 $ (0.02 ) (1.9)% Rental income increased in 2008 because of rents from our real estate acquisitions during 2008, including $12.3 million of rental income due to our acquisition of 38 MOBs from June 2008 through December 2008, and the full year impact of rents from our acquisitions in 2007. These increases were offset by rent reductions resulting from the sale of three properties during the third quarter of 2008. Interest and other income increased as a result of higher levels of investable cash in money market funds. Property operating expenses is the result of our acquisition of 38 MOBs from June 2008 through December 2008 and mainly includes expenses related to real estate taxes, utilities, management fees paid to RMR and cleaning costs. Interest expense increased because of greater amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility, offset by lower interest rates under our revolving credit facility. This increase was also due to $61.3 million of debt assumed as part of our third quarter 2008 acquisitions and $14.9 million of debt assumed as part of our fourth quarter 2007 wellness centers acquisition, offset by our prepayment of a mortgage of $12.6 million on April 1, 2008. Our weighted average balance outstanding and interest rate under our revolving facility was $70.2 million and 4.7% and $20.4 million and 5.7% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Depreciation expense increased because of real estate acquisitions since January 1, 2007, including $3.3 million of depreciation expense due to our acquisition of 38 MOBs from June 2008 through December 2008. These increases were offset by depreciation eliminated by the sale of three properties during the third quarter of 2008. General and administrative expenses increased in 2008 due principally to our acquisitions since January 1, 2007, and higher stock grants, accounting fees and legal fees, offset by a decrease in state taxes. 52 We recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $2.0 million in connection with our redemption of a portion of our 85/8% senior notes in January 2007. Also, during 2008 and 2007, we recognized an impairment of assets charge of $8.4 million related to four properties, including two properties that we have classified as held for sale, and $1.4 million related to one property that we have classified as held for sale, respectively. In July 2008, we sold three assisted living facilities for net proceeds of $21.4 million. Our carrying value of these properties at the time of sale was $21.1 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $266,000. Income before gain on sale of properties and net income increased because of the changes in revenues and expenses described above. Income before gain on sale of properties per share and net income per share increased because of the changes in revenues and expenses described above offset by the effect of an increase in the weighted average number of shares outstanding resulting from our issuance of common shares in February and December 2007 and in February and June 2008. Year Ended December 31, 2007, Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Change % Change (in thousands, except per share amounts) Rental income $ 185,952 $ 178,372 $ 7,580 4.2% Interest and other income 2,070 1,434 636 44.4% Interest expense 37,755 47,020 (9,265 ) (19.7)% Depreciation expense 47,384 44,073 3,311 7.5% General and administrative expense 14,154 14,645 (491 ) (3.4)% Loss on early extinguishment of debt 2,026 6,526 (4,500 ) (69.0)% Impairment of assets 1,400 1,420 (20 ) (1.4)% Income before loss on sale of properties 85,303 66,122 19,181 29.0% Loss on sale of properties  (21 ) (21 ) (100.0)% Net income $ 85,303 $ 66,101 $ 19,202 29.0% Weighted average shares outstanding 83,168 72,529 10,639 14.7% Per share amounts: Income before loss on sale of properties $ 1.03 $ 0.91 $ 0.12 13.2% Loss on sale of properties    % Net income $ 1.03 $ 0.91 $ 0.12 13.2% Rental income increased in 2007 because of rents from our real estate acquisitions during 2007 and the full year impact of rents from our acquisitions in 2006. These increases were offset by rent reductions resulting from the sale of three properties during the fourth quarter of 2006. Rental income in 2006 also includes $5.7 million of additional rent received from HealthSouth as part of the settlement of our litigation with HealthSouth. Interest and other income increased as a result of higher levels of investable cash and increased yields on our cash and marketable securities. Interest expense decreased because of lower interest rates and lesser amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Our weighted average balance outstanding and interest rate under our revolving facility was $20.4 million and 5.7% and $135.9 million and 6.2% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We assumed $14.9 and $12.8 million of mortgage debt at 6.91% and 7.15% in connection with acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in interest expense is also due to a decrease in interest on our senior notes and junior subordinated debentures as a result of our purchase and retirement of $20.0 million of our 53 senior notes in January 2007 and repayment of $52.5 million of our senior notes in January 2006 and all $28.2 million of our junior subordinated debentures in June 2006. Depreciation expense increased because of 2007 real estate acquisitions totaling $125.4 million and the full year impact of 2006 real estate acquisitions totaling $133.1 million. These increases were offset by depreciation eliminated by the sale of three properties during the fourth quarter of 2006. General and administrative expense includes $1.7 million of HealthSouth litigation costs for the year ended December 31, 2006. General and administrative expense, exclusive of litigation costs in 2006, increased in 2007 by $1.2 million, or 9.3%, as a result of property acquisitions and incentive fees payable to RMR. We recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $2.0 million in connection with our redemption of a portion of our 85/8% senior notes in January 2007 and $6.5 million in connection with our redemption of a portion of our 77/8% unsecured senior notes in January 2006 and our redemption of all $28.2 million of our 10.125% junior subordinated debentures in June 2006. Also, during 2007 and 2006, we recognized an impairment of assets charge of $1.4 million in both periods related to one property that we have classified as held for sale and three properties that were sold during 2006, respectively. Income before loss on sale of properties and income before loss on sale of properties per share increased because of the changes in revenues and expenses described above. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a loss of $21,000 related to three properties sold during 2006. Net income increased because of the changes that affected income before loss on sale of properties. Net income per share increased because of the changes in revenues and expenses described above, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of shares outstanding that resulted from our issuance of common shares in February and December 2007 and November 2006. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal source of funds to meet operating expenses and pay planned distributions on our shares is rental income from our properties. This flow of funds has historically been sufficient to pay operating expenses and debt service relating to our properties. We believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses, debt service and planned distributions on our shares for the foreseeable future. Our future cash flows from operating activities will depend primarily upon our ability to: maintain the occupancy of and the current rent rates at our properties; control operating cost increases at our properties; and purchase additional properties which produce positive cash flows from operations. Our Operating Liquidity and Resources Rents from our properties are our principal sources of funds for current expenses, debt service and distributions to shareholders. We generally receive minimum rents monthly or quarterly from our tenants and we receive percentage rents monthly, quarterly or annually. This flow of funds has historically been sufficient for us to pay our operating expenses, debt service and distributions to shareholders. During 2008, we generated $184.5 million of cash from operations and at December 31, 2008, we had $6.0 million of cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses, debt service and expected distribution payments for the foreseeable future. 54 Our Investment and Financing Liquidity and Resources In order to fund acquisitions and to accommodate cash needs that may result from timing differences between our receipts of rents and our need or desire to pay operating expenses and distributions to our shareholders, we maintain a revolving credit facility with a group of institutional lenders. The facility matures in December 2010, with an extension option to December 2011 upon payment of an extension fee. The revolving credit facility permits us to borrow up to $550.0 million. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility are unsecured. We may borrow, repay and reborrow funds until maturity. No principal repayment is due until maturity. We pay interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility at LIBOR plus a premium. At December 31, 2008, the weighted average interest rate payable on our revolving credit facility was 2.2%. As of December 31, 2008, we had $257.0 million outstanding under this credit facility and as of February 27, 2009, we had $190.0 million outstanding under this credit facility. In February 2008, we issued 6.2 million common shares in a public offering, raising net proceeds of $129.4 million. In June 2008, we issued 19.6 million common shares in a public offering, raising net proceeds of $393.5 million. In February 2009, we issued 5.9 million common shares in a public offering, raising net proceeds of approximately $96.8 million. We used the net proceeds from these offerings, to repay borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility, to fund the acquisitions described below and for general business purposes. During the three months ended March 31, 2008, we purchased 19 senior living properties with a total of 1,692 living units for approximately $272.3 million from five unaffiliated parties. We leased these properties to Five Star for initial rent of $21.8 million and added them to what we now refer to as Five Star lease no. 1 and lease no. 3, which have current terms expiring in 2022 and 2024, respectively. Percentage rent, based on increases in gross revenues at these properties, will commence in 2010. We funded these acquisitions using cash on hand, proceeds from equity issuances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In April 2008, we paid in full a mortgage loan on one of our properties for $12.6 million. We used cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund this payment. In May 2008, we entered into a series of agreements to acquire 48 MOBs from HRPT for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $565.0 million. As of December 31, 2008, these 48 buildings that we agreed to acquire were 98% leased to approximately 220 tenants for an average lease term of 8.2 years. Between June and December 31, 2008, we acquired 37 of these properties containing 1.5 million square feet for approximately $346.8 million, excluding closing costs. In January 2009 we acquired one additional property for approximately $19.3 million, excluding closing costs, and we expect the closings of the remaining 10 acquisitions to occur in 2010. We and HRPT may mutually agree to accelerate the closings of these acquisitions. In addition, because a third party consent was not received, one of the agreements was amended so that one of the remaining buildings with an allocated value of $3.0 million is no longer subject to being purchased; in the event HRPT obtains the third party consent we may nonetheless purchase that building. We funded these acquisitions using cash on hand, proceeds from equity issuances, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and by assuming three mortgage loans on two properties totaling $10.8 million with a weighted average interest rate of 7.1% per annum and a weighted average maturity in 2018. Our obligations to complete our outstanding purchases from HRPT are subject to various conditions typical of commercial real estate purchases. We can provide no assurance that we will purchase all of these buildings or that the remaining purchases will be completed in 2010 or sooner. In addition, we also acquired rights of first refusal to purchase any of 45 additional buildings (containing approximately 4.6 million square feet of rental space) that are leased to tenants in medical related businesses which HRPT will continue to own after these transactions. HRPT was formerly our parent company, and both we and HRPT are managed by RMR. Because we and HRPT are both managed by RMR, the terms of these transactions were negotiated by 55 special committees of our and HRPT's boards of trustees composed solely of independent trustees who were not also independent trustees of both companies. In June 2008, we realigned three of our leases with Five Star. Lease no. 1 now includes 100 properties, including nine properties acquired during the first quarter of 2008. This lease includes independent living communities, assisted living communities and skilled nursing facilities, and expires in 2022. Lease no. 2 now includes 32 properties, including independent living communities, assisted living communities, skilled nursing facilities and two rehabilitation hospitals, and expires in 2026. Lease no. 3 now includes 44 properties, including 10 properties acquired during the first quarter of 2008, 10 properties acquired during the third quarter of 2008 and one property acquired on November 1, 2008 described below. This lease includes independent living communities, assisted living communities and skilled nursing facilities and expires in 2024. The total rent payable by Five Star to us for these properties was unchanged as a result of this lease realignment. The increased rent payable for these three leases with Five Star, if and as we purchase improvements to the leased properties, is the greater of 8.0% per annum or the 10 year Treasury rate plus 300 basis points, but may not exceed 11.5%. Five Star was formerly our subsidiary. In addition to being our manager, RMR also provides management services to Five Star. Because of these and other relationships between us and Five Star, all transactions between us and Five Star are approved by our Independent Trustees and Five Star's independent directors. In July 2008, we sold three assisted living properties with 259 living units, which were formerly operated by NewSeasons, to Five Star for $21.4 million. Five Star also assumed the NewSeasons and IBC lease obligations to us for the remaining seven properties that were formerly operated by NewSeasons. The rent payable by Five Star for these seven properties is approximately $7.6 million per annum under lease no. 4 between us and Five Star. In August 2008, we acquired, from an unaffiliated party, two senior living properties with a total of 112 units for approximately $14.1 million, excluding closing costs. We leased the properties to Five Star until 2024 under our Five Star lease no. 3 described above and increased rent under that lease by $1.1 million. Percentage rent, based on increases in gross revenues at these properties, will commence in 2010. We funded this acquisition using cash on hand. In August 2008, we acquired four wellness centers for approximately $100.0 million, excluding closing costs, from Life Time Fitness. We leased these wellness centers to a subsidiary of Life Time Fitness for initial rent of $9.1 million, plus rent increases of 10% every five years. This lease has a current term expiring in 2028, plus renewal options. We funded this acquisition using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In September 2008, we acquired, from an unaffiliated party, eight senior living properties with a total of 451 units for approximately $62.1 million, excluding closing costs. We leased these properties to Five Star until 2024 under our Five Star lease no. 3 described above and increased rent under that lease by $5.0 million. Percentage rent, based on increases in gross revenues at these properties, will commence in 2010. We funded this acquisition using cash on hand, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and by assuming 15 mortgages on these eight properties totaling $50.5 million with a weighted average interest rate of 6.54% per annum and a weighted average maturity in 2017. In September 2008, we acquired, from an unaffiliated party, one medical office building for approximately $18.6 million, excluding closing costs. This building is currently 100% leased to 12 tenants for an average lease term of 6.3 years. We funded this acquisition using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In September 2008, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell one of our properties, classified as held for sale, to an unaffiliated party for approximately $1.2 million. The sale of this 56 property is subject to customary contingencies. We can provide no assurance that we will sell this property. In November 2008, we acquired, from an unaffiliated party, a senior living property with a total of 252 units for approximately $29.0 million. We leased this property to Five Star and added it to our Five Star lease no. 3, which has a term expiring in 2024, and increased the annual rent under this lease by $2.3 million. Percentage rent, based on increases in gross revenues at this property, will commence in 2010. We funded this acquisition using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. During 2008, we purchased $69.4 million of improvements made to our properties that are leased to Five Star. We used cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund these purchases. At December 31, 2008, we had $6.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and $293.0 million available under our revolving credit facility. We expect to use cash balances, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and net proceeds of offerings of equity or debt securities to fund future working capital requirements, property acquisitions and expenditures related to the repair, maintenance or renovation of our properties. When significant amounts are outstanding under our revolving credit facility or as the maturity dates of our revolving credit facility and term debts approach, we explore alternatives for the repayment of amounts due. Such alternatives may include incurring additional debt and issuing new equity securities. We have an effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis, but it does not assure that there will be buyers for such securities. Recent capital markets conditions have been challenging. The availability and cost of credit have been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid capital markets and wide credit spreads, and equity markets have been extremely volatile. While we believe we will have access to various types of financings, including debt or equity offerings, to fund our future acquisitions and to pay our debts and other obligations, there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any debt or equity offerings or that our cost of any future public or private financings will be reasonable. If current market conditions continue or worsen, one or more lenders under our revolving credit facility may be unable or unwilling to fund advances which we request or we may not be able to access additional capital. Our ability to continue to access capital could be impacted by various factors including general market conditions and the continuing slowdown in the economy, interest rates, credit ratings on our securities, the market price of our capital stock, the performance of our tenants, borrowers and operators, including any restructurings, disruptions or bankruptcies of our tenants, borrowers and operators, and the perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions. Impacts such as these might impair our ability to make future acquisitions and make our current growth plans unachievable. Also, the current market conditions have led to materially increased credit spreads which, if they continue, may result in material increases in the interest costs under our floating rate debts and our fixed rate debts when we refinance or when we incur new debt. These interest cost increases could have material and adverse impact on our results of operations and financial conditions. On January 7, 2009, we declared a distribution of $0.35 per common share. This distribution was paid to shareholders on February 13, 2009, using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We are currently negotiating terms of a mortgage financing that may be sold to Fannie Mae in an amount of approximately $500.0 million. We may determine not to continue to pursue this financing or to pursue other financings, in this amount or in materially higher or lower amounts, and in any event there can be no assurance that this financing will occur, particularly in view of current conditions in the debt capital markets. 57 As of December 31, 2008, our contractual payment obligations were as follows (dollars in thousands): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Long-term debt obligations(1) $ 715,686 $ 2,534 $ 262,593 $ 287,122 $ 163,437 Capital lease obligations 15,230 316 703 897 13,314 Ground lease obligations 2,940 154 308 342 2,136 Acquisitions(2) 215,242 19,906 195,336   Total $ 949,098 $ 22,910 $ 458,940 $ 288,361 $ 178,887 (1)At December 31, 2008, our term debt maturities were as follows: $257.0 million in 2010; $258.9 million in 2012; $31.2 million in 2013; $97.5 million in 2015; $50.2 million in 2017; $6.2 million in 2022; and $14.7 million in 2027. (2)During 2008, we agreed to purchase 48 MOBs from HRPT for $565.0 million. At December 31, 2008, there were 10 pending MOB acquisitions under agreement to purchase, one of which closed in 2009, with the remainder scheduled to close in 2010, for a total of $215.2 million. As of February 27, 2009, we have no commercial paper, derivatives, swaps, hedges, joint ventures or partnerships. We have no off balance sheet arrangements. Debt Covenants Our principal debt obligations at December 31, 2008, were our unsecured revolving credit facility, two public issues totaling $322.5 million of unsecured senior notes, $136.2 million of mortgage debt and bonds secured by 33 of our properties. Our senior notes are governed by an indenture. This indenture and related supplements and our revolving credit facility contain a number of financial ratio covenants which generally restrict our ability to incur debts, including debts secured by mortgages on our properties in excess of calculated amounts, require us to maintain a minimum net worth, restrict our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances and require us to maintain other ratios. As of December 31, 2008, we believe we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our indentures and related supplements and our revolving credit facility. None of our indentures and related supplements, our revolving credit facility or our other debt obligations contains provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings. However, in certain circumstances our revolving credit facility uses our senior debt rating to determine the fees and the interest rate payable. Our public debt indenture and related supplements contain cross default provisions to any other debts of $10.0 million or more. Similarly, our revolving credit facility contains a cross-default provision to any other debts of $25.0 million or more that are not non-recourse debts and to any other debts of $75.0 million or more that are non-recourse debts. Related Person Transactions In May 2008, we entered into a series of agreements to acquire 48 MOBs from HRPT for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $565.0 million. As of December 31, 2008, these 48 buildings that we agreed to acquire were 98% leased to approximately 220 tenants for an average lease term of 8.2 years. Between June and December 31, 2008, we acquired 37 of these properties containing 1.5 million square feet for approximately $346.8 million, excluding closing costs. In January 2009 we acquired one additional property for approximately $19.3 million, excluding closing costs, and we expect 58 the closings of the remaining 10 acquisitions to occur in 2010. We and HRPT may mutually agree to accelerate the closings of these acquisitions. In addition, because a third party consent was not received, one of the agreements was amended so that one of the remaining buildings with an allocated value of $3.0 million is no longer subject to being purchased; in the event HRPT obtains the third party consent we may nonetheless purchase that building. Our obligations to complete our outstanding purchases from HRPT are subject to various conditions typical of commercial real estate purchases. We can provide no assurance that we will purchase all of these buildings or that the remaining purchases will be completed in 2010 or sooner. HRPT was formerly our parent company; both we and HRPT are managed by RMR; Barry Portnoy and Adam Portnoy are managing trustees of both us and HRPT; and Frederick Zeytoonjian is an independent trustee of both us and HRPT. HRPT was formerly our parent. We were spun off to HRPT's shareholders in 1999 and, at the time of this spin off, we and HRPT entered into a transaction agreement which, among other things, prohibited us from purchasing MOBs. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the purchase agreements described above, we and HRPT entered into an amendment to that transaction agreement, or the first amendment agreement, to permit us, rather than HRPT, to invest in medical office, clinic and biomedical, pharmaceutical and laboratory buildings. The first amendment agreement is subject, in the case of mixed use buildings, to HRPT's retaining the right to invest in any mixed use building for which the rentable square footage is less than 50% medical office, clinic and biomedical, pharmaceutical and laboratory use. Also, concurrently with the execution and delivery of the purchase agreements, we entered into a right of first refusal agreement under which we were granted a right of first refusal to purchase up to 45 additional identified other properties (containing approximately 4.6 million square feet of rental space) HRPT owns which are leased to tenants in medical related businesses in the event HRPT determines to sell such properties or in the event of an indirect sale as a result of HRPT's change of control or a change of control of HRPT's subsidiary which owns such properties. The terms of our agreements entered in 2008 with HRPT were negotiated and approved by special committees of our and HRPT's boards composed of independent trustees of each company who are not independent trustees of both. For more information about the terms of the purchase agreements, the first amendment agreement and the right of first refusal agreement between us and HRPT, please read these agreements, copies of which are filed as exhibits to our Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 9, 2008. Five Star is our largest tenant. Five Star is our former subsidiary. In addition to being our manager, RMR also provides management services to Five Star. One of our trustees, Mr. Barry Portnoy, is currently a managing director of Five Star. Because of these and other relationships we and Five Star may be considered related persons. As of December 31, 2008, we leased 181 senior living communities and two rehabilitation hospitals to Five Star for total annual minimum rent of $176.0 million. Since January 1, 2008, we have had several transactions with Five Star. Because of the relationships between us and Five Star all of our transactions with Five Star are separately approved by our Independent Trustees and Five Star's independent directors. During the three months ended March 31, 2008, we purchased 19 senior living properties with a total of 1,692 living units for approximately $272.3 million from five unaffiliated parties. We leased these properties to Five Star for initial rent of $21.8 million and added them to what we now refer to as Five Star lease no. 1 and lease no. 3, which have current terms expiring in 2022 and 2024, respectively. Percentage rent, based on increases in gross revenues at these properties, will commence in 2010. We funded these acquisitions using cash on hand, proceeds from equity issuances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In June 2008, we realigned three of our leases with Five Star. Lease no. 1 now includes 100 properties, including nine properties acquired during the first quarter of 2008. This lease includes 59 independent living communities, assisted living communities and skilled nursing facilities, and expires in 2022. Lease no. 2 now includes 32 properties, including independent living communities, assisted living communities, skilled nursing facilities and two rehabilitation hospitals, and expires in 2026. Lease no. 3 now includes 44 properties, including 10 properties acquired during the first quarter of 2008, 10 properties acquired during the third quarter of 2008 and one property acquired on November 1, 2008 described below. This lease includes independent living communities, assisted living communities and skilled nursing facilities and expires in 2024. The total rent payable by Five Star to us for these properties was unchanged as a result of this lease realignment. The increased rent payable for these three leases with Five Star, if and as we purchase improvements to the leased properties, is the greater of 8.0% per annum or the 10 year Treasury rate plus 300 basis points, but may not exceed 11.5%. In July 2008, we sold three assisted living properties with 259 living units, which were formerly operated by NewSeasons, to Five Star for $21.4 million. Five Star also assumed the NewSeasons and Independence Blue Cross, or IBC, lease obligations to us for the remaining seven properties that were formerly operated by NewSeasons. The rent payable by Five Star for these seven properties is approximately $7.6 million per annum under lease no. 4 between us and Five Star. In August 2008, we acquired, from an unaffiliated party, two senior living properties with a total of 112 units for approximately $14.1 million, excluding closing costs. We leased the properties to Five Star until 2024 under our Five Star lease no. 3 described above and increased rent under that lease by $1.1 million. Percentage rent, based on increases in gross revenues at these properties, will commence in 2010. We funded this acquisition using cash on hand. In September 2008, we acquired, from an unaffiliated party, eight senior living properties with a total of 451 units for approximately $62.1 million, excluding closing costs. We leased these properties to Five Star until 2024 under our Five Star lease no. 3 described above and increased rent under that lease by $5.0 million. Percentage rent, based on increases in gross revenues at these properties, will commence in 2010. We funded this acquisition using cash on hand, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and by assuming 15 mortgages on these eight properties totaling $50.5 million with a weighted average interest rate of 6.54% per annum and a weighted average maturity in 2017. In November 2008, we acquired, from an unaffiliated party, a senior living property with a total of 252 units for approximately $29.0 million. We leased this property to Five Star and added it to our Five Star lease no. 3, which has a term expiring in 2024, and increased the annual rent under this lease by $2.3 million. Percentage rent, based on increases in gross revenues at this property, will commence in 2010. We funded this acquisition using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. During 2008, pursuant to the terms of our leases with Five Star, we purchased approximately $69.4 million of improvements made to our properties leased by Five Star, and, as a result, the annual rent payable to us by Five Star increased by approximately $5.8 million. RMR provides management services to us and also provides management services to other public and private companies, including HRPT, HPT, Five Star and TravelCenters. Our bylaws require that a certain number of our trustees be "Managing Trustees," meaning a trustee who has been an employee, officer or director of RMR or involved in our day to day activities for at least one year prior to his or her election. We have two agreements with RMR to originate and present investment and divestment opportunities to us and to provide management and administrative services to us: a business management agreement and a property management agreement. The business management agreement provides for compensation to RMR at an annual rate equal to a percentage of our average real estate investments, as defined. The percentage applied to our existing investments at the time we were spun off from HRPT is 0.5%. The annual percentage for the first $250.0 million of investments made after our spin off from HRPT is 0.7% and the percentage for investments above that amount is 0.5%. In 60 addition, RMR receives an incentive fee based upon increases in our funds from operations per share, as defined in the business management agreement. The incentive fee is paid in common shares. Our property management agreement with RMR provides for management fees on our MOB portfolio equal to 3.0% of gross rents and construction management fees on our MOB portfolio equal to 5.0% of certain construction costs. Renewals or extensions of our management agreements are subject to the annual approval of our Independent Trustees. Under our business management agreement, RMR has agreed not to provide business management services to any other REIT which is principally engaged in the business of senior apartments, congregate communities, assisted living or nursing home properties, without the consent of a majority of our Independent Trustees. Any termination of our business management agreement with RMR would cause a default under our revolving credit facility, if not approved by a majority of our lenders. Aggregate fees to RMR during 2008 were $13.4 million, including $804,000 as an incentive fee which will be paid in our common shares in April 2009. RMR also provides the internal audit function for us and for other publicly owned companies to which it provides management services. Our audit committee appoints our director of internal audit, and our compensation committee approves his salary and the costs we pay with respect to our internal audit function. Our pro rata share of RMR's costs of providing that function was $213,000 in 2008. Messrs. Barry Portnoy and his son, Adam Portnoy, beneficially own RMR and are our managing trustees. Adam Portnoy, is the President, Chief Executive Officer and a director of RMR. All transactions between us and RMR are approved by our compensation committee which is composed of Independent Trustees. For more information about the terms of our business management agreement and property management agreement with RMR, please read these agreements, copies of which were filed as an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2005, and to our Current Report on Form 8-K dated June 12, 2008, respectively. We, RMR and other companies to which RMR provides management services are in the process of forming and licensing an insurance company in the State of Indiana. All of our trustees are currently serving on the board of directors of this insurance company. We expect that RMR, in addition to being a shareholder, will enter a management agreement with this insurance company, pursuant to which RMR will provide the insurance company certain management and administrative services. In addition, it is expected that the insurance company will enter an investment advisory agreement with RMR Advisors, Inc., or Advisors, pursuant to which Advisors will act as the insurance company's investment advisor. The same persons who own and control RMR, Messrs. Barry Portnoy and Adam Portnoy, our managing trustees, own and control Advisors. We have invested $25,000 to date in the insurance company and are committed to invest another $4.975 million, and we currently own and intend to own approximately 16.67% of this insurance company. We may invest additional amounts in the insurance company in the future if the expansion of this insurance business requires additional capital, but we are not obligated to do so. Over time we expect to transfer some or all of our insurance business to this company. By participating in this insurance business with RMR and the other companies to which RMR provides management services, we expect that we may benefit financially by possibly reducing insurance expenses and/or by having our pro-rata share of any profits realized by this insurance business. See "Item 9B. Other Information" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding this insurance company and our participation in that insurance company. Policies and Procedures Concerning Conflicts of Interest and Related Person Transactions Our Code of Conduct and our governance guidelines address review and approval of activities, interests or relationships that interfere with, or appear to interfere with, our interests, including related party transactions. Persons subject to our Code of Conduct and governance guidelines are under a continuing obligation to disclose any such conflicts of interest and may pursue a transaction or 61 relationship which involves such conflicts of interest only if the transaction or relationship has been approved as follows: In the case of an executive officer or trustee, such person must seek approval from our disinterested trustees for investments, related person transactions (involving a direct or indirect material interest) and other transactions or relationships which such person would like to pursue and which may otherwise constitute a conflict of interest or other action falling outside the scope of permissible activities under our Code of Conduct and governance guidelines. If there are no disinterested trustees, the transaction shall be reviewed, authorized and approved or ratified by both the affirmative vote of our entire board of trustees and the affirmative vote of a majority of our Independent Trustees. Pursuant to our governance guidelines, in determining whether to approve or ratify a transaction, our board of trustees, disinterested trustees or Independent Trustees, as the case may be, shall act in accordance with any applicable provisions of the our declaration of trust, and shall consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances, and shall approve only those transactions that are fair and reasonable to us. In the case of RMR employees (other than our trustees and executive officers) subject to our Code of Conduct, the employee must seek approval from an executive officer who has no interest in the matter for which approval is being requested. We are in the process of forming and licensing an insurance company for which all of our trustees will serve as directors. Any material transaction between us and such insurance company shall be reviewed, authorized and approved or ratified by both the affirmative vote of a majority of our entire board of trustees and the affirmative vote of a majority of our Independent Trustees. The following is a summary of provisions of our declaration of trust, affecting certain transactions with related persons. Because it is a summary of the material terms, it does not contain all the information that may be important to you. If you would like more information, you should read the entire declaration of trust, which has been filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K, dated June 3, 2008. Under our declaration of trust: Each of our trustees, officers, employees and agents may, in his or her personal capacity or otherwise, have business interests and engage in business activities similar to or in addition to those relating to us, which interests and activities may be similar to and competitive with ours and may include the acquisition, syndication, holding, management, development, operation or disposition, for his own account, or for the account of others, of interests in mortgages, interests in real property, or interests in persons engaged in the real estate business. Each of our trustees, officers, employees and agents is free of any obligation to present to us any investment opportunity which comes to him or her in any capacity other than solely as our trustee, officer, employee or agent even if such opportunity is of a character which, if presented to us, could be taken by us. Each of our trustees, officers, employees or agents may be interested as a trustee, officer, director, shareholder, partner, member, advisor or employee of, or otherwise have a direct or indirect interest in, any person who may be engaged to render advice or services to us, and may receive compensation from such person as well as compensation from us as a trustee, officer, employee or agent or otherwise. None of the above mentioned activities will be deemed to conflict with an individual's duties and powers as our trustee, officer, employee or agent. We may enter into any contract or transaction of any kind, whether or not any of our trustees, officers, employees or agents has a financial interest in such transaction, with any person, 62 including any of our trustees, officers, employees or agents or any person affiliated with one of our trustees, officers, employees or agents or in which one of our trustees, officers, employees or agents has a material financial interest. To the extent permitted by Maryland law, a contract or other transaction between us and any of our trustees or between us and RMR or any other entities in which any of our trustees is a director or trustee or has a material financial interest shall not be void or voidable if: The fact of the common directorship, trusteeship or interest is disclosed or known to our board of trustees or a proper committee thereof, and our board of trustees or such committee authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract or transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of disinterested trustees, even if the disinterested trustees constitute less than a quorum; The fact of the common directorship, trusteeship or interest is disclosed or known to our shareholders entitled to vote, and the contract or transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified by a majority of the votes cast by our shareholders entitled to vote other than the votes of shares owned of record or beneficially by the interested trustee, corporation, trust, firm or other entity; or The contract or transaction is fair and reasonable to us. The failure of a contract or other transaction between us and any of our trustees or between us and RMR or any other corporation, trust, firm, or other entity in which any of our trustees is a director or trustee or has a material financial interest to satisfy the criteria set forth above will not create any presumption that such contract or other transaction is void, voidable or otherwise invalid, and any such contract or other transaction shall be valid to the fullest extent permitted by Maryland law. Critical Accounting Policies Our critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. We believe that our judgments and assessments are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations. Our three most critical accounting policies concern our investments in real property and are as follows: Allocation of Purchase Price and Recognition of Depreciation and Amortization Expense. We allocate the purchase prices of real estate acquired to land, building and improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above market and below market leases, the value of in place leases and the value of tenant relationships. Purchase price allocations and the determination of useful lives are based on management's estimates. In some circumstances management engages independent real estate appraisal firms to provide market information and evaluations that are relevant to management's purchase price allocations and determinations of useful lives; however, management is ultimately responsible for the purchase price allocations and determination of useful lives. We allocate purchase prices to land, building and improvements based on our determination of the relative fair values of these assets assuming the property is vacant. We determine the fair value of assets using methods which we believe are similar to those used by independent appraisers. We allocate purchase prices to above market and below market leases based on the estimated present value (using an interest rate which reflects our assessment of the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and (ii) our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases. These purchase price allocations to in place 63 leases and tenant relationships are determined as the excess of (i) the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in place leases to estimated market rental rates over (ii) the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant. We aggregate this value between in place lease values and tenant relationships based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease; however, the value of tenant relationships has not been separated from in place lease value because such value and related amortization expense is immaterial for acquisitions reflected in our financial statements. We consider certain factors in performing these analyses including estimates of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods, including real estate taxes, insurance and other operating income and expenses and costs to execute similar leases in current market conditions, such as leasing commissions, legal and other related costs. If the value of tenant relationships is material in the future, those amounts will be separately allocated and amortized over the estimated life of the relationships. We compute depreciation expense using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings and improvements, and up to 12 years for personal property. We do not depreciate the allocated cost of land. We amortize capitalized above market lease values (included in acquired real estate leases) as a reduction in rental income over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases. We amortize capitalized below market lease values (presented as acquired real estate lease obligations) as an increase in rental income over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases. We amortize the value of in place leases exclusive of the value of above market and below market in place leases to expense over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. If a lease is terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease are written off. Our purchase price allocations require us to make certain assumptions and estimates. Incorrect assumptions and estimates may result in inaccurate depreciation and amortization charges over future periods. Impairment of Assets. We periodically evaluate our real property investments for impairment indicators. These indicators may include weak or declining tenant profitability, cash flow or liquidity, our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life and market or industry changes that could permanently reduce the value of our investments. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the real property investment by comparing it to the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated. If the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value, we reduce the net carrying value to the present value of these expected future cash flows. This analysis requires us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash flows. If we misjudge or estimate incorrectly or if future tenant profitability, market or industry factors differ from our expectations, we may record an impairment charge which is inappropriate or fail to record a charge when we should have done so, or the amount of such charges may be inaccurate. Classification of Leases. A majority of our real property investments are leased on a triple net basis, pursuant to non-cancelable, fixed term, operating leases. Each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate its classification as either a capital lease or an operating lease. The classification of a lease as capital or operating affects the carrying value of a property, as well as our recognition of rental payments as revenues. These evaluations require us to make estimates of, among other things, the remaining useful life and market value of a leased property, appropriate discount rates and future cash flows. Incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases. These policies involve significant judgments based upon our experience, including judgments about current valuations, ultimate realizable value, estimated useful lives, the ability of our tenants and operators to perform their obligations to us, and the current and likely future operating and competitive environments in which our properties are operated. In the future we may need to revise our assessments to incorporate information which is not now known, and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties we own, result in the classification 64 of some of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of some of our assets. Impact of Inflation Inflation might have both positive and negative impacts upon us. Inflation might cause the value of our real estate investments to increase. In an inflationary environment, the percentage rents which we receive based upon a percentage of our tenants' revenues should increase. Offsetting these benefits, inflation might cause our costs of equity and debt capital and other operating costs to increase. An increase in our capital costs or in our operating costs will result in decreased earnings unless it is offset by increased revenues. In periods of rapid inflation, our tenants' operating costs may increase faster than revenues and this fact may have an adverse impact upon us if our tenants' operating income from our properties becomes insufficient to pay our rent. To mitigate the adverse impact of increased operating costs at our leased properties, we generally require our tenants to provide guarantees for our rent. To mitigate the adverse impact of increased costs of debt capital in the event of material inflation, we previously have purchased interest rate cap agreements and we may enter into similar interest rate hedge arrangements in the future. The decision to enter into these agreements was and will be based on the amount of our floating rate debt outstanding, our belief that material interest rate increases are likely to occur and the requirements of our borrowing arrangements. Impact of Government Reimbursement Approximately 90% of our current annual rents at our senior living properties come from properties where approximately 80% or more of the operating revenues are derived from residents who pay from their own private resources. The remaining 10% of our rents at our senior living properties come from properties where the revenues are heavily dependent upon Medicare and Medicaid programs. The operations of these senior living properties currently produce sufficient cash flow to support our rent. However, as discussed above in "BusinessGovernment Regulation and Reimbursement", we expect that Medicare and Medicaid rates paid to our tenants may not increase in amounts sufficient to pay our tenants' increased operating costs, or that they may even decline. Also, the hospitals we lease to Five Star are heavily dependent upon Medicare revenues. We cannot predict whether our tenants which are affected by Medicare and Medicaid rates will be able to continue to pay their rent obligations if these expected circumstances occur and persist for an extended time. Our medical office building or biotechnology laboratory tenants who provide healthcare services are subject regulation by federal, state and local entities. Many states require medical clinics, ambulatory surgery centers, clinical laboratories and other outpatient healthcare facilities to be licensed and inspected for compliance with licensure regulations concerning professional staffing, services, patient rights, and physical plant requirements, among other matters. We do not currently expect the costs of complying with these regulations to have a material impact on our financial results. Seasonality Nursing home and assisted living operations have historically reflected modest seasonality. During calendar fourth quarter holiday periods, residents at such facilities are sometimes discharged to join in family celebrations and admission decisions are often deferred. The first quarter of each calendar year usually coincides with increased illness among residents which can result in increased costs or discharges to hospitals. As a result of these factors and others, these operations sometimes produce greater earnings in the second and third quarters of each calendar year and lesser earnings in the fourth and first calendar quarters. We do not expect these seasonal differences to have a material impact upon the ability of our tenants to pay our rent. Also, we do not expect these seasonal differences to have a material impact on our MOBs or wellness centers. 65 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates. We manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives. Our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged from December 31, 2007. Other than as described below, we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the future. At December 31, 2008, our outstanding fixed rate debt included the following (dollars in thousands): Debt Principal Balance Annual Interest Rate Annual Interest Expense Maturity Interest Payments Due Unsecured senior notes $ 225,000 8.625% $ 19,406 2012 Semi-Annually Unsecured senior notes 97,500 7.875% 7,678 2015 Semi-Annually Mortgages 50,156 6.54% 3,280 2017 Monthly Mortgages 33,939 6.97% 2,366 2012 Monthly Mortgage 15,031 6.91% 1,039 2013 Monthly Mortgages 11,727 6.11% 717 2013 Monthly Mortgage 4,457 6.50% 290 2013 Monthly Mortgage 4,151 7.31% 303 2022 Monthly Mortgage 2,025 7.85% 159 2022 Monthly Bonds 14,700 5.875% 864 2027 Semi-Annually $ 458,686 $ 36,102 No principal payments are due under our unsecured notes or bonds until maturity. Our mortgages require principal and interest payments through maturity pursuant to amortization schedules. Because these debts bear interest at a fixed rate, changes in market interest rates during the term of these debts will not affect our operating results. If these debts are refinanced at interest rates which are 10% higher or lower than shown above, our per annum interest cost would increase or decrease by approximately $2.7 million. Changes in market interest rates also affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations; increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt, while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt. Based on the balances outstanding at December 31, 2008, and discounted cash flow analysis through the maturity date of our fixed rate debt obligations, a hypothetical immediate 10% change in interest rates would change the fair value of those obligations by approximately $13.8 million. We are allowed to make prepayments of our unsecured senior notes, in whole or in part, at par plus a premium, as defined. Our mortgages contain provisions that allow us to make repayment at par plus premiums which is generally designed to preserve a stated yield to the mortgage holder. Also, as we did in January 2007, we occasionally have the opportunity to purchase our outstanding debt by open market purchases. These prepayment rights may afford us the opportunity to mitigate the risk of refinancing at maturity. Our unsecured revolving credit facility accrues interest at floating rates and matures in December 2010. At December 31, 2008, we had $257.0 million outstanding and $293.0 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. At February 27, 2009, we had $190.0 million outstanding and $360.0 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. We may make repayments and drawings under our revolving credit facility at any time without penalty. We borrow in U.S. dollars and borrowings under our revolving credit facility accrue interest at LIBOR plus a premium. Accordingly, we are vulnerable to changes in U.S. dollar based short term rates, specifically LIBOR. A change in interest rates would not affect the value of this floating rate debt but would affect our 66 operating results. For example, the weighted average interest rate payable on our outstanding revolving indebtedness of $257.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, was 4.74% per annum. The following table presents the impact a 10% change in interest rates would have on our annual floating rate interest expense at December 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands): Impact of Changes in Interest Rates Interest Rate Per Year Outstanding Debt Total Interest Expense Per Year At December 31, 2008 4.74% $ 257,000 $ 12,182 10% reduction 4.27% 257,000 10,974 10% increase 5.22% 257,000 13,415 The foregoing table shows the impact of an immediate change in floating interest rates. If interest rates were to change gradually over time, the impact would be spread over time. Our exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with increases or decreases in the outstanding amount under our revolving credit facility or other floating rate debt. The following table presents the impact a 10% change in interest rates would have on our annual floating rate interest expense at December 31, 2008 if we were fully drawn on our revolving credit facility (dollars in thousands): Impact of Changes in Interest Rates Interest Rate Per Year Outstanding Debt Total Interest Expense Per Year At December 31, 2008 4.74% $ 550,000 $ 26,070 10% reduction 4.27% 550,000 23,485 10% increase 5.22% 550,000 28,710 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data The information required by this item is included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our managing trustees, President and Chief Operating Officer and Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15. Based upon that evaluation, our managing trustees, President and Chief Operating Officer and Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2008 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 67 Management Report on Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of trustees regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2008, our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our 2008 consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. The report appears elsewhere herein. Item 9B. Other Information Affiliates Insurance Company On February 27, 2009, we entered into a shareholders agreement, or the Shareholders Agreement, with Affiliates Insurance Company, a company being formed and licensed as an insurance company in the State of Indiana, or AIC, Five Star, TravelCenters, HRPT, HPT and RMR. With respect to AIC, we refer to ourselves, RMR, Five Star, TravelCenters, HRPT and HPT, collectively, as the Shareholders. Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, each of the Shareholders has purchased from AIC 100 shares of common stock, par value of $10.00 per share, of AIC, or the Shares, at a purchase price of $250.00 per Share and has committed to purchase from AIC an additional 19,900 Shares (such additional share purchase, we refer to as the "Second Subscription") within five business days of a request from AIC at the same purchase price per Share. The Shareholders comprise all the shareholders of AIC and each Shareholder currently owns approximately 16.67% of the outstanding Shares. AIC has been formed to provide insurance and risk management services to the Shareholders and their subsidiaries. Board Representation The Shareholders Agreement provides that for so long as a Shareholder (other than RMR) owns not less than 10% of the issued and outstanding Shares, such Shareholder has the right to designate two directors for election to the board of directors of AIC and that so long as RMR owns not less than 10% of the issued and outstanding Shares, RMR has the right to designate three directors for election to the board of directors of AIC, including one director who is a resident of Indiana. The board of directors of AIC is currently composed of 13 directors. Transfer Restrictions, Preemptive Rights and Call Options Subject to certain exceptions, the Shareholders Agreement prohibits the Shareholders from transferring Shares. Under the Shareholders Agreement, the Shareholders have rights to participate in future securities offerings by AIC in proportion to their Share ownership. 68 In addition, under the Shareholders Agreement, if a Shareholder undergoes a change of control (as defined in the Shareholders Agreement), AIC will have, for a specified period of time, a right to repurchase the securities of AIC owned by that Shareholder. Any AIC securities not acquired by AIC may, for a specified period of time, be purchased by the Shareholders which did not undergo a change of control in proportion to their Share ownership. Special Shareholder Approval Requirements The Shareholders Agreement prohibits AIC from taking certain actions unless Shareholders owning 75% of the Shares owned by all Shareholders approve of such action in advance. Those actions include: any amendment to the articles of incorporation or bylaws of AIC; any merger of AIC; the sale of all or substantially all of AIC's assets; any reorganization or recapitalization of AIC; or any liquidation or dissolution of AIC. Regulatory Matters The Shareholders Agreement requires AIC to comply in all material respects with applicable laws governing its business and operations. In addition, if by virtue of a Shareholder's ownership interest in AIC or actions taken by a Shareholder affecting AIC, the Shareholder triggers the application of any requirement or regulation on AIC or any subsidiary of AIC or any of their respective businesses, assets or operations, then the Shareholders Agreement generally requires that Shareholder to promptly take all actions necessary and fully cooperate with AIC to ensure that such requirements and regulations are satisfied without restricting, imposing additional obligations on or in any way limiting the business, assets, operations or prospects of AIC or any subsidiary of AIC. Also, the Shareholders Agreement requires each Shareholder to use best efforts to cause its shareholders, directors (or analogous position), nominees for director (or analogous position), officers, employees and agents to comply with any applicable laws impacting AIC or any of its subsidiaries or their respective businesses, assets or operations. Termination The Shareholders Agreement may be terminated at any time by Shareholders owning at least 75% of the issued and outstanding Shares owned by all Shareholders or upon the dissolution of AIC. The foregoing description of the Shareholders Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Shareholders Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.71 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Shareholders Agreement is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In furtherance of AIC's business and operations, AIC also intends to enter a management and administrative services agreement with RMR pursuant to which RMR will provide AIC certain management and administrative services and, as soon as practicable following the receipt by AIC of the amounts for the Second Subscription from the Shareholders, an investment advisory agreement with Advisors, pursuant to which Advisors will act as AIC's investment adviser. The same persons who own and control RMR, Messrs. Barry Portnoy and Adam Portnoy, our managing trustees, own and control Advisors. 69 Information Regarding Certain Relationships and Related Transactions We became a publicly owned company as a result of a spin off from HRPT in 1999 and we continue to have relationships with HRPT, including the series of agreements to acquire 48 MOBs from HRPT discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Five Star is our largest tenant and our former subsidiary. RMR provides management services to us. Please see elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further description of our relationships with HRPT and RMR and our definitive proxy statement for the 2008 annual meeting of shareholders, which has been filed with the SEC, and our definitive Proxy Statement, which will be filed with the SEC not later than 120 days after the end of our fiscal year. In addition, RMR also provides management services to Five Star, HPT, HRPT and TravelCenters and we understand that those entities also have certain relationships with each other, such as lease arrangements for properties. We understand that further information regarding those relationships is provided in the applicable Shareholders' periodic reports filed with the SEC. In addition, our Independent Trustees also serve as directors or trustees of certain of the other Shareholders and directors and trustees of certain of the Shareholders other than the Company serve as directors or trustees of other Shareholders. Mr. Barry Portnoy serves as a managing director or trustee of each of the Shareholders and Mr. Adam Portnoy serves as a managing trustee of HRPT and HPT. Amendment to our Bylaws On February 24, 2009, our board of trustees adopted an amendment to our bylaws, effective that same day. The amendment revised the advance notice procedures under our bylaws to require that a shareholder seeking to nominate any person for election as trustee or propose other business for consideration at an applicable meeting of our shareholders must have continuously held at least $2,000 in market value, or 1%, of our shares entitled to vote at the meeting on the election or the proposal of other business, as the case may be, for at least one year from the date the shareholder gives its advance notice and continuously hold those shares through and including the time of the meeting. The amendment provides that this requirement will not apply until April 1, 2010 with respect to a shareholder who continuously holds from and after April 1, 2009 shares entitled to vote at the meeting on such election or proposal of other business, as the case may be. For purposes of determining compliance with the $2,000 market value requirement, the amendment provides that the market value of our shares held by the applicable shareholder shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares such shareholder held continuously for that one year period by the highest selling price of our shares as reported on the principal national securities exchange on which our shares are listed for trading during the 60 calendar days before the date the shareholder's notice was submitted. The amendment also revised the advance notice procedures under our bylaws to require a shareholder seeking to nominate any person for election as trustee or propose other business for consideration at an applicable meeting of our shareholders to hold a certificate for all our shares owned by such shareholder during all times described with regard to a shareholder's qualifications for validly submitting a notice to nominate any person for election as trustee or propose other business for consideration at an applicable meeting of our shareholders, including the time periods referred to above. The amendment also included certain other conforming changes. 70 PART III Item 10.

(+)Management contract or compensatory plan or arrangement 80 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Trustees and Shareholders of Senior Housing Properties Trust: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Senior Housing Properties Trust (the "Company") as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Senior Housing Properties Trust at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Senior Housing Properties Trust's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 27, 2009 F-1 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Trustees and Shareholders of Senior Housing Properties Trust: We have audited Senior Housing Properties Trust's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Senior Housing Properties Trust's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in Item 9A of Senior Housing Properties Trust's Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading Management Report on Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Senior Housing Properties Trust maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2008 consolidated financial statements of Senior Housing Properties Trust and our report dated February 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 27, 2009 F-2 SENIOR HOUSING PROPERTIES TRUST CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AMOUNTS) December 31, 2008 2007 ASSETS Real estate properties, at cost: Land $ 319,591 $ 217,236 Buildings and improvements 2,487,665 1,723,111 2,807,256 1,940,347 Less accumulated depreciation 381,339 323,891 2,425,917 1,616,456 Cash and cash equivalents 5,990 43,521 Restricted cash 4,344 3,642 Investments in available for sale securities 3,424 8,020 Deferred financing fees, net 5,068 5,974 Due from affiliate 15,042 11,388 Acquired real estate leases, net 30,546 2,387 Other assets 6,543 10,506 Total assets $ 2,496,874 $ 1,701,894 LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY Unsecured revolving credit facility $ 257,000 $  Senior unsecured notes due 2012 and 2015, net of discount 322,017 321,873 Secured debt and capital leases 151,416 104,979 Accrued interest 11,121 10,849 Due to affiliate 2,287 1,496 Acquired real estate lease obligations, net 7,974 4,216 Other liabilities 13,701 9,071 Total liabilities 765,516 452,484 Commitments and contingencies Shareholders' equity: Common shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value: 149,700,000 shares authorized, 114,542,584 and 88,691,892 shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively 1,145 887 Additional paid-in capital 2,000,865 1,476,675 Cumulative net income 530,318 423,807 Cumulative distributions (797,639 ) (653,225 ) Unrealized (loss) gain on investments (3,331 ) 1,266 Total shareholders' equity 1,731,358 1,249,410 Total liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 2,496,874 $ 1,701,894 See accompanying notes.

F-6 SENIOR HOUSING PROPERTIES TRUST NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1. Organization We are a Maryland real estate investment trust, or REIT. At December 31, 2008, we owned 271 properties located in 34 states and Washington, D.C. Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies BASIS OF PRESENTATION. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Senior Housing Properties Trust, or the Company, and all of our consolidated subsidiaries. We have eliminated all intercompany transactions. REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES. We depreciate real estate properties on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings and improvements and up to 12 years for personal property. Our management regularly evaluates whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could indicate an impairment in the value of long lived assets. If there is an indication that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable, we estimate the projected undiscounted cash flows to determine if an impairment loss should be recognized. We determine the amount of impairment loss by comparing the historical carrying value to estimated fair value. We estimate fair value through an evaluation of recent financial performance and projected discounted cash flows using standard industry valuation techniques. In addition to consideration of impairment upon the events or changes in circumstances described above, we regularly evaluate the remaining lives of our long lived assets. If we change our estimate of the remaining lives, we allocate the carrying value of the affected assets over their revised remaining lives. We allocate the purchase prices of real estate acquired to land, building and improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above market and below market leases, the value of in place leases and the value of tenant relationships. Purchase price allocations and the determination of useful lives are based on management's estimates. In some circumstances management engages independent real estate appraisal firms to provide market information and evaluations that are relevant to management's purchase price allocations and determinations of useful lives; however, management is ultimately responsible for the purchase price allocations and determination of useful lives. We allocate purchase prices to land, building and improvements based on our determination of the relative fair values of these assets assuming the property is vacant. We determine the fair value of assets using methods which we believe are similar to those used by independent appraisers. We allocate purchase prices to above market and below market leases based on the estimated present value (using an interest rate which reflects our assessment of the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and (ii) our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases. These purchase price allocations to in place leases and tenant relationships are determined as the excess of (i) the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in place leases to estimated market rental rates over (ii) the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant. We aggregate this value between in place lease values and tenant relationships based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease; however, the value of tenant relationships has not been separated from in place lease value because such value and related amortization expense is immaterial for acquisitions reflected in our financial statements. We consider certain factors in performing these analyses including estimates of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods, including real estate taxes, insurance and other operating income and F-7 SENIOR HOUSING PROPERTIES TRUST NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) expenses and costs to execute similar leases in current market conditions, such as leasing commissions, legal and other related costs. If the value of tenant relationships is material in the future, those amounts will be separately allocated and amortized over the estimated life of the relationships. We amortize capitalized above market lease values (included in acquired real estate leases in our consolidated balance sheets) as a reduction in rental income over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases. We amortize capitalized below market lease values (presented as acquired real estate lease obligations in our consolidated balance sheets) as an increase in rental income over the non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. Such amortization resulted in a $60,000 reduction in rental income and a $16,000 increase in rental income during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We amortize the value of in place leases exclusive of the value of above market and below market in place leases to expense over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. Such amortization included in depreciation and amortization totaled $998,000 and $15,000 during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. If a lease is terminated prior to its stated expiration, the unamortized amount relating to that lease is written off. We recorded intangible lease assets of $29.8 million and $2.4 million and intangible lease liabilities of $4.3 million and $4.3 million for properties acquired in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Accumulated amortization of capitalized above and below market lease values was $29,000 and $16,000 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Accumulated amortization of the value of in place leases exclusive of the value of above and below market in place leases was $1.0 million and $15,000 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We expect to recognize future amortization of these intangible lease assets and liabilities in the amounts of approximately $3.5 million in 2009, $3.3 million in 2010, $2.9 million in 2011, $2.7 million in 2012, $2.3 million in 2013 and $7.9 million thereafter. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. We carry cash and cash equivalents, consisting of overnight repurchase agreements and short term investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase, at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value. RESTRICTED CASH. Restricted cash consists of amounts escrowed for real estate taxes, insurance and capital expenditures at 32 of our mortgaged properties. INVESTMENTS IN AVAILABLE FOR SALE SECURITIES. We own 1,000,000 common shares, or 0.44% at December 31, 2008, of HRPT Properties Trust, or HRPT. We also own 35,000 common shares, or 0.11% at December 31, 2008, of Five Star Quality Care, Inc., or Five Star, which we retained or received when we spun off Five Star in 2001. We classify these holdings as available for sale and carry them at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity. The unrealized loss on investments shown on the consolidated balance sheets represents the difference between the market value of these shares of HRPT and Five Star calculated by using quoted market prices on the date they were acquired ($6.50 and $7.26 per share, respectively) and on December 31, 2008 ($3.37 and $1.53 per share, respectively). At December 31, 2008, our investment in HRPT had a fair value of $3.4 million, including an unrealized loss of $3.1 million. At December 31, 2007, our investment in HRPT had a fair value of $7.7 million, including an unrealized gain of $1.3 million. At December 31, 2008, our investment in Five Star had a fair value of $54,000, including an unrealized loss of $201,000. At December 31, 2007, our investment in Five Star had a fair value of $290,000, including an unrealized gain of $36,000. F-8 SENIOR HOUSING PROPERTIES TRUST NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) DEFERRED FINANCING FEES. We capitalize issuance costs related to borrowings and amortize them over the terms of the respective loans. During 2007, we wrote off $276,000 of deferred financing fees and unamortized discounts in connection with the retirement of some of our 85/8% senior notes. During 2006, we wrote off $2.4 million of unamortized deferred financing fees in connection with our partial redemption of our 77/8% unsecured senior notes and our redemption of all our junior subordinated debentures. The unamortized balance of deferred financing fees net of accumulated amortization was $13.7 million and $8.6 million, and $12.6 million and $6.6 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The weighted average amortization period is approximately six years. We expect that the amortization expense for the five years subsequent to December 31, 2008 will be $1.9 million in 2009, $798,000 in each of 2010 and 2011, $331,000 in 2012, $289,000 in 2013 and $870,000 thereafter. REVENUE RECOGNITION. We recognize rental income from operating leases on a straight line basis over the life of each lease agreement. We recognize interest income as earned over the terms of each real estate mortgage. We recognize percentage rents when realizable and earned, which is generally during the fourth quarter of the year. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, percentage rents earned aggregated $8.4 million, $6.6 million, and $5.3 million, respectively. EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE. We compute earnings per common share using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. We have no common share equivalents, instruments convertible into common shares or other dilutive instruments. USE OF ESTIMATES. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and related notes. The actual results could differ from these estimates. INCOME TAXES. We operate in a manner to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Accordingly, we do not expect to be subject to federal income taxes if we continue to distribute our taxable income and continue to meet the other requirements for qualifying as a real estate investment trust. However, we are subject to some state and local taxes on our income and property. SEGMENT REPORTING. As of December 31, 2008, we have three operating segments. The first operating segment provides short term and long term residential care facilities that offer dining for residents. Properties in this segment include independent living facilities, assisted living facilities, skilled nursing facilities and rehabilitation hospitals. The second operating segment, commencing in June 2008, provides facilities for medical related services where residential overnight stays or dining services are not provided. Properties in this segment include medical office, clinic and biotech laboratory buildings, or MOBs. The third operating segment, commencing in October 2007, provides specialized facilities that offer fitness, wellness and spa services to members. All of our facilities are operated by others under long term leases with the Company. RECLASSIFICATIONS. Reclassifications have been made to the prior years' financial statements to conform to the current year's presentation. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS. In May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 162, "The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles", or SFAS 162. SFAS 162 identifies sources of accounting principles and a framework for selecting principles to be used in preparation of financial statements of F-9 SENIOR HOUSING PROPERTIES TRUST NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) nongovernmental entities that are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (the GAAP Hierarchy). SFAS 162 is effective 60 days following the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC's, approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to auditing standard AU Section 411, "The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles". We do not expect this standard will result in any change to our current accounting practices. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations", or SFAS No. 141(R). SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer shall recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and goodwill acquired in a business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We expect the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will affect our consolidated financial statements if we engage in a transaction that falls within the scope of this standard. In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes", or FIN 48. FIN 48 prescribes how we should recognize, measure and present in our financial statements uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return. Pursuant to FIN 48, we can recognize a tax benefit only if it is "more likely than not" that a particular tax position will be sustained upon examination or audit. To the extent the "more likely than not" standard has been satisfied, the benefit associated with a tax position is measured as the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. As required, we adopted FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007 and have concluded that the effect is not material to our consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, we did not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of FIN 48. We classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, if any, in our financial statements as a component of general and administrative expense. Note 3. Real Estate Properties The undepreciated cost, after impairment write downs, of our real estate was $2.8 billion and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The future minimum lease payments due to us during the current terms of our leases as of December 31, 2008, are $263.8 million in 2009, $262.9 million in 2010, $260.5 million in 2011, $258.0 million in 2012, $255.9 million in 2013 and $2.6 billion, thereafter. During the three months ended March 31, 2008, we purchased 19 senior living properties with a total of 1,692 living units for approximately $272.3 million from five unaffiliated parties. We leased these properties to Five Star for initial rent of $21.8 million and added them to what we now refer to as Five Star lease no. 1 and lease no. 3, which have current terms expiring in 2022 and 2024, respectively. Percentage rent, based on increases in gross revenues at these properties, will commence in 2010. We funded these acquisitions using cash on hand, proceeds from equity issuances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In May 2008, we entered into a series of agreements to acquire 48 MOBs from HRPT for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $565.0 million. As of December 31, 2008, these 48 buildings that we agreed to acquire were 98% leased to approximately 220 tenants for an average lease term of 8.2 years. Between June and December 31, 2008, we acquired 37 of these properties containing 1.5 million square feet for approximately $346.8 million, excluding closing costs. In January 2009 we acquired one F-10 SENIOR HOUSING PROPERTIES TRUST NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 3. Real Estate Properties (Continued) additional property for approximately $19.3 million, excluding closing costs, and we expect the closings of the remaining 10 acquisitions to occur in 2010. We and HRPT may mutually agree to accelerate the closings of these acquisitions. In addition, because a third party consent was not received, one of the agreements was amended so that one of the remaining buildings with an allocated value of $3.0 million is no longer subject to being purchased; in the event HRPT obtains the third party consent we may nonetheless purchase that building. We funded these acquisitions using cash on hand, proceeds from equity issuances, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and by assuming three mortgage loans on two properties totaling $10.8 million with a weighted average interest rate of 7.1% per annum and a weighted average maturity in 2018. Our obligations to complete our outstanding purchases from HRPT are subject to various conditions typical of commercial real estate purchases. We can provide no assurance that we will purchase all of these buildings or that the remaining purchases will be completed in 2010 or sooner. In addition, we also acquired rights of first refusal to purchase any of 45 additional buildings (containing approximately 4.6 million square feet of rental space) that are leased to tenants in medical related businesses which HRPT will continue to own after these transactions. HRPT was formerly our parent company, and both we and HRPT are managed by Reit Management & Research LLC, or RMR. Because we and HRPT are both managed by RMR, the terms of these transactions were negotiated by special committees of our and HRPT's boards of trustees composed solely of independent trustees who were not also independent trustees of both companies. In June 2008, we realigned three of our leases with Five Star. Lease no. 1 now includes 100 properties, including nine properties acquired during the first quarter of 2008. This lease includes independent living communities, assisted living communities and skilled nursing facilities, and expires in 2022. Lease no. 2 now includes 32 properties, including independent living communities, assisted living communities, skilled nursing facilities and two rehabilitation hospitals, and expires in 2026. Lease no. 3 now includes 44 properties, including 10 properties acquired during the first quarter of 2008, 10 properties acquired during the third quarter of 2008 and one property acquired on November 1, 2008 described below. This lease includes independent living communities, assisted living communities and skilled nursing facilities and expires in 2024. The total rent payable by Five Star to us for these properties was unchanged as a result of this lease realignment. The increased rent payable for these three leases with Five Star, if and as we purchase improvements to the leased properties, is the greater of 8.0% per annum or the 10 year Treasury rate plus 300 basis points, but may not exceed 11.5%. Five Star was formerly our subsidiary. In addition to being our manager, RMR also provides management services to Five Star. Because of these and other relationships between us and Five Star, all transactions between us and Five Star are approved by our Independent Trustees and Five Star's independent directors. In July 2008, we sold three assisted living properties with 259 living units, which were formerly operated by NewSeasons Assisted Living Communities, Inc., or NewSeasons, to Five Star for $21.4 million. Five Star also assumed the NewSeasons and Independence Blue Cross, or IBC, lease obligations to us for the remaining seven properties that were formerly operated by NewSeasons. The rent payable by Five Star for these seven properties is approximately $7.6 million per annum under lease no. 4 between us and Five Star. In August 2008, we acquired, from an unaffiliated party, two senior living properties with a total of 112 units for approximately $14.1 million, excluding closing costs. We leased the properties to Five Star until 2024 under our Five Star lease no. 3 described above and increased rent under that lease by $1.1 million. Percentage rent, based on increases in gross revenues at these properties, will commence in 2010. We funded this acquisition using cash on hand. F-11 SENIOR HOUSING PROPERTIES TRUST NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 3. Real Estate Properties (Continued) In August 2008, we acquired four wellness centers for approximately $100.0 million, excluding closing costs, from Life Time Fitness, Inc., or Life Time Fitness. We leased these wellness centers to a subsidiary of Life Time Fitness for initial rent of $9.1 million, plus rent increases of 10% every five years. This lease has a current term expiring in 2028, plus renewal options. We funded this acquisition using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In September 2008, we acquired, from an unaffiliated party, eight senior living properties with a total of 451 units for approximately $62.1 million, excluding closing costs. We leased these properties to Five Star until 2024 under our Five Star lease no. 3 described above and increased rent under that lease by $5.0 million. Percentage rent, based on increases in gross revenues at these properties, will commence in 2010. We funded this acquisition using cash on hand, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and by assuming 15 mortgages on these eight properties totaling $50.5 million with a weighted average interest rate of 6.54% per annum and a weighted average maturity in 2017. In September 2008, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell one of our properties, classified as held for sale, to an unaffiliated party for approximately $1.2 million. The sale of this property is subject to customary contingencies. We can provide no assurance that we will sell this property. In September 2008, we acquired, from an unaffiliated party, one medical office building for approximately $18.6 million, excluding closing costs. This building is 100% leased to 12 tenants for an average lease term of 6.3 years. We funded this acquisition using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In November 2008, we acquired, from an unaffiliated party, a senior living property with a total of 252 units for approximately $29.0 million. We leased this property to Five Star and added it to our Five Star lease no. 3, which has a term expiring in 2024, and increased the annual rent under this lease by $2.3 million. Percentage rent, based on increases in gross revenues at this property, will commence in 2010. We funded this acquisition using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In October and November 2007, we purchased six wellness centers for a total purchase price of $76.8 million from an unaffiliated third party. Subsidiaries of Starmark Holdings, LLC lease these wellness centers under three separate leases. These leases have a current term expiring in 2023, plus renewal options, and require aggregate annual rent of $6.5 million initially, plus consumer price index based increases. We funded this acquisition using cash on hand, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and by assuming a mortgage on two centers for $14.9 million at 6.91% per annum which matures in 2013. At December 31, 2008, two of our properties are classified as held for sale as we may sell them in 2009. These two properties are included in real estate properties on our consolidated balance sheets. These two properties have a carrying value of $3.8 million and $9.5 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. During 2008, we recorded impairment charges of $8.4 million related to four properties, including the two properties classified as held for sale, to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value, less costs to sell. During 2007, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.4 million related to one property to reduce the carrying value of this asset held for sale to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. During 2008 and 2007, pursuant to the terms of our leases with Five Star, we purchased approximately $69.4 million and $47.7 million, respectively, of improvements made to our properties which are leased F-12 SENIOR HOUSING PROPERTIES TRUST NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 3. Real Estate Properties (Continued) by Five Star and the annual rent payable to us by Five Star was increased by approximately $5.8 million and $4.5 million, respectively. Note 4. Shareholders' Equity We have common shares available for issuance under the terms of our 1999 Incentive Share Award Plan and our 2003 Incentive Share Award Plan, collectively referred to as the Award Plans. We awarded 54,025 common shares with an aggregate market value of $1.1 million, 38,400 common shares with an aggregate market value of $848,000 and 43,400 common shares with an aggregate market value of $941,000 to our officers and certain employees of RMR pursuant to the Award Plans during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition, we awarded each of our trustees 2,000 common shares in 2008 and 1,500 common shares in both 2007 and 2006 with an aggregate market value of $229,000 ($46,000 to each trustee), $175,000 ($35,000 to each trustee) and $132,000 ($26,000 to each trustee), respectively, pursuant to the Award Plans as part of their annual fees. Shares awarded to the trustees vest immediately. The shares awarded to our officers and certain employees of our manager vest in three or five annual installments beginning on the date of grant. At December 31, 2008, 2,645,815 of our common shares remain available for issuance under the Award Plans. All share awards are fully expensed as the grants vest. We recorded share-based compensation expense related to award grants of $978,000 in 2008 and $719,000 in both 2007 and 2006. Our cash distributions to our common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, were $1.40 per share, $1.37 per share, and $1.30 per share, respectively. The characterization of the distributions made in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 81.63%, 79.85%, and 59.51% ordinary income, respectively; 15.91%, 20.15%, and 40.49% return of capital, respectively; 0.11%, 0%, and 0% capital gain, respectively; and 0.26%, 0%, and 0% uncaptured Section 1250 gain, respectively. In February 2008, we issued 6.2 million common shares in a public offering, raising net proceeds of $129.4 million. In June 2008, we issued 19.6 million common shares in a public offering, raising net proceeds of $393.5 million. In February 2009, we issued 5.9 million common shares in a public offering, raising net proceeds of approximately $96.8 million. We used the net proceeds from these offerings to repay borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility, to fund the acquisitions described above and for general business purposes. Note 5. Related Person Transactions We have two agreements with RMR to originate and present investment and divestment opportunities to us and to provide management and administrative services to us: a business management agreement and a property management agreement which we entered into in connection with our MOB portfolio. The business management agreement provides for compensation to RMR at an annual rate equal to a percentage of our average real estate investments, as defined. The percentage applied to our existing investments at the time we were spun off from HRPT is 0.5%. The annual percentage for the first $250.0 million of investments made after our spin off from HRPT is 0.7% and the percentage for investments above that amount is 0.5%. In addition, RMR receives an incentive fee based upon increases in our funds from operations per share, as defined in the business management agreement. The incentive fee is paid in common shares. Our property management agreement with RMR provides for management fees on our MOB portfolio equal to 3.0% of gross rents and construction management fees on our MOB portfolio equal to 5.0% of certain construction costs. These agreements are subject F-13 SENIOR HOUSING PROPERTIES TRUST NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 5. Related Person Transactions (Continued) to the annual review and approval of our independent trustees. Any termination of our business management agreement with RMR would cause a default under our revolving credit facility, if not approved by a majority of lenders. RMR is beneficially owned by Barry M. Portnoy and Adam D. Portnoy, who are our managing trustees. Each of our executive officers are also officers of RMR. RMR is compensated annually based on a formula principally related to the gross amount of our investments in real estate and the amount of revenues collected from tenants in our MOB portfolio. RMR is also entitled to an annual incentive fee, which is based on a formula and paid in our restricted common shares. Cash fees paid to RMR under the business management agreement for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, were $11.4 million, $9.8 million and $9.4 million, respectively. Property management fees paid and payable for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $274,000 and $75,000, respectively. Incentive fees payable to RMR for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, were $804,000, $648,000 and $762,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had unpaid investment advisory, property management and incentive fees owed to RMR of approximately $2.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively. RMR also provides the internal audit function for us and for other publicly owned companies to which it provides management services. Our audit committee appoints our director of internal audit, and our compensation committee approves his salary. Our compensation committee also approves the costs which we pay with respect to our internal audit function. Our pro rata share of RMR's costs in providing that function was approximately $213,000, $169,000 and $173,000 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As discussed in Note 3 above, in May 2008, we entered into a series of agreements to acquire 48 MOBs from HRPT for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $565.0 million. As of December 31, 2008, these 48 buildings that we agreed to acquire were 98% leased to approximately 220 tenants for an average lease term of 8.2 years. Between June and December 31, 2008, we acquired 37 of these properties containing 1.5 million square feet for approximately $346.8 million, excluding closing costs. In January 2009 we acquired one additional property for approximately $19.3 million, excluding closing costs, and we expect the closings of the remaining 10 acquisitions to occur in 2010. We and HRPT may mutually agree to accelerate the closings of these acquisitions. In addition, because a third party consent was not received, one of the agreements was amended so that one of the remaining buildings with an allocated value of $3.0 million is no longer subject to being purchased; in the event HRPT obtains the third party consent we may nonetheless purchase that building. Our obligations to complete our outstanding purchases from HRPT are subject to various conditions typical of commercial real estate purchases. We can provide no assurance that we will purchase all of these buildings or that the remaining purchases will be completed in 2010 or sooner. HRPT was formerly our parent company; both we and HRPT are managed by RMR; Barry Portnoy and Adam Portnoy are managing trustees of both us and HRPT; and Frederick Zeytoonjian is an independent trustee of both us and HRPT. When we were spun off to HRPT's shareholders in 1999, we and HRPT entered into a transaction agreement which, among other things, prohibited us from purchasing MOBs. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the purchase agreements described above, we and HRPT entered into an amendment to that transaction agreement, or the first amendment agreement, to permit us, rather than HRPT, to invest in medical office, clinic and biomedical, pharmaceutical and laboratory buildings. The first amendment agreement is subject, in the case of mixed use buildings, to HRPT's retaining the right to invest in any mixed use building for which the rentable square footage is less than 50% medical office, clinic and biomedical, pharmaceutical and laboratory use. Also, concurrently with the execution F-14 SENIOR HOUSING PROPERTIES TRUST NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 5. Related Person Transactions (Continued) and delivery of the purchase agreements, we entered into a right of first refusal agreement under which we were granted a right of first refusal to purchase up to 45 additional identified other properties (containing approximately 4.6 million square feet of rental space) HRPT owns which are leased to tenants in medical related businesses in the event HRPT determines to sell such properties or in the event of an indirect sale as a result of HRPT's change of control or a change of control of HRPT's subsidiary which owns such properties. The terms of our agreements entered in 2008 with HRPT were negotiated and approved by special committees of our and HRPT's boards composed of independent trustees of each company who are not independent trustees of both. For more information about the terms of the purchase agreements, the first amendment agreement and the right of first refusal agreement between us and HRPT, please read these agreements, copies of which are filed as exhibits to our Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 9, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, we lease 181 senior living communities and two rehabilitation hospitals to our former subsidiary Five Star for annual rent of $176.0 million, plus percentage rents based upon revenue increases at certain communities according to formula. Total rent recognized by us from Five Star for the three years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 amounted to $158.6 million, $128.3 million and $110.8 million, respectively, and as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 unpaid rents from Five Star amounted to $14.8 million, $11.2 million and $10.2 million, respectively. Barry Portnoy, one of our managing trustees, is also a managing director of Five Star. RMR provides management services to both us and Five Star. As described in Note 3 above, we realigned three of our leases with Five Star in June 2008 and expanded two of our leases with Five Star during 2008 and we currently expect to expand them further in 2009. In July 2008, we sold three assisted living properties with 259 living units, which were formerly operated by NewSeasons, to Five Star for $21.4 million. Five Star also assumed the NewSeasons and IBC lease obligations to us for the remaining seven properties that were formerly operated by NewSeasons. The rent payable by Five Star for these seven properties is approximately $7.6 million per annum under lease no. 4 between us and Five Star. As discussed in Note 3 above, during 2008 and 2007 we purchased approximately $69.4 million and $47.7 million, respectively, of improvements to our properties leased by Five Star and the annual rent payable to us by Five Star was increased by approximately $5.8 million and $4.5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, rent due from Five Star was $14.2 million and $10.6 million, respectively. Note 6. Indebtedness We have an unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in December 2010, with an option to extend the maturity by one additional year upon payment of a fee. Our revolving credit facility permits borrowings up to $550.0 million. The annual interest payable for amounts drawn under the facility is LIBOR plus 0.80%. Our revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and requires us to maintain financial ratios and a minimum net worth. We were in compliance with these covenants during the periods presented. We can borrow, repay and reborrow until maturity, and no principal repayment is due until maturity. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 2.2% and 5.4% at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our revolving credit facility is available for acquisitions, working capital and general business purposes. At December 31, F-15 SENIOR HOUSING PROPERTIES TRUST NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 6. Indebtedness (Continued) 2008, there was $257.0 million outstanding and $293.0 million was available for borrowing under this revolving credit facility.

(2)These two mortgages are collateralized by one MOB property acquired in July 2008. We include amortization of capital lease assets in depreciation expense. Assets recorded under capital leases had a carrying value of $15.2 million and $15.5 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In April 2008, we paid in full a mortgage loan on one of our properties for $12.6 million that had a maturity date of June 30, 2008. We used cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund this payment. In January 2007, we purchased and retired $20.0 million of our 85/8% senior notes due in 2012 and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $2.0 million. The loss on early extinguishment of debt includes a $1.8 million premium and a $276,000 write off of deferred financing fees and unamortized discounts related to these senior notes. We funded this purchase with borrowings under our revolving credit facility. During 2006, we redeemed $52.5 million of our 77/8% senior unsecured notes. As a result, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $5.2 million, which included a $4.1 million redemption premium and a $1.1 million write off of deferred financing fees and unamortized discount related to these notes in 2006. Also in 2006, we redeemed all $28.2 million of our junior subordinated debentures at par plus accrued but unpaid F-16 SENIOR HOUSING PROPERTIES TRUST NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Note 6. Indebtedness (Continued) interest. As a result, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1.3 million of unamortized deferred financing fees related to these debentures. Interest on our unsecured senior notes and our bonds is payable semi-annually in arrears; however, no principal repayments are due until maturity. Our monthly payments on our mortgages include principal and interest. We assumed the mortgages due in January and December 2013, May 2017 and January 2022 in connection with acquisitions in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Payments under our capital leases are due monthly. Required principal payments on our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2008, are as follows (dollars in thousands): 2009 $ 2,850 2010 260,044 2011 3,251 2012 257,930 2013 30,090 Thereafter 176,751 Note 7. Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities On January 1, 2008, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements", or SFAS 157, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. Adoption of this statement did not materially impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. SFAS 157 establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements. The classification of fair value measurements within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement and the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. Level 1Valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments. Level 3Valuation is based upon other unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurements. The table below presents the assets and liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2008 categorized by the level of inputs used in the valuation of each asset.

The fair values of the common shares are based on quoted market prices. The common shares are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. (2)We estimate the fair values of our senior notes using discounted cash flow analysis and currently prevailing interest rates. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying amount of our senior notes was $322,017 and 321,873, respectively. In addition to the asset and liabilities described in the above table, additional financial instruments of ours include rents receivable, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, secured and unsecured debt and other liabilities. The fair values of these additional financial instruments approximates their carrying value at December 31, 2008 and 2007 based upon their liquidity, short term maturity, variable rate pricing or our estimate of fair value using discounted cash flows analysis and prevailing interest rates.

For the Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Total revenues $ 281,696 $ 274,161 Income before gain on sale of properties $ 128,356 $ 118,731 Net income $ 128,622 $ 118,997 Per common share data: Income before gain on sale of properties $ 1.12 $ 1.04 Net income $ 1.12 $ 1.04 Note 13. Subsequent Events We, RMR and other companies to which RMR provides management services are in the process of forming and licensing an insurance company in the State of Indiana. All of our trustees are currently serving on the board of directors of this insurance company. We expect that RMR, in addition to being a shareholder, will enter a management agreement with this insurance company, pursuant to which RMR will provide the insurance company certain management and administrative services. In addition, it is expected that the insurance company will enter an investment advisory agreement with RMR Advisors, Inc., or Advisors, pursuant to which Advisors will act as the insurance company's investment advisor. The same persons who own and control RMR, Messrs. Barry Portnoy and Adam Portnoy, our managing trustees, own and control Advisors. We have invested $25,000 to date in the insurance company and are committed to invest another $4.975 million, and we currently own and intend to own approximately 16.67% of this insurance company. We may invest additional amounts in the insurance company in the future if the expansion of this insurance business requires additional capital, but we are not obligated to do so. Over time we expect to transfer some or all of our insurance business to this company. By participating in this insurance business with RMR and the other companies to which RMR provides management services, we expect that we may benefit financially by possibly reducing insurance expenses and/or by having our pro-rata share of any profits realized by this insurance business.

The principal office of the Trust shall be located at such place or places as the Board of Trustees may designate. Section 1.2. Additional Offices.

ARTICLE II MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS Section 2.1. Place.

Annual Meeting. An annual meeting of the shareholders for the election of Trustees and the transaction of any business within the powers of the Trust shall be held at such times as the Trustees may designate. Failure to hold an annual meeting does not invalidate the Trusts existence or affect any otherwise valid acts of the Trust. Section 2.3. Special Meetings.

If there shall be no Trustees, the officers of the Trust shall promptly call a special meeting of the shareholders entitled to vote for the election of successor Trustees for the purpose of electing Trustees. Section 2.4. Notice of Regular or Special Meetings. Written notice specifying the place, day and hour of any regular or special meeting, the purposes of the meeting, to the extent required by law to be provided, and all other matters required by law shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote, either personally or by sending a copy thereof by mail, postage prepaid, to his or her address appearing on the books of the Trust or theretofore given by him or her to the Trust for the purpose of notice or, if no address appears or has been given, addressed to the place where the principal office of the Trust is situated, or by electronic transmission, including facsimile transmission, to any address or number of such shareholder at which the shareholder receives electronic transmissions. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given once deposited in the U.S. mail addressed to the shareholder at his or her post office address as it appears on the records of the Trust, with postage thereon prepaid. It shall be the duty of the secretary to give notice of each meeting of the shareholders. Section 2.5. Notice of Adjourned Meetings. It shall not be necessary to give notice of the time and place of any adjourned meeting or of the business to be transacted thereat other than by announcement at the meeting at which such adjournment is taken. Section 2.6. Scope of Meetings. Except as otherwise expressly set forth elsewhere in these Bylaws, no business shall be transacted at an annual or special meeting of shareholders except as specifically designated in the notice or otherwise properly brought before the shareholders by or at the direction of the Board of Trustees. Section 2.7. Organization of Shareholder Meetings. Every meeting of shareholders shall be conducted by an individual appointed by the Board of Trustees to be chairperson of the meeting or, in the absence of such appointment or the absence of the appointed individual, by the chairman of the board or, in the case of a vacancy in the office or absence of the chairman of the board, by one of the following officers present at the meeting in the following order: the vice chairman of the board, if there be one, the president, the vice presidents in their order of seniority or, in the absence of such officers, a chairperson chosen by the shareholders by the vote of holders of shares of beneficial interest representing a majority of the votes cast on such appointment by shareholders present in person or represented by proxy. The secretary, an assistant secretary or a person appointed by the Trustees or, in the absence of such appointment, a person appointed by the chairperson of the meeting shall act as secretary of the meeting and record the minutes of the meeting. If the secretary presides as chairperson at a meeting of the shareholders, then the secretary shall not also act as secretary of the meeting and record the minutes of the meeting. The order of business and all other matters of procedure at any meeting of shareholders shall be determined by the chairperson of the meeting. The chairperson of the meeting may prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and take such action as, in the discretion of such chairperson, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation: (a) restricting admission to the time set for the commencement of the meeting; (b) limiting attendance at the meeting to shareholders of record of the Trust, their duly authorized proxies or other such persons as the chairperson of the meeting may determine; (c) limiting participation at the meeting on any matter to shareholders of record of the Trust entitled to vote on such matter, their duly authorized proxies or other such persons as the chairperson of the meeting may determine; (d) limiting the time allotted to questions or comments by participants; (e) maintaining order and security at the meeting; (f) removing any shareholder or other person who refuses to comply with meeting procedures, rules or guidelines as set forth by the chairperson of the meeting; (g) concluding a meeting or recessing or adjourning the meeting to a later date and time and at a place announced at the meeting; and (h) complying with any state and local laws and regulations concerning safety and security. Without limiting the generality of the powers of the chairperson of the meeting pursuant to the foregoing provisions, the chairperson may adjourn any meeting of shareholders for any reason deemed necessary by the chairperson, including, without limitation, if (i) no quorum is present for the transaction of the business, (ii) the Board of Trustees or the chairperson of the meeting determines that adjournment is necessary or appropriate to enable the shareholders to consider fully information that the Board of Trustees or the chairperson of the meeting determines has not been made sufficiently or timely available to shareholders or (iii) the Board of Trustees or the chairperson of 2 the meeting determines that adjournment is otherwise in the best interests of the Trust. Unless otherwise determined by the chairperson of the meeting, meetings of shareholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the general rules of parliamentary procedure or any otherwise established rules of order. Section 2.8. Quorum. At any meeting of shareholders, the presence in person or by proxy of shareholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting shall constitute a quorum; but this section shall not affect any requirement under any statute or the Declaration of Trust for the vote necessary for the adoption of any measure. If, however, such quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the shareholders, the chairperson of the meeting shall have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time without the Trust having to set a new record date or provide any additional notice of such meeting, subject to any obligation of the Trust to give notice pursuant to Section 2.5. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. The shareholders present, either in person or by proxy, at a meeting of shareholders which has been duly called and convened and at which a quorum was established may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum then being present at the meeting. Section 2.9. Voting. (a) With regard to election of a Trustee, and except as may be mandated by applicable law or the listing requirements of the principal exchange on which the Trusts common shares are listed: (i) a majority of all the votes cast at a meeting of shareholders duly called and at which a quorum is present shall be sufficient to elect a Trustee in an uncontested election; and (ii) a majority of all the shares entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders duly called and at which a quorum is present shall be sufficient to elect a Trustee in a contested election (which, for purposes of these Bylaws, is an election at which the number of nominees exceeds the number of Trustees to be elected at the meeting). Each share may be voted for as many individuals as there are Trustees to be elected and for whose election the share is entitled to be voted. (b) With regard to any other matter which may properly come before a meeting of shareholders duly called and at which a quorum is present, and except as may be mandated by applicable law, by the listing requirements of the principal exchange on which the Trusts common shares are listed or by a specific provision of the Declaration of Trust, (i) if such matter is approved by at least 75% of the Trustees then in office, including 75% of the Independent Trustees then in office, a majority of all the votes cast at the meeting shall be required to approve such matter; and (ii) if such matter is not approved by at least 75% of the Trustees then in office, including 75% of the Independent Trustees then in office, 75% of all the shares entitled to vote at the meeting shall be required to approve such matter. Section 2.10. Proxies. A shareholder may cast the votes entitled to be cast by him or her either in person or by proxy executed by the shareholder or by his or her duly authorized agent in any manner permitted by law. Such proxy shall be filed with such officer of the Trust or third party agent as the Board of Trustees shall have designated for such purpose for verification at or 3 prior to such meeting. Any proxy relating to the Trusts shares of beneficial interest shall be valid until the expiration date therein or, if no expiration is so indicated, for such period as is permitted pursuant to Maryland law. At a meeting of shareholders, all questions concerning the qualification of voters, the validity of proxies, and the acceptance or rejection of votes, shall be decided by or on behalf of the chairperson of the meeting, subject to Section 2.13. Section 2.11. Record Date. The Board of Trustees may fix the date for determination of shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of shareholders. If no date is fixed for the determination of the shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders, only persons in whose names shares entitled to vote are recorded on the share records of the Trust at the opening of business on the day of any meeting of shareholders shall be entitled to vote at such meeting. Section 2.12. Voting of Shares by Certain Holders. Shares of the Trust registered in the name of a corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, if entitled to be voted, may be voted by the president or a vice president, a general partner or trustee thereof, as the case may be, or a proxy appointed by any of the foregoing individuals, unless some other person who has been appointed to vote such shares pursuant to a bylaw or a resolution of the governing body of such corporation or other entity or pursuant to an agreement of the partners of the partnership presents a certified copy of such bylaw, resolution or agreement, in which case such person may vote such shares. Any trustee or other fiduciary may vote shares registered in his or her name as such fiduciary, either in person or by proxy. Section 2.13. Inspectors. (a) Before or at any meeting of shareholders, the chairperson of the meeting may appoint one or more persons as inspectors for such meeting. Such inspectors shall (i) ascertain and report the number of shares of beneficial interest represented at the meeting, in person or by proxy and the validity and effect of proxies, (ii) receive and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, (iii) report such tabulation to the chairperson of the meeting and (iv) perform such other acts as are proper to conduct the election or voting at the meeting. (b) Each report of an inspector shall be in writing and signed by him or her or by a majority of them if there is more than one inspector acting at such meeting. If there is more than one inspector, the report of a majority shall be the report of the inspectors. The report of the inspector or inspectors on the number of shares represented at the meeting and the results of the voting shall be prima facie evidence thereof. Section 2.14. Nominations and Other Proposals to be Considered at Meetings of Shareholders. Nominations of individuals for election to the Board of Trustees and the proposal of other business to be considered by the shareholders at meetings of shareholders may be properly brought before the meeting only as set forth in this Section 2.14. All judgments and determinations made by the Board of Trustees or the chairperson of the meeting, as applicable, under this Section 2.14 (including, without limitation, judgments and determinations as to the propriety of a proposed nomination or a proposal of other business for consideration by 4 shareholders) shall be final and binding unless determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been made in bad faith.

Section 2.14.1(a)(ii) shall be the exclusive means for a shareholder to make nominations or propose other business before an annual meeting of shareholders, except to the extent of matters which are required to be presented to shareholders by applicable law which have been properly presented in accordance with the requirements of such law. For purposes of determining compliance with the requirement in subclause (A) of Section 2.14.1(a)(ii), the market value of the Trusts shares held by the applicable shareholder shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares such shareholder continuously held for that one-year period by the highest selling price of the Trust shares as reported on the principal exchange on which the Trusts common shares are listed during the 60 calendar days before the date such notice was submitted. (b) For nominations for election to the Board of Trustees or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder pursuant to Section 2.14.1(a)(ii), the shareholder shall have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the Trust in accordance with this Section 2.14 and such other business shall otherwise be a proper matter for action by shareholders. To be timely, a shareholders notice shall set forth all information required under this Section 2.14 and shall be delivered to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the Trust not later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the 120th day nor earlier than the 150th day prior to the first anniversary of the date of the proxy statement for the preceding years annual meeting ; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the proxy statement for the annual meeting is more than 30 days earlier than the first anniversary of the date of the proxy 5 statement for the preceding years annual meeting, notice by the shareholder to be timely shall be so delivered not later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the 10th day following the earlier of the day on which (i) notice of the annual meeting is mailed or otherwise made available or (ii) public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Trust.

class and series of beneficial interest of the Trust entitled to vote for such Proposed Nominee and/or shareholders proposal, as applicable. (c) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of Section 2.14.1(b) to the contrary, in the event that the number of Trustees to be elected to the Board of Trustees is increased and there is no public announcement of such action at least 130 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the proxy statement for the preceding years annual meeting, a shareholders notice required by this Section 2.14.1 also shall be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if the notice is delivered to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the Trust not later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the 10th day immediately following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Trust. 10 (d) For purposes of this Section 2.14, (i) Shareholder Associated Person of any shareholder shall mean (A) any person acting in concert with, such shareholder, (B) any direct or indirect beneficial owner of shares of beneficial interest of the Trust owned of record or beneficially by such shareholder and (C) any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with such shareholder or a Shareholder Associated Person; (ii) Proposed Nominee Associated Person of any Proposed Nominee shall mean (A) any person acting in concert with such Proposed Nominee, (B) any direct or indirect beneficial owner of shares of beneficial interest of the Trust owned of record or beneficially by such Proposed Nominee and (C) any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with such Proposed Nominee or a Proposed Nominee Associated Person; (iii) Derivative Transaction by a person shall mean any (A) transaction in, or arrangement, agreement or understanding with respect to, any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right or similar right with an exercise, conversion or exchange privilege, or settlement payment or mechanism related to, any security of the Trust, or similar instrument with a value derived in whole or in part from the value of a security of the Trust, in any such case whether or not it is subject to settlement in a security of the Trust or otherwise or (B) any transaction, arrangement, agreement or understanding which included or includes an opportunity for such person, directly or indirectly, to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of any security of the Trust, to mitigate any loss or manage any risk associated with any increase or decrease in the value of any security of the Trust or to increase or decrease the number of securities of the Trust which such person was, is or will be entitled to vote, in any such case whether or not it is subject to settlement in a security of the Trust or otherwise; and (iv) Insider Report shall mean a statement required to be filed pursuant to Section 16 of the Exchange Act (or any successor provisions) by a person who is a Trustee of the Trust or who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than 10% of the shares of the Trust. Section 2.14.2. Shareholder Nominations or Other Proposals Causing Covenant Breaches or Defaults. At the same time as the submission of any shareholder nomination or proposal of other business to be considered at a shareholders meeting that, if approved and implemented by the Trust, would cause the Trust or any subsidiary (as defined in Section 2.14.5(c)) of the Trust to be in breach of any covenant of the Trust or any subsidiary of the Trust or otherwise cause a default (in any case, with or without notice or lapse of time) in any existing debt instrument or agreement of the Trust or any subsidiary of the Trust or other material contract or agreement of the Trust or any subsidiary of the Trust, the proponent shareholder or shareholders shall submit to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the Trust (a) evidence satisfactory to the Board of Trustees of the lenders or contracting partys willingness to waive the breach of covenant or default or (b) a detailed plan for repayment of the indebtedness to the lender or curing the contractual breach or default and satisfying any resulting damage claim, specifically identifying the actions to be taken or the source of funds, which plan must be satisfactory to the Board of Trustees in its discretion, and evidence of the availability to the Trust of substitute credit or contractual arrangements similar to the credit or contractual arrangements which are implicated by the shareholder nomination or other proposal that are at least as favorable to the Trust, as determined by the Board of Trustees in its discretion. As an example and not as a limitation, at the time these Bylaws are being amended and restated, the Trust is party to a bank credit facility that contains covenants which prohibit certain changes in 11 the management and policies of the Trust without the approval of the lenders; accordingly, a shareholder nomination or proposal which implicates these covenants shall be accompanied by a waiver of these covenants duly executed by the banks or by evidence satisfactory to the Board of Trustees of the availability of funding to the Trust to repay outstanding indebtedness under this credit facility and of the availability of a new credit facility on terms as favorable to the Trust as the existing credit facility. Section 2.14.3. Shareholder Nominations or Other Proposals Requiring Governmental Action. If (a) submission of any shareholder nomination or proposal of other business to be considered at a shareholders meeting that could not be considered or, if approved, implemented by the Trust without the Trust, any subsidiary of the Trust, the proponent shareholder, any Proposed Nominee of such shareholder, any Proposed Nominee Associated Person of such Proposed Nominee, any Shareholder Associated Person of such shareholder, the holder of proxies or their respective affiliates or associates filing with or otherwise notifying or obtaining the consent, approval or other action of any federal, state, municipal or other governmental or regulatory body (a Governmental Action) or (b) such shareholders ownership of shares of the Trust or any solicitation of proxies or votes or holding or exercising proxies by such shareholder, any Proposed Nominee of such shareholder, any Proposed Nominee Associated Person of such Proposed Nominee, any Shareholder Associated Person of such shareholder, or their respective affiliates or associates would require Governmental Action, then, at the same time as the submission of any shareholder nomination or proposal of other business to be considered at a shareholders meeting, the proponent shareholder or shareholders shall submit to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the Trust (x) evidence satisfactory to the Board of Trustees that any and all Governmental Action has been given or obtained, including, without limitation, such evidence as the Board of Trustees may require so that any nominee may be determined to satisfy any suitability or other requirements or (y) if such evidence was not obtainable from a governmental or regulatory body by such time despite the shareholders diligent and best efforts, a detailed plan for making or obtaining the Governmental Action prior to the election of any such Proposed Nominee or the implementation of such proposal, which plan must be satisfactory to the Board of Trustees in its discretion. As an example and not as a limitation, at the time these Bylaws are being amended and restated, the Trust holds a controlling ownership position in a company being formed and licensed as an insurance company in the State of Indiana. The laws of the State of Indiana have certain regulatory requirements for any person who seeks to control (as defined under Indiana law) a company which itself controls an insurance company domiciled in the State of Indiana, including by exercising proxies representing 10% or more of its voting securities. Accordingly, a shareholder who seeks to exercise proxies for a nomination or a proposal affecting the governance of the Trust shall obtain any applicable approvals from the Indiana insurance regulatory authorities prior to exercising such proxies. Similarly, as a further example and not as a limitation, at the time these Bylaws are being amended and restated, the Trust owns healthcare facilities in various states; such facilities are governed by and subject to the regulatory and licensing requirements of the state in which such facility is located. The licensing terms or regulatory regime of certain states with jurisdiction over the Trust may require that certain consents or approvals be obtained prior to the Trust considering or implementing certain actions, including potentially requiring that a Proposed Nominee obtain regulatory approval or consent prior to being nominated for or elected as a Trustee. Accordingly, a shareholder nomination or shareholder proposal that, if approved, would require the Trust to obtain the consent or approval of a state authority due to the fact that the Trust owns licensed healthcare facilities in such state, shall be accompanied by evidence that the shareholder or 12 Proposed Nominee has either secured the required approvals or consents from all applicable state regulatory authorities or if such required approvals have not been obtained, then the shareholder nomination or other proposal shall be accompanied by a copy of any applications or forms required to be completed by the Proposed Nominee or shareholder as submitted or to be submitted to the applicable state authorities so that the Board of Trustees may determine the likelihood that the shareholder or the Proposed Nominee, as applicable, will receive any such required approval. Section 2.14.4. Special Meetings of Shareholders. As set forth in Section 2.6, only business brought before the meeting pursuant to the Trusts notice of meeting shall be conducted at a special meeting of shareholders. Nominations of individuals for election to the Board of Trustees only may be made at a special meeting of shareholders at which Trustees are to be elected: (a) pursuant to the Trusts notice of meeting; (b) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Trustees; or (c) provided that the Board of Trustees has determined that Trustees shall be elected at such special meeting, by any shareholder of the Trust who is a shareholder of record both at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section 2.14.4 through and including the time of the special meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting on such election and who has complied with the notice procedures and other requirements set forth in this Section 2.14.4. In the event the Trust calls a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more Trustees to the Board of Trustees, any such shareholder may nominate an individual or individuals (as the case may be) for election as a Trustee as specified in the Trusts notice of meeting, if the shareholder satisfies the holding period and certificate requirements set forth in Section 2.14.1(a) and Section 2.14.1(b), the shareholders notice contains or is accompanied by the information and documents required by Section 2.14 and the shareholder has given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the Trust at the principal executive offices of the Trust. To be timely, a shareholders notice shall be delivered to the secretary of the Trust at the principal executive offices of the Trust not earlier than the 150th day prior to such special meeting and not later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the later of (i) the 120th day prior to such special meeting or (ii) the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Trustees to be elected at such meeting. Neither the postponement or adjournment of a special meeting, nor the public announcement of such postponement or adjournment, shall commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholders notice as described above. Section 2.14.5. General. (a) If information submitted pursuant to this Section 2.14 by any shareholder proposing a nominee for election as a Trustee or any proposal for other business at a meeting of shareholders shall be deemed by the Board of Trustees incomplete or inaccurate, any authorized officer or the Board of Trustees or any committee thereof may treat such information as not having been provided in accordance with this Section 2.14. Any notice submitted by a shareholder pursuant to this Section 2.14 that is deemed by the Board of Trustees inaccurate, incomplete or otherwise fails to satisfy completely any provision of this Section 2.14 shall be deemed defective and shall thereby render all proposals and nominations set forth in such notice defective. Upon written request by the 13 secretary of the Trust or the Board of Trustees or any committee thereof (which may be made from time to time), any shareholder proposing a nominee for election as a Trustee or any proposal for other business at a meeting of shareholders shall provide, within three business days after such request (or such other period as may be specified in such request), (i) written verification, satisfactory to the secretary or any other authorized officer or the Board of Trustees or any committee thereof, in his, her or its discretion, to demonstrate the accuracy of any information submitted by the shareholder pursuant to this Section 2.14, (ii) written responses to information reasonably requested by the secretary, the Board of Trustees or any committee thereof and (iii) a written update, to a current date, of any information submitted by the shareholder pursuant to this Section 2.14 as of an earlier date. If a shareholder fails to provide such written verification, information or update within such period, the secretary or any other authorized officer or the Board of Trustees may treat the information which was previously provided and to which the verification, request or update relates as not having been provided in accordance with this Section 2.14; provided, however, that no such written verification, response or update shall cure any incompleteness, inaccuracy or failure in any notice provided by a shareholder pursuant to this Section 2.14. It is the responsibility of a shareholder who wishes to make a nomination or other proposal to comply with the requirements of Section 2.14; nothing in this Section 2.14.5(a) or otherwise shall create any duty of the Trust, the Board of Trustees or any committee thereof nor any officer of the Trust to inform a shareholder that the information submitted pursuant to this Section 2.14 by or on behalf of such shareholder is incomplete or inaccurate or not otherwise in accordance with this Section 2.14 nor require the Trust, the Board of Trustees, any committee of the Board of Trustees or any officer of the Trust to request clarification or updating of information provided by any shareholder, but the Board of Trustees, a committee thereof or the secretary acting on behalf of the Board of Trustees or a committee, may do so in its, his or her discretion. (b) Only such individuals who are nominated in accordance with this Section 2.14 shall be eligible for election by shareholders as Trustees and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of shareholders as shall have been properly brought before the meeting in accordance with this Section 2.14. The chairperson of the meeting and the Board of Trustees shall each have the power to determine whether a nomination or any other business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with this Section 2.14 and, if any proposed nomination or other business is determined not to be in compliance with this Section 2.14, to declare that such defective nomination or proposal be disregarded. (c) For purposes of this Section 2.14: (i) public announcement shall mean disclosure in (A) a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press, Business Wire, PR Newswire or any other widely circulated news or wire service or (B) a document publicly filed by the Trust with the S.E.C. pursuant to the Exchange Act; and (ii) subsidiary shall include, with respect to a person, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other entity of which such person (A) owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the outstanding voting securities or other interests or (B) has a person designated by such person serving on, or a right, contractual or otherwise, to designate a person, so to serve on, the board of directors (or analogous governing body). 14 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.14, a shareholder shall also comply with all applicable legal requirements, including, without limitation, applicable requirements of state law and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 2.14. Nothing in this Section 2.14 shall be deemed to require that a shareholder nomination of an individual for election to the Board of Trustees or a shareholder proposal relating to other business be included in the Trusts proxy statement, except as may be required by law. (e) The Board of Trustees may from time to time require any individual nominated to serve as a Trustee to agree in writing with regard to matters of business ethics and confidentiality while such nominee serves as a Trustee, such agreement to be on the terms and in a form (the Agreement) determined satisfactory by the Board of Trustees, as amended and supplemented from time to time in the discretion of the Board of Trustees. The terms of the Agreement may be substantially similar to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics of the Trust or any similar code promulgated by the Trust (the Code of Business Conduct) or may differ from or supplement the Code of Business Conduct. (f) Determinations required or permitted to be made under this Section 2.14 by the Board of Trustees may be delegated by the Board of Trustees to a committee of the Board of Trustees, subject to applicable law. Section 2.15. No Shareholder Actions by Written Consent. Shareholders shall not be authorized or permitted to take any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of shareholders by written consent, and may take such action only at shareholders meeting of the Trust. Section 2.16. Voting by Ballot. Voting on any question or in any election may be voice vote unless the chairperson of the meeting or any shareholder shall demand that voting be by ballot. Section 2.17. Proposals of Business Which Are Not Proper Matters For Action By Shareholders. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, subject to applicable law, any shareholder proposal for business the subject matter or effect of which would be within the exclusive purview of the Board of Trustees or would reasonably likely, if considered by the shareholders or approved or implemented by the Trust, result in an impairment of the limited liability status for the Trusts shareholders, shall be deemed not to be a matter upon which the shareholders are entitled to vote. The Board of Trustees in its discretion shall be entitled to determine whether a shareholder proposal for business is not a matter upon which the shareholders are entitled to vote pursuant to this Section 2.17, and its decision shall be final and binding unless determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been made in bad faith. 15 ARTICLE III TRUSTEES Section 3.1. General Powers; Qualifications; Trustees Holding Over. The business and affairs of the Trust shall be managed under the direction of its Board of Trustees. A Trustee shall be an individual at least 21 years of age who is not under legal disability. To qualify for nomination or election as a Trustee, an individual, at the time of nomination and election, shall, without limitation, (a) have substantial expertise or experience relevant to the business of the Trust and its subsidiaries, (b) not have been convicted of a felony and (c) meet the qualifications of an Independent Trustee or a Managing Trustee, each as defined in Section 3.2, as the case may be, depending upon the position for which such individual may be nominated and elected. In case of failure to elect Trustees at an annual meeting of the shareholders, the incumbent Trustees shall hold over and continue to direct the management of the business and affairs of the Trust until they may resign or until their successors are elected and qualify. Section 3.2. Independent Trustees and Managing Trustees. A majority of the Trustees holding office shall at all times be Independent Trustees; provided, however, that upon a failure to comply with this requirement as a result of the creation of a temporary vacancy which shall be filled by an Independent Trustee, whether as a result of enlargement of the Board of Trustees or the resignation, removal or death of a Trustee who is an Independent Trustee, such requirement shall not be applicable. An Independent Trustee is one who is not an employee of the Advisor (as defined in the Declaration of Trust), who is not involved in the Trusts day to day activities, who meets the qualifications of an independent trustee under the Declaration of Trust and who meets the qualifications of an independent director (not including the specific independence requirements applicable only to members of the Audit Committee of the Board of Trustees) under the applicable rules of each stock exchange upon which shares of the Trust are listed for trading and the S.E.C., as those requirements may be amended from time to time. If the number of Trustees, at any time, is set at less than five, at least one Trustee shall be a Managing Trustee. So long as the number of Trustees shall be five or greater, at least two Trustees shall be Managing Trustees. Managing Trustees shall mean Trustees who are not Independent Trustees and who have been employees of the Advisor or involved in the day to day activities of the Trust for at least one year prior to their election. If at any time the Board of Trustees shall not be comprised of a majority of Independent Trustees, the Board of Trustees shall take such actions as will cure such condition; provided that the fact that the Board of Trustees does not have a majority of Independent Trustees or has not taken such action at any time or from time to time shall not affect the validity of any action taken by the Board of Trustees. If at any time the Board of Trustees shall not be comprised of a number of Managing Trustees as is required under this Section 3.2, the Board of Trustees shall take such actions as will cure such condition; provided that the fact that the Board of Trustees does not have the requisite number of Managing Trustees or has not taken such action at any time or from time to time shall not affect the validity of any action taken by the Board of Trustees. Section 3.3. Number and Tenure. Pursuant to the Articles Supplementary accepted for record by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation (the SDAT) as of May 11, 2000, the number of Trustees constituting the entire Board of Trustees may be increased or decreased from time to time only by a vote of the Trustees; provided however that the tenure of office of a 16 Trustee shall not be affected by any decrease in the number of Trustees. The number of Trustees shall be five until increased or decreased by the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees shall be classified into three groups: Group I, Group II and Group III. A majority of the entire Board of Trustees shall designate the Group of which each Trustee shall be a member. Section 3.4. Annual and Regular Meetings. An annual meeting of the Trustees shall be held immediately after the annual meeting of shareholders, no notice other than this Bylaw being necessary. The time and place of the annual meeting of the Trustees may be changed by the Board of Trustees. The Trustees may provide, by resolution, the time and place, either within or without the State of Maryland, for the holding of regular meetings of the Trustees without other notice than such resolution. In the event any such regular meeting is not so provided for, the meeting may be held at such time and place as shall be specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for special meetings of the Board of Trustees. Section 3.5. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Trustees may be called at any time by any Managing Trustee, the president or pursuant to the request of any two Trustees then in office. The person or persons authorized to call special meetings of the Trustees may fix any place, either within or without the State of Maryland, as the place for holding any special meeting of the Trustees called by them. Section 3.6. Notice. Notice of any special meeting shall be given by written notice delivered personally or by electronic mail, telephoned, facsimile transmitted, overnight couriered (with proof of delivery) or mailed to each Trustee at his or her business or residence address. Personally delivered, telephoned, facsimile transmitted or electronically mailed notices shall be given at least 24 hours prior to the meeting. Notice by mail shall be deposited in the U.S. mail at least 72 hours prior to the meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the U.S. mail properly addressed, with postage thereon prepaid. Electronic mail notice shall be deemed to be given upon transmission of the message to the electronic mail address given to the Trust by the Trustee. Telephone notice shall be deemed given when the Trustee is personally given such notice in a telephone call to which he is a party. Facsimile transmission notice shall be deemed given upon completion of the transmission of the message to the number given to the Trust by the Trustee and receipt of a completed answer back indicating receipt. If sent by overnight courier, such notice shall be deemed given when delivered to the courier. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any annual, regular or special meeting of the Trustees need be stated in the notice, unless specifically required by statute or these Bylaws. Section 3.7. Quorum. A majority of the Trustees shall constitute a quorum for transaction of business at any meeting of the Trustees, provided that, if less than a majority of such Trustees are present at a meeting, a majority of the Trustees present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice, and provided further that if, pursuant to the Declaration of Trust or these Bylaws, the vote of a majority of a particular group of Trustees is required for action, a quorum for that action shall also include a majority of such group. The Trustees present at a meeting of the Board of Trustees which has been duly called and convened and at which a quorum was established may continue to transact business until adjournment, 17 notwithstanding the withdrawal of a number of Trustees resulting in less than a quorum then being present at the meeting. Section 3.8. Voting. The action of the majority of the Trustees present at a meeting at which a quorum is or was present shall be the action of the Trustees, unless the concurrence of a greater proportion is required for such action by specific provision of an applicable statute, the Declaration of Trust or these Bylaws. If enough Trustees have withdrawn from a meeting to leave fewer than are required to establish a quorum, but the meeting is not adjourned, the action of the majority of that number of Trustees necessary to constitute a quorum at such meeting shall be the action of the Board of Trustees, unless the concurrence of a greater proportion is required for such action by applicable law, the Declaration of Trust or these Bylaws. Section 3.9. Telephone Meetings. Trustees may participate in a meeting by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment if all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time. Participation in a meeting by these means shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. Such meeting shall be deemed to have been held at a place designated by the Trustees at the meeting. Section 3.10. Action by Written Consent of Trustees. Unless specifically otherwise provided in the Declaration of Trust, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Trustees may be taken without a meeting, if a majority of the Trustees shall individually or collectively consent in writing to such action. Such written consent or consents shall be filed with the records of the Trust and shall have the same force and effect as the affirmative vote of such Trustees at a duly held meeting of the Trustees at which a quorum was present. Section 3.11. Waiver of Notice. The actions taken at any meeting of the Trustees, however called and noticed or wherever held, shall be as valid as though taken at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice if a quorum is present and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the Trustees not present waives notice, consents to the holding of such meeting or approves the minutes thereof. Section 3.12. Vacancies. Pursuant to the Articles Supplementary accepted for record by the SDAT as of May 16, 2000, if for any reason any or all the Trustees cease to be Trustees, such event shall not terminate the Trust or affect these Bylaws or the powers of the remaining Trustees hereunder (even if fewer than three Trustees remain). Any vacancy on the Board of Trustees may be filled only by a majority of the remaining Trustees, even if the remaining Trustees do not constitute a quorum. Any Trustee elected to fill a vacancy, whether occurring due to an increase in size of the Board of Trustees or by the death, resignation or removal of any Trustee, shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of Trustees in which the vacancy occurred or was created and until a successor is elected and qualifies. Section 3.13. Compensation. The Trustees shall be entitled to receive such reasonable compensation for their services as Trustees as the Trustees may determine from time to time. Trustees may be reimbursed for expenses of attendance, if any, at each annual, regular or special meeting of the Trustees or of any committee thereof; and for their expenses, if any, in connection with each property visit and any other service or activity performed or engaged in as Trustee. The Trustees shall be entitled to receive remuneration for services rendered to the Trust in any 18 other capacity, and such services may include, without limitation, services as an officer of the Trust, services as an employee of the Advisor, legal, accounting or other professional services, or services as a broker, transfer agent or underwriter, whether performed by a Trustee or any person affiliated with a Trustee. Section 3.14. Removal of Trustees. A Trustee may be removed at any time with or without cause by the affirmative vote either of all the remaining Trustees or, at a meeting of the shareholders properly called for that purpose, by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds of the shares of the Trust then outstanding and entitled to vote generally in the election of Trustees. Section 3.15. Surety Bonds. Unless specifically required by law, no Trustee shall be obligated to give any bond or surety or other security for the performance of any of his or her duties. Section 3.16. Reliance. Each Trustee, officer, employee and agent of the Trust shall, in the performance of his or her duties with respect to the Trust, be entitled to rely on any information, opinion, report or statement, including any financial statement or other financial data, prepared or presented by an officer or employee of the Trust or by the Advisor, accountants, appraisers or other experts or consultants selected by the Board of Trustees or officers of the Trust, regardless of whether such counsel or expert may also be a Trustee. Section 3.17. Interested Trustee Transactions. Section 2-419 of the Maryland General Corporation Law shall be available for and apply to any contract or other transaction between the Trust and any of its Trustees or between the Trust and any other trust, corporation, firm or other entity in which any of its Trustees is a trustee or director or has a material financial interest. Section 3.18. Qualifying Shares Not Required. Trustees need not be shareholders of the Trust. Section 3.19. Certain Rights of Trustees, Officers, Employees and Agents. A Trustee shall have no responsibility to devote his or her full time to the affairs of the Trust. Any Trustee or officer, employee or agent of the Trust, in his or her personal capacity or in a capacity as an affiliate, employee or agent of any other person, or otherwise, may have business interests and engage in business activities similar or in addition to those of or relating to the Trust. Section 3.20. Emergency Provisions. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Declaration of Trust or these Bylaws, this Section 3.20 shall apply during the existence of any catastrophe, or other similar emergency condition, as a result of which a quorum of the Board of Trustees under ARTICLE III cannot readily be obtained (an Emergency). During any Emergency, unless otherwise provided by the Board of Trustees, (a) a meeting of the Board of Trustees may be called by any Managing Trustee or officer of the Trust by any means feasible under the circumstances and (b) notice of any meeting of the Board of Trustees during such an Emergency may be given less than 24 hours prior to the meeting to as many Trustees and by such means as it may be feasible at the time, including publication, television or radio. 19 ARTICLE IV COMMITTEES Section 4.1. Number; Tenure and Qualifications. The Board of Trustees shall appoint an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Governance Committee. Each of these committees shall be composed of three or more Trustees, to serve at the pleasure of the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees may also appoint other committees from time to time composed of one or more members, at least one of which shall be a Trustee, to serve at the pleasure of the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees shall adopt a charter with respect to the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee, which charter shall specify the purposes, the criteria for membership and the responsibility and duties and may specify other matters with respect to each committee. The Board of Trustees may also adopt a charter with respect to other committees. Section 4.2. Powers. The Trustees may delegate any of the powers of the Trustees to committees appointed under Section 4.1 and composed solely of Trustees, except as prohibited by law. In the event that a charter has been adopted with respect to a committee composed solely of Trustees, the charter shall constitute a delegation by the Trustees of the powers of the Board of Trustees necessary to carry out the purposes, responsibilities and duties of a committee provided in the charter or reasonably related to those purposes, responsibilities and duties, to the extent permitted by law. Section 4.3. Meetings. Notice of committee meetings shall be given in the same manner as notice for special meetings of the Board of Trustees. One-third, but not less than one, of the members of any committee shall be present in person at any meeting of a committee in order to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at a meeting, and the act of a majority present at a meeting at the time of a vote if a quorum is then present shall be the act of a committee. The Board of Trustees or, if authorized by the Board in a committee charter or otherwise, the committee members may designate a chairman of any committee, and the chairman or, in the absence of a chairman, a majority of any committee may fix the time and place of its meetings unless the Board shall otherwise provide. In the absence or disqualification of any member of any committee, the members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another Trustee to act at the meeting in the place of absent or disqualified members. Each committee shall keep minutes of its proceedings and shall periodically report its activities to the full Board of Trustees and, except as otherwise provided by law or under the rules of the S.E.C. and applicable stock exchanges on which the Trusts shares are listed, any action by any committee shall be subject to revision and alteration by the Board of Trustees, provided that no rights of third persons shall be affected by any such revision or alteration. Section 4.4. Telephone Meetings. Members of a committee may participate in a meeting by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment and participation in a meeting by these means shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. 20 Section 4.5.

The signatures may be either manual or facsimile. Certificates shall be consecutively numbered and if the Trust shall from time to time issue several classes of shares, each class may have its own number series. A certificate is valid and may be issued whether or not an officer who signed it is still an officer when it is issued. Section 7.2. Transfers. (a) Shares of the Trust shall be transferable in the manner provided by applicable law, the Declaration of Trust and these Bylaws. Certificates shall be treated as 23 negotiable and title thereto and to the shares they represent shall be transferred by delivery thereof to the same extent as those of a Maryland stock corporation. (b) The Trust shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any share or shares as the holder in fact thereof and, accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws or by the laws of the State of Maryland. Section 7.3. Lost Certificates. For shares evidenced by certificates, any officer designated by the Trustees may direct a new certificate to be issued in place of any certificate previously issued by the Trust alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed. When authorizing the issuance of a new certificate, an officer designated by the Trustees may, in such officers discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or the owners legal representative to advertise the same in such manner as he shall require and/or to give bond, with sufficient surety, to the Trust to indemnify it against any loss or claim which may arise as a result of the issuance of a new certificate. Section 7.4. Closing of Transfer Books or Fixing of Record Date. (a) The Trustees may set, in advance, a record date for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or determining shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or the allotment of any other rights, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose. (b) In lieu of fixing a record date, the Trustees may provide that the share transfer books shall be closed for a stated period but not longer than 20 days. If the share transfer books are closed for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, such books shall be closed for at least 10 days before the date of such meeting. (c) If no record date is fixed and the share transfer books are not closed for the determination of shareholders, (i) the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall be at the close of business on the day on which the notice of meeting is mailed or the 30th day before the meeting, whichever is the closer date to the meeting; and (ii) the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend or an allotment of any other rights shall be the close of business on the day on which the resolution of the Trustees, declaring the dividend or allotment of rights, is adopted. (d) When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof unless the Board of Trustees shall set a new record date with respect thereto. 24 Section 7.5.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Declaration of Trust or these Bylaws, the Trustees may issue units consisting of different securities of the Trust. Any security issued in a unit shall have the same characteristics as any identical securities issued by the Trust, except that the Trustees may provide that for a specified period securities of the Trust issued in such unit may be transferred on the books of the Trust only in such unit. ARTICLE VIII REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND DISCLOSURE Section 8.1. Actions Requiring Regulatory Compliance Implicating the Trust. If any shareholder (whether individually or constituting a group, as determined by the Board of Trustees), by virtue of such shareholders ownership interest in the Trust or actions taken by the shareholder affecting the Trust, triggers the application of any requirement or regulation of any federal, state, municipal or other governmental or regulatory body on the Trust or any subsidiary (for purposes of this ARTICLE VIII, as defined in Section 2.14.5(c)) of the Trust or any of their respective businesses, assets or operations, including, without limitation, any obligations to make or obtain a Governmental Action (as defined in Section 2.14.3), such shareholder shall promptly take all actions necessary and fully cooperate with the Trust to ensure that such requirements or regulations are satisfied without restricting, imposing additional obligations on or in any way limiting the business, assets, operations or prospects of the Trust or any subsidiary of the Trust. If the shareholder fails or is otherwise unable to promptly take such actions so to cause satisfaction of such requirements or regulations, the shareholder shall promptly divest a sufficient number of shares of the Trust necessary to cause the application of such requirement or regulation to not apply to the Trust or any subsidiary of the Trust. If the shareholder fails to cause such satisfaction or divest itself of such sufficient number of shares of the Trust by not later than the 10th day after triggering such requirement or regulation referred to in this Section 8.1, then any shares of the Trust beneficially owned by such shareholder at and in excess of the level triggering the application of such requirement or regulation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be deemed to constitute shares held in violation of the ownership limitations set forth in Article VII of the Declaration of Trust and be subject to the provisions of Article VII of the Declaration of Trust and any actions triggering the application of such a requirement or regulation may be deemed by the Trust to be of no force or effect. Moreover, if the shareholder who triggers the application of any regulation or requirement fails to satisfy the requirements or regulations or to take curative actions within such 10 day period, the Trust may take all other actions which the Board of Trustees deems appropriate to require compliance or to preserve the value of the Trusts assets; and the Trust may charge the offending shareholder for the Trusts costs and expenses as well as any damages which may result to the Trust. 25 As an example and not as a limitation, at the time these Bylaws are being amended and restated, the Trust holds a controlling ownership position in a company being formed and licensed as an insurance company in the State of Indiana. The laws of the State of Indiana have certain regulatory requirements for any person who seeks to control (as defined under Indiana law) a company which itself controls an insurance company domiciled in the State of Indiana, including by exercising proxies representing 10% or more of the Trusts voting securities. Accordingly, if a shareholder seeks to exercise proxies for a matter to be voted upon at a meeting of the Trusts shareholders without having obtained any applicable approvals from the Indiana insurance regulatory authorities, such proxies representing 10% or more of the Trusts voting securities will, subject to Section 8.3, be void and of no further force or effect. As a further example and not as a limitation, at the time these Bylaws are being amended and restated, the Trust owns healthcare facilities in various states which are subject to state regulatory and licensing requirements in each such state. Under the licensing terms or regulatory regime of certain states with jurisdiction over the Trust, a shareholder which acquires a controlling equity position in the Trust may be required to obtain regulatory approval or consent prior to or as a result of obtaining such ownership. Accordingly, if a shareholder which acquires a controlling equity position in the Trust that would require the shareholder or the Trust to obtain the consent or approval of a state authority due to the fact that the Trust owns licensed healthcare facilities in such state, and the shareholder refuses to provide the Trust with information required to be submitted to the applicable state authority or if the state authority declines to approve the shareholders ownership of the Trust, then, in either event, shares of the Trust owned by the shareholder necessary to reduce its ownership to an amount so that the shareholders ownership of Trust shares would not require it to provide any such information to, or for consent to be obtained from, the state authority, may be deemed by the Board of Trustees to be shares held in violation of the ownership limitation in Article VII of the Declaration of Trust and shall be subject to the provisions of Article VII of the Declaration of Trust. Section 8.2. Compliance With Law. Shareholders shall comply with all applicable requirements of federal and state laws, including all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, in connection with such shareholders ownership interest in the Trust and all other laws which apply to the Trust or any subsidiary of the Trust or their respective businesses, assets or operations and which require action or inaction on the part of the shareholder. Section 8.3. Limitation on Voting Shares or Proxies. Without limiting the provisions of Section 8.1, if a shareholder (whether individually or constituting a group, as determined by the Board of Trustees), by virtue of such shareholders ownership interest in the Trust or its receipt or exercise of proxies to vote shares owned by other shareholders, would not be permitted to vote the shareholders shares of the Trust or proxies for shares of the Trust in excess of a certain amount pursuant to applicable law (including by way of example, applicable state insurance regulations) but the Board of Trustees determines that the excess shares or shares represented by the excess proxies are necessary to obtain a quorum, then such shareholder shall not be entitled to vote any such excess shares or proxies, and instead such excess shares or proxies may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be voted by the Advisor (or by another person designated by the Trustees) in proportion to the total shares otherwise voted on such matter. 26 Section 8.4. Representations, Warranties and Covenants Made to Governmental or Regulatory Bodies. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any representation, warranty or covenant made by a shareholder with any governmental or regulatory body in connection with such shareholders interest in the Trust or any subsidiary of the Trust shall be deemed to be simultaneously made to, for the benefit of and enforceable by, the Trust and any applicable subsidiary of the Trust. Section 8.5. Board of Trustees Determinations. The Board of Trustees shall be empowered to make all determinations regarding the interpretation, application, enforcement and compliance with any matters referred to or contemplated by this ARTICLE VIII. ARTICLE IX FISCAL YEAR Section 9.1. Fiscal Year. The fiscal year of the Trust shall be the calendar year. ARTICLE X DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS Section 10.1. Dividends and Other Distributions. Dividends and other distributions upon the shares of beneficial interest of the Trust may be authorized and declared by the Trustees. Dividends and other distributions may be paid in cash, property or shares of the Trust. ARTICLE XI SEAL Section 11.1. Seal. The Trustees may authorize the adoption of a seal by the Trust. The Trustees may authorize one or more duplicate seals. Section 11.2. Affixing Seal. Whenever the Trust is permitted or required to affix its seal to a document, it shall be sufficient to meet the requirements of any law, rule or regulation relating to a seal to place the word (SEAL) adjacent to the signature of the person authorized to execute the document on behalf of the Trust. ARTICLE XII WAIVER OF NOTICE Section 12.1. Waiver of Notice. Whenever any notice is required to be given pursuant to the Declaration of Trust, these Bylaws or applicable law, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the 27 person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any meeting need be set forth in the waiver of notice or waiver by electronic transmission, unless specifically required by statute. The attendance of any person at any meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where such person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. ARTICLE XIII AMENDMENT OF BYLAWS Section 13.1. Amendment of Bylaws. Except for any change for which these Bylaws requires approval by more than a majority vote of the Trustees, these Bylaws may be amended or repealed or new or additional Bylaws may be adopted only by the vote or written consent of a majority of the Trustees. ARTICLE XIV MISCELLANEOUS Section 14.1. References to Declaration of Trust. All references to the Declaration of Trust shall include any amendments thereto. Section 14.2. Costs and Expenses. In addition to, and as further clarification of each shareholders obligation to indemnify and hold the Trust harmless from and against all costs, expenses, penalties, fines and other amounts, including, without limitation, attorneys and other professional fees, whether third party or internal, arising from such shareholders violation of any provision of the Declaration of Trust or these Bylaws pursuant to Section 8.7 of the Declaration of Trust, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each shareholder will be liable to the Trust for, and indemnify and hold harmless the Trust (and any subsidiaries or affiliates thereof) from and against, all costs, expenses, penalties, fines or other amounts, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys and other professional fees, whether third party or internal, arising from such shareholders breach of any provision of these Bylaws or the Declaration of Trust or any action against the Trust in which such shareholder is not the prevailing party, and shall pay such amounts on demand, together with interest on such amounts, which interest will accrue at the lesser of the Trusts highest marginal borrowing rate, per annum compounded, and the maximum amount permitted by law, from the date such costs or the like are incurred until the receipt of payment. Section 14.3. Ratification. The Board of Trustees or the shareholders may ratify and make binding on the Trust any action or inaction by the Trust or its officers to the extent that the Board of Trustees or the shareholders could have originally authorized the matter. Moreover, any action or inaction questioned in any shareholders derivative proceeding or any other proceeding on the ground of lack of authority, defective or irregular execution, adverse interest of a Trustee, officer or shareholder, non-disclosure, miscomputation, the application of improper 28 principles or practices of accounting, or otherwise, may be ratified, before or after judgment, by the Board of Trustees or by the shareholders and, if so ratified, shall have the same force and effect as if the questioned action or inaction had been originally duly authorized, and such ratification shall be binding upon the Trust and its shareholders and shall constitute a bar to any claim or execution of any judgment in respect of such questioned action or inaction. Section 14.4. Ambiguity. In the case of an ambiguity in the application of any provision of these Bylaws or any definition contained in these Bylaws, the Board of Trustees shall have the sole power to determine the application of such provisions with respect to any situation based on the facts known to it and such determination shall be final and binding unless determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been made in bad faith. Section 14.5. Inspection of Bylaws. The Trustees shall keep at the principal office for the transaction of business of the Trust the original or a copy of the Bylaws as amended or otherwise altered to date, certified by the secretary, which shall be open to inspection by the shareholders at all reasonable times during office hours. Section 14.6. Election to be Subject to Part of Title 3, Subtitle 8. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in the Declaration of Trust or these Bylaws, the Trust hereby elects to be subject to Section 3-804(b) and (c) of Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the Maryland General Corporation Law (or any successor statute). This Section 14.6 only may be repealed, in whole or in part, by a subsequent amendment to these Bylaws. Section 14.7. Special Voting Provisions relating to Control Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein or in the Declaration of Trust or these Bylaws, Title 3, Subtitle 7 of the Maryland General Corporation Law (or any successor statute) shall not apply to any acquisition by any person of shares of beneficial interest of the Trust. This section may be repealed, in whole or in part, at any time, whether before or after an acquisition of control shares and, upon such repeal, may, to the extent provided by any successor bylaw, apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition. 29 EX-3.6 3 a2190821zex-3_6.htm EXHIBIT 3.6 Exhibit 3.6 SENIOR HOUSING PROPERTIES TRUST AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS As Amended and Restated November 5, 2008February 24, 2009 Table of Contents ARTICLE I OFFICES 1 Section 1.1.

Every meeting of shareholders shall be conducted by an individual appointed by the Board of Trustees to be chairperson of the meeting or, in the absence of such appointment or the absence of the appointed individual, by the chairman of the board or, in the case of a vacancy in the office or absence of the chairman of the board, by one of the following officers present at the meeting in the following order: the vice chairman of the board, if there be one, the president, the vice presidents in their order of seniority or, in the absence of such officers, a chairperson chosen by the shareholders by the vote of holders of shares of beneficial interest representing a majority of the votes cast on such appointment by shareholders present in person or represented by proxy. The secretary, an assistant secretary or a person appointed by the Trustees or, in the absence of such appointment, a person appointed by the chairperson of the meeting shall act as secretary of the meeting and record the minutes of the meeting. If the secretary presides as chairperson at a meeting of the shareholders, then the secretary shall not also act as secretary of the meeting and record the minutes of the meeting. The order of business and all other matters of procedure at any meeting of shareholders shall be determined by the chairperson of the meeting. The chairperson of the meeting may prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and take such action as, in the discretion of such chairperson, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation: (a) restricting admission to the time set for the commencement of the meeting; (b) limiting attendance at the meeting to shareholders of record of the Trust, their duly authorized proxies or other such persons as the chairperson of the meeting may determine; (c) limiting participation at the meeting on any matter to shareholders of record of the Trust entitled to vote on such matter, their duly authorized proxies or other such persons as the chairperson of the meeting may determine; (d) limiting the time allotted to questions or comments by participants; (e) maintaining order and security at the meeting; (f) removing any shareholder or other person who refuses to comply with meeting procedures, rules or guidelines as set forth by the chairperson of the meeting; (g) concluding a meeting or recessing or adjourning the meeting to a later date and time and at a place announced at the meeting; and (h) complying with any state and local laws and regulations concerning safety and security. Without limiting the generality of the powers of the chairperson of the meeting pursuant to the foregoing provisions, the chairperson may adjourn any meeting of shareholders for any reason deemed necessary by the chairperson, including, without limitation, if (i) no quorum is present for the transaction of the business, (ii) the Board of Trustees or the chairperson of the meeting determines that adjournment is necessary or appropriate to enable the shareholders to consider fully information that the Board of Trustees or the chairperson of the meeting determines has not been made sufficiently or timely available to shareholders or (iii) the Board of Trustees or the chairperson of the meeting determines that adjournment is otherwise in the best interests of the Trust. Unless otherwise determined by the chairperson of the meeting, meetings of shareholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the general rules of parliamentary procedure or any otherwise established rules of order. 2 Section 2.8. Quorum. At any meeting of shareholders, the presence in person or by proxy of shareholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting shall constitute a quorum; but this section shall not affect any requirement under any statute or the Declaration of Trust for the vote necessary for the adoption of any measure. If, however, such quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the shareholders, the chairperson of the meeting shall have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time without the Trust having to set a new record date or provide any additional notice of such meeting, subject to any obligation of the Trust to give notice pursuant to Section 2.5. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. The shareholders present, either in person or by proxy, at a meeting of shareholders which has been duly called and convened and at which a quorum was established may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum then being present at the meeting. Section 2.9. Voting. (a) With regard to election of a Trustee, and except as may be mandated by applicable law or the listing requirements of the principal exchange on which the Trusts common shares are listed: (i) a majority of all the votes cast at a meeting of shareholders duly called and at which a quorum is present shall be sufficient to elect a Trustee in an uncontested election; and (ii) a majority of all the shares entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders duly called and at which a quorum is present shall be sufficient to elect a Trustee in a contested election (which, for purposes of these Bylaws, is an election at which the number of nominees exceeds the number of Trustees to be elected at the meeting). Each share may be voted for as many individuals as there are Trustees to be elected and for whose election the share is entitled to be voted. (b) With regard to any other matter which may properly come before a meeting of shareholders duly called and at which a quorum is present, and except as may be mandated by applicable law, by the listing requirements of the principal exchange on which the Trusts common shares are listed or by a specific provision of the Declaration of Trust, (i) if such matter is approved by at least 75% of the Trustees then in office, including 75% of the Independent Trustees then in office, a majority of all the votes cast at the meeting shall be required to approve such matter; and (ii) if such matter is not approved by at least 75% of the Trustees then in office, including 75% of the Independent Trustees then in office, 75% of all the shares entitled to vote at the meeting shall be required to approve such matter. Section 2.10. Proxies. A shareholder may cast the votes entitled to be cast by him or her either in person or by proxy executed by the shareholder or by his or her duly authorized agent in any manner permitted by law. Such proxy shall be filed with such officer of the Trust or third party agent as the Board of Trustees shall have designated for such purpose for verification at or prior to such meeting. Any proxy relating to the Trusts shares of beneficial interest shall be valid until the expiration date therein or, if no expiration is so indicated, for such period as is permitted pursuant to Maryland law. At a meeting of shareholders, all questions concerning the qualification of voters, the validity of proxies, and the acceptance or rejection of votes, shall be decided by or on behalf of the chairperson of the meeting, subject to Section 2.13. 3 Section 2.11. Record Date. The Board of Trustees may fix the date for determination of shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of shareholders. If no date is fixed for the determination of the shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders, only persons in whose names shares entitled to vote are recorded on the share records of the Trust at the opening of business on the day of any meeting of shareholders shall be entitled to vote at such meeting. Section 2.12. Voting of Shares by Certain Holders. Shares of the Trust registered in the name of a corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, if entitled to be voted, may be voted by the president or a vice president, a general partner or trustee thereof, as the case may be, or a proxy appointed by any of the foregoing individuals, unless some other person who has been appointed to vote such shares pursuant to a bylaw or a resolution of the governing body of such corporation or other entity or pursuant to an agreement of the partners of the partnership presents a certified copy of such bylaw, resolution or agreement, in which case such person may vote such shares. Any trustee or other fiduciary may vote shares registered in his or her name as such fiduciary, either in person or by proxy. Section 2.13. Inspectors. (a) Before or at any meeting of shareholders, the chairperson of the meeting may appoint one or more persons as inspectors for such meeting. Such inspectors shall (i) ascertain and report the number of shares of beneficial interest represented at the meeting, in person or by proxy and the validity and effect of proxies, (ii) receive and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, (iii) report such tabulation to the chairperson of the meeting and (iv) perform such other acts as are proper to conduct the election or voting at the meeting. (b) Each report of an inspector shall be in writing and signed by him or her or by a majority of them if there is more than one inspector acting at such meeting. If there is more than one inspector, the report of a majority shall be the report of the inspectors. The report of the inspector or inspectors on the number of shares represented at the meeting and the results of the voting shall be prima facie evidence thereof. Section 2.14. Nominations and Other Proposals to be Considered at Meetings of Shareholders. Nominations of individuals for election to the Board of Trustees and the proposal of other business to be considered by the shareholders at meetings of shareholders may be properly brought before the meeting only as set forth in this Section 2.14. All judgments and determinations made by the Board of Trustees or the chairperson of the meeting, as applicable, under this Section 2.14 (including, without limitation, judgments and determinations as to the propriety of a proposed nomination or a proposal of other business for consideration by shareholders) shall be final and binding unless determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been made in bad faith. Section 2.14.1. Annual Meetings of Shareholders. (a) Nominations of individuals for election to the Board of Trustees and the proposal of other business to be considered by the shareholders at an annual meeting of shareholders may be properly brought before the meeting (i) pursuant to the Trusts notice of meeting or otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the 4 Board of Trustees or (ii) by any shareholder of the Trust who (A) has continuously held at least $2,000 in market value, or 1%, of the Trusts shares entitled to vote at the meeting on such election or the proposal for other business, as the case may be, for at least one year from the date such shareholder gives the notice provided for in this Section 2.14.1 (or, if such notice is given prior to April 1, 2010, continuously held Trust shares since April 1, 2009 and without regard to the $2,000 market value, or 1%, requirement), and continuously holds such shares through and including the time of the annual meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof), (B) is a shareholder of record at the time of giving the notice provided for in this Section 2.14.1 through and including the time of the annual meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof), (BC) is entitled to make nominations or propose other business and to vote at the meeting on such election, or the proposal for other business, as the case may be, (CD) complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.14 as to such nomination or other business and (DE) has submitted the nomination or proposal of other business to the Board of Trustees in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Declaration of Trust. Section 2.14.1(a)(ii) shall be the exclusive means for a shareholder to make nominations or propose other business before an annual meeting of shareholders, except to the extent of matters which are required to be presented to shareholders by applicable law which have been properly presented in accordance with the requirements of such law. For purposes of determining compliance with the requirement in subclause (A) of Section 2.14.1(a)(ii), the market value of the Trusts shares held by the applicable shareholder shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares such shareholder continuously held for that one-year period by the highest selling price of the Trust shares as reported on the principal exchange on which the Trusts common shares are listed during the 60 calendar days before the date such notice was submitted. (b) For nominations for election to the Board of Trustees or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder pursuant to Section 2.14.1(a)(ii), the shareholder shall have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the Trust in accordance with this Section 2.14 and such other business shall otherwise be a proper matter for action by shareholders. To be timely, a shareholders notice shall set forth all information required under this Section 2.14 and shall be delivered to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the Trust not later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the 120th day nor earlier than the 150th day prior to the first anniversary of the date of the proxy statement for the preceding years annual meeting ; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the proxy statement for the annual meeting is more than 30 days earlier than the first anniversary of the date of the proxy statement for the preceding years annual meeting, notice by the shareholder to be timely shall be so delivered not later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the 10th day following the earlier of the day on which (i) notice of the annual meeting is mailed or otherwise made available or (ii) public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Trust.

Neither the postponement or adjournment of an annual meeting, nor the public announcement of such postponement or adjournment, shall commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholders notice as 5 described above. No shareholder may give a notice to the secretary described in this Section 2.14.1(b) unless such shareholder holds a certificate for all shares of beneficial interest of the Trust owned by such shareholder during all times described in Section 2.14.1(a), and a copy of each such certificate held by such shareholder at the time of giving such notice shall accompany such shareholders notice to the secretary in order for such notice to be effective.

(d) For purposes of this Section 2.14, (i) Shareholder Associated Person of any shareholder shall mean (A) any person acting in concert with, such shareholder, (B) any direct or indirect beneficial owner of shares of beneficial interest of the Trust owned of record or beneficially by such shareholder and (C) any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with such shareholder or a Shareholder Associated Person; (ii) Proposed Nominee Associated Person of any Proposed Nominee shall mean (A) any person acting in concert with such Proposed Nominee, (B) any direct or indirect beneficial owner of shares of beneficial interest of the Trust owned of record or beneficially by such Proposed Nominee and (C) any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with such Proposed Nominee or a Proposed Nominee Associated Person; (iii) Derivative Transaction by a person shall mean any (A) transaction in, or arrangement, agreement or understanding with respect to, any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right or similar right with an exercise, conversion or exchange privilege, or settlement payment or mechanism related to, any security of the Trust, or similar instrument with a 10 value derived in whole or in part from the value of a security of the Trust, in any such case whether or not it is subject to settlement in a security of the Trust or otherwise or (B) any transaction, arrangement, agreement or understanding which included or includes an opportunity for such person, directly or indirectly, to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of any security of the Trust, to mitigate any loss or manage any risk associated with any increase or decrease in the value of any security of the Trust or to increase or decrease the number of securities of the Trust which such person was, is or will be entitled to vote, in any such case whether or not it is subject to settlement in a security of the Trust or otherwise; and (iv) Insider Report shall mean a statement required to be filed pursuant to Section 16 of the Exchange Act (or any successor provisions) by a person who is a Trustee of the Trust or who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than 10% of the shares of the Trust. Section 2.14.2. Shareholder Nominations or Other Proposals Causing Covenant Breaches or Defaults. At the same time as the submission of any shareholder nomination or proposal of other business to be considered at a shareholders meeting that, if approved and implemented by the Trust, would cause the Trust or any subsidiary (as defined in Section 2.14.5(c)) of the Trust to be in breach of any covenant of the Trust or any subsidiary of the Trust or otherwise cause a default (in any case, with or without notice or lapse of time) in any existing debt instrument or agreement of the Trust or any subsidiary of the Trust or other material contract or agreement of the Trust or any subsidiary of the Trust, the proponent shareholder or shareholders shall submit to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the Trust (a) evidence satisfactory to the Board of Trustees of the lenders or contracting partys willingness to waive the breach of covenant or default or (b) a detailed plan for repayment of the indebtedness to the lender or curing the contractual breach or default and satisfying any resulting damage claim, specifically identifying the actions to be taken or the source of funds, which plan must be satisfactory to the Board of Trustees in its discretion, and evidence of the availability to the Trust of substitute credit or contractual arrangements similar to the credit or contractual arrangements which are implicated by the shareholder nomination or other proposal that are at least as favorable to the Trust, as determined by the Board of Trustees in its discretion. As an example and not as a limitation, at the time these Bylaws are being amended and restated, the Trust is party to a bank credit facility that contains covenants which prohibit certain changes in the management and policies of the Trust without the approval of the lenders; accordingly, a shareholder nomination or proposal which implicates these covenants shall be accompanied by a waiver of these covenants duly executed by the banks or by evidence satisfactory to the Board of Trustees of the availability of funding to the Trust to repay outstanding indebtedness under this credit facility and of the availability of a new credit facility on terms as favorable to the Trust as the existing credit facility. Section 2.14.3. Shareholder Nominations or Other Proposals Requiring Governmental Action. If (a) submission of any shareholder nomination or proposal of other business to be considered at a shareholders meeting that could not be considered or, if approved, implemented by the Trust without the Trust, any subsidiary of the Trust, the proponent shareholder, any Proposed Nominee of such shareholder, any Proposed Nominee Associated Person of such Proposed Nominee, any Shareholder Associated Person of such shareholder, the holder of proxies or their respective affiliates or associates filing with or otherwise notifying or obtaining the consent, approval or other action of any federal, state, municipal or other governmental or regulatory body (a Governmental Action) or (b) such shareholders ownership of shares of the Trust or any solicitation of proxies or votes or holding or exercising proxies by such shareholder, any Proposed Nominee of such 11 shareholder, any Proposed Nominee Associated Person of such Proposed Nominee, any Shareholder Associated Person of such shareholder, or their respective affiliates or associates would require Governmental Action, then, at the same time as the submission of any shareholder nomination or proposal of other business to be considered at a shareholders meeting, the proponent shareholder or shareholders shall submit to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the Trust (x) evidence satisfactory to the Board of Trustees that any and all Governmental Action has been given or obtained, including, without limitation, such evidence as the Board of Trustees may require so that any nominee may be determined to satisfy any suitability or other requirements or (y) if such evidence was not obtainable from a governmental or regulatory body by such time despite the shareholders diligent and best efforts, a detailed plan for making or obtaining the Governmental Action prior to the election of any such Proposed Nominee or the implementation of such proposal, which plan must be satisfactory to the Board of Trustees in its discretion. As an example and not as a limitation, at the time these Bylaws are being amended and restated, the Trust holds a controlling ownership position in a company being formed and licensed as an insurance company in the State of Indiana. The laws of the State of Indiana have certain regulatory requirements for any person who seeks to control (as defined under Indiana law) a company which itself controls an insurance company domiciled in the State of Indiana, including by exercising proxies representing 10% or more of its voting securities. Accordingly, a shareholder who seeks to exercise proxies for a nomination or a proposal affecting the governance of the Trust shall obtain any applicable approvals from the Indiana insurance regulatory authorities prior to exercising such proxies. Similarly, as a further example and not as a limitation, at the time these Bylaws are being amended and restated, the Trust owns healthcare facilities in various states; such facilities are governed by and subject to the regulatory and licensing requirements of the state in which such facility is located. The licensing terms or regulatory regime of certain states with jurisdiction over the Trust may require that certain consents or approvals be obtained prior to the Trust considering or implementing certain actions, including potentially requiring that a Proposed Nominee obtain regulatory approval or consent prior to being nominated for or elected as a Trustee. Accordingly, a shareholder nomination or shareholder proposal that, if approved, would require the Trust to obtain the consent or approval of a state authority due to the fact that the Trust owns licensed healthcare facilities in such state, shall be accompanied by evidence that the shareholder or Proposed Nominee has either secured the required approvals or consents from all applicable state regulatory authorities or if such required approvals have not been obtained, then the shareholder nomination or other proposal shall be accompanied by a copy of any applications or forms required to be completed by the Proposed Nominee or shareholder as submitted or to be submitted to the applicable state authorities so that the Board of Trustees may determine the likelihood that the shareholder or the Proposed Nominee, as applicable, will receive any such required approval. Section 2.14.4. Special Meetings of Shareholders. As set forth in Section 2.6, only business brought before the meeting pursuant to the Trusts notice of meeting shall be conducted at a special meeting of shareholders. Nominations of individuals for election to the Board of Trustees only may be made at a special meeting of shareholders at which Trustees are to be elected: (a) pursuant to the Trusts notice of meeting; (b) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Trustees; or (c) provided that the Board of Trustees has determined that Trustees shall be elected at such special meeting, by any shareholder of the Trust who is a shareholder of record both at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section 12 2.14.4 through and including the time of the special meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting on such election and who has complied with the notice procedures and other requirements set forth in this Section 2.14.4. In the event the Trust calls a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more Trustees to the Board of Trustees, any such shareholder may nominate an individual or individuals (as the case may be) for election as a Trustee as specified in the Trusts notice of meeting, if the shareholder satisfies the holding period and certificate requirements set forth in Section 2.14.1(a) and Section 2.14.1(b), the shareholders notice contains or is accompanied by the information and documents required by Section 2.14 and the shareholder has given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the Trust at the principal executive offices of the Trust. To be timely, a shareholders notice shall be delivered to the secretary of the Trust at the principal executive offices of the Trust not earlier than the 150th day prior to such special meeting and not later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the later of (i) the 120th day prior to such special meeting or (ii) the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Trustees to be elected at such meeting. Neither the postponement or adjournment of a special meeting, nor the public announcement of such postponement or adjournment, shall commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholders notice as described above. Section 2.14.5. General. (a) If information submitted pursuant to this Section 2.14 by any shareholder proposing a nominee for election as a Trustee or any proposal for other business at a meeting of shareholders shall be deemed by the Board of Trustees incomplete or inaccurate, any authorized officer or the Board of Trustees or any committee thereof may treat such information as not having been provided in accordance with this Section 2.14. Any notice submitted by a shareholder pursuant to this Section 2.14 that is deemed by the Board of Trustees inaccurate, incomplete or otherwise fails to satisfy completely any provision of this Section 2.14 shall be deemed defective and shall thereby render all proposals and nominations set forth in such notice defective. Upon written request by the secretary of the Trust or the Board of Trustees or any committee thereof (which may be made from time to time), any shareholder proposing a nominee for election as a Trustee or any proposal for other business at a meeting of shareholders shall provide, within three business days after such request (or such other period as may be specified in such request), (i) written verification, satisfactory to the secretary or any other authorized officer or the Board of Trustees or any committee thereof, in his, her or its discretion, to demonstrate the accuracy of any information submitted by the shareholder pursuant to this Section 2.14, (ii) written responses to information reasonably requested by the secretary, the Board of Trustees or any committee thereof and (iii) a written update, to a current date, of any information submitted by the shareholder pursuant to this Section 2.14 as of an earlier date. If a shareholder fails to provide such written verification, information or update within such period, the secretary or any other authorized officer or the Board of Trustees may treat the information which was previously provided and to which the verification, request or update relates as not having been provided in accordance with this Section 2.14; provided, however, that no such written verification, response or update shall cure any incompleteness, inaccuracy or failure in any notice provided by a shareholder pursuant to this Section 2.14. It is the responsibility of a shareholder who wishes to make a nomination 13 or other proposal to comply with the requirements of Section 2.14; nothing in this Section 2.14.5(a) or otherwise shall create any duty of the Trust, the Board of Trustees or any committee thereof nor any officer of the Trust to inform a shareholder that the information submitted pursuant to this Section 2.14 by or on behalf of such shareholder is incomplete or inaccurate or not otherwise in accordance with this Section 2.14 nor require the Trust, the Board of Trustees, any committee of the Board of Trustees or any officer of the Trust to request clarification or updating of information provided by any shareholder, but the Board of Trustees, a committee thereof or the secretary acting on behalf of the Board of Trustees or a committee, may do so in its, his or her discretion. (b) Only such individuals who are nominated in accordance with this Section 2.14 shall be eligible for election by shareholders as Trustees and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of shareholders as shall have been properly brought before the meeting in accordance with this Section 2.14. The chairperson of the meeting and the Board of Trustees shall each have the power to determine whether a nomination or any other business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with this Section 2.14 and, if any proposed nomination or other business is determined not to be in compliance with this Section 2.14, to declare that such defective nomination or proposal be disregarded. (c) For purposes of this Section 2.14: (i) public announcement shall mean disclosure in (A) a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press, Business Wire, PR Newswire or any other widely circulated news or wire service or (B) a document publicly filed by the Trust with the United States Securities and Exchange CommissionS.E.C. pursuant to the Exchange Act; and (ii) subsidiary shall include, with respect to a person, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other entity of which such person (A) owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the outstanding voting securities or other interests or (B) has a person designated by such person serving on, or a right, contractual or otherwise, to designate a person, so to serve on, the board of directors (or analogous governing body). (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.14, a shareholder shall also comply with all applicable legal requirements, including, without limitation, applicable requirements of state law and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 2.14. Nothing in this Section 2.14 shall be deemed to require that a shareholder nomination of an individual for election to the Board of Trustees or a shareholder proposal relating to other business be included in the Trusts proxy statement, except as may be required by law. (e) The Board of Trustees may from time to time require any individual nominated to serve as a Trustee to agree in writing with regard to matters of business ethics and confidentiality while such nominee serves as a Trustee, such agreement to be on the terms and in a form (the Agreement) determined satisfactory by the Board of Trustees, as amended and supplemented from time to time in the discretion of the Board of Trustees. The terms of the Agreement may be substantially similar to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics of the Trust or any similar code promulgated by the Trust (the Code of Business Conduct) or may differ from or supplement the Code of Business Conduct. 14 (f) Determinations required or permitted to be made under this Section 2.14 by the Board of Trustees may be delegated by the Board of Trustees to a committee of the Board of Trustees, subject to applicable law. Section 2.15. No Shareholder Actions by Written Consent. Shareholders shall not be authorized or permitted to take any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of shareholders by written consent, and may take such action only at shareholders meeting of the Trust. Section 2.16. Voting by Ballot. Voting on any question or in any election may be voice vote unless the chairperson of the meeting or any shareholder shall demand that voting be by ballot. Section 2.17. Proposals of Business Which Are Not Proper Matters For Action By Shareholders. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, subject to applicable law, any shareholder proposal for business the subject matter or effect of which would be within the exclusive purview of the Board of Trustees or would reasonably likely, if considered by the shareholders or approved or implemented by the Trust, result in an impairment of the limited liability status for the Trusts shareholders, shall be deemed not to be a matter upon which the shareholders are entitled to vote. The Board of Trustees in its discretion shall be entitled to determine whether a shareholder proposal for business is not a matter upon which the shareholders are entitled to vote pursuant to this Section 2.17, and its decision shall be final and binding unless determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been made in bad faith. ARTICLE III TRUSTEES Section 3.1. General Powers; Qualifications; Trustees Holding Over. The business and affairs of the Trust shall be managed under the direction of its Board of Trustees. A Trustee shall be an individual at least 21 years of age who is not under legal disability. To qualify for nomination or election as a Trustee, an individual, at the time of nomination and election, shall, without limitation, (a) have substantial expertise or experience relevant to the business of the Trust and its subsidiaries, (b) not have been convicted of a felony and (c) meet the qualifications of an Independent Trustee or a Managing Trustee, each as defined in Section 3.2, as the case may be, depending upon the position for which such individual may be nominated and elected. In case of failure to elect Trustees at an annual meeting of the shareholders, the incumbent Trustees shall hold over and continue to direct the management of the business and affairs of the Trust until they may resign or until their successors are elected and qualify. Section 3.2. Independent Trustees and Managing Trustees. A majority of the Trustees holding office shall at all times be Independent Trustees; provided, however, that upon a failure to comply with this requirement as a result of the creation of a temporary vacancy which shall be filled by an Independent Trustee, whether as a result of enlargement of the Board of Trustees or the resignation, removal or death of a Trustee who is an Independent Trustee, such requirement shall not be applicable. An Independent Trustee is one who is not an employee of the Advisor (as 15 defined in the Declaration of Trust), who is not involved in the Trusts day to day activities, who meets the qualifications of an independent trustee under the Declaration of Trust and who meets the qualifications of an independent director (not including the specific independence requirements applicable only to members of the Audit Committee of the Board of Trustees) under the applicable rules of each stock exchange upon which shares of the Trust are listed for trading and the Securities and Exchange CommissionS.E.C., as those requirements may be amended from time to time. If the number of Trustees, at any time, is set at less than five, at least one Trustee shall be a Managing Trustee. So long as the number of Trustees shall be five or greater, at least two Trustees shall be Managing Trustees. Managing Trustees shall mean Trustees who are not Independent Trustees and who have been employees of the Advisor or involved in the day to day activities of the Trust for at least one year prior to their election. If at any time the Board of Trustees shall not be comprised of a majority of Independent Trustees, the Board of Trustees shall take such actions as will cure such condition; provided that the fact that the Board of Trustees does not have a majority of Independent Trustees or has not taken such action at any time or from time to time shall not affect the validity of any action taken by the Board of Trustees. If at any time the Board of Trustees shall not be comprised of a number of Managing Trustees as is required under this Section 3.2, the Board of Trustees shall take such actions as will cure such condition; provided that the fact that the Board of Trustees does not have the requisite number of Managing Trustees or has not taken such action at any time or from time to time shall not affect the validity of any action taken by the Board of Trustees. Section 3.3. Number and Tenure. Pursuant to the Articles Supplementary accepted for record by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation (the SDAT) as of May 11, 2000, the number of Trustees constituting the entire Board of Trustees may be increased or decreased from time to time only by a vote of the Trustees; provided however that the tenure of office of a Trustee shall not be affected by any decrease in the number of Trustees. The number of Trustees shall be five until increased or decreased by the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees shall be classified into three groups: Group I, Group II and Group III. A majority of the entire Board of Trustees shall designate the Group of which each Trustee shall be a member. Section 3.4. Annual and Regular Meetings. An annual meeting of the Trustees shall be held immediately after the annual meeting of shareholders, no notice other than this Bylaw being necessary. The time and place of the annual meeting of the Trustees may be changed by the Board of Trustees. The Trustees may provide, by resolution, the time and place, either within or without the State of Maryland, for the holding of regular meetings of the Trustees without other notice than such resolution. In the event any such regular meeting is not so provided for, the meeting may be held at such time and place as shall be specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for special meetings of the Board of Trustees. Section 3.5. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Trustees may be called at any time by any Managing Trustee, the president or pursuant to the request of any two Trustees then in office. The person or persons authorized to call special meetings of the Trustees may fix any place, either within or without the State of Maryland, as the place for holding any special meeting of the Trustees called by them. 16 Section 3.6. Notice. Notice of any special meeting shall be given by written notice delivered personally or by electronic mail, telephoned, facsimile transmitted, overnight couriered (with proof of delivery) or mailed to each Trustee at his or her business or residence address. Personally delivered, telephoned, facsimile transmitted or electronically mailed notices shall be given at least 24 hours prior to the meeting. Notice by mail shall be deposited in the U.S. mail at least 72 hours prior to the meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the U.S. mail properly addressed, with postage thereon prepaid. Electronic mail notice shall be deemed to be given upon transmission of the message to the electronic mail address given to the Trust by the Trustee. Telephone notice shall be deemed given when the Trustee is personally given such notice in a telephone call to which he is a party. Facsimile transmission notice shall be deemed given upon completion of the transmission of the message to the number given to the Trust by the Trustee and receipt of a completed answer back indicating receipt. If sent by overnight courier, such notice shall be deemed given when delivered to the courier. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any annual, regular or special meeting of the Trustees need be stated in the notice, unless specifically required by statute or these Bylaws. Section 3.7. Quorum. A majority of the Trustees shall constitute a quorum for transaction of business at any meeting of the Trustees, provided that, if less than a majority of such Trustees are present at a meeting, a majority of the Trustees present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice, and provided further that if, pursuant to the Declaration of Trust or these Bylaws, the vote of a majority of a particular group of Trustees is required for action, a quorum for that action shall also include a majority of such group. The Trustees present at a meeting of the Board of Trustees which has been duly called and convened and at which a quorum was established may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of a number of Trustees resulting in less than a quorum then being present at the meeting. Section 3.8. Voting. The action of the majority of the Trustees present at a meeting at which a quorum is or was present shall be the action of the Trustees, unless the concurrence of a greater proportion is required for such action by specific provision of an applicable statute, the Declaration of Trust or these Bylaws. If enough Trustees have withdrawn from a meeting to leave fewer than are required to establish a quorum, but the meeting is not adjourned, the action of the majority of that number of Trustees necessary to constitute a quorum at such meeting shall be the action of the Board of Trustees, unless the concurrence of a greater proportion is required for such action by applicable law, the Declaration of Trust or these Bylaws. Section 3.9. Telephone Meetings. Trustees may participate in a meeting by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment if all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time. Participation in a meeting by these means shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. Such meeting shall be deemed to have been held at a place designated by the Trustees at the meeting. Section 3.10. Action by Written Consent of Trustees. Unless specifically otherwise provided in the Declaration of Trust, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Trustees may be taken without a meeting, if a majority of the Trustees shall individually or collectively consent in writing to such action. Such written consent or consents shall be filed with 17 the records of the Trust and shall have the same force and effect as the affirmative vote of such Trustees at a duly held meeting of the Trustees at which a quorum was present. Section 3.11. Waiver of Notice. The actions taken at any meeting of the Trustees, however called and noticed or wherever held, shall be as valid as though taken at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice if a quorum is present and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the Trustees not present waives notice, consents to the holding of such meeting or approves the minutes thereof. Section 3.12. Vacancies. Pursuant to the Articles Supplementary accepted for record by the SDAT as of May 16, 2000, if for any reason any or all the Trustees cease to be Trustees, such event shall not terminate the Trust or affect these Bylaws or the powers of the remaining Trustees hereunder (even if fewer than three Trustees remain). Any vacancy on the Board of Trustees may be filled only by a majority of the remaining Trustees, even if the remaining Trustees do not constitute a quorum. Any Trustee elected to fill a vacancy, whether occurring due to an increase in size of the Board of Trustees or by the death, resignation or removal of any Trustee, shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of Trustees in which the vacancy occurred or was created and until a successor is elected and qualifies. Section 3.13. Compensation. The Trustees shall be entitled to receive such reasonable compensation for their services as Trustees as the Trustees may determine from time to time. Trustees may be reimbursed for expenses of attendance, if any, at each annual, regular or special meeting of the Trustees or of any committee thereof; and for their expenses, if any, in connection with each property visit and any other service or activity performed or engaged in as Trustee. The Trustees shall be entitled to receive remuneration for services rendered to the Trust in any other capacity, and such services may include, without limitation, services as an officer of the Trust, services as an employee of the Advisor, legal, accounting or other professional services, or services as a broker, transfer agent or underwriter, whether performed by a Trustee or any person affiliated with a Trustee. Section 3.14. Removal of Trustees. A Trustee may be removed at any time with or without cause by the affirmative vote either of all the remaining Trustees or, at a meeting of the shareholders properly called for that purpose, by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds of the shares of the Trust then outstanding and entitled to vote generally in the election of Trustees. Section 3.15. Surety Bonds. Unless specifically required by law, no Trustee shall be obligated to give any bond or surety or other security for the performance of any of his or her duties. Section 3.16. Reliance. Each Trustee, officer, employee and agent of the Trust shall, in the performance of his or her duties with respect to the Trust, be entitled to rely on any information, opinion, report or statement, including any financial statement or other financial data, prepared or presented by an officer or employee of the Trust or by the Advisor, accountants, appraisers or other experts or consultants selected by the Board of Trustees or officers of the Trust, regardless of whether such counsel or expert may also be a Trustee. 18 Section 3.17. Interested Trustee Transactions. Section 2-419 of the Maryland General Corporation Law shall be available for and apply to any contract or other transaction between the Trust and any of its Trustees or between the Trust and any other trust, corporation, firm or other entity in which any of its Trustees is a trustee or director or has a material financial interest. Section 3.18. Qualifying Shares Not Required. Trustees need not be shareholders of the Trust. Section 3.19. Certain Rights of Trustees, Officers, Employees and Agents. A Trustee shall have no responsibility to devote his or her full time to the affairs of the Trust. Any Trustee or officer, employee or agent of the Trust, in his or her personal capacity or in a capacity as an affiliate, employee or agent of any other person, or otherwise, may have business interests and engage in business activities similar or in addition to those of or relating to the Trust. Section 3.20. Emergency Provisions. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Declaration of Trust or these Bylaws, this Section 3.20 shall apply during the existence of any catastrophe, or other similar emergency condition, as a result of which a quorum of the Board of Trustees under ARTICLE III cannot readily be obtained (an Emergency). During any Emergency, unless otherwise provided by the Board of Trustees, (a) a meeting of the Board of Trustees may be called by any Managing Trustee or officer of the Trust by any means feasible under the circumstances and (b) notice of any meeting of the Board of Trustees during such an Emergency may be given less than 24 hours prior to the meeting to as many Trustees and by such means as it may be feasible at the time, including publication, television or radio. ARTICLE IV COMMITTEES Section 4.1. Number; Tenure and Qualifications. The Board of Trustees shall appoint an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Governance Committee. Each of these committees shall be composed of three or more Trustees, to serve at the pleasure of the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees may also appoint other committees from time to time composed of one or more members, at least one of which shall be a Trustee, to serve at the pleasure of the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees shall adopt a charter with respect to the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee, which charter shall specify the purposes, the criteria for membership and the responsibility and duties and may specify other matters with respect to each committee. The Board of Trustees may also adopt a charter with respect to other committees. Section 4.2. Powers. The Trustees may delegate any of the powers of the Trustees to committees appointed under Section 4.1 and composed solely of Trustees, except as prohibited by law. In the event that a charter has been adopted with respect to a committee composed solely of Trustees, the charter shall constitute a delegation by the Trustees of the powers of the Board of Trustees necessary to carry out the purposes, responsibilities and duties of a committee provided in the charter or reasonably related to those purposes, responsibilities and duties, to the extent permitted by law. 19 Section 4.3. Meetings. Notice of committee meetings shall be given in the same manner as notice for special meetings of the Board of Trustees. One-third, but not less than one, of the members of any committee shall be present in person at any meeting of a committee in order to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at a meeting, and the act of a majority present at a meeting at the time of a vote if a quorum is then present shall be the act of a committee. The Board of Trustees or, if authorized by the Board in a committee charter or otherwise, the committee members may designate a chairman of any committee, and the chairman or, in the absence of a chairman, a majority of any committee may fix the time and place of its meetings unless the Board shall otherwise provide. In the absence or disqualification of any member of any committee, the members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another Trustee to act at the meeting in the place of absent or disqualified members. Each committee shall keep minutes of its proceedings and shall periodically report its activities to the full Board of Trustees and, except as otherwise provided by law or under the rules of the Securities and Exchange CommissionS.E.C. and applicable stock exchanges on which the Trusts shares are listed, any action by any committee shall be subject to revision and alteration by the Board of Trustees, provided that no rights of third persons shall be affected by any such revision or alteration. Section 4.4. Telephone Meetings. Members of a committee may participate in a meeting by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment and participation in a meeting by these means shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. Section 4.5. Action by Written Consent of Committees. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of a committee of the Trustees may be taken without a meeting, if a consent in writing to such action is signed by a majority of the committee and such written consent is filed with the minutes of proceedings of such committee. Section 4.6. Vacancies. Subject to the provisions hereof, the Board of Trustees shall have the power at any time to change the membership of any committee, to fill all vacancies, to designate alternate members to replace any absent or disqualified member or to dissolve any such committee.

If the election of officers shall not be held at such meeting, such election shall be held as soon thereafter 20 as may be convenient. Each officer shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualifies or until his or her death, resignation or removal in the manner hereinafter provided. Any two or more offices, except president and vice president, may be held by the same person. In their discretion, the Trustees may leave unfilled any office except that of president and secretary. Election of an officer or agent shall not of itself create contract rights between the Trust and such officer or agent. Section 5.2. Removal and Resignation. Any officer or agent of the Trust may be removed by the Trustees if in their judgment the best interests of the Trust would be served thereby, but the removal shall be without prejudice to the contract rights, if any, of the person so removed. Any officer of the Trust may resign at any time by giving written notice of his or her resignation to the Trustees, the chairman of the board, the president or the secretary. Any resignation shall take effect at any time specified therein or, if the time when it shall become effective is not specified therein, immediately upon its receipt. The acceptance of a resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective unless otherwise stated in the resignation.

When authorizing the issuance of a new certificate, an officer designated by the Trustees may, in such officers discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or the owners legal representative to advertise the same in such manner as he shall require and/or to give bond, with sufficient surety, to the Trust to indemnify it against any loss or claim which may arise as a result of the issuance of a new certificate. Section 7.4. Closing of Transfer Books or Fixing of Record Date. (a) The Trustees may set, in advance, a record date for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or determining shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or the allotment of 23 any other rights, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose. (b) In lieu of fixing a record date, the Trustees may provide that the share transfer books shall be closed for a stated period but not longer than 20 days. If the share transfer books are closed for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, such books shall be closed for at least 10 days before the date of such meeting. (c) If no record date is fixed and the share transfer books are not closed for the determination of shareholders, (i) the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall be at the close of business on the day on which the notice of meeting is mailed or the 30th day before the meeting, whichever is the closer date to the meeting; and (ii) the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend or an allotment of any other rights shall be the close of business on the day on which the resolution of the Trustees, declaring the dividend or allotment of rights, is adopted. (d) When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof unless the Board of Trustees shall set a new record date with respect thereto.

Any security issued in a unit shall have the same characteristics as any identical securities issued by the Trust, except that the Trustees may provide that for a specified period securities of the Trust issued in such unit may be transferred on the books of the Trust only in such unit. ARTICLE VIII REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND DISCLOSURE Section 8.1. Actions Requiring Regulatory Compliance Implicating the Trust. If any shareholder (whether individually or constituting a group, as determined by the Board of Trustees), by virtue of such shareholders ownership interest in the Trust or actions taken by the shareholder affecting the Trust, triggers the application of any requirement or regulation of any federal, state, municipal or other governmental or regulatory body on the Trust or any subsidiary (for purposes of this ARTICLE VIII, as defined in Section 2.14.5(c)) of the Trust or any of their respective businesses, assets or operations, including, without limitation, any obligations to make or obtain a Governmental Action (as defined in Section 2.14.3), such shareholder shall promptly 24 take all actions necessary and fully cooperate with the Trust to ensure that such requirements or regulations are satisfied without restricting, imposing additional obligations on or in any way limiting the business, assets, operations or prospects of the Trust or any subsidiary of the Trust. If the shareholder fails or is otherwise unable to promptly take such actions so to cause satisfaction of such requirements or regulations, the shareholder shall promptly divest a sufficient number of shares of the Trust necessary to cause the application of such requirement or regulation to not apply to the Trust or any subsidiary of the Trust. If the shareholder fails to cause such satisfaction or divest itself of such sufficient number of shares of the Trust by not later than the 10th day after triggering such requirement or regulation referred to in this Section 8.1, then any shares of the Trust beneficially owned by such shareholder at and in excess of the level triggering the application of such requirement or regulation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be deemed to constitute shares held in violation of the ownership limitations set forth in Article VII of the Declaration of Trust and be subject to the provisions of Article VII of the Declaration of Trust and any actions triggering the application of such a requirement or regulation may be deemed by the Trust to be of no force or effect. Moreover, if the shareholder who triggers the application of any regulation or requirement fails to satisfy the requirements or regulations or to take curative actions within such 10 day period, the Trust may take all other actions which the Board of Trustees deems appropriate to require compliance or to preserve the value of the Trusts assets; and the Trust may charge the offending shareholder for the Trusts costs and expenses as well as any damages which may result to the Trust. As an example and not as a limitation, at the time these Bylaws are being amended and restated, the Trust holds a controlling ownership position in a company being formed and licensed as an insurance company in the State of Indiana. The laws of the State of Indiana have certain regulatory requirements for any person who seeks to control (as defined under Indiana law) a company which itself controls an insurance company domiciled in the State of Indiana, including by exercising proxies representing 10% or more of the Trusts voting securities. Accordingly, if a shareholder seeks to exercise proxies for a matter to be voted upon at a meeting of the Trusts shareholders without having obtained any applicable approvals from the Indiana insurance regulatory authorities, such proxies representing 10% or more of the Trusts voting securities will, subject to Section 8.3, be void and of no further force or effect. As a further example and not as a limitation, at the time these Bylaws are being amended and restated, the Trust owns healthcare facilities in various states which are subject to state regulatory and licensing requirements in each such state. Under the licensing terms or regulatory regime of certain states with jurisdiction over the Trust, a shareholder which acquires a controlling equity position in the Trust may be required to obtain regulatory approval or consent prior to or as a result of obtaining such ownership. Accordingly, if a shareholder which acquires a controlling equity position in the Trust that would require the shareholder or the Trust to obtain the consent or approval of a state authority due to the fact that the Trust owns licensed healthcare facilities in such state, and the shareholder refuses to provide the Trust with information required to be submitted to the applicable state authority or if the state authority declines to approve the shareholders ownership of the Trust, then, in either event, shares of the Trust owned by the shareholder necessary to reduce its ownership to an amount so that the shareholders ownership of Trust shares would not require it to provide any such information to, or for consent to be obtained from, the state authority, may be deemed by the Board of Trustees to be shares held in violation of the 25 ownership limitation in Article VII of the Declaration of Trust and shall be subject to the provisions of Article VII of the Declaration of Trust. Section 8.2. Compliance With Law. Shareholders shall comply with all applicable requirements of federal and state laws, including all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, in connection with such shareholders ownership interest in the Trust and all other laws which apply to the Trust or any subsidiary of the Trust or their respective businesses, assets or operations and which require action or inaction on the part of the shareholder. Section 8.3. Limitation on Voting Shares or Proxies. Without limiting the provisions of Section 8.1, if a shareholder (whether individually or constituting a group, as determined by the Board of Trustees), by virtue of such shareholders ownership interest in the Trust or its receipt or exercise of proxies to vote shares owned by other shareholders, would not be permitted to vote the shareholders shares of the Trust or proxies for shares of the Trust in excess of a certain amount pursuant to applicable law (including by way of example, applicable state insurance regulations) but the Board of Trustees determines that the excess shares or shares represented by the excess proxies are necessary to obtain a quorum, then such shareholder shall not be entitled to vote any such excess shares or proxies, and instead such excess shares or proxies may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be voted by the Advisor (or by another person designated by the Trustees) in proportion to the total shares otherwise voted on such matter. Section 8.4. Representations, Warranties and Covenants Made to Governmental or Regulatory Bodies. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any representation, warranty or covenant made by a shareholder with any governmental or regulatory body in connection with such shareholders interest in the Trust or any subsidiary of the Trust shall be deemed to be simultaneously made to, for the benefit of and enforceable by, the Trust and any applicable subsidiary of the Trust. Section 8.5. Board of Trustees Determinations. The Board of Trustees shall be empowered to make all determinations regarding the interpretation, application, enforcement and compliance with any matters referred to or contemplated by this ARTICLE VIII. ARTICLE IX FISCAL YEAR Section 9.1. Fiscal Year. The fiscal year of the Trust shall be the calendar year. ARTICLE X DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS Section 10.1. Dividends and Other Distributions. Dividends and other distributions upon the shares of beneficial interest of the Trust may be authorized and declared by the Trustees. Dividends and other distributions may be paid in cash, property or shares of the Trust. 26 ARTICLE XI SEAL Section 11.1. Seal. The Trustees may authorize the adoption of a seal by the Trust. The Trustees may authorize one or more duplicate seals. Section 11.2. Affixing Seal. Whenever the Trust is permitted or required to affix its seal to a document, it shall be sufficient to meet the requirements of any law, rule or regulation relating to a seal to place the word (SEAL) adjacent to the signature of the person authorized to execute the document on behalf of the Trust. ARTICLE XII WAIVER OF NOTICE Section 12.1. Waiver of Notice. Whenever any notice is required to be given pursuant to the Declaration of Trust, these Bylaws or applicable law, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any meeting need be set forth in the waiver of notice or waiver by electronic transmission, unless specifically required by statute. The attendance of any person at any meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where such person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. ARTICLE XIII AMENDMENT OF BYLAWS Section 13.1. Amendment of Bylaws. Except for any change for which these Bylaws requires approval by more than a majority vote of the Trustees, these Bylaws may be amended or repealed or new or additional Bylaws may be adopted only by the vote or written consent of a majority of the Trustees. ARTICLE XIV MISCELLANEOUS Section 14.1. References to Declaration of Trust. All references to the Declaration of Trust shall include any amendments thereto. Section 14.2. Costs and Expenses. In addition to, and as further clarification of each shareholders obligation to indemnify and hold the Trust harmless from and against all costs, 27 expenses, penalties, fines and other amounts, including, without limitation, attorneys and other professional fees, whether third party or internal, arising from such shareholders violation of any provision of the Declaration of Trust or these Bylaws pursuant to Section 8.7 of the Declaration of Trust, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each shareholder will be liable to the Trust for, and indemnify and hold harmless the Trust (and any subsidiaries or affiliates thereof) from and against, all costs, expenses, penalties, fines or other amounts, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys and other professional fees, whether third party or internal, arising from such shareholders breach of any provision of these Bylaws or the Declaration of Trust or any action against the Trust in which such shareholder is not the prevailing party, and shall pay such amounts on demand, together with interest on such amounts, which interest will accrue at the lesser of the Trusts highest marginal borrowing rate, per annum compounded, and the maximum amount permitted by law, from the date such costs or the like are incurred until the receipt of payment. Section 14.3. Ratification. The Board of Trustees or the shareholders may ratify and make binding on the Trust any action or inaction by the Trust or its officers to the extent that the Board of Trustees or the shareholders could have originally authorized the matter. Moreover, any action or inaction questioned in any shareholders derivative proceeding or any other proceeding on the ground of lack of authority, defective or irregular execution, adverse interest of a Trustee, officer or shareholder, non-disclosure, miscomputation, the application of improper principles or practices of accounting, or otherwise, may be ratified, before or after judgment, by the Board of Trustees or by the shareholders and, if so ratified, shall have the same force and effect as if the questioned action or inaction had been originally duly authorized, and such ratification shall be binding upon the Trust and its shareholders and shall constitute a bar to any claim or execution of any judgment in respect of such questioned action or inaction. Section 14.4. Ambiguity. In the case of an ambiguity in the application of any provision of these Bylaws or any definition contained in these Bylaws, the Board of Trustees shall have the sole power to determine the application of such provisions with respect to any situation based on the facts known to it and such determination shall be final and binding unless determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been made in bad faith. Section 14.5. Inspection of Bylaws. The Trustees shall keep at the principal office for the transaction of business of the Trust the original or a copy of the Bylaws as amended or otherwise altered to date, certified by the secretary, which shall be open to inspection by the shareholders at all reasonable times during office hours. Section 14.6. Election to be Subject to Part of Title 3, Subtitle 8. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in the Declaration of Trust or these Bylaws, the Trust hereby elects to be subject to Section 3-804(b) and (c) of Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the Maryland General Corporation Law (or any successor statute). This Section 14.6 only may be repealed, in whole or in part, by a subsequent amendment to these Bylaws. Section 14.7. Special Voting Provisions relating to Control Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein or in the Declaration of Trust or these Bylaws, Title 3, Subtitle 7 of the Maryland General Corporation Law (or any successor statute) shall not apply to any acquisition by any person of shares of beneficial interest of the Trust. This section may be repealed, in whole or in part, at any time, whether before or after an acquisition of control shares 28 and, upon such repeal, may, to the extent provided by any successor bylaw, apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition. 29 EX-8.1 4 a2190821zex-8_1.htm EX-8.1 Exhibit 8.1 March 2, 2009 Senior Housing Properties Trust 400 Centre Street Newton, Massachusetts 02458 Ladies and Gentlemen: The following opinion is furnished to Senior Housing Properties Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust (the Company), to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) as Exhibit 8.1 to the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 (the Form 10-K) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We have acted as counsel for the Company in connection with the preparation of the Form 10-K, and we have reviewed originals or copies of such corporate records, such certificates and statements of officers and accountants of the Company and of public officials, and such other documents as we have considered relevant and necessary in order to furnish the opinion hereinafter set forth. In doing so, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such documents. Specifically, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we have reviewed: (i) the amended and restated declaration of trust and the amended and restated by-laws of the Company, each as amended to date, and in the case of the declaration of trust, as supplemented; and (ii) the sections of Item 1 of the Form 10-K captioned Federal Income Tax Considerations and ERISA Plans, Keogh Plans and Individual Retirement Accounts. The opinion set forth below is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Treasury Regulations issued thereunder, published administrative interpretations thereof, and judicial decisions with respect thereto, all as of the date hereof (collectively, Tax Laws), and upon the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Labor regulations issued thereunder, published administrative interpretations thereof, and judicial decisions with respect thereto, all as of the date hereof (collectively, BOSTON NEW YORK WASHINGTON, DC ERISA Laws). No assurance can be given that Tax Laws or ERISA Laws will not change. In preparing the discussions with respect to Tax Laws matters and ERISA Laws matters in the sections of Item 1 of the Form 10-K captioned Federal Income Tax Considerations and ERISA Plans, Keogh Plans and Individual Retirement Accounts, we have made certain assumptions therein and expressed certain conditions and qualifications therein, all of which assumptions, conditions and qualifications are incorporated herein by reference. With respect to all questions of fact on which our opinion is based, we have assumed the initial and continuing truth, accuracy and completeness of: (i) the information set forth in the Form 10-K and in the documents incorporated therein by reference; and (ii) representations made to us by officers of the Company or contained in the Form 10-K and in the documents incorporated therein by reference, in each such instance without regard to qualifications such as to the best knowledge of or in the belief of. We have not independently verified such information. We have relied upon, but not independently verified, the foregoing assumptions. If any of the foregoing assumptions are inaccurate or incomplete for any reason, or if the transactions described in the Form 10-K or the documents incorporated therein by reference have been consummated in a manner that is inconsistent with the manner contemplated therein, our opinion as expressed below may be adversely affected and may not be relied upon. Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the discussions with respect to Tax Laws matters and ERISA Laws matters in the sections of Item 1 of the Form 10-K captioned Federal Income Tax Considerations and ERISA Plans, Keogh Plans and Individual Retirement Accounts in all material respects are accurate and fairly summarize the Tax Laws issues and the ERISA Laws issues addressed therein, and hereby confirm that the opinions of counsel referred to in said sections represent our opinions on the subject matter thereof. Our opinion above is limited to the matters specifically covered hereby, and we have not been asked to address, nor have we addressed, any other matters or any other transactions. Further, we disclaim any undertaking to advise you of any subsequent changes of the matters stated, represented or assumed herein or any subsequent changes in Tax Laws or ERISA Laws. This opinion is intended solely for the benefit and use of the Company, and is not to be used, released, quoted, or relied upon by anyone else for any purpose (other than as required by law) without our prior written consent. We hereby consent to the filing of a copy of this opinion as an exhibit to the Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference in the Companys Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-135716) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act), and to the references to our firm in the Form 10-K and such Registration Statement. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we come within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act or under the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder.

(e) If, as a result of death, disability, retirement, resignation, removal or otherwise, there shall exist or occur any vacancy with respect to any director previously designated by a Shareholder in accordance with such Shareholders right under this Article II to so designate such director, such Shareholder shall have the right to designate a replacement director. Upon such designation, the Shareholders shall promptly take all action necessary to ensure the election of such replacement director to fill the unexpired term of the director whom such new director is replacing, including, if necessary, calling a special meeting of shareholders of the Company and voting their Shares, or executing any written consent in lieu thereof, in favor of the election of such director. ARTICLE III TRANSFER OF SHARES; PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS; CALL RIGHTS 3.1 Transfer of Shares; No Pledging of Shares. (a) The Shareholders may not, directly or indirectly, transfer any Shares, except that a Shareholder may transfer Shares owned by it to a wholly owned subsidiary of such Shareholder, to another Shareholder or to a wholly owned subsidiary of another Shareholder. Any purported transfer of Shares in contravention of this Section 3.1 shall be null and void and of no force or effect. 3 (b) The Shareholders may not pledge their Shares (other than pledges arising from the operation of law and not as a result of the Shareholders express granting of a pledge); provided, however, that any pledge or other lien, charge or encumbrance which may arise by application of the terms of any agreement, contract, license, permit or instrument existing on the date hereof (an Existing Pledge) on a Shareholders Shares shall not be a violation of this Section 3.1(b); and provided further, however, any transfer which results from exercise of rights under a permitted lien, charge or encumbrance shall be subject to the call rights of the Company and the other Shareholders set forth in Section 3.3 to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and existing contracts as if such a transfer constitutes a Change of Control. Any Shareholder whose Shares would be subject to an Existing Pledge shall use best efforts to cause the pledgee under an Existing Pledge, prior to any exercise by the pledgee of its rights on the Shareholders Shares, to take all actions under applicable law which are required to be taken prior to any such exercise, including obtaining any necessary approvals from the Indiana Department of Insurance and Indiana Insurance Commissioner. 3.2 Preemptive Rights. (a) If, at any time after the date hereof, the Company wishes to issue any capital stock of the Company or any other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock of the Company (collectively, New Securities) to any person or entity (the Subject Purchaser), then the Company shall first offer the Appropriate Percentage (as defined herein) of the New Securities (the Allocated Shares) to each Shareholder (each, a Preemptive Rightholder and collectively, the Preemptive Rightholders) by sending written notice (the New Issuance Notice) to each of the Preemptive Rightholders, which New Issuance Notice shall state the terms of such proposed issuance, including the number of New Securities proposed to be issued and the proposed purchase price per security of the New Securities (the Proposed Price). Upon delivery of the New Issuance Notice, such offer shall be irrevocable unless and until the Company shall have terminated the contemplated issuance of New Securities in its entirety at which time the rights set forth herein shall be applicable to any proposed issuance subsequent to any such termination. For purposes of this Section 3.2, Appropriate Percentage shall mean that percentage of the New Securities determined by dividing (i) the total number of Shares then owned by a Preemptive Rightholder by (ii) the total number of Shares owned by all the Preemptive Rightholders. (b) For a period of 20 days after the giving of the New Issuance Notice pursuant to Section 3.2(a) (the Initial Preemptive Subscription Period), each of the Preemptive Rightholders shall have the right to purchase, in whole or in part, the Allocated Shares offered to such Preemptive Rightholder as determined pursuant to Section 3.2(a) at a purchase price equal to the Proposed Price and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the New Issuance Notice. (c) The right of each Preemptive Rightholder to purchase the New Securities so offered under Section 3.2(b) shall be exercisable by delivering written notice of the exercise thereof, prior to the expiration of the Initial Preemptive Subscription Period, to the Company, which notice shall state the amount of New Securities that such Preemptive Rightholder elects to purchase pursuant to Section 3.2(a). The failure of a Preemptive Rightholder to respond prior to the expiration of the Initial Preemptive Subscription Period shall be deemed to be a waiver of such Preemptive Rightholders rights under this Agreement solely 4 with respect to its right to purchase the New Securities referenced in the New Issuance Notice; provided that each Preemptive Rightholder may waive its rights under Section 3.2(b) prior to the expiration of Initial Preemptive Subscription Period by giving written notice of such waiver to the Company. (d) If as of the expiration of the Initial Preemptive Subscription Period, some but not all of the Preemptive Rightholders have exercised their right to purchase the full amount of New Securities to which they are entitled to purchase pursuant to Sections 3.2(b) and (c) (any such Preemptive Rightholder which has exercised in full its rights to purchase such New Securities, a Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholder), the Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholders shall have the right to purchase, in whole or in part, their Oversubscription Appropriate Percentage (as defined herein) of the New Securities which the Preemptive Rightholders did not exercise their right to purchase pursuant to Sections 3.2(b) and (c) (the Undersubscribed Shares) at a purchase price equal to the Proposed Price and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the New Issuance Notice. The right of the Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholders to purchase the Undersubscribed Shares may be exercised for a period of ten days following the earlier of the expiration of the Initial Preemptive Subscription Period or the date on which notice is given by the Company to such Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholders that all the Preemptive Rightholders have either exercised their right to purchase the New Securities pursuant to Sections 3.2(b) and (c) or waived their rights to purchase any of such New Securities pursuant to Section 3.2(c) (the Oversubscription Period). For purposes of this Section 3.2, Oversubscription Appropriate Percentage shall mean that percentage of the Undersubscribed Shares determined by dividing (i) the total number of Shares then owned by a Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholder by (ii) the total number of Shares owned by all the Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholders. (e) The right of each Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholder to purchase Undersubscribed Shares pursuant to Section 3.2(d) shall be exercisable by delivering written notice of the exercise thereof, prior to the expiration of the Oversubscription Period, to the Company, which notice shall state the amount of Undersubscribed Shares that such Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholder elects to purchase pursuant to Section 3.2(d). The failure of a Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholder to respond prior to the expiration of the Oversubscription Period shall be deemed to be a waiver of such Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholders rights under this Agreement solely with respect to its right to purchase the Undersubscribed Shares included in the New Securities referenced in the New Issuance Notice; provided that each Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholder may waive its rights under Section 3.2(d) prior to the expiration of Oversubscription Period by giving written notice of such waiver to the Company. (f) The closing of the purchase of New Securities subscribed for by the Preemptive Rightholders, including the Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholders, pursuant to this Section 3.2 shall be held at such time and place as the parties to the transaction may reasonably agree. At such closing, the New Securities subscribed for shall be issued by the Company free and clear of all liens, charges or encumbrances (other than those arising hereunder and those attributable to actions by the purchasers thereof). Each Preemptive Rightholder, including each Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholder, purchasing the New Securities shall deliver at the closing payment in full in immediately available funds for the New Securities 5 purchased by it. At such closing, all of the parties to the transaction shall execute such additional documents as are otherwise necessary, appropriate or customary for similar financing transactions. If any Preemptive Rightholder, including any Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholder, fails to purchase any New Securities for which it exercised its right to purchase pursuant to Sections 3.2(b) and (c) or 3.2(d) and (e), such New Securities may be purchased by the Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholders which did purchase all the New Securities for which they exercised their rights to purchase pursuant to Sections 3.2(b), (c), (d) and (e) in the same manner provided in this Section 3.2 with respect to Undersubscribed Shares and the resulting Oversubscription Period with respect to such right to purchase shall be an Oversubscription Period for all instances such term is used in this Section 3.2. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the obligations and liability of any Preemptive Rightholder, including any Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholder, which fails to purchase any New Securities for which it exercised its right to purchase pursuant to Sections 3.2(b) and (c) or 3.2(d) and (e) shall not be relieved as a result of any Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholders right to purchase, or any actual purchase by any Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholder of, any such New Securities. (g) Following the expiration of the later of the Initial Preemptive Subscription Period and, if applicable, the Oversubscription Period, if the Preemptive Rightholders, including any Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholders, did not exercise their right to purchase any of the New Securities, including the Undersubscribed Shares, which were originally the subject of the New Issuance Notice, then the Company may sell the remaining New Securities to the Subject Purchaser on terms and conditions that are no more favorable to the Subject Purchaser than those set forth in the New Issuance Notice; provided, however, that such sale is bona fide and made pursuant to a contract entered into between the Company and the Subject Purchaser and that such sale is consummated by not later than 90 days following the earlier to occur of (i) receipt by the Company of written waivers pursuant to Section 3.2(c) from all the Preemptive Rightholders of their rights to purchase the Appropriate Percentage of New Securities and, if applicable, written waivers pursuant to Section 3.2(e) from all the Fully Exercising Preemptive Rightholders of their rights to purchase the Oversubscription Appropriate Percentage of New Securities, and (ii) the expiration of the Oversubscription Period, if applicable, and if not applicable, the expiration of the Initial Preemptive Subscription Period. If the sale of any of the New Securities is not consummated by the expiration of such 90 day period, then the preemptive rights afforded to the Shareholders under this Section 3.2 shall again become effective, and no issuance and sale of New Securities may be made thereafter by the Company without again offering the same in accordance with this Section 3.2. 3.3 Change of Control Call Option. (a) By not later than five days following a Change of Control (as defined herein or in Section 3.1(b)) of any Shareholder, such Shareholder shall give the Company and each other Shareholder notice of such Change of Control and shall disclose the number of Shares and any other securities of the Company which were owned by the Shareholder as of immediately prior to such Change of Control of such Shareholder (the Change of Control Securities). If the Shareholder fails to give the notice required by the preceding sentence by the time required thereby, and another Shareholder or the Company is or becomes aware that such Shareholder underwent a Change of Control, then (i) if it is a 6 Shareholder that is or becomes aware of such Change of Control, that Shareholder shall reasonably promptly inform the Company of such Change of Control and upon the Company being of the reasonable belief that such a Change of Control has occurred, the Company shall reasonably promptly provide the notice to the Shareholders that such Shareholder which underwent the Change of Control failed to provide, or (ii) if it is the Company that is or becomes aware of such Change of Control, the Company shall reasonably promptly provide the notice that such Shareholder which underwent the Change of Control failed to provide. Any liability of a Shareholder which undergoes a Change of Control for failure to give the notice required by the first sentence of this Section 3.3(a) shall not be relieved as a result of the Company or any other Shareholder being obligated to give, or giving, the notice required by the second sentence of this Section 3.3(a). (b) For a period of 20 days following the receipt of a notice given pursuant to Section 3.3(a), the Company shall have the right to purchase from such Shareholder (or its successor, as applicable), in whole or in part, the Change of Control Securities. The purchase price for the Change of Control Securities shall be the book value, as determined in accordance with the statutory accounting principles applicable to the Company, of the Change of Control Securities as of the time such Shareholder underwent the Change of Control (the Call Option Purchase Price). To exercise its right to purchase the Change of Control Securities, the Company shall deliver written notice of such exercise to the Shareholder which underwent the Change of Control and the other Shareholders prior to the expiration of such 20 day call exercise period. The closing for any such exercised call option shall occur on the fifth business day (or such longer period as may be required by applicable law or in order to obtain applicable regulatory approval) following receipt of the Companys notice of exercise of its call option by the Shareholder which underwent the Change of Control, or on such other date as may be agreed by the Company and such Shareholder. At its option, the Company may pay in cash the entire amount of the Call Option Purchase Price at such closing or it may elect to defer any amount of the Call Option Purchase Price. Any amounts so deferred shall bear interest at the Deferred Interest Rate (as defined herein). The Company may pay any such deferred amounts and accrued interest thereon at any time and from time to time; provided, however, that all such deferred amounts and accrued but unpaid interest, shall be due and payable on the fifth anniversary of the closing of the applicable call option exercise. (c) Shareholders other than the Shareholder which underwent the Change of Control shall have the right to purchase, in whole or in part, any Change of Control Securities not elected to be purchased by the Company pursuant to Section 3.3(b) at a price equal to the Call Option Purchase Price. To exercise its right to purchase the Change of Control Securities, the applicable Shareholder shall deliver written notice of such exercise to the Shareholder which underwent the Change of Control, the Company and the other Shareholders by not later than the 20 days following the earlier of (i) the expiration of the 20 day period during which the Company has the right to exercise its call option for the Change of Control Securities pursuant to Section 3.3(b) and (ii) the date the Company waives its right to purchase such Change of Control Securities and has given notice of the same to all the Shareholders (such deadline for exercising a right to purchase Change of Control Securities referred to as the Call Option Exercise Deadline). The notice of exercise shall indicate the number of Change of Control Securities that the Shareholder seeks to purchase. If the aggregate number of Change of Control Securities sought to be purchased by the exercising Shareholders (determined by adding 7 all the eligible securities each Shareholder states it seeks to purchase in its notice of exercise) exceeds the actual number of Change of Control Securities eligible for purchase, the number of Change of Control Securities which may be purchased by a particular applicable Shareholder shall be reduced by an amount equal to the product of the aggregate number of such excess Change of Control Securities sought to be purchased by all the exercising Shareholders multiplied by the quotient of (x) the number of Shares owned by all eligible Shareholders which are exercising their call option rights minus the number of Shares owned by the particular applicable exercising Shareholder divided by (y) the number of Shares owned by all eligible Shareholders which are exercising their call option rights, with any such result rounded up or down to the nearest whole share as reasonably determined by the Company. The closing of any such exercised call option shall occur on the fifth business day (or such longer period as may be required by applicable law or in order to obtain applicable regulatory approval) following the Call Option Exercise Deadline, or on such other date as may be agreed by the exercising Shareholder, the Company and the Shareholder which underwent the Change of Control. At its option, the exercising Shareholder may pay in cash the entire amount of the Call Option Purchase Price at such closing or it may elect to defer any amount of the Call Option Purchase Price. Any amounts so deferred shall bear interest at the Deferred Interest Rate. The exercising Shareholder may pay any such deferred amounts and accrued interest thereon at any time and from time to time; provided, however, that all such deferred amounts and accrued but unpaid interest, shall be due and payable on the fifth anniversary of the closing of the applicable call option exercise.
