BUSINESS The Gymboree Corporation is a specialty retailer operating stores selling high quality apparel and accessories for children under the GYMBOREE® and JANIE AND JACK® brands, as well as play programs for children under the GYMBOREE PLAY & MUSIC® brand. The Company operates retail stores in the United States and Canada, primarily in regional shopping malls and in selected suburban and urban locations. All references to we, our, us, and the Company in this Annual Report mean The Gymboree Corporation and its subsidiaries. GENERAL As of February 3, 2007, the Company conducted its business through four primary divisions: Gymboree, Gymboree Outlet, Janie and Jack, and Gymboree Play & Music. Gymboree: Gymboree stores offer high quality, fashionable, child-appropriate apparel and accessories characterized by bright colors, patterns and whimsical graphics, complex embellishments, comfort, functionality, and durability for children sizes preemie through 12. As of February 3, 2007, we operated 575 Gymboree stores, including 547 stores in the United States and 28 stores in Canada, as well as an on-line store at www.gymboree.com. Gymboree Outlet: Gymboree Outlet stores provide our customers with high quality childrens apparel and accessories in the same size ranges as traditional Gymboree stores but at outlet prices. The majority of our Gymboree Outlet product is developed and manufactured exclusively for the Gymboree Outlet stores. As of February 3, 2007, we operated 42 Gymboree Outlet stores. Janie and Jack: Janie and Jack shops are highly differentiated from Gymboree stores. Janie and Jack shops offer distinctive, finely crafted clothing and accessories for boys and girls sizes preemie through 5T. Lush fabrics, a hand-made quality and details such as hand-embroidery, smocking and vintage prints are utilized to create classic looks. Shops have an old mercantile boutique style with special details such as wainscoting and distressed wooden armoires. As of February 3, 2007, we operated 81 Janie and Jack shops in the United States, as well as an on-line shop at www.janieandjack.com. 3 Table of Contents Gymboree Play & Music. Gymboree Play & Music offers children ages newborn to 5 years the opportunity to explore, learn, play and have fun in an innovative parent-child program. Gymboree Play & Music offers an array of classes developed by early childhood experts, as well as birthday parties and developmental toys, books and music. As of February 3, 2007, Gymboree Play & Music programs included 3 Company-operated play centers in California and 545 franchisee-operated play centers, of which approximately 52% are located in the United States, and the remaining 48% are located in 29 other countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, France, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and the United Kingdom. On October 4, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to proceed with the closure of its womens division (Janeville, 17 stores), as a result of the divisions inability to achieve the level of financial performance expected by management and the desire to focus existing resources on other opportunities. All Janeville stores were closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Gymboree was organized in October 1979 as a California corporation and re-incorporated as a Delaware corporation in June 1992. RETAIL STORES As of February 3, 2007, the Company operated a total of 698 retail stores, including 670 stores in the United States (547 Gymboree stores, 42 Gymboree Outlet stores, and 81 Janie and Jack shops) and 28 stores in Canada. The Company also operates two on-line stores at www.gymboree.com and www.janieandjack.com. In 2006, the Company opened 17 Gymboree stores, 29 Gymboree Outlet stores, and 17 Janie and Jack shops in the United States. The Company also relocated or remodeled 39 Gymboree stores, closed 7 Gymboree stores, and closed all 17 Janeville stores in the United States (see Note 3 to Consolidated Financial Statements). During 2007, the Company plans to open approximately 20 new Gymboree stores (16 in the United States and 4 in Canada), 45 new Gymboree Outlet stores, 15 new Janie and Jack shops, and a minimum of 10 stores in a new concept in the childrens apparel space. The Company also plans to remodel, relocate or expand approximately 64 Gymboree stores. The Gymboree on-line store at www.gymboree.com offers the entire Gymboree product offering for children between the sizes of preemie through 12. The site also offers on-line registration for Gymboree Play & Music classes at selected U.S. locations. The Janie and Jack on-line store at www.janieandjack.com, offers the entire Janie and Jack product offering for children sizes preemie through 5T. The Company fully integrates its on-line stores and retail stores in determining pricing and promotional strategies. Less than 5% of the Companys revenues were derived from outside the United States in 2006, 2005 and 2004, and less than 5% of the Companys long-lived assets were located outside the United States in 2006, 2005 and 2004. SUPPLIERS The majority of our apparel is manufactured to our specifications by approximately 120 independent manufacturers in Asia, as well as in the United States, Central America, the Middle East, and South America. The Company purchases all products in U.S. dollars. One buying agent manages approximately 95% of our inventory purchases. We have no long-term contracts with suppliers and typically transact business on an order-by-order basis. All of our factories undergo annual audits for social accountability by an independent third party. In addition, all product undergoes a quality audit performed by independent third parties. 4 Table of Contents SEASONALITY AND COMPETITION The Companys operations are seasonal in nature, with sales from our retail operations peaking during the fourth quarter, primarily during the holiday season in November and December. During fiscal 2006, the fourth quarter accounted for approximately 30% of our net sales from retail operations. Our Gymboree and Janie and Jack brands compete on a national level with BabyGap and GapKids (divisions of The Gap, Inc.), Talbots Kids and certain leading department stores operating in malls, outlet centers or street locations, as well as certain discount retail chains such as Old Navy (a division of The Gap, Inc.), The Childrens Place, Wal-Mart and Target. Our Gymboree and Janie and Jack brands also compete with a wide variety of local and regional specialty stores, with certain other retail chains, and with childrens retailers that sell their products by mail order, over the Internet or through outlet malls. The principal factors of competition for retail sales are product design, product quality, brand image, customer service and pricing. Our goal is to provide our customers with high quality apparel with an excellent price/value relationship. We design and produce our apparel exclusively for sale at our retail and on-line stores. TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS In the United States, the Company is the owner of the trademarks and service marks GYMBOREE, JANIE AND JACK, and GYMBOREE PLAY & MUSIC, and the trademarks GYMBO and GYMBUCKS. These marks and certain other of our marks are registered in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The mark GYMBOREE is also registered, or is the subject of pending applications, in approximately 80 foreign countries. Each federal registration is renewable indefinitely if the mark is still in use at the time of renewal. Our rights in the GYMBOREE and JANIE AND JACK marks and other marks are a significant part of our business. Accordingly, we intend to maintain the marks and the related registrations. We are not aware of any material claims of infringement or other challenges to our right to use the GYMBOREE and JANIE AND JACK marks in the United States. The Company uses a number of other trademarks, certain of which have been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in certain foreign countries. We believe that our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and that some of our trademarks are instrumental to our ability to both market our products and create and sustain demand for our products. TEAM MEMBERS As of February 3, 2007, the Company had approximately 9,500 full-time and part-time employees or 4,300 full-time equivalents. In addition, a significant number of seasonal employees are hired during each holiday selling season. None of the Companys employees are represented by a labor union. SEGMENT AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION Financial information for the Companys two segments, retail stores and Gymboree Play & Music, and for its international subsidiary for each of the three years ended February 3, 2007, January 28, 2006, and January 29, 2005, is contained in Note 10 to Consolidated Financial Statements.

RISK FACTORS We may not be able to continue our current level of sales and earnings growth, which could cause the market price for our common stock to decline. During the past year, we realized substantial growth in both sales and earnings. Many factors have historically affected, and will continue to affect, our rate of growth and performance. We expect that future increases in net sales and net income will be dependent on, among other factors, our ability to attract new customers through strategies such as direct mail campaigns and cross-brand marketing; maintain existing customers longer in the core Gymboree division through appropriate size expansions; continue to reduce product costs while maintaining high quality standards; and expand our two newer growth concepts, Janie and Jack and Gymboree Outlet. Other factors that could impact our sales and earnings growth are discussed below in this section. There can be no assurance that we will be able to grow our sales or continue the earnings performance that we have recently experienced. Additionally, any decline in our future growth or our rate of growth in sales or earnings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Our results may be adversely affected by our failure to anticipate and respond to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. Our sales and profitability depend upon the continued demand by customers for our apparel and accessories. We believe that our success depends in large part upon our ability to anticipate, gauge and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demands and fashion trends and upon the appeal of our products. There can be no assurance that the demand for our apparel or accessories will not decline or that we will be able to anticipate, gauge and respond to changes in fashion trends. In addition, since much of the Companys inventory is sourced from vendors located outside the United States, the Company usually must order merchandise, and enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of such merchandise, up to nine months in advance of the applicable selling season and frequently before trends are known. A decline in demand for our apparel and accessories or a misjudgment of fashion trends could, among other things, lead to lower sales, excess inventories and higher markdowns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Competition and the strength of our competitors may impair our ability to maintain and grow our sales and adversely affect our operating results. The apparel segment of the specialty retail industry is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete successfully in the future. The principal factors of competition for retail sales are product design, product quality, brand image, customer service and pricing. Our Gymboree and Janie and Jack brands compete on a national level with BabyGap and GapKids (divisions of The Gap, Inc.), Talbots Kids and certain leading department stores operating in malls, outlet centers or street locations, as well as certain discount retail chains such as Old Navy (a division of The Gap, Inc.), The Childrens Place, Wal-Mart and Target. Our Gymboree and Janie and Jack brands also compete with a wide variety of local and regional specialty stores, with certain other retail chains, and with childrens retailers that sell their products by mail order, over the Internet or through outlet malls. Many of these competitors are larger than the Company and have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources. Increased competition may reduce sales and gross margins, increase operating expenses and decrease profit margins. 7 Table of Contents We may not be able to operate successfully if we lose key personnel, are unable to hire qualified additional personnel, or experience turnover of our management team. The continued success of the Company is largely dependent on the individual efforts and abilities of our senior management team and certain other key personnel and on our ability to retain current management and to attract and retain qualified key personnel in the future. The loss of certain key employees or our inability to continue to attract and retain other qualified key employees could have a material adverse effect on our growth, operations and financial position. Our new concepts and businesses require a substantial commitment of resources and are not certain of ultimate success. The Companys ongoing efforts to develop, launch and grow new divisions, businesses and brands require significant capital expenditures and management attention. Our commitment of management resources and capital to a new concept means that those resources and capital are unavailable for other Company activities and operations. Our decision to launch a new business is based on our assessment that a significant opportunity exists in the marketplace. The Company has opened new businesses in the past that were ultimately unsuccessful such as the Janeville division, which the Company closed in fiscal 2006. There can be no assurance that new business concepts the Company opens in the future will be successful, and the incurrence of expenses in the launch of new business concepts that do not ultimately succeed could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. Our business may be harmed by additional United States regulation of foreign trade or delays caused by additional United States customs requirements. Our business is subject to the risk that the United States may adopt additional regulations relating to imported apparel products, including quotas, duties, taxes and other charges or restrictions on imported apparel. We cannot predict whether additional United States quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions will be imposed upon the importation of our products in the future, or what effect any such actions would have on our business, financial position and results of operations. If the United States government imposes any such charges or restrictions, the supply of products could be disrupted and their cost could substantially increase, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Unforeseen delays in customs clearance of any goods could have a material adverse effect on our ability to deliver complete shipments to our stores in a timely manner, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Because we purchase our products internationally, our business is sensitive to risks associated with international business. Our products are currently manufactured to our specifications by independent factories located primarily in Asia, Central America, the Middle East, and South America. As a result, our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as foreign governmental regulations, currency fluctuations, adverse conditions including epidemics, natural disasters, social or political unrest, disruptions or delays in transportation or customs clearance, local business practices and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our suppliers are located. We cannot predict the effect of such factors on our business relationships with foreign suppliers or on our ability to deliver products into our stores in a timely manner. If even a small portion of our current foreign manufacturing sources or textile mills were to cease doing business with us for any reason, such actions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. In addition, the Company is currently pursuing strategies with the goal of reducing product costs. These strategies may result in sourcing product from factories from which we have not previously purchased products and which may be in countries in which we have not done business before. These efforts could result in greater risk to timely deliveries and quality control. We must timely and effectively deliver merchandise to our stores and customers. We cannot control all of the various factors that might affect our fulfillment rates for on-line sales and timely and effective merchandise delivery to our stores. We rely upon third party carriers for our merchandise 8 Table of Contents shipments to and from stores and reliable data regarding the timing of those shipments and we also rely upon a third party distribution facility for merchandise fulfillment to our Canadian stores. In addition, we are heavily dependent upon two carriers for the delivery of our merchandise to our customers. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activity, inclement weather, natural disasters, and possible acts of terrorism associated with such carriers ability to provide delivery services to meet our shipping needs. Failure to deliver merchandise in a timely and effective manner could damage our reputation and sales. We may suffer negative publicity if any of our products are found to be unsafe. We currently test Gymboree branded products sold in our stores and at our Play & Music sites. We have in the past and may in the future need to recall products that we later determine may present safety issues. If these products have safety problems of which we are not aware, or if the Consumer Product Safety Commission recalls a product sold in our stores, we could experience negative publicity and product liability lawsuits, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial position. We may be subject to negative publicity or be sued if our manufacturers violate labor laws or engage in practices that our customers believe are unethical. We require our independent manufacturers to operate their businesses in compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to them. Our sourcing personnel periodically visit and monitor the operations of our independent manufacturers, but we cannot control their business and labor practices. We also rely on an independent third party to audit all of our factories on an annual basis. If an independent manufacturer violates or is suspected of violating labor laws or other applicable regulations, or if a manufacturer engages in labor or other practices that diverge from those typically acceptable in the United States, Canada or Europe, we could in turn experience negative publicity or be sued. Negative publicity or legal actions regarding the production of our products could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, sales, business and financial position. The loss of a key buying agent could disrupt our ability to deliver our inventory supply in a timely fashion, impacting its value. In 2006 and 2005, one buying agent managed approximately 95% and 94% of the Companys inventory purchases, respectively. Although we believe that other buying agents could be identified and retained to place our required foreign production, the loss of this buying agent could result in delays in procuring inventory which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Changes in economic conditions that impact consumer spending could harm our business. Our financial performance is sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending, particularly discretionary spending. Future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions, interest rates, and tax rates could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to other products. A general reduction in the level of discretionary spending or shifts in consumer discretionary spending to other products could have a material adverse effect on our growth, sales and profitability. Changes in seasonal consumer spending patterns that are beyond our control could harm our business. Historically, a disproportionate amount of our retail sales and a significant portion of our net income have been realized during the holiday season in November and December. We have also experienced periods of increased sales activity in the early spring, during the period leading up to the Easter holiday, and in the early fall, in connection with back-to-school sales. In fiscal 2006, we generated net income in the second quarter, however, we have historically generated net losses during the second quarter and could generate such losses in the future due to seasonal consumer spending patterns. Changes in seasonal consumer spending patterns for 9 Table of Contents reasons beyond our control could result in lower-than-expected sales during these periods. Such a circumstance could cause us to have excess inventory, necessitating markdowns to dispose of these excess inventories, which would reduce our profitability. Any failure by us to meet our business plans for, in particular, the third or fourth quarter of any fiscal year would have a material adverse effect on our earnings, which in all likelihood would not be offset by satisfactory results achieved in other quarters of the same fiscal year. Also, because we typically spend more in labor costs during the holiday season to hire temporary store employees in anticipation of holiday spending, a shortfall in expected sales during that period could result in a disproportionate decrease in our net income. Our ability to successfully implement significant information technology systems is critical to our business. In the coming year, we plan to undertake a series of initiatives to upgrade our information technology infrastructure. These initiatives include a program to upgrade our point-of-sale and sales audit systems, implement a new customer relationship management system, and continue to support and enhance functionality for the Companys websites. Such technology systems changes are complex and could cause disruptions that would adversely affect our business. While management will make every effort to ensure the orderly implementation of various information technology systems, we cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully execute these changes without potentially incurring a significant disruption to our business. If we are not successful, we may not achieve the expected benefits from these initiatives, despite having expended significant capital. We may also determine that additional investment is required to bring our systems to their desired state; this could result in a significant additional investment of time and money and increased implementation risk. Furthermore, the Company intends to rely on third parties to fulfill contractual obligations related to the upgrade of these systems. Failure of these third parties to fulfill their contractual obligations could lead to significant expenses or losses due to a disruption in business operations. Our business may be harmed if our computer network security is compromised. Despite the Companys considerable efforts and technology to secure our computer network, security could be compromised, confidential information, such as customer credit card numbers, could be misappropriated, or system disruptions could occur. This could lead to adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, or cause the Company to incur significant costs to reimburse third parties for damages which could impact profits. The Company is currently in the process of upgrading its systems and procedures to meet the Payment Card Industry (PCI) data security standards. The Companys compliance with these standards is required to undergo audits by independent third parties. Failure to comply with the security requirements or rectify a security issue may result in fines and the imposition of restrictions on the Companys ability to accept payment cards. There can be no assurance that the Company will satisfy audit requirements. Damage to our computer systems could severely hamper our ability to manage our business. Our operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our computer systems on which we rely to manage our purchase orders, store inventory levels, web applications, accounting functions and other aspects of our business. We have computer systems located in each of our stores, with the main database servers for our systems located in San Francisco, California, which exists on or near known earthquake fault zones. An earthquake or similar disaster could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results not only by damaging our stores or corporate headquarters, but also by damaging our main servers, which could disrupt our business for an indeterminate length of time. Our systems are vulnerable to damage from fire, floods, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, and similar events. Our failure to successfully manage our on-line businesses could have a negative impact on our business. The operation of our on-line businesses depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our order-taking and fulfillment operations and our on-line stores. Disruptions or slowdowns in these areas could result from disruptions in telephone service or power outages, inadequate system capacity, 10 Table of Contents system issues, computer viruses, security breaches, human error, changes in programming, natural disasters or adverse weather conditions. Our on-line businesses are vulnerable to additional risks and uncertainties associated with the Internet, including changes in required technology and other technical failures as well as changes in applicable federal and state regulation, security breaches, and consumer privacy concerns. Problems in any of these areas could result in a reduction in sales, increased selling, general and administrative expenses and damage to our reputation and brands. In addition, we face the risk that we cannot hire enough qualified employees, or that there will be a disruption in the labor we hire from third party providers, especially during our peak season, to support our on-line operations, due to circumstances that reduce the available workforce. The need to operate with fewer employees could negatively impact our customer service levels and our operations. Our growth will be hampered if we are unable to locate new stores and relocate existing stores in appropriate retail venues and shopping areas. Our stores must be located in appropriate retail spaces in areas with demographic characteristics consistent with our customer base. These locations tend to be limited to upscale malls and similar venues where the market for available space is very competitive. The location of acceptable store sites and the negotiation of acceptable lease arrangements require considerable time, effort and expense. Our ability to lease desirable retail space for expansion and relocation of stores, and to renew our existing store leases, on favorable economic terms is essential to our revenue and earnings growth. Approximately 130, 100, and 40 store leases will come up for renewal during fiscal 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. We are also in the process of negotiating lease terms for approximately 80 stores, which are currently operating under month-to-month terms. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve its store expansion goals, effectively manage its growth, successfully integrate the planned new stores into its operations, or profitably operate its new and remodeled stores. Failure to obtain and renew leases for a sufficient number of stores on acceptable terms would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. Our growth will be hampered if we are unable to successfully open new stores. The Company plans to open approximately 90 new stores in fiscal 2007, which is a significant increase from 63 new stores in fiscal 2006 and 28 new stores in fiscal 2005. Our growth depends in large part on our ability to successfully open new stores, which in turn is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to hire and train skilled store operating and management teams and our ability to complete construction within planned timelines and budgets. There can be no assurance that the Company will successfully open the number of stores planned for fiscal 2007, and the resulting impact on our growth rate could cause the market price for our common stock to decline. Our comparable store sales fluctuate over time, which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Our comparable store sales have fluctuated significantly in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future. Our comparable store sales are affected by a number of factors including our merchandise assortment, economic conditions, weather conditions, timing of our promotional offerings, competition, and the overall retail environment. The investment community often tracks comparable store sales and a decline or significant fluctuation in comparable store sales, or a failure to meet investor expectations of comparable store sales, could materially affect the market price of our common stock. Failure of internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally 11 Table of Contents accepted in the United States. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the Companys transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of the Companys assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the Companys financial statements would be prevented or detected. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the Companys ability to accurately and timely report its financial results or to detect and prevent fraud. Our operating and financial performance in any given period might not meet the extensive guidance that we have provided to the public. We provide extensive public guidance on our expected operating and financial results for future periods. Although we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of managements expectations for the future, and is useful to our shareholders and potential shareholders, such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. Our guidance may not always be accurate. If in the future our operating or financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts, or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock could significantly decline. We may experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate. We are subject to income taxes in many United States and Canadian jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which include reserves for estimates of probable settlements of foreign and domestic tax audits. At any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may impact the ultimate settlement of these issues. As a result, we expect that there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as taxable events occur and exposures are re-evaluated. Further, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings. We may be a party to legal proceedings that could result in unexpected outcomes. From time to time, we are a party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, there are an increasing number of cases being filed against companies generally, which contain class action allegations under federal and state wage and hour laws. We evaluate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish reserves for the estimated liabilities in accordance with GAAP. Assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties. Although not currently anticipated by management, unexpected outcomes in these legal proceedings, or changes in managements evaluations or predictions, could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.
