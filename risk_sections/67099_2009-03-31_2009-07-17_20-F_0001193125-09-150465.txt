Risk Factors. With respect to oil and gas exploration, development and production (E&P) business, it is important to maintain or increase oil and gas reserves as is the case for major oil and gas companies, and Mitsuis Energy Segment is also aiming for increasing its reserves by expanding current projects and investing to new opportunities. Although our reserve is less than those of major oil and gas companies in the world, its volume can be ranked as a top level company among the Japanese oil and gas companies. 39 Table of Contents The following tables provide information on our investments in coal resource projects undertaken by the Energy Segment.

(2) In addition to the above-mentioned coal mining projects, through Mitsui Coal Holdings Pty. Ltd., we have small interests in two projects in Australia operated by Anglo American, namely, Moranbah North Joint Venture in Queensland and Drayton Joint Venture in New South Wales. Our ownership percentage and annual production capacity of Moranbah North Joint Venture and Drayton Joint Venture are 4.75%, 4 million tons and 3.83%, 5 million tons, respectively. Currently the above mentioned joint ventures are forced to experience production adjustments due to recession of the world economy as well as reductions in crude steel production by steel manufacturers. On the other hand, in the medium and long term, demands of both thermal coal and metallurgical coal are expected to increase along with economic growth of Asian countries including India and China. In response to such increasing global demand, we continue to make proactive capital investments to expand the capacities of the existing projects, and our equity production tonnage is expected to be increasing after this fiscal year onward. Regarding further information and discussion on development of our coal mining projects, see Item 4.A. History and Development of the CompanyCapital Expenditure, Item 5.A. Operating ResultsOperating Results by Operating SegmentEnergy Segment and Item 5.B. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesInvestment Plans and Financial Policies of the Medium Term Management Outlook. Revenues from oil and gas producing activities and coal mining activities (based on US GAAP) account for a critical portion of this segment.

IRON ORE Name of Joint Venture Entity by which Mitsui Participates in the Mining Activity and its Ownership Interest Area of Mining Operation (Region, State, Country) Robe River Iron Associates Mitsui Iron Ore Development Pty. Ltd. (33%) Pilbara Region, Western Australia, Australia Mesa J The development of the Robe River project began in 1962(*) near Pannawonica. The Robe River project was commissioned and the first shipment was made in 1972. Iron ore reserves at the Mesa J production Base provide the cornerstone of Pannawonicas sinter fines and lump output. Development of Mesa J began in 1992, and all mine administration, workshops, warehousing and other support facilities were integrated there in 1994. The mine produces Rove River fines and lump, which are pisolitic iron ore products. Process Plant 1 was commissioned in 1999 and Process Plant 2 in 2001. The plant processes clay-contaminated pisolite, sub-grade material which was once discarded, to reduce contaminants and retain on-specification ore. In December 2007, the joint venture decided to develop Mesa A / Warramboo mine which will have a full scale capacity of 25 million tons per annum and is expected to start production in 2010. The total capital cost will be estimated at US$901 million. The total mine life of Mesa A is expected to be 11 years. With this addition, total production of Robe Valley pisolite ore will be maintained at 32 million tons per annum. West Angelas The development of West Angelas began in 1998. Mining of ore commenced in March 2002. The West Angelas deposits contain Marra Mamba type iron ore with higher iron content than Robe Rivers Mesa J mine. The West Angelas operation is comprised of an open pit mine, a crushing and screening ore processing plant producing lump and sinter fines iron ore, as well as stockpiling, reclaiming and train-loading facilities. Further expansion of the West Angelas mine was completed in October 2005. This US$105 million project took the mines production capacity to 25 million tons per year. Robe River Iron Associates uses a dedicated rail system, operated by Pilbara Iron, to transport ore from its mines to the companys deepwater port facilities at Cape Lambert. Also, a US$200 million rail expansion project to duplicate almost 100 kilometers of track and associated interconnection and infrastructure to increase the capacity of the Pilbara Iron main line was completed in the first quarter of 2006. A further expansion plan to increase port capacity at Cape Lambert from nameplate capacity of 55 to 80 million tones per year was completed in November 2008, ahead of time with the total capital cost of US$860 million. Progressive capacity will ramp up in the first half of 2009. (*) The Robe River project was originally started by Cleveland Cliffs Iron Company, an iron and steel producer in the United States. Since then, there were major changes in ownership before Rio Tinto took a 53% stake in Robe River Iron Associates in 2000. Mt. Newman Joint Venture Mitsui Itochu Iron Pty. Ltd. (10%) (Mitsui share of Mitsui Itochu Iron Pty. Ltd. is 70%) Pilbara Region, Western Australia, Australia Mt. Whaleback The joint venture began production in 1969 at the Mt. Whaleback ore body. Today, production continues to be sourced from the major Mt. Whaleback ore body and is complemented by production from other ore bodies, namely Orebody 18, 23, 25, 29 and 30 and Jimblebar, which we are involved in through the Wheelarra arrangement with BHP Iron Ore (Jimblebar) Pty Ltd, Itochu Minerals & Energy Australia Pty Ltd, and 4 Chinese steel companies. The facilities at Mt. Whaleback include primary and secondary crushing plants with a nominal capacity of 35 million tons of product per year, a heavy media beneficiation plant with an annual capacity of 8 million tons and a train-loading facility. An additional primary and secondary crushing plant is present at Orebody 25 with a nominal capacity of 8 million tons of product per year. A crusher and train-loading facility are also located at Orebody 18. 65 Table of Contents Yandi Joint Venture Mitsui Iron Ore Development Pty. Ltd. (7%) Pilbara Region, Western Australia, Australia Marillana Creek Development of the ore body began in 1991 and the projects first shipment of iron ore was in March 1992. Capacity was progressively expanded between 1994 and 2003 and the current capacity is 42 million tons per annum. Two processing plants and a primary crusher and overland conveyor are used to crush and screen the Yandi ore and deliver it to one of two train loading facilities. Mt. Goldsworthy Joint Venture Mitsui Iron Ore Development Pty. Ltd. (7%) Pilbara Region, Western Australia, Australia Northern (Yarrie) (Nimingarra) Mt. Goldsworthy was commissioned in 1966 in the North Area. The original Goldsworthy mine was closed in 1982 and mining operations ceased at Shay Gap mine in 1993. Since then, mining has continued from the adjacent Nimingarra and Yarrie, 30 kilometers to the south-east. The primary crushers at Yarrie and Nimingarra, with a combined capacity of 8 million tons of products per year, have been placed into care and maintenance. Yarrie is currently using mobile in-pit crushing plant at a rate of 2 million tons of products per year. The ore is crushed and then railed to Port Hedland. Area C In October 2003, the joint venture opened the new Area C mine located 120 kilometers north-west of Newman, which produces Brockman ore and Marra Mamba ore deposits, which are sold under the trademark MAC. An ore processing plant, primary crusher and overland conveyor are located at Area C with a capacity of 42 million tons of products per year. All production from the Mt. Goldsworthy Northern (Yarrie and Nimingarra) is transported on a separate railway to Port Hedland. Ore from Area C is transported via a 39 kilometer new section of railway to the Yandi mine which then connects to the Newman main line to Port Hedland. Development projects at joint ventures with BHP Billiton Ltd. The three joint ventures, namely, Mt. Newman joint venture, Yandi joint venture and Mt. Goldsworthy joint venture have been planning for staged expansions of supply capacity. As a step, in October 2005 they approved the Rapid Growth Project 3 (RPG3) to add 20 million tons per annum to their capacity, upgrading combined capacity to 129 million tons per annum by 2007. The capital expenditure for the expansion work totaled A$2.2 billion (Mitsuis share was approximately A$150 million). The expansion focused mainly on the Area C mine and encompassed expansions of rail systems and the loading port, including the rebuilding of the C berth at Finucane Island. RGP3 was completed by 2008. In addition, in March 2007, the joint ventures approved the Rapid Growth Project 4 (RGP4) to increase annual production capacity to 155 million tons per annum by early 2010. The capital expenditure for the expansion will total approximately A$2.7 billion. The expansion includes development of a new crushing and screening plant, as well as additional stockyard, car dumping and train loading facilities at Mt. Whaleback. Furthermore, in November 2008, the joint ventures approved the Rapid Growth Project 5 (RGP5) with a total capital investment of US$5.6 billion. RGP5 will increase installed capacity by 50 million tons to 205 million tons per annum. RGP5 is expected to deliver first production in the second half of 2011. The majority of production growth will come from the Yandi and Mining Area C operations. RGP5 will also deliver significant infrastructure upgrades including additional shipping berths at the Port Hedland inner habour (Finucane Island), substantial double tracking of the rail system and additional crushing, screening and stockpiling facilities at Yandi. 66 Table of Contents COAL Name of Joint Venture or Investee Entity by which Mitsui Participates in the Mining Activity and its Ownership Interest Area of Mining Operation (Region, State, Country) BHP Mitsui Coal Pty.

The operation is expected to commence in 2012 and the project estimates a maximum 6.5 million tons per annum coal production with 20-year operation. Dawson Joint Venture Mitsui Coal Holdings Pty. Ltd. (49%) Queensland, Australia Dawson (formerly Moura) Dawson Joint Venture was originally called Moura Joint Venture. The Moura Mine commenced operation in 1961. Since 1994, all production at Moura has been from its surface operation. Production tonnage has been increasing steadily throughout the years. After a few changes of ownership, Anglo Coal acquired a 51% share in 2002. In September 2003, the adjacent Theodore deposit was developed which further expanded its capacity. Anglo Coal Australia and Mitsui Coal Holdings intend to recapitalize their existing operations at the Moura mine and to establish two additional operations on adjacent tenures. The new and expanded operations are known as the Dawson Complex. Moura Joint Venture has already changed its name to Dawson Joint Venture. The joint ventures capital expenditure was estimated in excess of A$1 billion. Expansion work of the Dawson complex was completed in the year ended March 31, 2008, aiming to boost annual coal production from the present capacity of 6.5 million tons per annum to 12.7 million tons of metallurgical and thermal coals. German Creek Joint Venture Mitsui Coal Holdings Pty. Ltd. (30%) Queensland, Australia German Creek Open pit mining commenced in 1981. Underground mining in the Central Colliery area started in 1984, while underground mining in the Southern Colliery area began in 1988. Grasstree is a new underground mine which commenced production in 2006 and produces hard coking coal for our export markets. In addition, the joint venture has started the development of Lake Lindsay mine, a new open cut mine adjacent to German Creek mine, with estimated ultimate completion during 2009, to increase the aggregate annual production from 6 to 10 million tons per annum and to extend the total joint ventures mine life by about 11 years. 67 Table of Contents Production Tonnage IRON ORE Production tonnage figures in the table below represent those of marketable products as tonnage after accounting for extraction and beneficiation losses.

(the former Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, which has been renamed legally effective May 22, 2009) as of December 31, 2008. Accordingly, 5.0% (33.3% x 15%) of Vales production and reserve amounts are indirectly attributable to us. The following table provides iron ore production and reserve amounts for Vale, and Mitsuis share of the production and reserve amounts of Vale. Production Tonnage (for the year ended December 31) Millions of Tons 2008 2007 2006 Total Production Mitsuis Share Total Production Mitsuis Share Total Production Mitsuis Share 293.4 14.7 295.9 14.4 264.2 12.9 Proven and Probable Reserves (as of December 31) Millions of Tons 2008 2007 2006 Total Reserve Fe Basis (%) Mitsuis Share Total Reserve Fe Basis (%) Mitsuis Share Total Reserve Mitsuis Share 14,328.8 59.0 716.0 7,267.8 56.9 353.9 7,619.3 371.0 Vales iron ore reserve estimates increased from 7,267.8 to 14,328.8 million tons. The increase mainly reflects (i) the inclusion of the huge reserves of S11, part of the Serra Sul deposit in Carajás, (ii) the expansion of the N4W reserves into a continuous body to the south of the deposit, and (iii) the inclusion of the low-grade itabirite reserves for the Vargem Grande complex (the Tamanduá, Capitão do Mato and Abóboras mines). All of these deposits have been intensively drilled over the past four years, and the related projects (Serra Sul, Carajás 130 Mt, and Vargem Grande (formerly Itabiritos)) are now in feasibility or pre-feasibility stages. Moreover, Vales reserve estimates for Segredo/João Pereira increased due to the expansion of the open-pit project, which was undertaken in order to include low-grade materials, that will be used to feed a new concentration plant. Changes in the other reserves reflect mining production during the year and small changes in new updated geological models and/or pit designs and reserve classifications.

The expected costs to develop these undeveloped reserves were estimated to be ¥502 billion in total as of March 31, 2007. The proportion of Proved Developed Reserves to Proved Developed and Undeveloped Reserves was about 64 percent as of March 31, 2008 and the expected costs to develop these undeveloped reserves were estimated to be ¥248 billion in total as of March 31, 2008. This large proportion change is mainly due to the reduction of Mitsuis interest in Sakhalin II project. The proportion of Proved Developed Reserves to Proved Developed and Undeveloped Reserves was about 64 percent as of March 31, 2009 and almost same level compared to the percentage as of March 31, 2008. The expected costs to develop these undeveloped reserves were estimated to be ¥369 billion in total as of March 31, 2009. (3) The proved gas reserves are restricted to those volumes that are related to firm sales commitments. (4) Includes total proved reserves attributable to Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. of 19 million, 37 million and 32 million barrels of Crude oil, Condensate and Natural Gas Liquids and 265 billions, 636 billions and 584 billions of cubic feet of Natural Gas in March 2007, 2008 and 2009, as well as proved developed reserves of 18 million, 18 million and 19 million barrels of Crude oil, Condensate and Natural Gas Liquids and 227 billions, 294 billions and 339 billions of cubic feet of Natural Gas in March 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively, in which there were a 49.7 percent, 48.5 percent and 46.5 percent minority interest. (5) Includes decreases of 96 million barrels in sales of Crude oil, Condensate and Natural Gas Liquids and 1,658 billions of cubic feet in sales of Natural Gas in place, which were mainly related to the reduction of Mitsuis interest in Sakhalin II project. The estimated net quantities of oil and gas applicable to long-term supply or similar agreements with foreign governments or authorities in which Mitsui acts as producer have not exceeded, nor do they now exceed, one percent of the amount of our total proved reserve for the respective commodity. The tables above reflect such estimated net quantities. 73 Table of Contents Furthermore, the estimated net quantities of oil and gas received during each of the last three fiscal years applicable to long-term supply or similar agreements with foreign governments or authorities in which Mitsui acts as producer have not exceeded, nor do they now exceed, one percent of the amount of our total annual production of the respective commodity. Information on our oil and gas producing activities, which also reflects the immediately preceding sentence, is shown in the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited) to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. Also see Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsOperating Results by Operating SegmentEnergy Segment. Item 4A. Unresolved Staff Comments We are a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. There are no written comments which have been provided by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding our periodic reports under that Act not less than 180 days before the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 and which remain unresolved as of the date of the filing of this Form 20-F with the Commission and which we believe are material. Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects A. Operating Results You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements that appear elsewhere in this annual report. Please note that you should be aware that this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. As used in this Operating and Financial Review and Prospects, Mitsui is used to refer to Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (Mitsui Bussan Kabushiki Kaisha), and we, us, and our are used to indicate Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated. In the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is used to refer to Mitsui & Co., Ltd., and the companies is used to refer to Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated. All references to Note throughout the Operating and Financial Review and Prospects relate to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report. Throughout the Operating and Financial Review and Prospects, we describe the domicile of our subsidiaries and associated companies in parentheses following names of those companies. For example, Mitsui Iron Ore Development, Pty. Ltd. (Australia) means that the companys name is Mitsui Iron Ore Development, Pty. Ltd. and that it is domiciled in Australia. Operations of a subsidiary that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale have been accounted for as discontinued operations under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). This means that income statement and cash flow information is reclassified for past years to separate the discontinued operations from our continuing operations. This presentation is required by U.S. GAAP and facilitates historical and future trend analysis of our continuing operations. 74 Table of Contents Key Performance Measures under Managements Discussion Although our operating results and financial condition are influenced by various factors, management believes that as of the end of the fiscal year under review the following indicators can be usefully employed to discuss trends in our performance and financial condition. Gross profit, operating income* and equity in earnings of associated companies We undertake worldwide business activities, involving diversified risk-return profiles, ranging from intermediary services as agent to development and production activities of mineral resources and energy. In this context, changes in the amounts of gross profit, operating income and equity in earnings of associated companies by operating segment reflect the overall progress of our business, and greatly affect the amount of net income in the Statements of Consolidated Income. For further information, refer to the table of Operating Segment Information and subsequent discussions in Operating Results by Operating Segment in this Operating and Financial Review and Prospects. Trends in the price of and supply-demand for mineral resources and energy In recent years, we have observed a rapid growth in the operating results from our mineral resources and energy producing activities; and, the significance of these operations to our overall operating results has increased dramatically. These results have been brought on by rising prices as well as increased production, reflecting globally tightened supplies and increased demands and increased prices of mineral resources and energy that have been driven by expanding demand from emerging countries, particularly China. Furthermore, management recognize that for some time to come such global supply-demand balance and price fluctuations of mineral resources and energy will continuously have a material impact, positive or negative, on our operating results, financial condition and business. For further information regarding trends and prospects in this field, refer to the sections relating to the Mineral & Metal Resources Segment and the Energy Segment in Operating Results by Operating Segment. Investment plans and cash flow from investing activities; and financial leverage Consistent with our Medium-Term Management Outlook announced in May 2006, we have been engaged in establishing a group-wide strategic business portfolio, by leveraging proactive investment activities in the four business areas of Mineral Resources and Energy; Global Marketing Networks, including steel products, chemicals and machinery; Infrastructure, including power generation; and Consumer Services, including outsourcing services and content businesses. In parallel, management monitors the progress of investment plans quarterly and addresses divestitures of existing assets in order to maintain an optimum portfolio structure and also to generate additional cash flows as a source for the above-mentioned investments. Mitsui is monitoring and managing a group-wide financial leverage seeking to secure an efficient return on equity as well as maintaining and improving credit ratings and financial stability in order to secure necessary capital resources for investments as well as to refinance our interest bearing debt. For further information regarding details of expenditures and our financial policy, refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources. * Operating Income Operating income is included in the measure of segment performance reviewed by the chief operating decision maker. Operating income is comprised of our (a) gross profit, (b) selling, general and administrative expenses and (c) provision for doubtful receivables, as presented in the Statements of Consolidated Income. 75 Table of Contents Results of Operations Summary of Operations for the Years Ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 Principal developments in the economic environment that influenced our operations during the years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 included the following: Operating Environment for the Year Ended March 31, 2009 During the first half of the current fiscal year, the United States economy continued to expand steadily supported by strong exports and by better-than-expected consumer spending boosted by the tax rebates made in spring that tended to mitigate the effects of the increases in the prices of oil and food products. The Asian economy also continued to show strong growth boosted by expanded domestic construction and capital investments as well as increases in exports, mainly in China, despite the fact that inflation in the region had risen due to a continued run-up in energy and food prices. However, in September what had begun in the summer of 2007 with market turmoil surrounding U.S. subprime mortgages turned into a financial tsunami engulfing the largest U.S. insurance company and triggering the largest U.S. bankruptcy and rapidly transformed into a full-blown global financial crisis in the fall of 2008. In the United States, the contraction in activity in 2009 is triggering a rapid demand destruction coupled with sharp declines in equity markets. Authorities have implemented various drastic plans for rehabilitating the financial sector as well as continued policy support to bolster domestic demand. Global economic activity has continued to decline ever since then, with advanced economies experiencing their sharpest declines in the post-war era, reflecting an intensification of the corrosive interplays between the financial crisis and real activity, notwithstanding continued policy efforts. In the Euro area, the decline in activity in 2009 reflects a sharp collapse in external demand, the impact of housing market corrections in some member states, and an intensification of financing constraints. Growth also plunged across a broad front of emerging and developing economies, as well as in low-income economies, reflecting the interaction of weakening external demand, tightening financial constraints, and plunging commodity prices. Emerging Asia is being hurt through its reliance on manufacturing exports. The regions manufacturing activity has been particularly hurt by collapsing IT exports. Growth in China is also slowing from higher growth rates of the past years albeit domestic demand is being supported by strong policy stimulus. In Japan, the sharp fall in output reflects plunging net exports and business investment and faltering private consumption. The financial sectorthough not at the epicenter of the crisisis also suffering ill effects. The dramatic decline of export volumes which had been growing steadily, resulted in an unprecedented destocking, downward revisions of business investment plans and employment adjustment throughout nearly every industry. Responding to such a critical situation, the Japanese government implemented a policy stimulus and the Bank of Japan reduced the policy interest rate and purchased Japanese government bonds. Commodity markets too are at a crossroad. Prices in energy, metals and all other commodity markets fell sharply reflecting slower growth and an increase in risk aversion. Future oil price (WTI) reached the highest price ever of U.S.$147.27 in July 2008, and then fell sharply to U.S.$33 per barrel at one time in December. Japanese Yen appreciated against almost all currencies and even reached ¥87 against U.S.$1.00 at one point. Nikkei Stock Average continued to move downward amid the same downward trend in the global equity markets, and plunged to less than ¥7,000, which is its lowest daily price after the bubble era. The external factors influencing operating results and our businesses are 1) sharp curtailment in shipments for coal and iron ore triggered by the economic downturn despite contribution from large increases in annual contract 76 Table of Contents prices for the two commodities, 2) plunging oil prices, 3) lower sales and drop in prices of various merchandise as a result of rapid global demand destruction and unprecedented destocking throughout almost every value chain and 4) continued precipitation of equity markets all over the globe. Notwithstanding a significant downward revision to the forecast, downside risks continue to dominate. Yet, global financial and economic conditions could rebound faster than anticipated if policy measures are credibly strengthened. While exceptional uncertainty far exceeds that seen during typical downturns, the right policies could help remedy the crisis of confidence, providing a lift to spending and growth. In this regards, we intend to be cautiously optimistic. Operating Environment for the Year Ended March 31, 2008 The global economy continued to expand vigorously supported by generally sound fundamentals and strong momentum in the Asian economy, led by China, and resilient activities in Europe and Japan, despite increasing uncertainty about the outlook of the United States with concerns that financial market strains could deepen and trigger a more pronounced economic slowdown. Continued run-up of prices of internationally traded commodities such as metals and crude oil, as well as continued strong growth of domestic demand in emerging countries, including BRICs, for capital investment and consumption were the two major factors influencing the operating results and businesses of Mitsui and its subsidiaries. These factors particularly boosted operating results of our mineral resources and energy related activities and supported steady business performance in steel products, machinery & infrastructure and chemicals. On a regional basis, the business sentiment in the United States, which enjoyed moderate growth during the first half of the year as a result of healthy consumer spending, reflecting robust performance in the business sector and growth in real disposable income, deteriorated significantly in the second half, reflecting financial stress which erupted in August 2007 as the subprime mortgage market was derailed, leading to tightening of credit conditions, considerable deceleration of consumer spending due to sharp increases in the prices of crude oil and food products, as well as softening of the labor market. The European economy slowed down moderately as construction investments peaked out in the region. In Japan, exports of automotive, steel and chemical products to emerging economies drove a high level of industrial production. On the other hand, uncertainties increased in the corporate and household sectors reflecting a decline in construction investments caused by revision of the Japanese building standards regulation as well as rising prices of material costs and consumer goods including foodstuffs. Looking into financial and foreign exchange markets, the Federal Reserve Board of the United States (FRB) implemented a series of interest rate cuts to try to stabilize the financial market. In foreign exchange markets, the U.S. dollar continued to depreciate against most major currencies, and fell below ¥100/ U.S. dollar in March 2008, the lowest value in 13 years. Furthermore, stock markets worldwide saw falling share prices in the latter half of the fiscal year. Overview of the Financial Results for the Year Ended March 31, 2009  Operating results The group posted consolidated net income of ¥177.6 billion, a sharp decline of ¥232.5 billion, or down 56.7%, from ¥410.1 billion for the corresponding previous year. Major developments during the two fiscal years were as follows;  Operating results during the first half of the current fiscal year were solid reflecting a continued broad-based surge in the emerging and developing economies. Following the banking crisis that erupted in mid-September 2008, the financial markets unraveled and took with them consumer confidence. The rapid demand destruction and unprecedented destocking throughout nearly every value chain resulted in lower sales volume and a sharp drop in prices of all merchandise which triggered a decline in net income of all segments excluding the Energy Segment and Asia Pacific 77 Table of Contents Segment compared with the previous fiscal year. The Energy Segment reported an increase in net income due to the time lag in consolidating their earnings into our operating results as well as the price formulas while the Asia Pacific Segment posted an increase reflecting the higher prices of coal and iron ore.  With the scale and scope of the current financial crisis taking the global economy into uncharted waters, the Group recognized additional impairment losses on unlisted securities, goodwill and long lived assets including real estate related losses in the Consumer Service & IT Segment and the Europe, the Middle East and Africa Segment and impairment losses on goodwill and long lived assets in the Americas Segment, after reviewing business plans of relevant businesses in the three month period ended March 31, 2009.  Due to the sharp decline in equity markets, the Group recognized impairment losses of ¥117.4 billion including those of listed securities such as those of Mitsui Chemical held by the Chemical Segment, Nippon Steel Corporation held by the Iron & Steel Products Segment and Yamaha Motor held by the Machinery & Infrastructure Projects Segment. In addition, reflecting declines in listed shares of Sims Metal Management Limited (Australia) and Penske Automotive Group (United States), Inc., we recognized impairment losses in equity in earnings of associated companies-net for both companies.  Substantial one-off gains on sales of securities and divestiture in the previous year amounting to approximately ¥93 billion (after tax) were recorded. Those gains include sales of the Groups stakes in mineral resources and energy businesses, such as Sesa Goa Limited (India), Sakhalin II in Russia, Wandoo Petroleum Pty. Ltd. (Australia) and EBM (Brazil)(*1), gains on sale of aircraft held by Tombo Aviation, Inc. (United States) as well as a gain on land sale in Europe in the automotive field.  Return-on-Equity for the year ended March 31, 2009 was 8.7%, a decline of 10.4 percentage points from 19.1% for the previous year.  Financial condition Total assets as of March 31, 2009 were ¥8.4 trillion, a decline of ¥1.1 trillion from ¥9.5 trillion as of March 31, 2008. With prices of virtually all merchandises including commodities plummeting from the three month period ended December 31, 2008, current assets declined by ¥0.6 trillion. Investments and plant, property and equipment (PPE) declined by ¥0.5 trillion compared to the previous fiscal year end. The decline was attributable to decreases in investment in foreign associated companies, in PPE held by foreign subsidiaries and in listed securities resulting from the appreciation of the Japanese Yen against major currencies and sharp decline in equity markets all over the world in the second half of the current fiscal year, partially offset by additional investment in Valepar S.A. (Brazil) and various capital expenditures for the expansions made by the Mineral & Metal Resources and the Energy segments. Shareholders equity as of March 31, 2009 was ¥1.9 trillion, a decline of ¥0.3 trillion from ¥2.2 trillion as of March 31, 2008, due to the stronger Japanese Yen and lower equity prices offset by a slight increase in retained earnings. Net Debt-to-Equity Ratio (Net DER)(*2) as of March, 2009 was 1.34 times, an increase of 0.07 point from 1.27 times as of March 31, 2008.  Cash flows As operating income slightly increased to ¥394.7 billion and cash inflow from the collection of trade receivables as well as changes in other operating assets and liabilities contributed positively, net cash (*1) Empreendimentos Brasileiros de Mineração S.A. (*2) Net DER is comprised of net interest bearing debt divided by shareholders equity. See Liquidity and Capital ResourcesUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 78 Table of Contents provided by operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥582.7 billion. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended March, 2009 was ¥290.9 billion due mainly to an additional investment in Valepar S.A., and other expansion related expenditures for natural resources in the Mineral & Metal Resources and the Energy Segments. As a result, free cash flow (*3) for the year ended March 31, 2009 was net inflow of ¥291.8 billion. Overview of the Financial Results for the Year Ended March 31, 2008  Operating results  We recorded consolidated net income of ¥410.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008, a significant increase of ¥108.6 billion, or 36.0%, from ¥301.5 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. In regards to the individual segments, the Mineral & Metal Resources and the Energy businesses made outstanding performances with increases of ¥78.7 billion and ¥48.4 billion, respectively, reflecting substantial one-off gains on divestitures such as Sesa Goa Limited in India and Sakhalin II in Russia as well as increases in energy equity production and mineral resource prices. The Iron & Steel Products, the Chemicals and the Machinery and Infrastructure Projects businesses continued to post robust results, and the Foods & Retail business, which had recorded significant impairment losses in the previous years, improved its performance by ¥22.8 billion with restructuring efforts paying off.  The Americas recorded a downturn by ¥12.6 billion from write downs on inventories in the residential home businesses and a slowdown in its businesses in the United States, triggered by the subprime mortgage issues. In addition, several business units at the headquarters of Mitsui, including the Automotive and the Financial Markets businesses, recorded write downs on domestic listed securities.  Financial condition Total assets as of March 31, 2008 were ¥9.5 trillion, a decline of ¥0.3 trillion from ¥9.8 trillion as of March 31, 2007. Despite active investing activities mainly at the Machinery & Infrastructure Projects, the Mineral & Metal Resources, the Energy and the Americas segments combined total of investments and plants, property and equipment (PPE) declined by ¥0.2 trillion due to:  a partial divestiture of our stake in the Sakhalin II project by ¥0.2 trillion; and  the impact from a decline in the domestic stock market and appreciation of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar, which resulted in net ¥0.2 trillion decline in combined sum of unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and foreign currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). As of March 31, 2008, shareholders equity was ¥2.2 trillion as a result of current year earnings, and Net Debt-to-Equity Ratio (Net DER) was 1.27 times, a decline of 0.20 point from 1.47 times as of March 31, 2007. Return on Equity (ROE) during the period on an annualized basis is computed as 19.1%.  Cash flows Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥415.8 billion, an increase of ¥176.5 billion from the year ended March 31, 2007, reflecting steady growth in operating income. Net cash used by investing activities was ¥104.8 billion, reflecting the above-mentioned new investments and expansion projects largely offset by the material divestitures of interests in Sakhalin II project, Sesa Goa Ltd., and other assets. (*3) Free cash flow is sum of net cash provided/(used) by operating activities and net cash provided/(used) by investing activities. See Liquidity and Capital ResourcesUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 79 Table of Contents Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Fluctuation on Operating Results for 2009 Total sum of net income for the years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 reported by overseas subsidiaries and associated companies were ¥254.0 billion and ¥306.9 billion, respectively. These companies principally use U.S. dollars, Australian dollars and Brazilian real as functional currency in their reporting. The average U.S. dollarJapanese yen exchange rate during the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥100.66 = U.S.$1, representing Japanese yen appreciation of ¥13.14, or 11.5%, compared to the average rate during the year ended March 31, 2008 of ¥113.80 = U.S.$1. As of March 31, 2009, the U.S. dollarJapanese yen exchange rate was ¥98.23 = U.S.$1. a) Japanese yen denominated impact against the U.S. dollar, Australian dollar and Brazilian real We conducted simplified estimation for the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on net income for the year ending March 2010. We aggregated a total forecast net income in the business plans of these companies covering the year ending March 2010 according to their functional currencies. Firstly, we aggregated Australian dollar and Brazilian real denominated forecast net income of those companies using two currencies as functional currency, and secondly we aggregated the rest of net income at overseas subsidiaries and associated companies as U.S. dollar equivalent amount. We conduct a sensitivity analysis on foreign currency fluctuation towards 3 categories of aggregated net income. For example, yen appreciation by ¥1 against U.S.$1 would have the net effect of reducing net income by approximately ¥0.3 billion. Specifically, for the net income of those companies using Australian dollar and Brazilian real as functional currency, yen appreciation by ¥1 against Australian $1 and Brazilian R$1 would have the net effect of reducing net income by approximately ¥1.3 billion and ¥0.2 billion, respectively. b) Currency exchange rate risk between revenues from U.S. dollar denominated contract and costs denominated in Australian dollar and Brazilian real Sum of net income from those companies using Australian dollar and Brazilian real as functional currency is getting significant, reflecting increasing income in mineral resources and energy producing operations. Net income of those mineral resources and energy producing companies are impacted by the currency fluctuation between U.S. dollar as a contractual currency of sales contracts and the two currencies as functional currency, affecting their Australian dollar or Brazilian real denominated revenues. We should pay attention to this in addition to the impact which is discussed in the above a). Discussion and Analysis of Operating Results for the Years Ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 Revenues In accordance with U.S. GAAP, revenues are reported based on the gross amount billed to a customer or on the net amount retained (that is, the amount billed to a customer less the amount paid to a supplier) in the following manner.  Revenues are reported based on gross amounts for transactions where we have the related risks and rewards of ownership such as transactions mainly where we are the primary obligor in the arrangement and/or assume general inventory risk without any significant mitigation of our risk level.  Revenues are reported based on net amounts where we assume a low degree of related risks and rewards, effectively acting as an agent for the applicable products or services. A typical example of reporting revenues based on net amounts is a transaction where we receive a commission or fee at a fixed rate based on transaction volume or amount. We classified our revenues into sales of products, sales of services and other sales with the corresponding costs of revenues. 80 Table of Contents The table below provides these three categories of revenues by products in PRODUCT INFORMATION in Note 17, SEGMENT INFORMATION.(*) Billions of Yen Years Ended March 31, 2009 2008 Change Sales ofProducts Sales ofServices OtherSales Total Sales ofProducts Sales ofServices OtherSales Total Sales ofProducts Sales ofServices OtherSales Total Iron and Steel ¥ 800.6 ¥ 64.5 ¥ 0.5 ¥ 865.6 ¥ 730.4 ¥ 70.6 ¥ 0.3 ¥ 801.3 ¥ 70.2 ¥ (6.1 ) ¥ 0.2 ¥ 64.3 Non-Ferrous Metals 165.0 7.3 25.2 197.5 56.8 9.3 13.6 79.7 108.2 (2.0 ) 11.6 117.8 Machinery 226.7 97.5 70.0 394.2 276.0 123.6 78.6 478.2 (49.3 ) (26.1 ) (8.6 ) (84.0 ) Electronics & Information 47.1 85.8 0.9 133.8 77.4 100.8 4.1 182.3 (30.3 ) (15.0 ) (3.2 ) (48.5 ) Chemicals 1,333.0 75.5 6.4 1,414.9 1,207.5 104.2 6.9 1,318.6 125.5 (28.7 ) (0.5 ) 96.3 Energy 1,688.2 6.5 24.6 1,719.3 1,992.1 6.9 18.7 2,017.7 (303.9 ) (0.4 ) 5.9 (298.4 ) Foods 567.5 43.1 0.6 611.2 533.2 38.3 1.1 572.6 34.3 4.8 (0.5 ) 38.6 Textiles 11.8 14.6 2.0 28.4 14.7 19.5 4.0 38.2 (2.9 ) (4.9 ) (2.0 ) (9.8 ) General Merchandise 15.0 4.4 0.0 19.4 33.8 6.7 0.0 40.5 (18.8 ) (2.3 ) 0.0 (21.1 ) Property and Service Business 26.3 80.3 44.3 150.9 87.9 73.8 48.1 209.8 (61.6 ) 6.5 (3.8 ) (58.9 ) Consolidated Total ¥ 4,881.2 ¥ 479.5 ¥ 174.5 ¥ 5,535.2 ¥ 5,009.8 ¥ 553.7 ¥ 175.4 ¥ 5,738.9 ¥ (128.6 ) ¥ (74.2 ) ¥ (0.9 ) ¥ (203.7 ) Billions of Yen Years Ended March 31, 2008 2007 Change Sales ofProducts Sales ofServices OtherSales Total Sales ofProducts Sales ofServices OtherSales Total Sales ofProducts Sales ofServices OtherSales Total Iron and Steel ¥ 730.4 ¥ 70.6 ¥ 0.3 ¥ 801.3 ¥ 495.2 ¥ 71.5 ¥ 0.2 ¥ 566.9 ¥ 235.2 ¥ (0.9 ) ¥ 0.1 ¥ 234.4 Non-Ferrous Metals 56.8 9.3 13.6 79.7 71.2 9.0 19.7 99.9 (14.4 ) 0.3 (6.1 ) (20.2 ) Machinery 276.0 123.6 78.6 478.2 253.1 106.0 69.5 428.6 22.9 17.6 9.1 49.6 Electronics & Information 77.4 100.8 4.1 182.3 74.4 104.4 0.0 178.8 3.0 (3.6 ) 4.1 3.5 Chemicals 1,207.5 104.2 6.9 1,318.6 1,038.9 98.4 9.3 1,146.6 168.6 5.8 (2.4 ) 172.0 Energy 1,992.1 6.9 18.7 2,017.7 1,617.7 7.1 8.5 1,633.3 374.4 (0.2 ) 10.2 384.4 Foods 533.2 38.3 1.1 572.6 417.2 49.3 0.5 467.0 116.0 (11.0 ) 0.6 105.6 Textiles 14.7 19.5 4.0 38.2 17.1 21.2 1.5 39.8 (2.4 ) (1.7 ) 2.5 (1.6 ) General Merchandise 33.8 6.7 0.0 40.5 42.3 8.0 0.0 50.3 (8.5 ) (1.3 ) 0.0 (9.8 ) Property and Service Business 87.9 73.8 48.1 209.8 63.3 81.1 38.0 182.4 24.6 (7.3 ) 10.1 27.4 Consolidated Total ¥ 5,009.8 ¥ 553.7 ¥ 175.4 ¥ 5,738.9 ¥ 4,090.4 ¥ 556.0 ¥ 147.2 ¥ 4,793.6 ¥ 919.4 ¥ (2.3 ) ¥ 28.2 ¥ 945.3 Sales of Products Sales of products include the following four types of transactions:  the sale of products as a principal in the transactions, such as crude oil and petroleum products, petrochemical products and steel products;  the sale of manufactured products at our manufacturing subsidiaries such as feed additives by Novus International, Inc. (United States) and tea leaves by Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. (Japan);  the sale of natural resources from iron ore and coal mining activities and oil and gas producing activities; and  the development and sale of real estate. (*) Revenues reported in PRODUCT INFORMATION are classified by similarity of products as required by U.S. GAAP, and are not intended to represent classification by operating segment. As an example, revenues of Chemicals in PRODUCT INFORMATION include not only those reported in the Chemical Segment but also revenues related to various chemical businesses reported in other operating segments such as the Americas Segment. To differentiate between classification by product and classification by operating segment, classification by product is italicized in this Revenues section and Gross Profit Classified by Category of Revenues section. 81 Table of Contents Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 For the year ended March 31, 2009, revenues from the sales of products were ¥4,881.2 billion, a decline of ¥128.6 billion, or 2.6%, from ¥5,009.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. Major factors by product were as follows:  Revenues from Energy were ¥1,688.2 billion, a decline of ¥303.9 billion from ¥1,992.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. Crude oil and petroleum products sales in international markets and domestic petroleum products and liquefied petroleum gas sales comprised the major part of the revenues from Energy. Revenues from sales of crude oil and petroleum products decreased at Westport Petroleum, Inc. (United States) by ¥159.8 billion. Regarding price trends of oil and gas for the year ended March 31, 2009, refer to the discussion under Energy Segment of Operating Results by Operating Segment.  Revenues from Chemicals were ¥1,333.0 billion, an increase of ¥125.5 billion from ¥1,207.5 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. In petrochemical products business, there was a decline in both product prices and sales volume in general for the second half of the fiscal year due to the credit crunch and rapidly deteriorating economic activities, however, Novus International Inc. reported an increase in revenue reflecting higher product prices and increase in sales volume supported by a strong global demand for animal feed additives. Agricultural business remains robust and the favorable market conditions and increase in sales volume for ammonia, sulfur and fertilizers for the first half of the fiscal year has also contributed to the increase in revenue. Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 For the year ended March 31, 2008, revenues from the sales of products were ¥5,009.8 billion, an increase of ¥919.4 billion, or 22.5%, from ¥4,090.4 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. Major factors by product were as follows:  Revenues from Energy were ¥1,992.1 billion, an increase of ¥374.4 billion from ¥1,617.7 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. Crude oil and petroleum products sales in international markets and domestic petroleum products and liquefied petroleum gas sales comprised the major part of the revenues from Energy. Revenues from sales of petroleum products increased at Westport Petroleum, Inc. (United States) by ¥187.7 billion. There was a new contribution of ¥79.3 billion from Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. (Japan)(*) which was newly consolidated as a subsidiary during the fourth quarter of the year ended March 31, 2007. Regarding price trends of oil and gas for the year ended March 31, 2008, refer to the discussion under Energy Segment of Operating Results by Operating Segment.  Revenues from Iron and Steel were ¥730.4 billion, an increase of ¥235.2 billion from ¥495.2 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. The increase was attributable to rising prices in iron ore and steel scrap as well as robust steel products sales, particularly in Asia. Also there was a new contribution from Steel Technologies, Inc. (United States) of ¥119.9 billion following our acquisition in June 2007. Regarding price trends of iron ore for the year ended March 31, 2008, please refer to the discussion under Mineral & Metal resources Segment of Operating Results by Operating Segment.  Revenues from Chemicals were ¥1,207.5 billion, an increase of ¥168.6 billion from ¥1,038.9 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007, primarily due to increased sales of basic petrochemicals and petrochemical intermediates of ¥118.3 billion at Mitsui, reflecting higher prices of those products as a result of rising crude oil prices. (*) In March 2007, Mitsui acquired an additional 3% stake in Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd., formerly an associated company, increasing its voting interest in Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. to 50.3% and re-classifying Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. as a subsidiary of Mitsui. 82 Table of Contents  Revenues from Foods were ¥533.2 billion, an increase of ¥116.0 billion from ¥417.2 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007, mainly due to increases of ¥74.1 billion in Mitsuis sales of grain and feedstuff, reflecting increased corn and soybean prices and active commodity markets. Sales of Services Sales of services include the revenues from trading margins (for our intermediary service) and commissions. For example:  As the most typical case of our services, for back-to-back sales and purchase transactions of products, we record the net amount of sale and purchase prices (namely, margin for our intermediary service) as revenues.  We provide various services such as logistics and warehouse services, information and communication services and technical support. We also facilitate arrangement of the contracts between manufacturers and customers and deliveries of the products between suppliers and customers. In these cases, the billed amounts for these services are recognized as revenues. Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 For the year ended March 31, 2009, revenues from the sales of services were ¥479.5 billion, a decline of ¥74.2 billion, or 13.4%, from ¥553.7 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. Chemicals declined by ¥28.7 billion to ¥75.5 billion from ¥104.2 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. Machinery declined by ¥26.1 billion to ¥97.5 billion from ¥123.6 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. Electronics & Information declined by ¥15.0 billion to ¥85.8 billion from ¥100.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. The decrease at Electronics & Information is mainly due to reclassification of T-Gaia Corporation from subsidiary to associated company, which resulted in a decline of ¥14.6 billion. Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 For the year ended March 31, 2008, revenues from the sales of services were ¥553.7 billion, a decline of ¥2.3 billion, 0.4%, from ¥556.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. While Machinery increased by ¥17.6 billion to ¥123.6 billion from ¥106.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007, Foods declined by ¥11.0 billion to ¥38.3 billion from ¥49.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007 and Property and Service Business declined by ¥7.3 billion to ¥73.8 billion from ¥81.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. Other Sales Other sales principally include the revenues from:  derivative commodity instruments and derivative financial instruments held for trading purposes (by product category mainly in Energy and Non Ferrous Metals);  the revenues from leasing activities of real estate, rolling stock, ocean transport vessels and machinery equipment (by product category mainly in Property and Service Business and Machinery); and  the revenues from external consumer financing (by product category mainly in Machinery). Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 For the year ended March 31, 2009, revenues from other sales were ¥174.5 billion, a decline of ¥0.9 billion, 0.5%, from ¥175.4 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008, which was primarily attributable to the following factors:  Derivative trading revenues were ¥50.2 billion, an increase of ¥13.5 billion from the ¥36.7 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. The increase includes a profit corresponding to a foreign exchange loss of ¥13.6 billion related to commodity trading business posted in other expense-net. 83 Table of Contents  Leasing revenues were ¥82.6 billion, a decline of ¥7.7 billion from the ¥90.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008 due to less demand for and overhaul of rolling stock at leasing subsidiaries in North America and Europe. Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 For the year ended March 31, 2008, revenues from other sales were ¥175.4 billion, an increase of ¥28.2 billion, 19.2%, from ¥147.2 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007, which was primarily attributable to the following factors:  Derivative trading revenues were ¥36.7 billion, an increase of ¥3.6 billion from the ¥33.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. The increase was mainly attributable to a reversal effect from naphtha trading loss for the year ended March 31, 2007 at Mitsui Oil (Asia) Pte. Ltd. (Singapore), however, the improvement was partly offset by a decrease in commodity derivatives trading revenues for the year ended March 31, 2008.  Leasing revenues were ¥90.3 billion, an increase of ¥7.5 billion from the ¥82.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007 due to a full-year contribution from a rolling stock leasing subsidiary MRCE Dispolok Gmbh (Germany) which was acquired in October 2006.  P.T. Bussan Auto Finance (Indonesia) increased its revenue by ¥4.9 billion reflecting strong business performance in the motorcycle retail finance industry in Indonesia.

The Gross Profit ratio (GP ratio), or ratio of gross profit divided by revenues, for the year ended March 31, 2009 was 18.4%, an increase of 1.2 percentage points compared to the year ended March 31, 2008. For the year ended March 31, 2009, gross profit from sales of products was ¥597.7 billion, an increase of ¥100.4 billion from ¥497.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. Gross profit from Iron and Steel was ¥182.8 billion, an increase of ¥76.7 billion from ¥106.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. Reflecting a significant increase in coal and iron ore prices, Mitsui Coal Holdings Pty. Ltd (Australia) and Mitsui Iron Ore Development Pty. Ltd (Australia) reported increases of ¥46.6 billion and ¥23.3 billion, respectively. Gross profit from Chemical was ¥92.3 billion, an increase of ¥31.8 billion from ¥60.5 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. Novus International Inc. recorded an increase of ¥27.4 billion reflecting higher product prices and increase in sales volume supported by a strong demand for animal feed additives. Gross profit from Energy was ¥222.4 billion, a slight increase of ¥3.7 billion from ¥218.7 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. Mitsui E&P Australia Pty Ltd reported an increase of ¥14.3 billion reflecting increase in sales volume and higher oil prices. Mitsui Marubeni Liquefied Gas Co., Ltd also contributed to the increase due to increased sales volume resulting from the merger. 84 Table of Contents These contributions were partly offset by a decline of ¥22.7 billion reported by Mittwell Energy Resourses Pty., Ltd due to a decline of shipments and an increase in condensate cost as a result of the revision of the purchase price. The GP ratio from sales of products for the year ended March 31, 2009 was 12.2%, an improvement of 2.3 percentage points compared to the year ended March 31, 2008. This 2.3 percentage point improvement was attributable to the substantial increase in gross profit (20.2% increase), particularly in Mitsui Coal Holdings Pty. Ltd (Australia) of Iron and Steel reflecting a significant increase in coal prices. Revenues from sales of petroleum products decreased at Westport Petroleum, Inc. (United States) reflecting declines in the market prices, however, lower revenues do not necessarily result in decline in gross profit because its profit-earning opportunities derive from oil price fluctuations. For the year ended March 31, 2009, gross profit from sales of services was ¥315.5 billion, a decline of ¥82.1 billion from ¥397.6 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. As illustrated by the table in three categories of revenues by productsSales of Services, Chemicals, Iron and Steel and Machinery recorded substantial declines. The GP ratio from sales of services for the year ended March 31, 2009 was 65.8%, a decline of 6.0 percentage points compared to the year ended March 31, 2008. For the year ended March 31, 2009, gross profit from other sales was ¥103.1 billion, an increase of ¥9.9 billion from ¥93.2 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. The major reason was gross profit corresponding to a foreign exchange loss of ¥13.6 billion related to commodity trading business posted in other expense-net. The GP ratio from other sales for the year ended March 31, 2009 was 59.1%, an increase of 6.0 percentage points compared to the year ended March 31, 2008. Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 For the year ended March 31, 2008, gross profit was ¥988.1 billion, an increase of ¥121.8 billion, or 14.1%, from ¥866.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. The Gross Profit ratio (GP ratio), or ratio of gross profit divided by revenues, for the year ended March 31, 2008 was 17.2%, a decrease of 0.9 percentage points compared to the year ended March 31, 2007. For the year ended March 31, 2008, gross profit from sales of products was ¥497.3 billion, an increase of ¥103.7 billion from ¥393.6 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. Gross profit from Energy was ¥218.7 billion, a significant increase of ¥91.1 billion from ¥127.6 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007, due to full year contributions of Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. by ¥58.7 billion which was newly consolidated as a subsidiary during the 4th quarter of the year ended March 31, 2007, and Mitsui E&P Australia Pty Limited which commenced a commercial production of the Enfield oil field by ¥26.4 billion. Mitsui E&P Middle East B.V. (Netherlands) and Mittwell Energy Resources Pty. Ltd. (Australia) recorded increases reflecting higher oil prices. On the other hand, Westport Petroleum, Inc. (United States) recorded a ¥12.4 billion decrease from sales of petroleum products. The GP ratio from sales of products for the year ended March 31, 2008 was 9.9%, an improvement of 0.3 percentage points compared to the year ended March 31, 2007. This 0.3 percentage point improvement was attributable to the higher growth in gross profit (26.3% increase) than growth in revenues (22.5% increase), particularly in oil and gas producing activities of Energy reflecting the rising sales prices. For the year ended March 31, 2008, gross profit from sales of services was ¥397.6 billion, an increase of ¥0.1 billion from ¥397.5 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. As illustrated by the table in three categories of revenues by productsSales of Services, increases in revenues from sales of services of Machinery were largely offset by decreases in those of Electronics & Information and Foods. The GP ratio from sales of services for the year ended March 31, 2008 was 71.8%, an increase of 0.3 percentage points compared to the year ended March 31, 2007. 85 Table of Contents For the year ended March 31, 2008, gross profit from other sales was ¥93.2 billion, an increase of ¥18.0 billion from ¥75.2 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. The major reasons were the same as described in RevenuesOther Sales above. While GP ratio in all the three categories of revenue increased, the overall GP ratio decreased by 0.9%. This is due to the change in the sales mix wherein the percentage of sales from services, which has considerably higher GP ratio as compared to products and others, has reduced from 45.8% in 2007 to 40.2% in 2008. Gross Profit Classified by Operating Segment For detailed discussion, see Operating Results by Operating Segment. A summary of the increase in gross profit classified by operating segment is provided below. Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 For the year ended March 31, 2009 consolidated total gross profit was ¥1,016.3 billion, an increase of ¥28.2 billion, or 2.9%, from ¥988.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008 as a result of the following:  The Energy Segment reported an increase of ¥52.7 billion in gross profit. This increase is attributable to solid performance by the oil & gas producing businesses, reflecting continued run-up in prices and additional equity production, as well as contribution of ¥46.6 billion made by Mitsui Coal Holdings Pty. Ltd. (Australia) reflecting a significant increase in coal prices.  The Mineral & Metal Resources Segment also reported an increase of ¥23.4 billion in gross profit. Reflecting higher iron ore prices, Mitsui Iron Ore Development Pty. Ltd. (Australia) and Mitsui Itochu Iron Pty. Ltd. (Australia) reported increases of ¥23.3 billion and ¥2.0 billion, respectively.  The Americas Segment reported an increase of ¥37.5 billion in gross profit. Supported by strong demand as well as increased price of animal feed additives, Novus International Inc. (United States) reported an increase of ¥27.4 billion. Backed by strong demand for tubular pipes for oil and gas industry, Champions Pipe & Supply, Inc. (United States) also contributed to the increase in gross profit.  Consumer Service & IT Segment reported a decline of ¥43.0 billion, due to a loss on write-down of inventories in the domestic residential home business and weak results from almost all the domestic consumer related businesses. In addition, reclassification of T-Gaia Corporation from subsidiary to associated company through merger with MS Communications Co., Ltd. in the three month period ended December 31, 2008, resulted in a decline of ¥14.6 billion in gross profit.  Due to the financial turmoil which intensified after last autumn, the Chemical Segment, the Iron & Steel Products Segment and the Machinery & Infrastructure Projects Segment recorded substantial declines in gross profit attributable to declines in sales volumes as well as margins, which offset the increased gross profits for the first half of the current fiscal year reflecting the positive economic circumstances in the emerging countries. 86 Table of Contents Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 For the year ended March 31, 2008 consolidated total gross profit was ¥988.1 billion, an increase of ¥121.8 billion, or 14.1%, from ¥866.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007 as a result of the following:  The Energy Segment recorded an increase of ¥95.4 billion compared to the year ended March 31, 2007, making up 78% of the consolidated total increase, mainly attributable to contributions from Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. and the Enfield oil field. These contributions were partly offset by a decline in gross profit at Mitsui Coal Holdings Pty. Ltd. (Australia) reflecting a lower coal price, the Australian dollar appreciation against the U.S. dollar and a cost increase related to various operational troubles at its mining expansion project.  The Machinery & Infrastructure Projects Segment recorded an increase of ¥26.1 billion from the year ended March 31, 2007, primarily reflecting solid performance at a motorcycle retail finance subsidiary, P.T.Bussan Auto Finance, and other automotive subsidiaries, ocean vessels and rolling stock leasing subsidiaries as well as contribution from a newly acquired machine tools sales subsidiary Ellison Technologies Inc. (United States). Similarly, the Chemical Segment and the Iron & Steel products Segment reported increases of ¥7.2 billion reflecting favorable methanol and ammonia market conditions and ¥3.6 billion reflecting firm results in steel tubular products for energy sector as well as construction material and tubular products to Asian market, respectively.  The Mineral & Metal Resources Segment recorded a decline of ¥15.2 billion from the year ended March 31, 2007, mainly due to divestiture of Sesa Goa Limited (India)(*). This negative impact was partly offset by an increase of gross profit at Mitsui Iron Ore Development Pty. Ltd. and Mitsui Itochu Iron Pty. Ltd. reflecting higher prices of iron ore.  The Consumer Service & IT Segment and the Americas Segment recorded declines from the year ended March 31, 2007. The decline at the Consumer Service & IT Segment was attributable to business reorganization through withdrawals from or divestitures of mainly domestic businesses. In the Americas Segment for the year ended March 31, 2008, MBK Real Estate LLC. (United States), which engages in the development and sale of residential homes in the West Coast market, recorded a sharp fall in sales and a loss from write-downs on inventories reflecting deterioration in the residential market triggered by the subprime mortgage problems of the United States. Moreover, Westport Petroleum Inc. decreased its profit from oil products trading and so did steel products subsidiaries engaged in the steel products business mainly in oil tubular products reflecting lower margins. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Classified by Category of Expenses Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2009 were ¥602.1 billion, a decline of ¥3.1 billion or 0.5% from ¥605.2 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. (*) As a result of Mitsuis divestiture of Sesa Goa, the operating results of Sesa Goa for the year ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 are presented as income from discontinued operations (after income tax effect in our statements of consolidated income). However, in this Gross Profit Classified by Operating Segment, operating results of the company are presented and discussed according to line items of the consolidated statements of income. 87 Table of Contents The table below provides a breakdown of selling, general and administrative expenses used for our internal review for the years ended March 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

This nominal decline was mainly attributable to a decline related to the reclassification of T-Gaia Corporation from subsidiary to associated company offset by an increase resulting from Mitsui Marubeni Liquefied Gas Co., Ltd. (Japan)s merger with Marubeni Liquefied Gas Corporation (Japan) and increased sales volume at Novus International, Inc.  Travel expenses were ¥33.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2009, a decline of ¥1.8 billion from the year ended March 31, 2008. This decline resulted from the reclassification of T-Gaia Corporation from subsidiary to associated company. Fees and Taxes were ¥9.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2009, a decline of ¥1.8 billion from the year ended March 31, 2008. This was mainly attributable to a decline in enterprise tax expense at Mitsui. Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2008 were ¥605.2 billion, an increase of ¥33.6 billion or 5.9% from ¥571.6 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007.  Personnel expenses were ¥294.5 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008, an increase of ¥11.2 billion from the year ended March 31, 2007. This was mainly attributable to acquisitions of subsidiaries such as Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. in the Energy Segment and Ellison Technologies Inc. (United States) and Steel Technologies, Inc. in the Americas segment.  Other remaining items in selling, general and administrative expenses increased showing similar patterns as personnel expenses. 88 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Classified by Operating Segment The table below provides selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended March 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 by operating segment.

These declines are mainly attributable to the reclassifications from subsidiaries to associated companies such as T-Gaia Corporation. The Energy Segment reported an increase of ¥11.6 billion attributable to Mitsui Marubeni Liquefied Gas Co., Ltd. (Japan), which merged with Marubeni Liquefied Gas Corporation (Japan). Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 As illustrated by the above table, selling, general and administrative expenses increased mainly at segments such as the Machinery & Infrastructure, the Americas and the Energy by ¥7.1 billion, ¥15.2 billion and ¥7.9 billion, respectively. The increase at the Machinery & Infrastructure was mainly attributable to business expansions of P.T. Bussan Auto Finance and Mitsui Automotive CIS Investment B.V. (Netherlands). The increases at the Americas and the Energy was mainly attributable to acquisitions of subsidiaries such as Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. in the Energy Segment and Ellison Technologies Inc. and Steel Technologies, Inc. in the Americas segment. On the other hand, expenses at the Consumer Service & IT Segment and the Foods & Retail Segment declined as a result of business reorganizations including exit and disposal of domestic businesses. With regard to the Energy Segment and the Mineral & Metal Resources Segment, they have relatively small numbers of employees and little correlation between gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses compared to other operating segments such as the Machinery & Infrastructure Projects Segment and the Consumer Service & IT Segment. See Item 6.D. Employees for further details of numbers of employees. 89 Table of Contents Provision for Doubtful Receivables Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 Provision for doubtful receivables for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥19.5 billion, an increase of ¥11.4 billion, or 140.7%, from ¥8.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008, reflecting the tightening of credit sparked by the intensifying financial turmoil. Provisions for both periods consisted of an accumulation of reserves for individually small receivables, including those of P.T. Bussan Auto Finance. Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 Provision for doubtful receivables for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥8.1 billion, a decline of ¥3.8 billion, or 31.9%, from ¥11.9 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. Provisions for the year ended March 31, 2008 consisted of a number of individually small receivables. For the year ended March 31, 2007, major factors were a new provision for an overseas oil exploration company, an increase in the provision for motorcycle retail finance at P.T. Bussan Auto Finance reflecting its expanding operations and an increase in the provision at Fertilizantes Mitsui S.A. Industria e Comercio (Brazil). Interest Income and Interest Expense Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 Interest income for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥40.0 billion, a decline of ¥17.3 billion, or 30.2%, from ¥57.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. Interest expense was ¥75.0 billion, a decline of ¥31.2 billion, or 29.4%, from ¥106.2 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. As a result, interest expense, net of interest income was ¥35.0 billion, a decline of ¥13.9 billion from ¥48.9 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008.  Interest expense for the Sakhalin II project declined by ¥4.6 billion as a result of declines in U.S dollar interest rates.  Mitsui recorded a ¥1.5 billion increase in interest expense, net of interest income.  Reflecting lower U.S. dollar interest rates, interest expense at overseas subsidiaries declined by ¥11.3 billion, out of which a ¥7.6 billion decline was attributable to the Americas Segment. In general, interest income tends to show similar patterns of fluctuations as interest expense. We provide loans and deferred payment facilities, which generate interest income, by funding our borrowings from financial institutions. Usually, both interest expense and interest income have the same interest rate type, floating or fixed. Accordingly, most fluctuations in interest income are offset by corresponding fluctuations in interest expense. With respect to interest rate swaps employed to manage interest rate risk exposure, see Item 5.B. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesFunding Sources. Interest rate trends for the year ended March 31, 2009 regarding the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar, in which we have borrowings, were as follows:  Following the reduction in the policy interest rate by the Bank of Japan twice in October and December 2008 the Bank of Japan purchased CP and corporate bonds from the market as a further response of easing monetary policy. As a result, policy interest rate became close to zero percent, but reflecting turmoil in the financial and capital markets, spreads implied in the borrowing rates for the companies remained high. Market interest rate (the average of the month-end Japanese yen three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)) for the year ended March 31, 2009 was 0.85% on par with 0.87% for the year ended March 31, 2008. On the other hand, the average yield rate on 10-year Japanese Government Bonds was 1.45% for the year ended March 31, 2009, down from 1.59% during the year 90 Table of Contents ended March 31, 2008 supported by the aforementioned easing monetary policy although there were upward pressures on rate from the expectation of the economic rebound as well as concerns on supply-demand imbalance of Government Bonds after the beginning of the current year.  The FRB gradually lowered the Federal Funds target rate to 0-0.25% in December 2008 in response to stabilizing the financial market following the sub-prime mortgage crisis. This is the first time the FRB had virtually taken zero interest rate policy in its history. The FRB provided enough liquidity to the interbank markets and implemented additional monetary easing measures including purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets. However, risk spread implied in the interest rates remained high reflecting the uncertainties in the market including bankruptcy risk of the major automobile companies in the U.S. As a result, the average of the month-end U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR during the year ended March 31, 2009 was 2.36%, down from the average of 4.66% during the year ended March 31, 2008. For information regarding development of our investment plans and financial policies, refer to B. Liquidity and Capital Resources. Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 Interest income for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥57.3 billion, an increase of ¥7.5 billion, or 15.1%, from ¥49.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. Interest expense was ¥106.2 billion, an increase of ¥13.7 billion, or 14.8%, from ¥92.5 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. As a result, interest expense, net of interest income, was ¥48.9 billion, an increase of ¥6.2 billion, or 14.5%, from ¥42.7 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. A breakdown of the principal changes for the year ended March 31, 2008 is as follows:  Interest expense for the Sakhalin II project declined by ¥7.2 billion as a result of the transfer of our 50% stake in the project and subsequent decline in related interest bearing debt.  Mitsui recorded a ¥5.5 billion increase in interest expense, net of interest income, reflecting higher Japanese yen interest rates.  Reflecting increased interest bearing debt used to fund various investments, interest expense at overseas subsidiaries increased by ¥6.6 billion, out of which a ¥5.6 billion increase was attributable to the Americas Segment. Interest rate trends for the year ended March 31, 2008 regarding the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar, in which we have borrowings, were as follows:  The Bank of Japan raised the policy interest rate in February 2007 but kept policy interest rates on hold thereafter. Reflecting steady growth of the Japanese economy in the first half of the year market interest rate ( the average of the month-end Japanese yen three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)) for the year ended March 31, 2008 rose to 0.87% from 0.45% for the year ended March 31, 2007. On the other hand, the average yield rate on 10-year Japanese Government Bonds was 1.59% for the year ended March 31, 2008, down from 1.75% during the year ended March 31, 2007.  The FRB raised the Federal Funds target rate to 5.25% in June 2006 and kept the rate level thereafter. However, it gradually lowered the rate from September 2007 in response to a concern about economic slowdown triggered by the sub-prime mortgage crisis, to 2.25% in March 2008, showing its attitude to provide an actual money rate of zero. The FRB then lowered the rate to 2.0% in April 2008. The average of the month-end U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR during the year ended March 31, 2008 was 4.66%, down from the average of 5.35% during the year ended March 31, 2007.

Dividends from LNG projects in Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Oman amounted to ¥23.4 billion, a decline of ¥3.2 billion over the year ended March 31, 2007, which was offset by increased dividends from other investees including INPEX Holdings Inc. held by Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd.

(Japan) for the year ended March 31, 2009, we posted substantial gains for the year ended March 31, 2008, as a result of several large scale divestitures such as the sale of a part of our stake in the Sakhalin II project and our whole stake in EBM in Brazil. Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 Gain on sales of securities for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥92.3 billion, a substantial increase of ¥33.5 billion, or 57.0%, from ¥58.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. Since the year ended March 31, 2007, Mitsui continuously conducted scrutiny on whole investments held by operating segments to optimize the business portfolio. Consequently it recorded gains on the sales of shares mainly in listed companies.  For the year ended March 31, 2008, the largest part of the gains came from the sale of a part of Mitsuis stake in the Sakhalin II project; sales of its entire holding in EBM in Brazil; and sale of additional shares in Toho Titanium Co., Ltd.

Subsequent to that date, the Nikkei Stock Average once rebounced to ¥14,489.44 in June 2008, but resumed its downward trend over the summer.

During the year ended March 31, 2008, the Nikkei Stock Average recorded a high of ¥18,261.98 due to the rise of expectations for expanding Japanese corporate earnings, but retreated from highs reflecting declines in global stock prices and Japanese yen appreciation, triggered by the sub-prime mortgage crisis, and recorded ¥12,525.54 as of March 31, 2008.  The losses for the year ended March 31, 2008 included write-downs on listed shares for ¥28.0 billion, including ¥4.5 billion for Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. in the Foods & Retail Segment and ¥4.5 billion for Central Finance Co., Ltd. in the Logistics & Financial Markets Segment.

(Japan), reflecting a decline in its share price. See the relevant discussions as described later on the impairment losses in Operating Results by Operating Segment in this item.  For the year ended March 31, 2008, we recorded a ¥2.0 billion loss for Mitsui Knowledge Industry Co., Ltd., reflecting a decline in its share price. Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 Impairment loss of Goodwill for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥2.0 billion, a decline of ¥14.5 billion, or 87.9%, from ¥16.5 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. Details of impairment losses are as below:  Mitsui Knowledge Industry Co., Ltd. (Japan) and NextCom K.K. (Japan), both of which were subsidiaries and listed on the second section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, were merged in April, 2007. At the merger, a ¥2.5 billion gain from the exchange of shares was recognized. For the year ended March 31, 2008, Mitsui Knowledge Industry Co., Ltd. (Japan) reported a ¥2.0 billion impairment loss on its goodwill, reflecting a decline in its share price.  For the year ended March 31, 2007, Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. reported a ¥16.5 billion impairment loss on all of its goodwill, using a discounted future cash flow method based on its internal operating budget for evaluation of fair value of its goodwill. After reporting this significant impairment loss, Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. recorded net income of ¥0.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008, a marginal income which the management had expected considering continuously strict business conditions. The carrying amounts of goodwill as of March 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were ¥33.6 billion, ¥52.5 billion and ¥37.2 billion, respectively. For more information, see Note 12, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. Despite the fact that the Americas Segment recorded a ¥13.6 billion impairment loss of goodwill for the year ended March 31, 2009, goodwill recorded at the segment still accounts for 42% of the total goodwill outstanding balance as of March 31, 2009, and most of the goodwill in the segment belongs to subsidiaries in the United States. As of the date of this annual report, management continues to pay a close attention to the operating results and business of the subsidiaries in the United States in monitoring the possibility of occurrence of additional goodwill impairment, considering the prolonged economic slowdown in the United States. Other ExpenseNet Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 Other Expensenet for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥46.5 billion, an increase of expense of ¥43.5 billion, or 1,450%, from ¥3.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008.  Mitsui recorded foreign exchange losses of ¥17.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2009 including a loss of ¥13.6 billion on commodity trading activities in the Logistics & Financial Markets Segment which corresponded to the related profit recorded in gross profit in the same segment.  Exploration expenses at the oil & gas business increased. The salvage expenses of ¥4.5 billion for the Mexican gulf oil production facility seriously damaged by a hurricane and a liquidation cost of ¥3.7 billion of currency option transactions at Fertilizantes Mitsui S.A. Industria e Comercio were also recorded. 95 Table of Contents  A major component of other expensesnet for the year ended March 31, 2008 was exploration expenses, mainly at Mitsui E&P Australia Pty Limited (Australia). Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 Other expensenet for the year ended March 31, 2008 was a ¥3.0 billion expense, an increase of ¥2.5 billion, or 500.0%, from a loss of ¥0.5 billion in expenses for the year ended March 31, 2007. A major component of other expensesnet for the year ended March 31, 2008 was exploration expenses, mainly at Mitsui E&P Australia Pty Limited (Australia). For the year ended March 31, 2007, restructuring-related charges were reported mainly by MITSUI FOODS CO., LTD. (Japan) and Hokushuren Company Limited (Japan). For more information on other expensenet, see Note 19, OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME)NET. and on our restructuring activities, see Note 24, EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES. Income Taxes Comparison between the year ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 Income taxes for the year ended March 31, 2009 were ¥119.4 billion, a decline of ¥51.8 billion, or 30.3%, from ¥171.2 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008 due to a decline in income from continuing operations before income taxes, minority interests and equity in earnings. The effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2009 was 48.3%, an increase of 5.7 percentage points from 42.6% for the year ended March 31, 2008. The increase in the effective tax rate was due mainly to an increase in the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets after evaluating the recoverability of deferred tax assets, which was partially offset by a decline in the effective tax rate attributable to the application of lower income tax rates to certain taxable income at overseas subsidiaries and a decline in the effect of taxation on dividends. The increase in the valuation allowance include a ¥20.8 billion valuation allowance recorded at Mitsui based on new tax laws to be applied for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010. The new tax laws allow tax payers to deduct 95% of dividend received income from foreign subsidiaries, which are 25% or more owned foreign investees in this context, and therefore, Mitsuis future taxable incomes after the year ending March 31, 2010 are expected to be reduced. Also from the year ending March 31, 2010, Mitsui and its 100% domestic subsidiaries will file a consolidated tax return as a group. Under the circumstances, we forecasted the future taxable incomes of the consolidated tax group as well as of Mitsui stand alone basis, and evaluated the realizability of the deferred tax assets. As a result of the analysis, we recognized the valuation allowance of ¥20.8 billion since we determined that a recovery of a part of deferred tax assets is highly unlikely. For further information, see Note 20, INCOME TAXES. 96 Table of Contents Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 For the year ended March 31, 2008, income taxes were ¥171.2 billion, an increase of ¥25.9 billion, or 17.8%, from ¥145.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007, reflecting increases in income from continuing operations before income taxes, minority interests and equity in earnings. The effective tax rate was 42.6%, a decline of 4.4 percentage points from 47.0% for the year ended March 31, 2007. The decline was seen in the effect of taxation on dividends, application of lower income tax rates to certain taxable income at overseas subsidiaries and changes in valuation allowance, which was partly offset by a higher income tax rate on certain natural resources extracting activities including those in Australia, Thailand and Oman. Transfer price taxation issue with North West Shelf LNG Project Mitsui was audited by the Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau with regard to transfer pricing on the LNG Project in Western Australia for the six fiscal years from the year ended March 31, 2000 to the year ended March 31, 2005. Mitsui received notices of tax assessment from the Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau for the years ended March 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002 and paid approximately ¥10.7 billion in total. Mitsui disagreed with the assessment, registered its protest and lodged an application in November 2006 for the mutual agreement procedure pursuant to a provision in the tax treaty between Japan and Australia in order to settle the double taxation. In December 2008, the competent authorities of Japan and Australia reached the mutual agreement, and Mitsui received abatement regarding the tax assessments while our associated company in Australia also received a tax refund for the taxable income adjustment from the Australian tax authority. The total of the tax assessment, the abatement and the reversal of FIN48 reserve at Mitsui was recorded in Income Taxes. For further information, see Note 20, INCOME TAXES. As of March 31, 2009, the earliest tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions in which the companies operate are the year ended March 31, 2003 for Japan; the year ended March 31, 2006 for the United States; and the year ended March 31, 2005 for Australia. Minority Interests in Earnings of Subsidiaries Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 Minority interests in earnings of subsidiaries for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥35.1 billion, a decline of ¥10.9 billion, or 23.7%, from ¥46.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008.

(Netherlands) (with a minority interest of 38.1%) and Mitsui E&P Mozambique Area 1 (Republic of Mozambique) (with a minority interest of 74.4% reported declines in minority interests in earnings of subsidiaries while Novus International Inc. (U.S.A.) (with a minority interest of 35.0%) reported an increase. 97 Table of Contents Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 Minority interests in earnings of subsidiaries for the year ended March 31, 2008 were ¥46.0 billion, a large increase of ¥28.1 billion, or 157.0%, from ¥17.9 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. Minority interests in earnings of subsidiaries increased due to the following factors:  The Energy Segment recorded minority interests in earnings of ¥20.6 billion and ¥1.7 billion for the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007, most of which related to Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. (Japan) (with a minority interest of 48.5%), which became a subsidiary as a result of the acquisition of additional voting shares in Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. (Japan) during the fourth quarter of the year ended March 31, 2007.  In the Foods & Retail Segment, for the year ended March 31, 2007 Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. (Japan) (with a minority interest of 48.1%) recorded a loss from continuing operations before minority interests and equity in earnings, reflecting significant impairment losses on long-lived assets and goodwill, contributing ¥8.3 billion in minority interests in income for the year ended March 31, 2007.

Equity in Earnings of Associated CompaniesNet (After Income Tax Effect) Comparison between the years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 Equity in earnings of associated companiesnet (after income tax effect) for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥84.8 billion, a decline of ¥69.5 billion, or 45.0%, from ¥154.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008 as a result of the followings (See Operating Results by Operating Segment for detailed discussion.):  An increase of ¥11.0 billion at Robe River Mining Company (Australia) reflecting an increase in iron ore prices.  A decline in earnings at Compania Minera Dona Ines de Collahuasi SCM (Chile) of ¥7.4 billion due to the drop in copper prices, an increase in production cost and the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese Yen.  A decline at Valepar S.A.(*1) of ¥4.9 billion reflecting a reduction in earnings at its investee, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (Vale), mainly due to a sharp drop in nickel prices as well as appreciation of the Brazilian Real against the U.S. Dollar partially offset by an increase in iron ore prices.  A decline in earnings due to impairment losses of approximately ¥54.0 billion including a loss of ¥28.0 billion for Sims Metal Management Limited and a loss of ¥7.6 billion for Penske Automotive Group, Inc., reflecting other-than-temporary declines in share prices of these listed associated companies.  Overseas power producing businesses such as IPM Eagle LLP (United Kingdom) reported an increase of ¥6.9 billion due to a reversal effect that Australian power producing operation recorded mark-to-market evaluation losses on power swap contracts for the corresponding previous year(*2). (*1) Valepar S.A. is a controlling shareholder of Vale, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, a mineral resources company in Brazil, legally renamed Vale S.A. in May 2009. (*2) An Australian power producing operation of IPM Eagle had concluded a long term power price swap contract, corresponding to a power supply contract until 2016. Reflecting fluctuations in the Australian open electricity market, it recognizes mark-to-market evaluation profit and loss. See also Machinery & Infrastructure Projects Segment of Operating Results by Operating Segment for further information. 98 Table of Contents  An increase in earnings at Japan Australia LNG (MIMI) PTY. Ltd. (Australia) reflecting an increase in oil prices as well as a higher price of condensate sold to Mittwell Resources Pty. Ltd.

The business units also collaborate with overseas branches and overseas trading subsidiaries in planning and executing their strategies for products and regions. The overseas branches and overseas trading subsidiaries are separate operating units, which are delegated responsibility for the business of their regions as the centers of each particular regional strategy and operate diversified businesses together with their subsidiaries and associated companies in collaboration with the business units. Therefore, our operating segments consist of product-focused operating segments comprised of the business units of the Head Office and region-focused operating segments comprised of overseas branches and overseas trading subsidiaries. Our operating segments have been aggregated based on the nature of the products and other criteria into eight product-focused reportable operating segments and three region-focused reportable operating segments, totaling eleven reportable operating segments. Based on the reorganization effective April 1, 2008, the following subsidiaries previously included in the Machinery & Infrastructure Projects and the Chemical Segments were transferred to the Americas Segment.

The domestic steel products business which enjoyed a steady growth up to the first half of the current fiscal year but faced a drastic change in the environment following the sharp escalation of financial stress and the decline in global economy. The rapid demand destruction resulted in lower sales volume and a sharp drop in prices of all steel products in the second half of the current fiscal year. Except for demand of steel tubular products for oil field applications, which was softened by destocking, foreign trading transactions of various products such as steel sheets and plates for automobiles and shipbuilding, steel tubular products and line pipes for oil and gas development including transactions carried out by Regency Steel Asia Pte Ltd. to Asian markets decelerated due to a sharp decline in demand for the same reasons mentioned above. As a result, Regency Steel Asia Pte Ltd. was forced to recognize a valuation loss on inventories while it recorded solid results for the first half of the current fiscal year supported by continued favorable demand. Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥17.4 billion, a decline of ¥8.2 billion from ¥25.6 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008, reflecting a decline in gross profit. Equity in losses of associated companiesnet (after income tax effect) for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥1.3 billion, a decline of ¥6.2 billion from earnings of ¥4.9 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. On top of lower earnings of associated companies in general due to the economic slowdown, we recognized an impairment loss of ¥3.4 billion, reflecting a decline in the listed share price of Nippon Steel Trading Co., Ltd. Net loss for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥4.8 billion, a ¥25.0 billion decline from earnings of ¥20.2 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. In addition to the decline in operating income and equity in earnings, a decline in gains on sales of securities and recognition of impairment losses of ¥13.3 billion on listed securities, including a ¥9.6 billion impairment loss on shares of Nippon Steel Corporation, resulted in the decline in net income. Comparison between the Year Ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥61.3 billion, an increase of ¥3.5 billion from ¥57.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. Overall steel products business continued to show solid performance mainly in high-end tubular products for energy applications, automobile steel plates and shipbuilding steel plates. Regency Steel Asia Pte Ltd. (Singapore) also contributed to the increase in earnings, reflecting robust operations for construction material, tubular products and steel plates for the Asian market. Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥25.6 billion, the same as the year ended March 31, 2007. The increase in gross profit was mainly offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Equity in earnings of associated companiesnet (after income tax effect) for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥4.9 billion, an increase of ¥1.8 billion from ¥3.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥20.2 billion, a ¥0.4 billion decline from ¥20.6 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007, due to a decline of gain on sales of securities, although there was an increase in equity in earnings of associated companies. 104 Table of Contents Mineral & Metal Resources Segment Billions of Yen Years Ended March 31, Change(20092008) Change(20082007) 2009 2008 2007 Gross Profit ¥ 119.2 ¥ 95.8 ¥ 111.0 ¥ 23.4 ¥ (15.2 ) Operating Income 104.5 79.0 91.3 25.5 (12.3 ) Equity in Earnings of Associated CompaniesNet (After Income Tax Effect) 39.4 71.2 60.3 (31.8 ) 10.9 Net Income 90.0 177.0 98.4 (87.0 ) 78.6 Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥119.2 billion, an increase of ¥23.4 billion from ¥95.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008.  The main factor contributing to the increase in gross profit from iron ore mining operations was the increase in iron ore annual contract prices. Reflecting the tight market condition in emerging and developing countries, especially in China, iron ore prices for the year ended March 31, 2009 increased substantially from prices for the year ended March 31, 2008. Following the settlement of Brazilian iron ore fines with increases of 65~71%, Australian iron ore lump and fines prices were settled with an increase of 96.5% and 79.9% respectively. FOB (Free On Board) prices of Brazilian iron ore and Australian iron ore had been at the same level as was the customary practice in this industry up to the year ended March 31, 2008. However, Australian iron ore producers insisted that different prices be applied, reflecting the ocean freight difference between Australia and Brazil to major markets, such as China and Japan.  Due to the global economic slowdown triggered by the financial turmoil, the world crude steel production fell sharply in the three month period ended December 31, 2008 and the production for the year ended March 31, 2009 was down by approximately 9%, from that of the year ended March 31, 2008. Crude steel production in China, which had been sharply increasing in the recent years, fell off dramatically in the three month period ended December 31, 2008 and the total production for the year ended March 31, 2009 was flat, compared with the year ended March 31, 2008. Experiencing decline in sales volume under such a weak demand situation as well as the weakening Australian Dollar vis-à-vis the Japanese Yen, the iron ore mining operating business recorded a decline in gross profit for the three month period ended March 31, 2009 compared with the corresponding three month period of the previous year although the gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2009 still recorded a modest increase from the year ended March 31, 2008, thanks to the increase in iron ore annual prices as mentioned above. Consequently, increases in gross profit recorded by Mitsui Iron Ore Development and Mitsui Itochu Iron were ¥23.3 billion and ¥2.0 billion, respectively. Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥104.5 billion, an increase of ¥25.5 billion from ¥79.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008, reflecting the increase in gross profit. Equity in earnings of associated companiesnet (after income tax effect) for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥39.4 billion, a decline of ¥31.8 billion from ¥71.2 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. Major factors were as follows:  Earnings at Robe River Mining Company were ¥22.3 billion, an increase of ¥11.0 billion from ¥11.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008, reflecting the increase in iron ore prices.  Compania Minera Dona Ines de Collahuasi SCM, a Chilean copper mining company, recorded earnings of ¥11.5 billion, a decline of ¥7.4 billion from ¥18.9 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008 due to an increase in production costs and the depreciation of the U.S.Dollar against the Japanese Yen. 105 Table of Contents  Valepar S.A. posted earnings of ¥29.2 billion, a decline of ¥4.9 billion from ¥34.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008, reflecting a reduction in earnings at, its investee, Vale, mainly due to a drop in nickel prices as well as the depreciation of the Brazilian Real against the Japanese Yen.  Reflecting a decline in the listed share price of Sims Metal Management Limited, we recognized an impairment loss of ¥28.0 billion. Net income for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥90.0 billion, a decline of ¥87.0 billion from ¥177.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. In addition to the factors mentioned above there are the following factors:  Other expense-net was a loss of ¥0.4 billion, a decline of ¥4.8 billion from a profit of ¥4.4 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008, as a result of a foreign exchange translation loss of ¥3.6 billion related to a borrowing denominated in U.S. Dollars at Mitsui Raw Material Development Pty. Limited (Australia). In addition, this segment recorded a loss of ¥3.0 billion on write-down of securities including an impairment loss on shares of JFE Holdings, Inc. (Japan).  Increase in operating income and equity in earnings were offset by a significant reversal effect from gains of ¥93.9 billion on the sale of our whole stake in Sesa Goa Limited(*) and of ¥12.4 billion on the sale of shares in EBM, a Brazilian iron ore company for the year ended March 31, 2008. Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥95.8 billion, a decline of ¥15.2 billion from ¥111.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007 as a result of the following:  The divestiture in April 2007 of our entire holding in Sesa Goa Limited, formerly our iron ore subsidiary, which resulted in a decline of ¥27.2 billion(*) in this segments gross profit, the amount which Sesa Goa Limited contributed for the year ended March 31, 2007.  Reflecting tight supply-demand balance in Asia, especially in China, iron ore prices for the year ending March 31, 2008 increased by 9.5 % from the year ended March 31, 2007. Consequently, gross profit at Mitsui Iron Ore Development Pty. Ltd. (Australia) and Mitsui Itochu Iron Pty. Ltd. (Australia) increased by ¥8.7 billion and ¥4.3 billion, respectively. At Mitsui Iron Ore Development Pty. Ltd. and Mitsui Itochu Iron Pty. Ltd., shipments (on our equity production basis) stayed at almost the same levels of 22.6 million tons and 3.1 million tons respectively for the year ended March 31, 2008, compared to 22.8 million tons and 2.9 million tons respectively for the year ended March 31, 2007. Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥79.0 billion, a decline of ¥12.3 billion from ¥91.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007, due to the above-mentioned decline in gross profit. There was a marginal improvement in selling, general administrative expenses as a result of the divestiture of Sesa Goa Limited. Equity in earnings of associated companiesnet (after income tax effect) for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥71.2 billion, an increase of ¥10.9 billion from ¥60.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. Major factors contributing to the increase were as follows:  Valepar S.A. (Brazil) posted a net income of ¥34.1 billion, an increase of ¥9.1 billion from ¥25.0 billion including a ¥5.6 billion one-time gain on issuance of stock by Vale in exchange for Caemi Mineraçã o e (*) In the consolidated statements of income, net income of Sesa Goa for the years ended March 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are presented as income from discontinued operations (after income tax effect). However, in this Operating Results by Operating Segment, operating results of Sesa Goa have been included in and presented as continuing operation. 106 Table of Contents Metalurgia S.A stock in the year ended March 31, 2007. This increase is due to strong operating results of Vale reflecting higher iron prices and contributions from newly acquired Inco Limited (currently Vale Inco Limited) following the acquisition by Vale during the fourth quarter of the year ended March 31, 2007.  Earnings of Compania Minera Dona Ines de Collahuasi SCM (Chile) was a net income of ¥18.9 billion, a decline of ¥0.3 billion from the year ended March 31, 2007. The LME copper price for 2007 (calendar year) was U.S.$7,126 per ton on average compared to U.S.$6,731 per ton for 2006 (calendar year).  Sims Group Limited (Australia), a metal recycler, added a new contribution in earnings of ¥1.9 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. Net income for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥177.0 billion, a significant increase of ¥78.6 billion from ¥98.4 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. Besides the above-mentioned factors, there were significant gains from divestitures for the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 as follows:  For the year ended March 31, 2008, this segment recorded a ¥93.9 billion gain on the sale of its whole stake in Sesa Goa Limited(*). In addition, it also recorded a ¥12.4 billion gain on the sale of shares in Empreendimentos Brasileiros de Mineração S.A.  For the years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007, this segment recorded ¥14.2 billion and ¥9.4 billion gains on the sale of shares in Toho Titanium Co., Ltd. (Japan), respectively. Short- and Long-Term Outlook on Prices and Supply-Demand Balance for Iron Ore, and Our Equity Production Short-Term Pricing and Supply-Demand Balance Major suppliers including our joint venture businesses in Australia in which we participate with major overseas mineral resources companies conclude long-term supply contracts with various clients in the world including Japanese and Chinese steel manufacturers. Based on such contracts, sales prices are reviewed and renegotiated each fiscal year. (Unit prices for iron ore from each mine in production also reflect the difference of respective grades and types.) Until the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 prices continued to run up driven by increased demands especially in China as well as tightened supplies from Australia and Brazil due to their limited production capacities. Annual prices for the year ended March 31, 2009 rose sharply after long negotiations, resulting in 65-96.5% price increases depending on the grades and types over the annual prices for the year ended March 31, 2008. Nevertheless, economic slowdown triggered by the financial crisis in September 2008 changed the situation drastically. Crude steel production in the world, even in China, which is the world largest crude steel producing country, rapidly declined, and as a result, iron ore producers were forced to adjust their productions as well as shipments and spot prices of iron ore dropped. While crude steel production in China is showing signs of recovery, production in the rest of the world remains to be under tremendous pressure. Under such circumstances, one major Australian iron ore producer announced in early June that it had settled its iron ore contract for the year ending March 31, 2010 with major iron ore consumers in Asian countries such as Japan, Korea and Taiwan with price reductions of 32.9% for fine ore and 44.5% for lump ore from the prices for the year ended March 31, 2009. On June 10, 2009, a major Brazilian iron ore producer announced that it concluded negotiations with Japanese and Korean (*) In the consolidated statements of income, net income of Sesa Goa for the years ended March 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are presented as income from discontinued operations (after income tax effect). However, in this Operating Results by Operating Segment, operating results of Sesa Goa have been included in and presented as continuing operation. 107 Table of Contents iron ore consumers with price reductions of 28.2% for fine ore, 44.5% for lump ore and 48.3% for pellet from the prices for the year ended March 31, 2009. As of July 10, 2009, the both iron ore producers remain in price negotiations with other consumers including Chinese consumers. The other major Australian iron ore producer has not made any announcement regarding its annual contract price negotiation for the year ending March 31, 2010. Fluctuations in iron ore prices directly affect revenues from the equity-based production at our iron ore subsidiaries and associated companies. For the year ending March 31, 2010, we estimate that the impact on net income from a change of U.S.$1 per ton in iron ore price would be approximately ¥2.0 billion. For the year ended March 31, 2009, the equity-based shipments of our overseas subsidiaries and associated companies amounted to approximately 39 million tons of iron ore. The above-mentioned effect is calculated based on the assumptions of an estimated decline in production in line with our holdings after the year ended March 31, 2009, and a specific range of foreign exchange rates for the Japanese yen, U.S. dollar, Australian dollar and Brazilian real. Although the rate of run-up in material and equipment costs as well as utility and personnel costs has halted due to the global economic slowdown, the cost is expected not to decline immediately since the impact of such cost reductions has certain time lag and the effect of increased unit cost due to lower production volumes offsets the cost reduction. In natural resource producing countries such as Australia and Brazil, there is a general trend toward currency appreciation in line with the growing export of those products, resulting in a negative impact on the revenues of our overseas subsidiaries and associated companies. Middle- and Long-Term Price Outlook and Supply-Demand Balance and Trends in Our Equity Production Due to the contraction of activity and trade provoked by the dramatic escalation of the financial crisis, the demand for iron ore is likely to decline in the short-term. However, in the mid- and long-term, it is expected that steel products demand in developing countries remains strong, and consequently. In order to respond to such increasing demand, major iron ore producers intend to continue investing to expand their production capacity. As of March 31, 2009, noteworthy developments in iron ore projects in which we hold stakes are as follows: (Unless otherwise noted, production amounts represent a 100% basis.)  Our iron ore mining joint ventures led by the BHP Billiton group completed expansion to raise the combined iron ore production capacity to 129 million tons per annum from 118 million tons. In addition, the joint venture members further agreed to an expansion plan to increase annual production capacity to 155 million tons and to start production by 2010. Furthermore, joint venture members approved expansion plan in November 2009 involving the expansion of railway and ports in parallel with the current construction, with the aim being to increase annual production capacity to 205 million tons by latter half of 2011.  In the iron ore mining joint venture led by Rio Tinto group, participants agreed to a plan in 2007 to expand port capacity at Cape Lambert in the Pilbara region of Western Australia from nameplate capacity of 55 to 80 million tons per annum, and completed the project in November 2008. In addition, the joint ventures agreed to approve capital investment representing pre-approval of expenditures for material and equipment with an aim to increase annual capacity to 180 million. Furthermore, the joint venture decided to develop the Mesa A / Warramboo mine in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. The new mine will have a full scale capacity of 25 million tons per annum and is expected to start production in 2010. The total mine life of Mesa A is expected to be 11 years. With this addition, total production of Robe Valley pisolite ore will be maintained at 32 million tons per annum. Including those we are participating in, most of the iron ore mining projects have plans for expanding their production capacity in response to forecasted iron ore demand increase in mid- and long-term. As there are too many uncertainties including demand from China and other emerging countries, it is difficult for our management to draw up definitive forecasts on supply-demand balance and prices at this point in time. 108 Table of Contents Machinery & Infrastructure Projects Segment Billions of Yen Years Ended March 31, Change(20092008) Change(20082007) 2009 2008 2007 Gross Profit ¥ 106.3 ¥ 119.7 ¥ 101.9 ¥ (13.4 ) ¥ 17.8 Operating Income 16.0 30.1 19.4 (14.1 ) 10.7 Equity in Earnings of Associated CompaniesNet (After Income Tax Effect) 13.9 20.3 21.4 (6.4 ) (1.1 ) Net Income 21.8 34.4 33.2 (12.6 ) 1.2 Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥106.3 billion, a decline of ¥13.4 billion from ¥119.7 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008.  While the motorcycle retail finance company P.T. Bussan Auto Finance continued to show solid performance, the Motor Vehicle Business Unit reported a decline of ¥5.9 billion in gross profit due to a decline in import and sales transactions of finished cars and auto parts logistics business activities in the Americas and less business activity as a result of restructuring of subsidiaries in Europe, reflecting contraction of demand inflicted by the massive financial crisis.  Despite the financial turmoil and the sluggish freight market, the Marine & Aerospace Business Unit showed relatively stable performance through marketing commercial vessels, trading in used vessels, operating and chartering vessels for the year ended March 31, 2009. Nevertheless, this business unit reported a decline of ¥3.7 billion in gross profit due to a reversal effect from profit on delivery of some new vessels realized in the year ended March 31, 2008.  Infrastructure Projects Business Unit reported a decline of ¥3.9 billion in gross profit due to less demand for and overhaul of rolling stock at leasing subsidiaries in North America and Europe and fewer deliveries in plant business. Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥16.0 billion, a decline of ¥14.1 billion from ¥30.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. The major factors were increases in selling, general and administrative expenses and in the provision for doubtful receivables at the Marine & Aerospace and the Infrastructure Projects Business Units in addition to the decline in gross profit. Equity in earnings of associated companiesnet (after income tax effect) for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥13.9 billion, a decline of ¥6.4 billion from ¥20.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. Major factors were as follows:  Overseas power producing businesses such as IPM UK Power Holdings Limited, IPM Eagle LLP and P.T. Paiton Energy reported equity in earnings of ¥10.6 billion, an increase of ¥6.5 billion from equity in earnings of ¥4.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. Power producing operations recorded a ¥0.3 billion mark-to-market evaluation gain related to long-term power contracts while Australian power producing operations recorded a ¥5.8 billion mark-to-market evaluation loss on long-term swap agreement for the year ended March 31, 2008.  This segment recorded equity in losses of ¥6.1 billion (this segment portion) for Penske Automotive Group, Inc., ¥3.2 billion for Toyo Engineering Corporation (Japan) and ¥2.1 billion for ASAHI TEC CORPORATION (Japan), reflecting declines in the share prices. The segment also recorded a loss of ¥4.4 billion (this segment portion) for ASAHI TEC CORPORATION for the same reason in the year ended March 31, 2008.  Other than the above-mentioned factors, this segment recorded a profit from sales of vessels at marine business for the year ended March 31, 2009 and had a reversal effect of profit from sale of real estate in automotive related business for the year ended March 31, 2008. 109 Table of Contents Net income for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥21.8 billion, a decline of ¥12.6 billion from ¥34.4 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. In addition to the above-mentioned factors, major factors were as follows:  This segment recorded a loss of ¥8.2 billion on write-down of securities of Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd. The segment posted a positive tax effect of ¥6.9 billion in Income Taxes including the effect of the impairment loss of ¥8.6 billion for the previous year(*1).  This segment recorded a gain of ¥5.5 billion(*2) on the sale of leased aircraft held by Tombo Aviation Inc. for the year ended March 31, 2008. Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥119.7 billion, an increase of ¥17.8 billion from ¥101.9 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007.  Overseas automotive-related subsidiaries continued to post solid performance, particularly the motorcycle retail finance company P.T. Bussan Auto Finance (Indonesia) reported higher gross profit, along with an automobile sales dealer company in Russia and other areas.  Ocean vessels and marine project businesses showed overall strong performance through marketing newly built and second hand vessels, operating and chartering vessels and energy related businesses, supported by continued strong demand.  Gross profit increased due to expanding operations at the two rolling stock leasing subsidiaries in Europe and plant businesses including power generation businesses. Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥30.1 billion, an increase of ¥10.7 billion from ¥19.4 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. The increase is primarily attributable to the improvement in gross profit in ocean vessels and marine project businesses and infrastructure projects businesses. Operating income of automotive and machine tools related subsidiaries slightly increased, as increases in their gross profit was mostly offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses and provision for doubtful receivables. Equity in earnings of associated companiesnet (after income tax effect) for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥20.3 billion, a decline of ¥1.1 billion from ¥21.4 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007.  Overseas power producing businesses such as IPM Eagle LLP (United Kingdom) and P.T. Paiton Energy (Indonesia) reported equity in earnings of ¥4.1 billion in total, a decline of ¥5.4 billion from ¥9.5 billion earnings for the year ended March 31, 2007. The decline is due to a ¥5.8 billion mark-to-market evaluation losses for the year ended March 31, 2008 which were recorded mainly by IPM Eagle on long-term swap contracts, among others in its Australian power producing operations. (*1) Mitsui records an impairment loss on a marketable security if a decline in the share price is other-than-temporary. Basically a 30% or more decline in fair value of a security leads to the conclusion that the security has an other-than-temporary impairment. Among those determined to be other-than-temporary impaired, a 50% or less decline in fair value of a security is a nondeductible impairment loss based on Japanese tax laws and regulations. Mitsui evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets for nondeductible impairment losses and set up valuation allowances if it is more likely than not that they are not considered recoverable. (*2) In this Operating Results by Operating Segment, the gain on the sale of aircraft has been included in and presented as continuing operations. In the consolidated statement of income, the gain of ¥4.4 billion on the sale for the year ended March 31, 2008 is presented as income from discontinued operations (after income tax effect). 110 Table of Contents  This segment recorded a ¥4.4 billion equity in loss reflecting an other-than-temporary decline in share price of ASAHI TEC CORPORATION (Japan)(*1), a manufacturer of ductile iron cast parts and aluminum forged parts.  The other associated companies reported improved earnings in general, such as the gas distribution companies in Brazil and the automotive and construction machinery related businesses. Net income for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥34.4 billion, an increase of ¥1.2 billion from ¥33.2 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. In addition to the above-mentioned factors, for the year ended March 31, 2008, this segment recorded:  gains on sales of aircraft which were previously leased to others at Tombo Aviation, Inc.

The market price of ASAHI TECH Corporation (listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange) declined significantly from the end of 2006 to the middle of 2007. For the year ended March 31, 2008, we concluded it was an other-than-temporary decline in fair value loss in the account title of equity in earnings/losses of associated companies.

(*3) Mitsuis Management principally recognizes that a 50% or more decline in fair value of a security from cost leads to the conclusion that the security has an other-than-temporary impairment. In addition, management recognizes an other-than-temporary impairment in case of a 30% or more and less than 50% decline, considering the materiality of declined value. The closing share price of Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd. at the Tokyo Stock Exchange was ¥1,834 leading to a more than 30% decline from the cost. As of the end of June 2008, its closing share price at the Tokyo Stock Exchange was ¥1,987, which was slightly less than a 30% decline. 111 Table of Contents Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥80.0 billion, a decline of ¥20.2 billion from ¥100.2 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. The principal developments in this segment were as follows:  Basic petrochemicals of upstream products recorded an increase of ¥3.1 billion in gross profit. The ethylene and propylene businesses contributed to the increase by focusing on reducing transportation costs as well as by marketing operations closely monitoring supply demand balance under the circumstances where global demand contraction and a further deterioration in market prices have been taking place. Despite the fact that the market price of ammonia plunged sharply after last autumn, P.T. Kaltim Pasifik Amoniak, a joint venture manufacturing and marketing company of ammonia, recorded an increase in gross profit due to higher price and an increase in sales volume in the first half of the current fiscal year.  Mid-stream intermediate products used for synthetic resin and synthetic fiber products overall recorded a decline of ¥6.8 billion in gross profit due to sharp declines in market prices as well as a further drop in demand.  Plastics and Functional Materials also recorded a decline of ¥7.9 billion in gross profit due to declines in the market prices coupled with a decline in demand.  On the other hand, supported by a globally stable demand for agriculture products, businesses of crop protection chemicals and fertilizer remained robust while sulfur and sulfuric acid, raw materials of fertilizer, decelerated sharply after last summer when the export custom duty for fertilizer products in China was raised which resulted in a decline in the demand and a decline in the price, resulting in a decline of ¥3.5 billion of gross profit. Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥24.2 billion, a decline of ¥18.6 billion from ¥42.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008, reflecting the decline in gross profit. Equity in earnings of associated companiesnet (after income tax effect) for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥1.7 billion, a decline of ¥4.1 billion from ¥5.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. While International Methanol Company, a joint venture methanol manufacturing company, recorded almost same level of earnings as the year ended March 31, 2008, the segment recorded an equity in loss reflecting impairments of Japanese listed shares. Net loss for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥10.2 billion, a decline of ¥28.5 billion from net income of ¥18.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. In addition to the above-mentioned factors, this segment recorded a loss of ¥30.0 billion on the write-down of securities including an ¥18.0 billion impairment loss on shares of Mitsui Chemicals, Inc. and a ¥4.2 billion impairment loss on shares in Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha LTD. Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥100.2 billion, an increase of ¥4.6 billion from ¥95.6 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. The principal developments in this segment were as follows:  Gross profit continued to stay at high levels, reflecting a solid performance mainly in ammonia and methanol; however, the basic petrochemicals business recorded a decline in gross profit due to a sharp decline in margins following a rapid increase in prices of crude oil and naphtha.  The sulphur business improved its performance, substantially supported by a globally strong demand for agriculture products. Performance of inorganic chemicals and plastics including IT related parts and components remained solid, reflecting a strong demand particularly in Asia. Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥42.8 billion, an increase of ¥6.6 billion from ¥36.2 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. 112 Table of Contents Equity in earnings of associated companiesnet (after income tax effect) for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥5.8 billion, an increase of ¥0.9 billion from ¥4.9 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥18.3 billion, a decline of ¥2.5 billion from ¥20.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. Besides the above-mentioned improvements for the year ended March 31, 2008, this segment recorded the following:  For the year ended March 31, 2007, this segment recorded a credit to income of ¥3.9 billion as a result of the reversal of the accrued cost which had been set up based on estimated cost for compensation and other charges related to the DPF incident during past years as a result of completion of the redemption of the relevant DPFs. For more information, see Note 21, COMPENSATION AND OTHER CHARGES RELATED TO DPF INCIDENT.  This segment recorded a gain on the sale of shares in Toho Titanium Co., Ltd., for the years ended March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2007.  For the year ended March 31, 2008, this segment recorded a ¥4.7 billion loss on the write down of shares mainly in Kaneka Corporation, reflecting other-than-temporary decline in their market prices. Energy Segment Billions of Yen Years Ended March 31, Change(20092008) Change(20082007) 2009 2008 2007 Gross Profit ¥ 272.0 ¥ 219.3 ¥ 123.9 ¥ 52.7 ¥ 95.4 Operating Income 214.1 172.5 81.3 41.6 91.2 Equity in Earnings of Associated CompaniesNet (After Income Tax Effect) 44.1 36.8 44.4 7.3 (7.6 ) Net Income 153.3 124.1 75.7 29.2 48.4 Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 Japan Crude Cocktail (JCC), which is average CIF price of oil imported to Japan, continued to rise from April 2007, reflecting strong demand and an influx of speculative money into the futures markets and reached US$135 per barrel in August 2008. Following the banking crisis in September 2008, the JCC plummeted to US$43 per barrel in January 2009, and ended at US$44 per barrel (preliminary figure) in March 2009, as a result of weaker demand and increased risk aversion. The JCC price trend is generally reflected in the net income of our overseas oil and gas producing subsidiaries and associated companies in this segment with a zero to 6 month time lag. Considering these time lags, Mitsui periodically calculates the weighted average JCC price applied to operating results of those oil and gas producing subsidiaries and associated companies for internal reviewing purposes. Such weighted average JCC prices for internal reviewing purposes for the year ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 were US$101 per barrel and US$71 per barrel, respectively. Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥272.0 billion, an increase of ¥52.7 billion from ¥219.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008 primarily due to the following:  There were contributions of ¥14.2 billion by Mitsui E&P Australia Pty Ltd due to the start-up of oil production at Tui oil field in New Zealand in July 2007 as well as higher oil prices. Likewise, due to higher oil prices MitEnergy Upstream LLC (United States) and Mitsui E&P Middle East B.V. (Netherlands) reported increases of ¥9.5 billion and ¥5.1 billion, respectively. On the other hand, Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. posted a decline of ¥4.2 billion, due to a drop in oil prices reflecting short period of time lag and stronger Japanese Yen against US Dollar and Thai Baht. Mittwell Energy 113 Table of Contents Resources Pty., Ltd. posted a decline of ¥22.7 billion in gross profit due to decline of shipments and an increase in condensate cost as a result of the revision of the purchase price from Japan Australia LNG (MIMI) Pty. Ltd during the year ended March 31, 2009.(*1)  The price for representative Australian premium hard coking coal for the year ended March 31, 2009 was quoted as US$300 per ton FOB, which was approximately three times the price for the year ended March 31, 2008. At the same time thermal coal prices doubled from the price for the prior year. For the year ended March 31, 2009, gross profit at Mitsui Coal Holdings Pty. Ltd. (Australia) increased by ¥46.6 billion, reflecting higher coal price as well as an increase in sales volume. Despite the sharp decline in demand due to economic slowdown, shipments for the year ended March 31, 2009 were approximately 7.4 million tons, a slight increase from 6.8 million tons for the year ended March 31, 2008 when there were production troubles.  Following the merger with Marubeni Liquefied Gas Corporation (Japan) in April 2008, Mitsui Marubeni Liquefied Gas Co., Ltd. reported an increase of ¥10.5 billion in gross profit due to the merger and increased sales volume. Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥ 214.1 billion, an increase of ¥41.6 billion from ¥172.5 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. An increase of ¥14.1 billion of selling, general and administrative expenses resulting from the merger with Marubeni Liquefied Gas Corporation was recorded at Mitsui Marubeni Liquefied Gas Co., Ltd. Equity in earnings of associated companiesnet (after income tax effect) for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥44.1 billion, an increase of ¥7.3 billion from ¥36.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. Japan Australia LNG (MIMI) Pty. Ltd. reported an increase in earnings due to higher oil prices and revised transfer price applied to sales of condensate to Mittwell Energy Resources Pty., Ltd. partially offset by foreign exchange translation effect of the depreciated Australian Dollar against the Japanese Yen and decline of oil shipment. Net income for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥153.3 billion, an increase of ¥29.2 billion from ¥124.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. Besides the above-mentioned developments, there were following factors:  Interest expenses declined by ¥4.8 billion, due mainly to lower US interest rates applied for funding for Sakhalin II project.  Dividends from LNG projects in Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Oman and Equatorial Guinea were ¥48.9 billion, an increase of ¥24.9 billion over the year ended March 31, 2008 due to higher oil prices.  This segment recorded a profit of ¥6.7 billion on sale of its shareholding in Kyushu Oil Co., Ltd. On the other hand, in April 2007, this segment sold 50% of its stake in Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd. (Bermuda) and recorded the relevant gain on sale of the shares for the year ended March 31, 2008.  This segment recorded a ¥20.2 billion gain (pre-tax) on the sale of its entire oil and gas producing interests(*2) at Wandoo Petroleum Pty. Ltd. (Mitsuis profit share 71.7%) for the year ended March 31, 2008. (*1) Positive impact of the increase in condensate sales price at Japan Australia LNG (MIMI) Pty. Ltd. is not reflected timely due to a three-month time lag in consolidating its earnings into our operating results, whereas negative impact of the decline in condensate sales price at Mittwell Energy Resources Pty., Ltd. is reflected with no lag. Therefore, positive impact related to condensate sales earned during January to March 2009 period will be reflected in the earnings of Japan Australia LNG (MIMI) Pty. Ltd. in the year ending March 31, 2010. (*2) In this Operating Results by Operating Segment, the gain on the sale of the entire oil and gas producing interests in Wandoo Petroleum Pty. Ltd. has been included in and presented as continuing operations. In the consolidated statement of income, the gain of ¥9.6 billion on the sale for the year ended March 31, 2008 is presented as income from discontinued operations (after income tax effect). 114 Table of Contents  This segment recorded a ¥14.6 billion impairment loss on property & equipment and mineral rights of Vincent oil field belonging to Mitsui E&P Australia Pty Limited. We wrote down the assets to the fair value using a discount cash flow method. Future cash flow used for the impairment judgment as well as for the fair value calculation is estimated from its business plan that the most updated oil reserve is produced from the oil field in accordance with the production plan, and the estimate of the sales prices is based on the future prices at the analysis day. For the year ended March 31, 2008 this segment recorded a ¥3.9 billion impairment loss on power producing equipment at a domestic power producing operation.  Other expense-net increased by ¥17.9 billion due mainly to exploration expenses and salvage expenses of ¥4.5 billion for the Mexican gulf oil production facility damaged seriously by a hurricane. The exploration expenses included a ¥6.3 billion expense at Mitsui E&P Australia, a ¥3.6 billion expense at Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd.(Japan), a ¥2.7 billion expense at Mitsui E&P Mozambique Area1. For the corresponding previous year, major exploration expenses were a ¥5.4 billion expense at Mitsui E&P Australia and a ¥2.7 billion expense at Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 After reaching U.S.$72 per barrel in September 2006, Japan Crude Cocktail (JCC) dropped to U.S.$55 per barrel in February 2007. It then bounced back sharply and reached U.S.$95.4 per barrel in March 2008. On average, crude oil prices continued to rise, reflecting strong demand supported by global expansion, geopolitical uncertainty surrounding supply from the Middle East and other oil producing regions, and an influx of speculative money into the futures markets. Average JCC for the year ended March 31, 2008 was U.S.$78.71 per barrel compared to U.S.$63.50 per barrel for the year ended March 31, 2007. Average JCC for calendar year 2007 was U.S.$69.41 compared to U.S.$63.94 for calendar year 2006. The JCC price trend is generally reflected in the net income of our overseas oil and gas producing subsidiaries and associated companies in this segment within a zero to 6 month time lag. Considering these time lags, Mitsui periodically calculates the weighted average JCC price applied to operating results of those oil and gas producing subsidiaries and associated companies for internal reviewing purposes. Such weighted average JCC prices for internal reviewing purposes for the year ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 were U.S.$71 per barrel and U.S.$64 per barrel, respectively. Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥219.3 billion, a significant increase of ¥95.4 billion from ¥123.9 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007 primarily due to the following factors:  As a result of Mitsuis acquisition of additional voting shares in Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. (Japan) during the 4th quarter of the year ended March 31, 2007, Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd., formerly an associated company, became a subsidiary with Mitsuis 50.3% voting interest (51.03% as of March 31, 2008). There was a new contribution to gross profit from Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. of ¥58.4 billion coming from this acquisition of shares. There were also new contributions of ¥23.9 billion by Mitsui E&P Australia Pty Limited (Australia) due to the start of oil production at the Enfield oil field in July 2006 as well as the Tui oil filed in July 2007. Moreover, Mittwell Energy Resources Pty. Ltd. (Australia) reported an ¥8.6 billion increase, reflecting increased shipment of condensate and higher prices; and Mitsui E&P Middle East B.V. (Netherlands) operating in Oman reported an increase of ¥5.6 billion, reflecting increased prices.  The price for representative Australian hard coking coal for the year ending March 31, 2008 declined by approximately 15.5% to U.S.$92 per ton FOB. At the same time soft coking coal prices rose in general by 9%. For the year ended March 31, 2008, gross profit at Mitsui Coal Holdings Pty. Ltd. (Australia) declined significantly by ¥11.9 billion, reflecting lower coal prices, appreciation of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar, delay of expansion projects and other operational troubles including heavy rainfall. Although the expansion plan in the Dawson mine has been completed, shipments by Mitsui Coal Holdings Pty. Ltd. for the year ended March 31, 2008 were approximately 7.9 million tons, a slight 115 Table of Contents increase from 6.8 million tons for the year ended March 31, 2007 due to the above-mentioned operation troubles. As of April 2008, the operational trouble at the Dawson mine had been remedied in general and it is currently concentrating on stabilizing production.  There were ¥9.6 billion naphtha trading losses at Mitsui Oil (Asia) Pte. Ltd. (Singapore) for the year ended March 31, 2007.  In domestic sales operations, Mitsui Liquefied Gas Co., Ltd. (Japan) recorded a ¥3.3 billion increase, reflecting higher sales prices; however, Mitsui Oil Co., Ltd. (Japan) reported a decline due to reduced margins related to a sharp increase in crude oil prices. Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥172.5 billion, an increase of ¥91.2 billion from ¥81.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. The increase in gross profit was partly offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses, particularly at Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd.. Equity in earnings of associated companiesnet (after income tax effect) for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥36.8 billion, a decline of ¥7.6 billion from ¥44.4 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. Japan Australia LNG (MIMI) Pty. Ltd. (Australia), which is engaged in natural gas, crude oil and condensate exploration, development and marketing in Western Australia, recorded a slight increase in earnings. Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd., as an associated company up to the third quarter of the year ended March 31, 2007, reported ¥8.4 billion equity in earnings for the year ended March 31, 2007, but has been consolidated for the year ended March 31, 2008. Net income for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥124.1 billion, a significant increase of ¥48.4 billion from ¥75.7 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. Besides the above-mentioned developments, the following factors contributed to this increase:  This segment divested 50% of its shares in Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd. (Bermuda) and recorded relevant gains on sale of the shares for the year ended March 31, 2008.  This segment recorded a ¥20.2 billion gain (pre-tax) on the sale of its entire oil and gas producing interests in Wandoo Petroleum Pty. Ltd. (Mitsuis profit share 71.7%) for the year ended March 31, 2008(*1).  Dividends from LNG projects in Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Oman were ¥23.4 billion, a decline of ¥3.2 billion over the year ended March 31, 2007.  This segment reported an impairment loss on power producing equipment at GTF Green Power Co., Ltd. (Japan), a domestic power producing operation, for the year ended March 31, 2008.  Minority interests in earnings of subsidiaries increased by ¥18.9 billion (in expense) related to consolidation of Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. by Mitsui in the fourth quarter of the year ended March 31, 2007. (*1) In the consolidated statements of income, net income of the assets of Wandoo Petroleum Pty. Ltd. for the year ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 is presented as income from discontinued operations (after income tax effect). 116 Table of Contents  Mitsui E&P Australia Pty Limited (Australia) recorded a Petroleum Resource Rent tax (PRRT) of ¥9.5 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008(*2). Short- and Long-Term Outlook on Prices and Supply-Demand Balance for oil and gas, and Our Equity Production Short-Term Pricing and Supply-Demand Balance A survey conducted by the International Energy Agency (May 2008) indicated that world crude oil demand in 2008 was 85.8 million barrels per day, with an estimated demand for 2009 of 83.2 million barrels per day. As of May 2009, general observations on short-term supply-demand balance of crude oil by agencies and corporations in this industry suggest that:  After WTI reached its historical high price of U.S.$147 per barrel in July 2008, it plummeted due to the credit constraints and economic downturn. Entering into 2009, crude oil prices picked up once reflecting increasing geopolitical uncertainties such as Israels military activity Gaza region and disputes regarding gas supply between Russia and Ukraine, but the oil market immediately changed due to the worse-than-expected worldwide recession and the prices dropped to nearly U.S.$30 per barrel in February 2009. Afterward, crude oil prices have recovered and hit the U.S.$70 per barrel level recently mainly due to the inflow of risk money into the energy market.  While oil inventory in the U.S. continues to rise reflecting a decline in overall demand, there have been considerable inflows of risk money into commodity markets, resulting in a run-up of crude oil price. Although oil prices have surged as a result of such inflow of risk money, the outlook is extremely uncertain especially since the recovery of demand is likely to take place in 2010 at the soonest based on the demand estimation reported by International Energy Agency.  The following are the changing factors for oil price; 1) development of disposal of non performing loans which constitutes of the bedrock of the recession, 2) implementation of economic stimulus packages by the governments including Chinese government and 3) market confidence risk of the U.S. Dollar stemming from increasing public spending. Our production amount for the year ended March 31, 2009 was 57 million barrels, an increase of 2 million barrels from the year ended March 31, 2008 (gas is converted to barrels of oil at the ratio of 5,800 cubic feet of natural gas to 1 barrel of crude oil), as presented in Table 4, Proved Reserve Quantity Information of Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited). Each of production amounts for the years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 includes 11 million barrels for Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd.s minority interest portion. We expect that our production amount for the year ending March 31, 2010 will be at the approximately same level as amount for the year ended March 31, 2009 considering full year contributions from (*2) PRRT applies to all petroleum projects in Australian offshore areas (or Commonwealth adjacent areas), other than production licenses derived from the North West Shelf exploration permits. (Japan Australia LNG (MIMI) Pty. Ltd. participates in the North West Shelf LNG project.) Therefore, Mitsui E&P Australia Pty Limited, our oil and gas exploration and production subsidiary in Australia, is subject to this tax. PRRT is assessed as follows:  PRRT is levied on the taxable profits of a petroleum project at a rate of 40%. The taxable profit of a project is the excess of assessable receipts over operating expenditures; and exploration and development expenditures. Exploration and development expenditures are deductible on an accrual basis, including the period when these expenditures are capitalized on the balance sheets.  All undeducted expenditures are eligible for compounding. The expenditures can be compounded annually at set rates (Australian long term bond yields and specified spreads), and the compounded amount is deducted against assessable receipts in future years.  PRRT is deductible for Australian income tax computation. 117 Table of Contents the Vincent oil field project as well as the fifth LNG producing train of the Northwest Shelf JV, while crude oil production at the Tui crude oil field belonging to Mitsui E&P Australia Pty Limited and Mexican gulf operation of Mit Energy Upstream LLC is expected to decline. On April 13, 2009, a fire started in the gas compression units on the Vincents floating production storage and off-take facility, and was immediately extinguished. Receiving regulatory approval, production at the Vincent oil field resumed on June 16, 2009 on an interim basis while work to restore the gas compression facility is still continuing. For the year ending March 31, 2010, a change of U.S.$1 per barrel in crude oil prices is estimated to have an effect of ¥1.6 billion on net income as a result of changes in revenues of our oil and gas related subsidiaries and associated companies. Similar to the discussion regarding iron and steel raw materials, actual results of operations are also influenced by production costs, trends in foreign exchange rates and other factors surrounding those subsidiaries and associated companies. Middle- and Long-Term Price Outlook and Supply-Demand Balance and Trends in Our Equity Production The middle- and long-term trends in supply-demand balance and prices of crude oil are subject to far greater levels of uncertainty than recent trends, and it is therefore difficult for the management to make a definitive forecast. On the other hand, with respect to LNG, we are focusing on the changes in market structure that are currently taking place, and acting accordingly as follows:  In the past, the market growth has been driven primarily by long-term purchase contracts by power and gas companies operating in Japan and the Far East. Expansion of incumbent projects and green field projects coming on stream will increase the volume of supply to the market, while demand, traditionally centered around the Far East, is likely to increase by growing demand from Europe and the United States, while huge markets in China and India will emerge. Therefore, globalization both in terms of supply and demand is expected to continue. In addition, as the opportunity for supply-demand adjustments in these markets increases, LNG is expected to become a more marketable commodity.  Long-term purchase contracts with Japanese companies in many projects are subject to renewal around 2015, and more flexible terms reflecting the above-mentioned supply-demand balance trends will be requested from the buyers. In evaluating the opportunities for the expansion of incumbent projects or participation in green field projects, we are putting an emphasis on securing stable supply as well as diversifying our source of supply to enhance flexibility. Short- and Long-Term Outlook on Prices and Supply-Demand Balance for coal, and Our Equity Production Short-Term Pricing and Supply-Demand Balance As is the case with the iron ore business, coal (metallurgical coal) producing joint venture businesses in Australia in which we participate together with major foreign mineral resources companies conclude supply contracts with Japanese steel manufacturers and major clients in other countries every year. Based on such contracts, sales prices are reviewed and renegotiated each fiscal year. For the year ending March 31, 2010, the annual prices of coal have declined sharply due to reduced demand stemming from curtailment of production by steel manufacturers, especially in developed countries. (Unit prices for coal from each mine in production also reflect the difference of respective grades and types.) Up to the date of this annual report, we have observed that an indicative price for representative Australian premium hard coking coal, a type of metallurgical coal, declined to U.S.$115 to U.S.$125 per ton/FOB for the year ending March 31, 2010. Generally, metallurgical coal prices declined approximately 60% from the year ended March 31, 2009. Also, some contracts indicate that the price for thermal coal declined to U.S.$70 to U.S.$72 per ton /FOB for the year ending March 31, 2010. At the same time, in general, thermal coal prices have declined approximately 40% from the year ended March 31, 2009. 118 Table of Contents Fluctuations in coal prices directly affect revenues from the equity-based production at our coal subsidiaries and associated companies. For the year ending March 31, 2010, we calculate that an estimated impact on net income from a change of U.S.$1 per ton in coal price would be approximately ¥0.5 billion. For the year ended March 31, 2009, the equity-based shipments of our overseas subsidiaries and associated companies amounted to approximately 8.6 million tons of coal. For the year ending March 31, 2010, we expect that the equity-based shipments of our overseas subsidiaries and associated companies will amount to approximately 8.0 million tons of coal. The above impact is calculated based on the assumptions of an estimated decline in production in line with our holdings after the year ended March 31, 2009, and a specific range of foreign exchange rates for the Japanese yen, the U.S. dollar and the Australian dollar. Although a global trend of rising material and equipment costs as well as utility and personnel costs, which was remarkable before the financial crisis, reversed due to the economic slowdown, the cost is unlikely to decline so immediately since the impact of such cost reductions has a certain time lag and the effect of increased unit costs due to lower production volume partially offsets the cost reduction in costs. In addition, the appreciation of Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar may have a negative impact on the revenues of our coal mining subsidiaries and associated companies. Middle- and Long-Term Price Outlook and Supply-Demand Balance and Trends in Our Equity Production In order to respond to tightening supply-demand balance in mid- and long-term resulting from increased demand for metallurgical coal in line with economic growth of developing countries as well as rising demand of thermal coal for coal fired power plants especially in India and Taiwan, major coal producers continue investing to increase production capacity. With respect to coal mining joint ventures with the Rio Tinto group, we approved the development of the new mining area owned by Kestrel Joint Venture in Queensland, Australia. This project will extend the operation period of Kestrel Joint Venture by developing the new mining area, as the existing mining areas are expected to be exhausted in 2014. We obtained the governments approvals in November 2009. The operation is expected to commence in 2012. The project estimates a maximum 6.5 million tons per annum coal production and 20-year operation. Including those we are participating in, most of the coal mining projects have plans for expanding their production capacity. As there are too many uncertainties, including demand from China and other emerging countries, it is difficult for our management to draw up definitive forecasts on supply-demand balance and prices at this point in time.

On the other hand, under severe business circumstances due to higher raw material and oil costs in the first half of the year ended 119 Table of Contents March 31, 2009 as well as lack of consumer confidence due to economic downturn in the second half of the year ended March 31, 2009, this segment has been taking various cost reduction initiatives in the food distribution and retail operations in Japan. The major developments were as follows:  In the food raw material business, broiler business displayed robust performance due to increases in prices of the products in addition to steady results from soybean and wheat transactions.  MITSUI FOODS CO., LTD (Japan) recorded an increase of ¥1.1 billion over the year ended March 31, 2008 due to improved margins gained through restructuring unprofitable businesses.  Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. (Japan) reported a decline of ¥1.1 billion in gross profit due to the weaker market for wholesale tea products and beverage raw materials as the food service industry has been dull despite firm performance of tea business for the household use. In addition, Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. recorded a loss on a write down of inventories. Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥19.0 billion, an increase of ¥2.4 billion from ¥16.6 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. MITSUI FOODS CO., LTD. showed an improvement in operating income reflecting the increase in gross profit. Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. reported a decline in operating income although the decline in gross profit was partly offset by a slight improvement in selling, general and administrative expenses. Equity in losses of associated companiesnet (after income tax effect) for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥3.8 billion, a decline of ¥6.9 billion from earnings of ¥3.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008.

In addition to the above-mentioned factors, there are following factors:  Loss on write-down of securities for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥3.6 billion. For the year ended March 31, 2008, this segment recognized a ¥5.6 billion loss mainly due to the write-down of the shares of Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd of ¥4.5 billion.  This segment recorded a ¥3.2 billion gain on sales of securities, mainly related to listed securities, for the year ended March 31, 2008.  Other expenses-net increased by ¥3.1 billion, major part of which was foreign exchange losses, over the year ended March 31, 2008. Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥81.2 billion, a decline of ¥0.1 billion from ¥81.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. Food raw material business transactions showed solid performance, partly reflecting a run-up in prices. At the same time, this segment has been taking various cost reduction initiatives in the competitive, domestic food distribution and retail operations.  In October 2007, this business unit transferred 70% of its shares of Hokushuren Co., Ltd. (Japan), formerly a foods and liquor wholesale subsidiary, to KOKUBU & CO., LTD., an unrelated entity, following the transfer of MITSUI FOODS CO., LTD.s business in the Hokkaido area (excluding Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd.-related businesses) to Hokushuren Co., Ltd. As a result, gross profit of Hokushuren Company Limited declined by ¥2.9 billion. Gross profit of MITSUI FOODS CO., LTD. declined by ¥1.1 billion, primarily reflecting the restructuring of domestic distribution centers and exiting from unprofitable businesses. 120 Table of Contents  There was an increased gross profit in the feed grain businesses, mainly in corn due to increased prices and trading transactions for the year ended March 31, 2008.  Gross profit of Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. (Japan) declined slightly by ¥0.1 billion due to fierce competition mainly in the tea leaves business and rising material costs. Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥16.6 billion, an increase of ¥5.7 billion from ¥10.9 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. MITSUI FOODS CO., LTD. and Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. succeeded in decreasing general, selling and administrative expenses, which resulted in a substantial improvement in their operating income, although their gross profit declined marginally due to less sales transactions as a result of exiting from unprofitable businesses. Equity in earnings of associated companiesnet (after income tax effect) for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥3.1 billion, a ¥0.7 billion decline from ¥3.8 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. Net income for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥10.4 billion, a significant improvement of ¥22.7 billion from ¥12.3 billion net loss for the year ended March 31, 2007. In addition to the above-mentioned development, major factors were as follows:  For the year ended March 31, 2007, Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. recorded impairment losses on intangible assets and goodwill of ¥12.1 billion and ¥16.5 billion, respectively, and moreover established a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. At the same time, a ¥8.3 billion minority interest in income from these losses was also recorded. For the year ended March 31, 2008, its operating results recovered to a marginally positive amount of income and zero minority interest is recorded.  For the year ended March 31, 2008, Mitsui recognized a ¥4.5 billion loss on the write-down of the shares of Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd., following a decline in its share price. The major component of impairment losses for the year ended March 31, 2007 was a loss on intangible assets at Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. (Japan) due to deterioration of operating environment, such as intensifying competition in both beverage and beverage materials. Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. used a discounted cash flow method based on its internal budget for evaluation of fair value of the intangible assets, and used its weighted average capital cost for the discount rate in evaluating fair values of intangible assets. Following recognition of the impairment losses (including the loss on its goodwill), the book values of fixed assets and intangible assets as of March 31, 2008 and 2007 were ¥9.5 billion and ¥10.0 billion, respectively. While there may be fluctuations from future developments in the market management expects that Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. will continue to record positive, but not substantial, net income considering its market and its competitive position in the beverage industry. Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. recorded net income of ¥0.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008, a marginal income but reasonable level considering strict business conditions. Management also believes that the estimation and assumption for this impairment loss has been specific to Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd., and does not expect such estimation and assumption to have a material impact on our future consolidated operating results excluding Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd.

Due to a decline of IT demand and an impairment loss on fixed assets Nippon Unisys, Ltd. (Japan) reported a decline in earnings. Net loss for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥31.4 billion, a decline of ¥43.4 billion from net income of ¥12.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. Additional factors are as follows:  Reflecting the sharp drop in the Japanese equity market, this segment recorded a loss of ¥35.2 billion on write-down of securities, which includes impairment losses of listed securities including those of Tokyo Broadcasting System, Inc. of ¥3.1 billion, securities of Recruit Co., Ltd. of ¥12.0 billion(*1), and our equity share in office building development business in Japan of ¥9.8 billion(*2) for the year ended March 31, 2009.

The gain resulted from the merger of Mitsui Knowledge Industry Co., Ltd. and NextCom K.K. and sales of shares of two cable television providers and Jupiter Telecommunications Co., Ltd.  Considering a decline in share price of Mitsui Knowledge Industry Co., Ltd., which is listed in Tokyo Stock Exchange, we evaluated if the fair value of the subsidiarys equity fell below its carrying amount and potential impairment is identified. As a result of the evaluation, we determined that the implied fair value of the goodwill fell below its carrying value, and this Segment reported an impairment loss of ¥4.1 billion for the difference. (*1) Reflecting recent decline in the markets of recruiting as well as advertising in Japan, there was a concern that economic environments surrounding Recruit Co., Ltd. would be deteriorated, and consequently its operating profit would become worse than originally expected. We calculated the impairment loss based on the objective data of the economic environment surrounding the company gathered by us and its financial statements of the past fiscal years. (*2) We used a third party appraisal for the fair value of the office building, which was estimated based on the most recent rents of the office buildings in the surrounding areas. Taking into consideration such appraisal price, we calculated the share price, and recorded the impairment loss for the difference between the carrying value and the share price calculated. 122 Table of Contents Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥116.7 billion, a decline of ¥13.3 billion from ¥130.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007.

(Japan)(*), Mitsui Bussan Forestry Co., Ltd. (Japan), two cable television providers and certain textile and general merchandise businesses. In addition, IT related businesses mainly in the system integration sector reported a marginal decline, while real estate businesses in Japan and Europe showed steady performance. Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥19.0 billion, a decline of ¥1.3 billion from ¥20.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007.

Furthermore, logistics business recorded a valuation loss on real estate for sale.

Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 Gross profit was ¥55.1 billion, a decline of ¥5.4 billion from ¥60.5 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. Gross profit declined at Mitsui & Co. Energy Risk Management Ltd. (United Kingdom), reflecting lower trading margins due to a significant reduction of volatility in the market.

The increase in gross profit was attributable to increases in steel product prices in the first half of the current fiscal year as well as a transfer of business from Mitsui Steel Inc., which was partially offset by a decline in gross profit for the second half of the current fiscal year reflecting declines in the sales volume and prices caused by demand contraction and credit uncertainties of the customers under the recession. Also, Champions Pipe & Supply, Inc. contributed to the increase in gross profit supported by a strong demand for tubular pipes for oil and gas industry despite a sharp demand contraction starting in the three month period ended March 31, 2009.  MBK Real Estate LLC., which recorded a loss of ¥9.6 billion on the write-down of residential home inventories for the year ended March 31, 2008, increased gross profit by ¥6.6 billion, recording a relatively small loss of ¥2.5 billion in the current fiscal year on the write-down of inventories under severe circumstances in the real estate business in the United States. Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥39.0 billion, an increase of ¥31.7 billion from ¥7.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008 reflecting the increase in gross profit. Personnel expenses at Novus International Inc. and Champions Steel & Pipe, Inc. increased. Equity in losses of associated companiesnet (after income tax effect) for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥2.2 billion, a ¥7.3 billion decline from earnings of ¥5.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. This segment recorded equity in losses of ¥1.5 billion for Penske Automotive Group, Inc. (this segment portion), reflecting an other-than-temporary decline in its share price. Earnings of associated companies in the steel products and medical health care businesses declined. In addition, United Harvest, LLC (United States) reported a decline in earnings due to a reversal effect of its strong performance from the wheat export facility operation business in the year ended March 31, 2008. Net loss for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥7.1 billion, a decline of ¥12.1 billion from net income of ¥5.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2008. In addition to the above factors, there were the following factors:  Interest expense, net of interest income, declined by ¥7.6 billion in the overall Americas Segment resulting from a decline in U.S. Dollar interest rates. 125 Table of Contents  This segment recorded a ¥13.6 billion impairment loss of goodwill. Steel Technologies Inc. recorded a ¥6.4 billion impairment loss of goodwill(*1), reflecting severe condition of the steel products business for automotive and housing industries in the United States.

The increase was attributable to an increase of ¥10.4 billion in income from continuing operations before income taxes, minority interests and equity in earnings. The fact that Steel Technologies did not record tax effect on the goodwill impairment loss as the goodwill recorded on its book can not be amortized for the tax purpose, and Ferlitilizantes Mitsui S.A. Industria e Comercio set up valuation allowance for deferred tax assets evaluating the realizability of the deferred tax assets also resulted in the increase.  Minority interest in earnings of subsidiaries increased by ¥5.9 billion. This is mainly attributable to increase in earnings of Novus International Inc., in which the segment has a 65% ownership interest. Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥78.5 billion, an increase of ¥0.2 billion from ¥78.3 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007.  For the year ended March 31, 2008, MBK Real Estate LLC.

(United States), a feed additive manufacturing subsidiary, due to improvement in both sales volume and margin. (*1) Demand on the steel products for automotive and housing industries in the United States, which Steel Technologies Inc. considers its principal markets, is likely to remain under pressure for some time. The overall economic conditions in the North America and corporate restructuring plans of the U.S. major automotive companies are extremely uncertain. Reflecting these uncertainties Steel Technologies Inc. made its mid-term business plan, based on which the equity value was calculated by using discount cash flow method and guideline public company method (EBITDA multiple method) for the impairment testing of the goodwill. Implied fair value of the goodwill as well as other intangible assets was evaluated by using mainly discount cash flow method. 126 Table of Contents This segment recorded a ¥7.3 billion operating income for the year ended March 31, 2008, a deterioration of ¥14.7 billion from ¥22.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007.

The financial crisis seriously affected the performance of the corporate sector, especially the finance sector, and amid the circumstances that job cuts and cost reduction efforts were accelerated, commercial real estate market in London deteriorated sharply.

The main factor for the increase in net income is attributable to the segments minority interest in Mitsui Coal Holdings Pty. Ltd. and Mitsui Iron Ore Development Pty. Ltd. whose majority interest is held by the Energy Segment and the Mineral & Metal Resources Segment, respectively. Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥33.1 billion, an increase of ¥2.4 billion from ¥30.7 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. Steel products and chemicals exhibited strong performance. Operating income for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥7.6 billion, a decline of ¥1.9 billion from ¥9.5 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. This decline reflects increases in personnel expenses. Net income for the year ended March 31, 2008 was ¥22.5 billion, an increase of ¥0.5 billion from ¥22.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2007. Income related to minority interests held by this segment in Mitsui Iron Ore Development Pty. Ltd. and Wandoo Petroleum Pty. Ltd. increased, while it declined in Mitsui Coal Holdings Pty. Ltd. (Australia) for the year ended March 31, 2008. 128 Table of Contents All Other Billions of Yen Years Ended March 31, Change(20092008) Change(20082007) 2009 2008 2007 Gross Profit ¥ 2.9 ¥ 5.5 ¥ 4.3 ¥ (2.6 ) ¥ 1.2 Operating Loss (2.9 ) (1.4 ) (4.4 ) (1.5 ) 3.0 Equity in Earnings of Associated CompaniesNet (After Income Tax Effect) 0.0 0.1 0.1 (0.1 ) 0.0 Net Income (Loss) 6.5 (7.1 ) 5.8 13.6 (12.9 ) Comparison between the Years Ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 The activities of this segment primarily include financing services, office services and other services to external customers, and/or to us, and associated companies.

For the year ended March 31, 2008, we recorded a ¥13.9 billion impairment loss on real estate which we possessed in Saito International Culture Park, located in the north area of Osaka Prefecture. Inflation The management believes that inflation did not have a significant effect on our reported results of operations. (*1) In March 2008, Urban Renaissance Agency (URA), an implementing body of land readjustment of SICP, announced that it would be difficult for URA to execute the project as the implementing body considering a conclusion on the project provided by the special appraisal and monitoring committee, and suggested that the project plan should be fundamentally revised. As a result of the URAs announcement, uncertainty about the progress and profitability of the land readjustment project in SICP has increased and Mitsui recognized a ¥13.9 billion impairment loss on land, by re-examining future value based on the current prices in the nearby block. 129 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates are considered to be critical if they are important to our financial condition and results of operations and involve estimates that require managements subjective or significant judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The following items require significant management judgments and estimates. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Impairment losses of long-lived assets, other than goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization, for the years ended March 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 and the balance of the long-lived assets, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, as of March 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: Billions of Yen As of March 31, 2009 2008 2007 Long-lived assets ¥ 1,196.6 ¥ 1,264.9 ¥ 1,304.5 Impairment loss 37.6 24.4 17.6 Impairment losses of long-lived assets have had a material impact on our net income in recent years. These losses were mainly due to the declining profitability resulting from deterioration of business environment and the reorganization of business structure of our subsidiaries. Our long-lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of other than by sale are reviewed for impairment semiannually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. This review for impairment is performed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset with the aggregate amount of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows (impairment analysis). Cash flow projections used in our impairment analysis and fair value calculations are based on the business plan authorized by our management or, if this is not available, on the operating plan reflecting the most recent condition of the long-lived asset. In these plans, for example, we assume:  that the level of most recent selling prices and rents of real estate in the surrounding areas will remain unchanged for a reasonable period in the future; and  that the estimate of the sales prices of the products from facilities and equipment for the certain future period is based on the average price of the equivalent length of period in the past or on the analysts reports.  that the most updated oil reserve will be produced from the oil field in accordance with the production plan, and the estimate of the sales prices is based on the future prices at the analysis day. As for the discount rate used in fair value calculations, when expected variations of cash flows are not considered in the cash flow estimate, a discount rate which includes the risk factor for the cash flow deviation is used. For example:  Assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value are incorporated in the discount rate when such information is available; or 130 Table of Contents  When such information is not available, an expected internal rate of return (IRR) used for management purposes or a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of a company that owns the long-lived asset, whichever is higher, is also considered for the discounted cash flow calculation. Factors to be considered when estimating future cash flows and determining discount rates vary for each long-lived asset because of the difference in nature of the assets and in operating circumstances, such as location, owner, operator, profitability and other factors. Also see the relevant discussion on the impairment losses at the Vincent oil field in Operating Results by Operating SegmentEnergy Segment, at Mitsui Norin Co., Ltd. in Operating Results by Operating SegmentFoods & Retail Segment, at Steel Technologies Inc. in Operating Results by Operating SegmentAmericas Segment and at MBK Real Estate Europe Limited in Operating Results by Operating SegmentEurope, the Middle East and Africa Segment in this item. Impairment of Goodwill Impairment of goodwill for recent fiscal years has had a significant impact on our income. The following table shows the carrying amounts of goodwill as of March 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 and the impairment loss for the years ended March 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Billions of Yen As of March 31, 2009 2008 2007 Goodwill ¥ 33.6 ¥ 52.5 ¥ 37.2 Impairment loss 18.6 2.0 16.5 We assess the carrying amount of goodwill for impairment annually and upon the occurrence of an indicator of impairment. We perform our impairment testing of goodwill by comparing the carrying amount with the fair value of each of our subsidiaries as our reporting units. Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to indentify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the subsidiarys equity with its carrying amount. If the fair value of the subsidiarys equity falls below its carrying amount and potential impairment is identified in the first step, the second step is performed by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill with its carrying value. If the implied fair value of the goodwill falls below its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. Namely, the equity fair value of a subsidiary is allocated to all of the identifiable assets and liabilities of that subsidiary, and the remaining value which can not be allocated to any identifiable assets and liabilities is considered the implied fair value of the goodwill. Determining the fair value of a subsidiarys equity under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a subsidiary under the second step of the goodwill impairment test are judgmental and often involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions could significantly impact whether or not an impairment loss is recognized as well as the magnitude of any such loss. In case that stock of a subsidiary which has goodwill on its book is listed on a market, we use the market equity price for the first step. In case that it is not listed, we perform internal valuation analyses using discount cash flow model or utilize third-party valuations when management believes the amounts are material. To determine the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a subsidiary for the second step, we also use internal valuation analyses using discount cash flow model or utilize third-party valuations if necessary. Similar to impairment of long-lived assets, cash flow projections used in the fair value calculations are based on the business plan authorized by our management or, if this is not available, on the business plan reflecting the most recent business environment of the subsidiary. In these plans, we make same kinds of assumption we make for impairment of long-lived assets. 131 Table of Contents Also see the relevant discussion on the impairment losses at Mitsui Knowledge Industry Co., Ltd. in Operating Results by Operating SegmentConsumer Service & IT Segment and at Steel Technologies Inc. in Operating Results by Operating SegmentAmericas Segment in this item. Impairment of Investment Securities Impairments of equity investments for recent fiscal years have had a significant impact on our income. The following table shows the carrying amounts of marketable and non-marketable equity securities as of March 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 and the impairment loss for the years ended March 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Billions of Yen Year ended March 31, 2009 2008 2007 Carryingamount Impairmentloss Carryingamount Impairmentloss Carryingamount Impairmentloss Marketable equity securities ¥ 398.7 ¥ 79.3 ¥ 652.0 ¥ 28.1 ¥ 861.5 ¥ 3.1 Non-marketable equity securities 499.9 37.8 557.6 8.7 316.2 8.6 Total ¥ 898.6 ¥ 117.1 ¥ 1,209.6 ¥ 36.8 ¥ 1,177.7 ¥ 11.7 Management principally believes that a 30% or more decline in fair value of a security at the end of quarter for marketable equity securities leads to the conclusion that the security has an other-than-temporary impairment. In addition, if the decline is less than 30%, various factors, such as the duration of the market decline (for more than nine consecutive months), our intention and ability to hold the investment until its market price recovery and the financial conditions of the investee, are considered in concluding if the decline is temporary or not. Management believes that the criteria for evaluating the significance of the decline in fair value are reasonable. The aggregate unrealized loss amount of the marketable securities that have been in continuous unrealized loss position for less than one year and had severity of decline of fair value below cost was ¥36.8 billion. But, considering the combination of length of time that fair values have been below cost, the extent of decline and the financial condition of the investees, we expect that their fair values will recover above their costs while we hold these investments. We assess the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities for impairment semiannually and upon the occurrence of an indicator of impairment. If our portion of net asset measured at fair value(*) falls below the carrying amount by more than 50% we assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of a non-marketable security as we determine a potential impairment exists. Where we have determined that there is an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of the security, the carrying value of the security is written down to its fair value, which is calculated by discount cash flow method or measured based on net asset taking into consideration various factors affecting the fair value. See the relevant discussion on the impairment losses on shares in Recruit Co., Ltd. and in office building business in Operating Results by Operating SegmentConsumer Service & IT Segment in this item. We also review investments in listed associated companies for impairment losses using the same other-than-temporary criteria for marketable equity securities unless there are reasonable grounds that the decline is temporary in case that the decline ratio is from 30% to 50% and the decline has been for less than nine consecutive months. The amount of impairment loss on net of tax basis for the years ended March 31, 2009 was approximately ¥54.0 billion, and was recorded in equity earnings in associated companies-net (after income tax effect). (*) For this analysis, net asset measured at fair value means net of assets and liabilities marked to market based on the most recent and available balance sheet, and excludes goodwill or any other intangible assets which represent excess earning power. 132 Table of Contents Tax Asset Valuation Establishing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, pursuant to evaluation on its realizability, has had a significant impact on our income. The following table shows the deferred tax assets and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and valuation allowance as of March 31, 2009 and 2008. Billions of Yen As of March 31, 2009 2008 Total deferred tax assets ¥ 321.7 ¥ 218.9 Valuation allowance (153.8 ) (99.0 ) Deferred tax assetsnet ¥ 167.9 ¥ 119.9 Mitsui determines the realizability of deferred tax assets based on all available evidence, both positive and negative, including all currently available information regarding tax deductibility on future years and ability to generate sufficient taxable income at Mitsui and subsidiaries prior to the expiration of the loss carryforward pursuant to the relevant tax laws and regulations. Management believes it is more likely than not that all of those deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, will be realized. However, the amount of realizable net deferred tax assets may change in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are changed or if statutory tax rates are changed. Some of the examples we factored in to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets were as follows;  On the occurrence of temporary difference, we establish a deferred tax asset; and, at the same time we evaluate when those deferred tax assets will be realized in future. Particularly, when we establish a deferred tax asset in relation to a write-down loss of securities or impairment loss on long-lived assets which are not subject to depreciation for tax purposes and we have no specific schedule of sale or disposal of those assets, we establish a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset because we view the deferred tax amount as not realizable.  We evaluate realizability of deferred tax assets on the future deductible temporary difference and tax loss carryforwards at subsidiaries and associated companies. Among others, no deferred tax assets are determined to be realizable, if those subsidiaries and associated companies recorded a significant amount of tax loss carryforwards for each of the past three years and are expected to record a significant tax loss in the current fiscal year as well, considering all our past experiences in determining realizability of deferred tax assets.  Effective April 1, 2009, a new tax law was introduced in Japan that excludes 95% of dividend received from a foreign investee in which an investor has 25% or more ownership interest from taxable income. Mitsuis taxable income is expected to be reduced from the year ending March 31, 2010 onward. At the same time, Mitsui and its wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are to file a consolidated corporate income tax return to the National Tax Agency as a consolidated group. As a result of the consolidated tax return filing, realizability of national corporate tax portion of the deferred tax assets at Mitsui is dependant on the estimate of the consolidated tax groups taxable incomes in future. Reserve estimates for oil and gas producing and mining activities Reserves are estimates of the amount of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the companys interests in properties. In order to calculate reserves, estimates and assumptions are required about a range of geological, technical and economic factors, including quantities, grades, production techniques, recovery rates, production costs, transport costs, commodity demand, commodity prices and exchange rates. Because the economic assumptions used to estimate reserves change from period to period, and because 133 Table of Contents additional geological data is generated during the course of operations, estimates of reserves may change from period to period. Changes in reported reserves may affect the companys financial results and financial position in a number of ways, including the following:  Asset carrying values may be impaired due to changes in estimated future cash flows.  Depreciation and amortization charged in the income statement may change where such charges are determined by the units of production basis, or where the useful economic lives of assets change.  Decommissioning, site restoration and environmental provisions may change where changes in estimated reserves affect expectations about the timing or cost of these activities. Pension Benefit Costs Employee pension benefit costs and obligations are dependent on various assumptions, including discount, retirement, and mortality rates, which are based on current statistical data, as well as the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and other factors. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the difference between actual results and the assumptions is accumulated and amortized to expenses over future periods and, therefore, generally affects the recognized costs in future periods. Management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate; however, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our future pension costs and obligations. We determine the discount rates each year as of the measurement date, based on a review of interest rates associated with long-term Japanese government bonds or high-quality fixed-income corporate bonds. The discount rates determined on each measurement date are used to calculate the benefit obligation as of that date, and are also used to calculate the net periodic pension costs for the upcoming plan year. Mitsui determines the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets based on the weighted-average rate of return computed by using the expected long-term rate of return on each asset class, which is derived from an extensive study conducted by investment advisors and actuaries on a periodic basis, and the target allocations for each asset class. The study includes a review of anticipated future performance with market analysis of individual asset classes, and also gives appropriate consideration to actual historical returns achieved by the plans. The subsidiaries determine the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets mainly based on the expectations for future returns by investment advisors and actuaries. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions for Mitsuis pension plans: Billions of Yen Impact of change inassumption on NPPCfor the year endingMarch 31, 2010 Impact of change inassumption on PBOas ofMarch 31, 2009 50 basis point decrease in discount rate ¥ 1.9 ¥ 15. 3 50 basis point increase in discount rate (1.6 ) (14.4 ) 50 basis point decrease in expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 1.0  50 basis point increase in expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (1.0 )  See Note 14, PENSION COSTS AND SEVERANCE INDEMNITIES, for further discussion about the estimates and assumptions on PBO and NPPC. 134 Table of Contents New Accounting Standards Fair value measurements In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157-4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly. This FSP provides guidance for determining whether a market that was formerly active has become inactive and a transaction is not orderly in order to apply the fair value measurement provisions of SFAS No. 157. This FSP is applied prospectively for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. The effect of the adoption of this FSP on our financial position and results of operations will be immaterial. Business combinations In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141R). SFAS No. 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase. SFAS No. 141R also requires disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. In April 2009, the FASB also issued FSP No. FAS 141(R)-1, Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies, which requires an asset or liability arising from a contingency in a business combination to be recognized at fair value if fair value can be reasonably determined. Both SFAS No. 141R and FSP No. FAS 141(R)-1 are applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The effects of the adoption of these standards on our financial position and results of operations are not currently known and cannot be reasonably estimated until further analysis is completed. Noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The effect of the adoption of this statement on our financial position and results of operations is not currently known and cannot be reasonably estimated until further analysis is completed. Recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments. FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 amends SFAS No. 115 and SFAS No. 124, Accounting for Certain Investments Held by Not-for-Profit Organizations. This FSP requires an entity to recognize the credit component of an other-than-temporary impairment of a debt security in earnings and the noncredit component in other comprehensive income when the entity does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the entity will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery. This FSP also expands the disclosure requirements for other-than-temporary impairments on debt and equity securities. FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. The effect of adoption of this FSP on our financial position and results of operations is not currently known and cannot be reasonably estimated until further analysis is completed. 135 Table of Contents B. Liquidity and Capital Resources Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Non-GAAP financial measures are defined in the SEC regulations as financial measures that either exclude or include amounts that are not excluded from or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Net Debt-to-Equity Ratio We refer to Net Debt-to-Equity Ratio (Net DER) in this Liquidity and Capital Resources and elsewhere in this annual report. Net DER is comprised of net interest bearing debt divided by shareholders equity. Net interest bearing debt is defined as interest bearing debt, consisting of short-term debt and long-term debt, less cash and cash equivalents and time deposits. Management believes that Net DER is a useful internal measure to review the balance between interest bearing debt and shareholders equity for the purpose of improving our capacity to meet debt repayments and/or return on equity. This calculation does not recognize the fact that cash and cash equivalents and time deposits may not be completely available for debt repayments because some amount of cash and cash equivalents and time deposits may be required for operational needs including contractual obligations or capital expenditures. Net interest bearing debt and Net DER are presented in the table below. Billions of Yen As of March 31, 2009 2008 Short-term debt ¥ 454.1 ¥ 464.6 Long-term debt 3,214.5 3,221.0 Interest bearing debt 3,668.6 3,685.6 Less cash and cash equivalents and time deposits (1,153.5 ) (911.6 ) Net interest bearing debt ¥ 2,515.1 ¥ 2,774.0 Shareholders equity ¥ 1,881.7 ¥ 2,183.7 Net DER (times) 1.34 1.27 The most directly comparable GAAP measures for Net interest bearing debt and Net DER are considered to be Interest bearing debt and Debt-to-Equity Ratio (DER), respectively. However, these measures do not measure changes in cash position. DER (times) 1.95 1.69 (defined as interest bearing debt divided by shareholders equity) Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow as the sum of net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities and net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities. Management believes that such indicator is useful to investors, to measure available net cash for investment in strategic opportunities and/or debt repayment, or the extent of reliance on borrowing to procure funds for strategic investments. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. 136 Table of Contents The following table shows a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow. Billions of Yen Years Ended March 31, 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities ¥ 582.7 ¥ 415.8 ¥ 239.3 Net cash used in investing activities (290.9 ) (104.8 ) (418.0 ) Free cash flow ¥ 291.8 ¥ 311.0 ¥ (178.7 ) Finance and Liquidity Management Funding and Treasury Policies and Objectives Our management believes our basic funding policy is to secure liquidity required for our smooth operations and to maintain the strength and soundness of our balance sheet. In order to achieve our objectives, our principal strategy is to obtain long-term funds (those with maturities of around 10 years) from financial institutions, including insurance companies and banks, and through the issuance of corporate bonds. In addition, we minimize our refinance risk by deconcentrating the amount of repayment of our long-term debt by each fiscal year. In case where large amount of finance is required for various projects, we utilize financing programs provided by government financing agencies and/or project financing to obtain long-term financing. Another strategy is to hold sufficient cash and cash equivalents in order to maintain liquidity to flexibly meet capital requirements and to minimize the harmful effect by the deteriorated financial market on future debt-service requirements. Cash and cash equivalents consist mainly of highly-liquid and highly-rated short-term financial instruments and deposits considering the current financial market conditions. In principle, the domestic financing subsidiary provides a cash management service with wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, and it results in the centralization of funding sources, efficient use of excess funds and securement of liquidity for domestic subsidiaries. The same policy and practices have been extended to wholly-owned overseas subsidiaries through our regional financing subsidiaries, which, in principle, centralizes the fund raising function and fund operation function. As a result, approximately 86% of total interest bearing debt as of March 31, 2009 was raised by Mitsui and the above-mentioned financing subsidiaries. Funding Sources In accordance with our basic funding policy above, we choose the funding source among various measures of direct and in-direct financing in order to secure long and stable sources of funds, and procure financing by the preferable method under the financial condition at that point of time. We borrow funds based on our longstanding and wide-ranging relations with financial institutions in Japan and overseas, borrow from government financing agencies, and also utilize project financing. In addition to these funding sources, Mitsui maintains direct finance methods such as a ¥200 billion debt shelf-registration and a ¥2,400 billion commercial paper program in Japan, and utilize suitable one among these facilities depending on the financial situation. Similarly, Mitsui & Co. (U.S.A.), Inc., Mitsui & Co. Financial Services (Europe) B.V., Mitsui & Co. Financial Services (Asia) Ltd. and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. have arranged a joint Euro medium-term note (MTN) program of U.S.$5 billion. Mitsui guarantees notes issued by these overseas subsidiaries. For raising short-term funds overseas, Mitsui & Co. (U.S.A.), Inc. has a U.S.$1.5 billion U.S. domestic commercial paper program, and there are similar commercial paper programs in some other overseas markets. Certain overseas subsidiaries set lines of credit by paying commitment fees to the financial institutions, which were not material in each of the past three years. For unused lines of credit financing outside of Japan, including these lines of credit with fees, see Note 13, SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT. 137 Table of Contents Short-term and long-term debt as of March 31, 2009 was mainly denominated in Japanese yen and the rest was primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Considering the type of interest and currency of our assets, we employ certain derivative financial instruments, which include interest rate swaps, currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts. We enter into interest rate swaps to convert fixed interest rate into floating interest rate (or vice versa) and currency swaps or foreign exchange forward contracts to convert funds in Japanese yen into U.S. dollars (or vice versa). The proportion of interest bearing debt with floating interest rate after taking into account interest rate swaps is nearly same as last years ratio, and management believes that it is consistent with interest rate conditions of our current balance sheet. See Note 25, DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, for further description of our derivative financial instruments. Credit Ratings To facilitate access to funds from capital markets, Mitsui and certain of our overseas subsidiaries have obtained ratings from Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I), Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys) and Standard and Poors Services (S&P). The ratings as of June 2009 were as follows: R&I Moodys S&P Commercial paper rating a-1+ P-1 A-1 Long-term corporate credit rating AA-  A+ Long-term unsecured senior debt rating AA- A2  Medium-term note program rating AA- A2  S&P raised our long-term credit rating to A+ from A in March 2008. S&P cited the following factors for the change in ratings:  Improving balance between our risk assets and risk buffer; and  Enhancement of our risk management system. Credit ratings are an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risks associated with us and are based on information provided by us and other sources that the rating agencies consider reliable. Credit ratings do not constitute a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and are subject to change or withdrawal by each of the rating agencies at any time. As rating agencies may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated with a company, you should evaluate each rating independently of other ratings. Ratings may be changed without pre-notice at any time. Liquidity Management Cash and cash equivalents, which were mostly in Japanese yen, were ¥1,147.8 billion as of March 31, 2009, an increase of ¥248.5 billion from March 31, 2008. This increase is primarily attributable to a surplus in free cash flow. As a result, management believes that cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2009 satisfy the liquidity for the repayment of short-term debt (¥454.1 billion) and current maturities of long-term debt (¥373.2 billion) Commencing from the subprime mortgage crisis, turmoil in financial market brought about the sharp drop in property and commodity prices and volatility in foreign exchange market, and then it had much harmful effect on the real economic activity such as the sudden slow-down of consumption, causing red figures on the manufacturers books and sharp fall in the stock market. At the same time, huge loss of the major financial institutions in various countries caused by substantial valuation loss in securitized products triggered credit crunch all over the world, and it forced financial institutions to tighten the credit line to the corporate customer. After Lehman Brothers bankruptcy filing, the credit market conditions were supported to some degree by the massive supply of liquidity, rate reduction as well as credit support program by the central banks and the equity injection to the financial institutions by the governments, but the credit market situation was still required to be monitored closely. 138 Table of Contents Under such circumstances, we procured necessary funds in accordance with our basic funding policy by utilizing the long-term relationship with financial institutions and measures implemented by public financial institutions. The primary source in the direct finance is issuance of domestic corporate bonds, while the primary source in the in-direct finance are borrowings from banks and life insurance companies. Approximately 87.6% of total interest bearing debt as of March 31, 2009 was long-term debt and this ratio was almost same as last fiscal years ratio (87.4%). For the details of the long-term debt, interest rate structure and the maturity profile of our outstanding debt as of March 31, 2009, see Note 13, SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT. As of March 31, 2009, although shareholders equity decreased to ¥1,881.7 billion, a decline of ¥302.0 billion from March 31, 2008, Net DER stayed 1.34 as of March 31, 2009 almost same as 1.27 as of March 31, 2008, since net interest bearing debt was also decreased by ¥258.9 billion to ¥2,515.1 billion. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities as of March 31, 2009 was 158.3%, up by 11.3% points from 147.0% as of March 31, 2008. Judging by the numbers above, we believe that our balance sheet has been financially maintained in good shape at this stage, even though we suffered limited impact by the turmoil in the financial market. As of March 31, 2009, we had given guarantees for obligations of various third parties and associated companies. These guarantees are not expected to require substantial use of our capital resources. We have not had any material payment requirements resulting from these guarantees for the past three years. For details on guarantees issued by us, see Note 22, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES. With the exception of project financing and non-recourse financing, it is our policy not to conclude agreements for important financial transactions with financial institutions that contain additional debt restriction clauses that may cause acceleration of our obligations, including debt incurrence restrictions, negative pledges, restrictions on dividend payments and various financial ratio limits, and there are no material financial covenants in the agreements undertaken. Assuming that our subsidiaries have sufficient distributable net assets or retained earnings as provided under the local laws of the relevant jurisdictions, there are no material contractual or legal restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of dividends, loans or advances. There are no material economic restrictions on payments of dividends, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries other than general withholding or other taxes calculated at the rates determined by the local tax laws of the relevant jurisdictions. We plan to contribute ¥4.2 billion to our defined-benefit pension plans for the year ending March 31, 2010. This cash requirement will be managed under our funding policy mentioned above. 139 Table of Contents Investment Plans and Financial Policies of the Medium-Term Management Outlook For the year ended March 31, 2009, we forecasted total investing cash outflow to be approximately ¥700 billion, reflecting a favorable investing environment. We also plan assets recycling for total sum of approximately ¥270 billion(*1). Facing the credit crunch and economic slowdown triggered by the financial crisis, during the year ended March 31, 2009, new investments and loans we executed were limited to approximately ¥520 billion due to further intensification of our financial discipline. Cash generated through continued divestitures of non core businesses was ¥190 billion due to tightening of credit crunch as well as decline in asset value(*2). Most of these investments and divestitures were executed in the six month period ended September 30, 2008. For the six month period ended September 30, 2008, cash outflow for the investments and loans and cash inflow from the divestitures were approximately ¥320 billion and ¥120 billion, respectively. As a result, net cash used in investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥290.9 billion. On the other hand, net cash provided by operating activities increased to ¥582.7 billion in spite of the decrease in net income for the year ended March 31, 2009, as most of factors of the decrease were losses on non-cash items. Free cash flow for the year ended March 31, 2009 was a net inflow of ¥291.8 billion. See Cash Flows, for further description of cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2009. As of the issuing date of this annual report, during the year ending March 31, 2010, we plan total sum of ¥360 billion expenditure for investments and loans, which includes investments and loans in the Mineral Resources & Energy area for ¥120 billion mainly for projects under development or for expansion, in the Global Marketing Networks area for ¥70 to 100 billion, in the Consumer Services areas for ¥10 to 20 billion and Infrastructure for ¥140 billion. We also plan assets recycling for total sum of approximately ¥120 billion. We expect a break-even free cash flow for the year ending March 31, 2010 led by operating activities with positive cash inflow while cash flows from investing activities continue to be still negative. During the year ended March 31, 2009, the financial crisis led us to implement proactive interventions in achieving a positive free cash flow. Included in such interventions were reducing our working capital, accelerating divestitures of non-core assets and intensifying financial discipline and execution in investments. We continue to work on the initiatives to achieve a positive free cash flow trend continuously and stably. Compared to the assumptions in our Medium-term Management Outlook, we could not achieve our targeted earnings of the original plan, but we expect stable positive free cash flow trend as following efforts: improvement of working capital, intensifying financial discipline and execution in investments, and generating cash for investment by internal financing. Additionally, given the exceptionally high level of uncertainty surrounding financial markets as well as the global economy, we believe that it would also be beneficial for the shareholders in the medium- to long-term if we strive to further strengthen our balance sheet. Accordingly, we would like to maintain the targeted dividend payout ratio at 20% of consolidated net income. However, we also believe that it would be necessary for us to continue seeking new investment opportunities that may provide us a foundation for our future. Even in such opportunities, we try to generate funds for the investments through additional divestures in order to maintain the leverage with a marginal increase. (*1) Mitsui defines Investment Plan with the combined total of investing cash flows of operating segments other than All Other Segment and Adjustments and Eliminations. Financial services from and to Mitsui and its subsidiaries referred to in Funding and Treasury Policies and Objectives and Liquidity Management above are provided by the All Other Segment. Acquisitions of and proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities as investing activities in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows are mostly conducted by the All Other Segment which includes the units in charge of corporate financing and liquidity management as discussed in Funding Sources. (*2) See Cash Flows from Investing Activities of Cash Flows for the breakdown by operating segment. 140 Table of Contents We forecast that total interest bearing debt as of March 31, 2010 will remain at the same level as of March 31, 2009. We also forecast that Net DER as of March 31, 2010 will remain at the same level as of March 31, 2009 at 1.34 times. For the details of the refinance by direct financing from capital markets and fund raisingincluding project financefrom the private sector and government financing agencies, see Funding and Treasury Policies and Objectives and Funding Sources. Many of the projects in the investment plan involve bidding. The outcome of bidding will have an effect on our actual cash flows and financial condition for the year ending March 31, 2010. Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders Equity Total assets as of March 31, 2009 were ¥8,364.2 billion, a decrease of ¥1,173.6 billion from ¥9,537.8 billion as of March 31, 2008. Current assets as of March 31, 2009 were ¥4,419.1 billion, a decrease of ¥639.0 billion from ¥5,058.1 billion as of March 31, 2008. Trade receivables declined by ¥893.9 billion due to decreased crude oil and oil product trading volumes reflecting the decline of the oil prices, in the Energy Segment and America Segment, and also declines in the commodity prices and trading volumes in the Chemical and the Iron & Steel Products Segment, while cash and cash equivalents increased by ¥248.5 billion to secure the liquidity for the financial turmoil. Total current liabilities as of March 31, 2009 were ¥2,792.5 billion, a decrease of ¥649.1 billion from ¥3,441.6 billion as of March 31, 2008 due to a decline in trade payables corresponding to the decline in trade receivables. As a result, working capital, or current assets minus current liabilities, as of March 31, 2009 was ¥1,626.6 billion, resulting in an increase of ¥10.1 billion from ¥1,616.5 billion as of March 31, 2008.

Compared to the year ended March 31, 2007, net cash raised by financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2008 decreased by ¥454.7 billion, reflecting decreases in net cash from both short term and long term debt from the year ended March 31, 2007. 149 Table of Contents C. Research & Development For the years ended March 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, research and development (R&D) expenses for the various R&D activities totaled ¥3.5 billion, ¥4.0 billion and ¥3.9 billion, respectively. Management recognizes that individual R&D activity will not have a significant impact on our future operating results. D. Trend Information See Item 5.A, B, E and F. E. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We use off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business to further our trading, fund-raising and other activities. Categories of off-balance sheet arrangements are as follows: Guarantees The following tables summarize our guarantees as of March 31, 2009 and 2008. The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the amount without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provision or from collateral held or pledged that we could be obliged to pay if there were defaults by guaranteed parties or there were changes in an underlying which would cause triggering events under market value guarantees and indemnification contracts. Such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses on these guarantees and indemnifications, and they greatly exceed anticipated losses. Estimated proceeds from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated values of assets we could liquidate or receive from other parties to offset our payments under guarantees. The carrying amounts of liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect our best estimate of future payments we may incur as part of fulfilling our guarantee obligations.

As lessees in operating lease contracts, certain subsidiaries have issued residual value guarantees of leased ocean transport vessels, and on the date of expiration of operating lease contracts, such subsidiaries will either purchase the leased assets at a fixed price or will be responsible for making up any shortfall between the actual sales price and the guaranteed value. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable 150 Table of Contents Interest Entities (revised December 2003)-an Interpretation of ARB No. 51 on December 31, 2003, we consolidated ¥11.9 billion and ¥12.2 billion of total assets related to certain ocean transport vessels entities at March 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. This information is provided in Note 23, VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES. Sales of Trade Receivables At March 31, 2009 and 2008, the outstanding amounts of off-balance sheet arrangements in which certain trade receivables are sold to third parties were immaterial. Variable Interest Entities We are involved with and have significant variable interests in a number of variable interest entities (VIEs) that are not consolidated because we are not the primary beneficiary, but in which we have significant variable interests. These VIEs mainly engage in leasing and financing activities. Further information is provided in Note 23, VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES. Commitments on Deferred Payments We had no financing commitments at March 31, 2009 and 2008. Contingent Liabilities See Note 22, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES. F. Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations The following table provides our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2009 and payment due by period of these contractual obligations: Billions of Yen Payment Due by Period Contractual Obligations Balance as ofMarch 31, 2009 March2010 March2012 March2014 AfterMarch 2014 Long-Term Debt(1) ¥ 3,159 ¥ 363 ¥ 641 ¥ 680 ¥ 1,475 Capital Lease Obligations(2) 30 8 12 5 5 Operating Leases(3) 143 36 45 29 33 Long-Term Purchase Contracts(4) 3,264 1,017 1,083 455 709 (1) The amounts of Long-Term Debt include bank borrowings and bonds, excluding the effect of the SFAS No. 133 fair value adjustment and capital lease obligations (present value of net minimum lease payments). (2) Capital Lease Obligations represents the schedule of payments for future minimum lease payments. (3) Operating Leases represents the schedule of payments for future minimum rentals. Minimum rental payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of ¥40.4 billion due in the future under noncancelable subleases. (4) Long-Term Purchase Contracts represents the schedule of payments for long-term purchase obligations, net of advance payments of ¥160 billion made to suppliers as of March 31, 2009. For additional information regarding long-term debt, capital lease obligations and operating leases, see Note 13, SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT, and Note 8, LEASES, respectively. In addition to the above, we plan to contribute ¥4.2 billion to our defined benefit pension plans for the year ending March 31, 2010. The table above excludes estimated interest payments on liabilities and estimated payments under interest swap. Total cash paid for interest during the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥84.0 billion. 151 Table of Contents Concerning only Mitsui which has approximately 71% of total interest bearing debt, estimated interest payments on liabilities and estimated payments under interest swaps were ¥232.6 billion. The payment amount by period was ¥30.5 billion due by March 2010, ¥51.9 billion due by March 2012, ¥55.6 billion due by March 2014 and ¥94.6 billion due after March 2014. The table above also excludes unrecognized tax benefits of ¥4.3 billion. Unrecognized tax benefits classified as current liabilities are ¥0.9 billion. The timing of future cash outflows associated with unrecognized tax benefits classified as non current liabilities is highly uncertain. The purchased items under Long-Term Purchase Contracts are principally ocean transport vessels, oil products, chemical materials, metals and machinery and equipment, either at fixed prices or at basic purchase prices adjustable to the market. In general, our customers, primarily large Japanese industrial companies and shipping firms, are also parties to the contracts, or conclude separate agreements with us, and are committed to purchasing the items from us. Therefore, management does not recognize that these long-term purchase contracts could have seriously adverse effects on our future liquidity. As of March 31, 2009, there was no outstanding balance of purchase contracts which have unconditional payment conditions. Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees. A. Directors and Senior Management. We are managed by a Board of Directors and Executive Officers. As of June 23, 2009, we have twelve Directors and forty Executive Officers including seven of whom are also Directors.

The Board of Directors is our decision-making body. The Board of Directors determines our basic guidelines and policies by establishing our corporate strategy, reviewing our business plans, and supervising and monitoring the activities of our Executive Officers. The Executive Officers are responsible for the execution of our corporate activities.

As of June 23, 2009, Mitsuis Executive Officers consisted of one President, four Executive Vice Presidents, five Senior Executive Managing Officers, ten Executive Managing Officers and twenty Managing Officers. The execution of the Directors functions (including their functions to supervise and monitor the activities of the Executive Officers) is audited by Corporate Auditors. Each Corporate Auditor is elected by shareholders of Mitsui at a general meeting of shareholders. As of June 23, 2009, we have six Corporate Auditors. In performing their auditing activities, they act independently of each other while they constitute and act through the Board of Corporate Auditors, as the Companies Act of Japan requires. 152 Table of Contents Directors, Corporate Auditors and Executive Officers Our Directors, Corporate Auditors and Executive Officers as of June 23, 2009 were: Directors Name Position Shoei Utsuda Chairman of the Board of Directors Masami Iijima Representative Director Ken Abe Representative Director Yoshiyuki Izawa Representative Director Junichi Matsumoto Representative Director Norinao Iio Representative Director Seiichi Tanaka Representative Director Takao Omae Representative Director Akishige Okada(1) Director Nobuko Matsubara(1) Director Ikujiro Nonaka(1) Director Hiroshi Hirabayashi(1) Director (1) Mr. Akishige Okada, Ms. Nobuko Matsubara, Mr. Ikujiro Nonaka and Mr. Hiroshi Hirabayashi are external directors.

Compensation. The aggregate amount of compensation and benefits in kind paid to Directors, Corporate Auditors and Executive Officers during the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥4,016 million. A breakdown is provided as below. Directors and Corporate Auditors The remuneration of Directors and Corporate Auditors totaling ¥1,119 million during the year ended March 31, 2009 was as follows. Number of recipients Total remuneration paidrelating to the year endedMarch 31, 2009 Directors 16 ¥ 902 million Corporate Auditors 8 ¥ 217 million External Directors and External Corporate Auditors (included in the above amounts) 9 ¥ 96 million Total 24 ¥ 1,119 million 161 Table of Contents Notes: i) Limits on remuneration of Directors and Corporate Auditors have been determined by General Meeting of Shareholders resolutions as follows: for Directors, there is a total limit of ¥70 million per month (by resolution of June 22, 2007); for Corporate Auditors, there is a total limit of ¥20 million per month (by resolution of June 22, 2007). ii) The above amounts include ¥178 million in bonuses for Directors (excluding external Directors), which was determined by the following system. Total bonuses for Directors (excluding External Directors) are calculated as the lesser of consolidated net income x 0.1% and ¥500 million, which is payable to each director in proportionate allocation according to points given to each Directors position. The Remuneration Committee reviewed the formula and reported to the Board of Directors in advance of the Board of Directors decision to establish the formula. Executive Officers The remuneration of Executive Officers (excluding Executive Officers who are also Directors) totaled ¥2,173 million during the year ended March 31, 2009, comprised of ¥748 million in bonuses and ¥1,425 million in monthly remunerations. The Remuneration Committee also reviews and reports to the Board of Directors on appropriateness of remuneration system and compensation levels for Executive Officers. Pension Plans and Retirement Allowances In addition, the aggregate amount of benefits from Directors and Corporate Auditors Pension Plans and retirement allowances for retiring Directors and Corporate Auditorsaccrued prior to the abolition of the retirement allowance systempaid during the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥724 million. Our retirement allowance system for Directors and Corporate Auditors was abolished pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors in February 2004. Up to this resolution, in accordance with customary Japanese business practices, a retiring Director or Corporate Auditor was entitled to receive a retirement allowance, which was subject to approval by shareholders at a general meeting of shareholders. The amount of the retirement allowance generally reflected the number of years of service, rank at the time of retirement and special contributions to our performance. After the abolition of the retirement allowance system, retirement allowances are not paid except for those accrued prior to the abolition. The aggregate amount set aside by us to provide pension benefits to Directors and Corporate Auditors was ¥3,554 million as of March 31, 2009. Mitsui has no stock option plans for Mitsuis Directors and Senior Management as of June 23, 2009. C. Board Practices. The information in Item 6.A. Directors and Senior Management is incorporated into this section by reference. None of our Directors have entered into any service contracts with us providing for benefits upon termination of his or her employment. The Companies Act of Japan allows a company to adopt the Committee System as the framework for corporate governance. We have decided, however, to maintain the corporate auditor system because we believe that our Corporate Auditors, of whom two are full-time and four are external Auditors as of June 23, 2009 and whose functions are legally defined and reinforced, provide adequate auditing functions. Furthermore, internal Directors are familiar with our business operations and can therefore contribute to effective management. 162 Table of Contents Although we retained the corporate auditor system, we have decided to adopt certain aspects of the Committee System and have established three committees (the Governance Committee, the Nomination Committee, and the Remuneration Committee) to provide advice to the Board of Directors. Functions and Composition of three committees The functions and composition of three committees are provided as below. Governance Committee Assignment : To study the state and direction of Mitsuis corporate governance Composition : Chairman of the Board of Directors (committee chair, Shoei Utsuda), President (Masami Iijima), External Directors 2 (Nobuko Matsubara, Ikujiro Nonaka), internal Directors 3 (Junichi Matsumoto, Norinao Iio, Seiichi Tanaka), External Corporate Auditor 1 (Hideharu Kadowaki) Nomination Committee Assignment : To establish the selection standards and processes used in nominating directors and executive officers as well as evaluating director nomination proposals Composition : President (committee chair, Masami Iijima), External Directors 2 (Akishige Okada, Hiroshi Hirabayashi), internal Directors 2 (Norinao Iio, Seiichi Tanaka) Remuneration Committee Assignment : To study the system and decision-making process related to remuneration and bonuses for directors and executive officers as well as evaluating remuneration proposals for them Composition : External Director (committee chair, Akishige Okada), President (Masami Iijima), internal Directors 2 (Junichi Matsumoto, Norinao Iio) Our Directors and Corporate Auditors are elected at the general meeting of shareholders. In accordance with our Articles of Incorporation, the normal term of office for our Directors is one year and for our Corporate Auditors is four years.

The number of shares held by Mitsuis Directors, Corporate Auditors and Executive Officers, on an individual basis, is provided in Item 6.C.

In July, 2006, a new management shareholding scheme was introduced, whereby each of Mitsuis Directors (excluding external Directors) and Executive Officers are required to purchase Mitsuis shares through Mitsui Executives Shareholding Association. Mitsuis Directors (excluding external Directors) and Executive Officers purchase Mitsuis shares in an amount equivalent to 10% of his or her salary, which amount is deducted from his or her salary for the purchases through said Mitsui Executives Shareholding Association. Employees Shareholding Association Mitsui operates an Employees Shareholding Association which, as of March 31, 2009, had 3,639 employee member participants. Employee members declare monthly the amount to be deducted from his or her salary to be used to purchase shares of common stock of Mitsui through the Employees Shareholding Association.

Employee members are entitled to dividends which are applied towards the purchase of additional shares through the Employees Shareholding Association. Employee members are able to sell part of their shares that have been reserved for them under the Employees Shareholding Associations plan, in multiples of 100 shares (1,000 shares until March 2009), once every month. As of March 31, 2009, the total amount of shares having voting rights owned by the Employees Shareholding Association was 11,537,281, representing 0.63% of the total shares issued and outstanding.

Related Party Transactions When conducting our business operations throughout the world, we form alliances with leading partner companies in Japan and overseas, including manufacturers and companies in the field of natural resources, such as energy and ferrous materials. In addition to investing in, or providing loans to, associated companies where we are a minority shareholder, we conduct selling and purchasing transactions of various products on a recurring basis with such associated companies. Our principal associated companies include Valepar S.A. (18.24%), Japan Australia LNG (MIMI) Pty. Ltd. (50.00%), Sims Metal Management Limited (The company changed its name from Sims Group Limited.) (19.99%), P.T. Paiton Energy (36.32%), IPM (UK) Power Holdings (26.32%), and Penske Automotive Group, Inc. (17.00%), among others.

Prices applied in transactions with associated companies are computed in the same way that such prices would be calculated in transactions with unrelated third parties. In addition, when associated companies are counterparties in transactions with us and we conduct such business under long-term procurement and/or sales contracts, in general, we conclude a corresponding sales contract with the purchasers (unrelated parties) of goods procured by us and/or with suppliers (unrelated parties) of the goods we sell to associated companies. Regarding any other commitments related to transactions with associated companies, we do not normally assume risk in excess of its percentage of share ownership in an associated company. In furtherance of their trading activities, it is customary practice for us to loan or guarantee, severally and jointly with others, indebtedness of certain customers and suppliers and of certain associated companies as well as to guarantee the performance of contracts by such entities. At March 31, 2009, the aggregate amount of loans (including ¥74 billion guarantees) relating to associated companies was ¥281billion. The largest amount outstanding as of March 31, 2009 was ¥30 billion loan with interest to P&M Drilling International B.V., which engages in capital lease operation in Netherlands. The loan was mainly from Mitsui. Other major loans to associated companies are related to the power plant project and the lease operation of ships. In the ordinary course of our business, we have entered into transactions with various organizations with which certain of our Directors and Senior Management are associated, but no material transactions have been entered into for the three-year period ended March 31, 2009. As of March 31, 2009, no person was the beneficial owner of more than 10% of our common stock. C. Interests of Experts and Counsel. Not applicable. Item 8. Financial Information. A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information. Consolidated Financial Statements The audited consolidated financial statements required by this item are included elsewhere in this annual report. Export Sales The total amount of revenues from export transactions for the year ended March 31, 2009 was ¥494 billion or 9% of total revenue of ¥5,535 billion. Legal Proceedings Various claims and legal actions are pending against us in respect of contractual obligations and other matters arising out of the conduct of our business. Appropriate provision has been recorded for the estimated loss on claims and legal actions. In the opinion of management, any liability will not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Dividend Policy It is Mitsuis basic policy to declare dividends twice per year. The record date for year-end dividends is March 31 and the record date for interim dividends is September 30. For a discussion of dividend distribution provisions under the Companies Act of Japan and Mitsuis Articles of Incorporation, see Item 10.B. Memorandum and Articles of Association. 170 Table of Contents In order to maximize shareholder value, we have sought to maintain an optimal balance between (1) achieving sustainable growth through strategic investments in areas of our core strength and growth and (2) paying out cash dividends as direct compensation to shareholders with the target dividend payout ratio of 20% of consolidated net income. For the year ended March 31, 2009, due to the drastic decline in earnings especially during the second half of the fiscal year, the dividend amount calculated in accordance with the payout ratio of 20% of consolidated net income was lower than the interim dividends of ¥25 per share which we had already paid. Accordingly, we determined not to pay any additional year-end dividends. For the year ending March 31, 2010, we intend to make a dividend proposal upon reviewing the operating results. The key factors for the proposal are as follows: (1) In light of the current business circumstances, we forecast a substantial decline in earnings for the year ending March 31, 2010 due to prolonged economic downturn and decline in commodity prices, although we have recently started to see a few bright spots in the markets which suggest there may be some recovery in the near future. (2) Given the exceptionally high level of uncertainty surrounding financial markets as well as the global economy, we believe that it would be for the benefit of the shareholders in the medium- to long-term if we strive to further strengthen our balance sheet. (3) We also believe that it would be necessary for us to continue seeking new investment opportunities that may provide us a foundation for our future with the utmost financial discipline. Accordingly, we currently plan to maintain the target dividend payout ratio of 20% of consolidated net income. We will continue to review the dividend policy taking into consideration the business environment, future trend of the investing activities, free cash flow level, interest bearing debt level and return on equity. B. Significant Changes Except as disclosed in this annual report, there has not been any significant change since the date of the latest annual financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. Item 9. The Offer and Listing. A. Offer and Listing Details. The primary market for Mitsuis common stock is the Tokyo Stock Exchange, or TSE. Mitsuis common stock is traded on the First Section of the TSE and is also listed on four other stock exchanges in Japan (Osaka, Nagoya, Fukuoka and Sapporo Stock Exchanges). Mitsuis American Depositary Shares (ADSs), each representing 20 shares of common stock, are traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol MITSY. American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), each evidencing one or more ADSs, were originally issued pursuant to a Deposit Agreement in May 1963, as amended from time to time, that we entered into with Citibank N.A. of New York as Depositary and the holders of the ADRs. 171 Table of Contents The following table provides the reported high and low closing sales prices of our common stock on the TSE and the reported high and low closing bid price quotations per ADS for the period indicated: TSE NASDAQ Price per Share ofCommon Stock(Yen) Price per ADS(U.S. dollars)(1) High Low High Low Year ended March 31: 2005 ¥ 1,074 ¥ 773 $ 206.20 $ 137.50 2006 1,731 908 292.66 171.50 2007 2,315 1,427 382.21 245.00 2008 3,080 1,704 538.92 336.25 2009 2,750 691 526.70 141.44 Year ended March 31, 2008: First quarter ¥ 2,595 ¥ 2,040 $ 416.60 $ 347.21 Second quarter 2,880 2,005 501.67 371.60 Third quarter 3,080 2,270 538.92 395.02 Fourth quarter 2,405 1,704 463.97 336.25 Year ended March 31, 2009: First quarter ¥ 2,750 ¥ 2,040 $ 526.70 $ 400.04 Second quarter 2,425 1,278 454.20 212.45 Third quarter 1,352 691 257.00 141.44 Fourth quarter 1,077 806 232.77 163.53 Year ending March 31, 2010: First quarter ¥ 1,308 ¥ 1,024 $ 271.90 $ 211.53 Month of: January 2009 ¥ 1,052 ¥ 875 $ 220.00 $ 190.62 February 2009 1,045 872 232.77 176.42 March 2009 1,077 806 219.01 163.53 April 2009 1,206 1,024 242.80 211.53 May 2009 1,216 1,075 253.72 227.14 June 2009 1,308 1,111 271.90 233.10 (1) All fractional figures of the prices per ADS are rounded to the nearest two decimal points. Share prices on Japanese stock exchanges are determined on a real-time basis by the equilibrium between bids and offers. These exchanges set daily price limits, which limit the maximum range of fluctuation within a single trading day. Daily price limits are set according to the previous days closing price or special quote. Although transactions may continue at the upward or downward limit price if the limit price is reached on a particular trading day, no transactions may take place outside these limits. Consequently, an investor wishing to sell at a price above or below the relevant daily limit may not be able to sell his shares at such price on a particular trading day, or at all. On July 10, 2009, the closing sales price per share of our common stock on the TSE was ¥1,049, and the closing sales price per ADS on the NASDAQ Global Select Market was U.S.$225.17. B.
