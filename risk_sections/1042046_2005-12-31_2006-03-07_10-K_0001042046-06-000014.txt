ITEM 1A Risk Factors Following is a discussion of the most significant risk factors to investors in AFG securities. Intense competition could adversely affect AFG's profitability. The specialty insurance business is highly competitive and, except for regulatory considerations, there are relatively few barriers to entry. AFG's specialty insurance businesses compete with other individual insurers, state funds and insurance groups of varying sizes, some of which are mutual insurance companies possessing competitive advantages in that all their profits inure to their policyholders. AFG also competes with self-insurance plans, captive programs and risk retention groups. Major competitors in some or all of AFG's specialty lines include American International Group Inc., Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Chubb Corp., W.R. Berkley Corp., CNA Financial Corp., Philadelphia Consolidated Holdings Corp., Markel Corp., Hartford Financial Services Group, The St. Paul Travelers Companies Inc., and Zenith National Insurance Corp. AFG's annuity and supplemental insurance businesses compete with individual insurers and insurance groups, mutual funds and other financial institutions. Competitors include ING Life Insurance and Annuity Company, Life Insurance Company of the Southwest, Midland National Life Insurance Company, Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America, Fidelity and Guaranty Life Insurance Company, Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company and Bankers Life and Casualty Company. Competition is based on many factors, including service to policyholders and agents, product design, reputation for claims handling, ratings and financial strength. Price, commissions, profit sharing terms and interest crediting rates are also important factors. Some of AFG's competitors have more capital and greater resources than AFG, and may offer a broader range of products and lower prices than AFG offers. If competition limits AFG's ability to write new or renewal business at adequate rates, its results of operations will be adversely affected. AFG's revenues could be negatively affected if it is not able to attract and retain independent agents. AFG's reliance on the independent agency market makes it vulnerable to a reduction in the amount of business written by agents. Many of AFG's competitors also rely significantly on the independent agency market. Accordingly, AFG must compete with other insurance carriers for independent agents' business. Some of its competitors offer a wider variety of products, lower price for insurance coverage or higher commissions. Loss of a substantial portion of the business that AFG writes through independent agents could adversely affect AFG's revenues and profitability. AFG is subject to comprehensive regulation, and its ability to earn profits may be restricted by these regulations. As previously discussed under "Regulation," AFG is subject to comprehensive regulation by government agencies in the states where its insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled and where these subsidiaries issue policies and handle claims. AFG must obtain prior approval for certain corporate actions. The regulations may limit AFG's ability to obtain rate increases or take other actions designed to increase AFG's profitability. In addition, state insurance department examiners perform periodic financial and market conduct examinations of insurance companies. Such regulation is generally intended for the protection of policyholders rather than securityholders. There can be no assurance that existing insurance-related laws and regulations will not become more restrictive in the future or that new restrictive laws will not be enacted and, therefore, it is not possible to predict the potential effects of these laws and regulations. The costs of compliance or the failure to comply with existing or future regulations could harm AFG's financial results and its reputation with customers. 16 The failure of AFG's insurers to maintain a commercially acceptable financial strength rating would have a significant negative effect on their ability to compete successfully. As discussed under "Property and Casualty Insurance Operations" and "Annuity and Supplemental Insurance Operations - General," financial strength ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and may be expected to have an effect on an insurance company's sales. A downgrade in AFG's insurers' claims-paying and financial strength ratings could significantly reduce AFG's business volumes, adversely impact AFG's ability to access the capital markets and increase AFG's borrowing costs. AFG's results may fluctuate as a result of cyclical changes in the specialty insurance industry. As previously discussed under "Property and Casualty Insurance Operations," the underwriting profitability of the property and casualty insurance industry has been historically cyclical in nature. The trend of AFG's underwriting results typically follows that of the industry and a prolonged downcycle could adversely affect AFG's results of operations. AFG's property and casualty reserves may be inadequate, which could significantly affect AFG's financial results. AFG's property and casualty insurance subsidiaries record reserve liabilities for the estimated payment of losses and loss adjustment expenses for both reported and unreported claims. Due to the inherent uncertainty of estimating reserves, it has been necessary in the past, and will continue to be necessary in the future, to revise estimated liabilities as reflected in AFG's reserves for claims and related expenses. For example, in 2005, 2004 and 2003, AFG recorded charges of $181 million (primarily the A&E charge), $140 million and $167 million, respectively, to increase reserves relating to prior accident years. The historic development of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expense may not necessarily reflect future trends in the development of these amounts. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to extrapolate redundancies or deficiencies based on historical information. To the extent that reserves are inadequate and are strengthened, the amount of such increase is treated as a charge to earnings in the period in which the deficiency is recognized. AFG's results could be negatively impacted by severe weather conditions or other catastrophes. AFG recorded significant catastrophe losses in 2005 and 2004, primarily due to hurricanes. Catastrophes can be caused by natural events, such as hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, tornadoes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, explosions and fire, and by man-made events, such as terrorist attacks and riots. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of the amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. However, a severe catastrophe or a series of catastrophes could result in losses exceeding AFG's reinsurance protection and may have a material adverse impact on its results of operations or financial condition. Volatility in crop prices could negatively impact AFG's financial results. Weather conditions and the level of crop prices in the commodities market heavily impact AFG's crop insurance business. These factors are inherently unpredictable and could result in significant volatility in the results of the crop insurance business from one year to the next. A significant decline in used car prices could negatively impact AFG's financial results. AFG's residual value business is heavily impacted by the level of used car prices. A significant decrease in the market value of used automobiles could result in significant losses and may have a material adverse impact on AFG's results of operations or its financial condition. 17 The inability to obtain reinsurance or to collect on ceded reinsurance could adversely impact AFG's results. AFG relies on the use of reinsurance to limit the amount of risk it retains. The following amounts of gross property and casualty premiums have been ceded to other insurers: 2005 - $1.3 billion (34%); 2004 - $1.5 billion (41%); and 2003 - $1.6 billion (46%). The availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions, which are beyond AFG's control and which may affect AFG's level of business and profitability. AFG is also subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurers, as the ceding of risk to reinsurers does not relieve AFG of its liability to insureds. Variations from the actuarial assumptions used to establish certain assets and liabilities in AFG's annuity and supplemental insurance business could negatively impact AFG's reported financial results. The earnings on certain products sold by AFG's annuity and supplemental insurance business depend significantly upon the extent to which actual experience is consistent with the assumptions used in setting reserves and establishing and amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs ("DPAC"). These assumptions relate to investment yields (and spreads over fixed annuity crediting rates), mortality, surrenders, annuitizations and, on some policies, morbidity. Developing such assumptions is complex and involves information obtained from company-specific and industry-wide data, as well as general economic information. These assumptions, and therefore AFG's results of operations, could be negatively impacted by changes in any of the factors listed above. For example, AFG recorded pretax charges in 2005 of (i) $15.8 million to DPAC and annuity liabilities due primarily to the negative effect of lower interest rates on expected future profits of its fixed annuity operations and (ii) $13.6 million related to an unexpected increase in mortality in its run-off life operations. The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military and other actions may adversely affect AFG's financial results. The continued threat of terrorism, both within the United States and abroad, and the ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats, may cause significant volatility and declines in the equity markets in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, loss of life, property damage, additional disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. Actual terrorist attacks could cause losses from insurance claims related to AFG's property and casualty and life insurance operations with adverse financial consequences. In addition, some of the assets in AFG's investment portfolios may be adversely affected by declines in the capital markets and economic activity caused by the continued threat of terrorism, ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures. Adverse securities market conditions can have significant negative effects on AFG's investment portfolio. AFG's results of operations depend in part on the performance of its invested assets. As of December 31, 2005, 90% of AFG's investment portfolio was invested in fixed maturity securities and 3% in equity securities. Certain risks are inherent in connection with fixed maturity securities including loss upon default and price volatility in reaction to changes in interest rates and general market factors. See Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Fixed Maturity Portfolio." AFG cannot predict whether and the extent to which industry sectors in which it maintains investments may suffer losses as a result of potential decreased commercial and economic activity, or how any such decrease might impact the ability of companies within the affected industry sectors to pay interest or principal on their securities, or how the value of any underlying collateral might be affected. Investment returns are an important part of AFG's overall profitability. Accordingly, adverse fluctuations in the fixed income or equity markets could adversely impact AFG's profitability, financial condition or cash flows. 18 As a holding company, AFG is dependent on the results of operations of its insurance company subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay future dividends. AFG is a holding company and a legal entity separate and distinct from its insurance company subsidiaries. As a holding company without significant operations of its own, AFG's principal sources of funds are dividends and other distributions from its insurance company subsidiaries. As discussed under "Regulation," state insurance laws limit the ability of insurance companies to pay dividends or other distributions and require insurance companies to maintain specified levels of statutory capital and surplus. AFG's rights to participate in any distribution of assets of its insurance company subsidiaries are subject to prior claims of policyholders and creditors (except to the extent that its rights, if any, as a creditor are recognized). Consequently, AFG's ability to pay debts, expenses and cash dividends to its shareholders may be limited. AFG may be adversely impacted by a downgrade in the ratings of its debt securities. AFG's debt securities are rated by Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch, independent corporate credit rating agencies. AFG's senior indebtedness is currently rated BBB by Standard & Poor's, Baa3 by Moody's and BBB+ by Fitch. Securities ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. An unfavorable change in either of these ratings could make it more expensive to access the capital markets and may increase the interest rate charged under AFG's current multi-bank credit line. AFG is a party to litigation which, if decided adversely, could impact its financial results. AFG and its subsidiaries are named as defendants in a number of lawsuits. See "Property and Casualty Insurance Operations - Asbestos and Environmental Reserves ("A&E"),""Legal Proceedings," and "Management's Discussion and Analysis - Uncertainties." Litigation, by its very nature, is unpredictable and the outcome of these cases is uncertain. AFG is unable to predict the precise nature of the relief that may be sought or granted in any lawsuits or the effect that pending or future cases may have on AFG's business, operations, profitability or financial condition. Certain shareholders exercise substantial control over AFG's affairs, which may impede a change of control transaction. Carl H. Lindner is Chairman of the Board of Directors of AFG, and his sons, Carl H. Lindner III and S. Craig Lindner, are each Co-Chief Executive Officers and Directors of AFG. Carl H. Lindner, Carl H. Lindner III and S. Craig Lindner beneficially own 11.8%, 7.3% and 7.3% of AFG's outstanding Common Stock as of February 1, 2006. Another son, Keith E. Lindner, reported in November 2005 that he beneficially owned shares representing 8.8% of AFG's outstanding Common Stock. As a result, certain members of the Lindner family have the ability to exercise significant influence over AFG's management, including over matters requiring shareholder approval. The price of AFG common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may make it difficult for holders to resell common stock when they want or at a price they find attractive. The price of AFG's common stock as listed on the NYSE and Nasdaq National Market constantly changes. During 2004 and 2005, AFG's common stock traded at prices ranging between $26.28 and $39.49. It is expected that the market price of AFG's common stock will continue to fluctuate. AFG's common stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond its control. These factors include but are not limited to: actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results; actual or anticipated changes in the dividends paid on AFG common stock; rating agency actions; recommendations by securities analysts; significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving AFG or its competitors; 19 operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to AFG; news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in AFG's lines of business; and geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.
