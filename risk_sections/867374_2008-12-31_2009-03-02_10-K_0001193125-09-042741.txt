Item 1A: Risk Factors We rely on sales to a relatively small number of OEM customers and the loss of any of these OEM customers could substantially decrease our revenues. A significant portion of our revenues are and have been generated by sales of our printer and copier related products to a relatively small number of OEMs. For example, Canon and Xerox each contributed over 10% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 and together accounted for approximately 29% of those revenues during the same period. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, Canon and Xerox each contributed over 10% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 and together accounted for approximately 31% of those revenues for the year. Because sales of our printer and copier-related products 12 Table of Contents constitute a significant portion of our revenues and there is a limited number of OEMs producing copiers and printers in sufficient volume to be attractive customers for us, we expect that we will continue to depend on a relatively small number of OEM customers for a significant portion of our controller revenues in future periods. In addition, our OEM customers have developed, and may continue to develop, their own controller products, which may compete directly with our products, which may adversely affect our revenues. Accordingly, if we lose or experience reduced sales to an important OEM customer, we will have difficulty replacing the revenue previously generated from such customers with sales to new or existing OEM customers and our controller revenue will likely decline significantly. The market for our super-wide-format printers is very competitive. The printing equipment industry is extremely competitive. Our VUTEk products compete against several companies that market digital printing systems based on electrostatic, drop-on-demand and continuous drop-on-demand inkjet, airbrush and other technologies and printers utilizing solvent and UV curable ink. Two large competitors, NUR and Scitex Vision, were acquired by Hewlett Packard (HP) and another large competitor, Inca, was acquired by Dai Nippon Screen (Screen). Both HP and Screen have greater resources to develop new products and technologies and market those products, as well as acquire or develop critical components at lower costs, which would provide a competitive advantage. They could also exert downward pressure on product pricing to gain market share. We have also witnessed the recent growth of local Chinese and Korean markets where local competitors are developing, manufacturing and selling inexpensive printers, mainly to the local Chinese and Korean markets. These Chinese and Korean manufacturers have also begun penetrating the international market and have partnered with other super-wide format printer manufacturers. Our ability to compete depends on factors both within and outside of our control, including the price, performance and acceptance of our current printers and any products we develop in the future. We also face competition from existing conventional wide format and super-wide format printing methods, including screen printing and offset printing. Our competitors could develop new products, with existing or new technology, that could be more competitive in our market than our printers. We cannot assure you that we can compete effectively with any such products. We face strong competition in the market for printing supplies such as ink. We compete with independent manufacturers in the ink market. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to remain the exclusive or even principal ink supplier for our printers. The loss of ink sales to our installed base of printers could adversely impact our revenues and gross margins. We could also experience an overall reduction in price within the ink markets, which would also adversely affect our gross margins. Solvent inks are relatively easy to replicate and additional manufacturers could increase pricing competition or divert customers away from us. We do not typically have long term purchase contracts with our OEM customers and our OEM customers have in the past and could at any time in the future, reduce or cease purchasing products from us, harming our operating results and business. With the exception of certain minimum purchase obligations, we typically do not have long-term volume purchase contracts with our OEM customers, including Canon, Xerox and Konica Minolta, and they are not obligated to purchase products from us. Accordingly, our customers could at any time reduce their purchases from us or cease purchasing our products altogether. In the past, some of our OEM customers have elected to develop products on their own, rather than rely, solely or partially, on our products and we expect that customers will continue to make such elections in the future. 13 Table of Contents In addition, because our OEM customers incorporate our products into products they manufacture and sell, any decline in demand for copiers or laser printers and any other negative developments affecting our major customers or the computer industry in general, including reduced demand for the products sold by our OEM customers, would likely harm our results of operations. For example, certain customers have in the past experienced serious financial difficulties which led to a decline in sales of our products to these customers. If any significant customers should face such difficulties in the future, our operating results could be harmed through, among other things, decreased sales volumes and write-offs of accounts receivables and inventory related to products we have manufactured for these customers products. In addition, a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed in advance based on projected sales levels and margins, sales forecasts from our OEM customers and product development programs. A substantial portion of our backlog is scheduled for delivery within 90 days or less and our customers may cancel orders and change volume levels or delivery times for product they have ordered from us without penalty. Accordingly, if sales to our OEM customers are below expectations in any given quarter, the adverse impact of the shortfall in revenues on operating results may be, and has been in the past, increased by our inability to adjust spending in the short term to compensate for this shortfall. We rely on our OEM customers to develop and sell products incorporating our controller technologies and if they fail to successfully develop and sell these products, or curtail or cease the use of our technologies in their products, our business will be harmed. We rely upon our OEM customers to develop new products, applications and product enhancements utilizing our controller technologies in a timely and cost-effective manner. Our continued success in the controller industry depends upon the ability of these OEM customers to utilize our technologies while meeting changing end-user customer needs and responding to emerging industry standards and other technological changes. However, we cannot provide assurance that our OEM customers will effectively meet these challenges. These OEM customers are generally not obligated to purchase products from us and we cannot provide assurance that they will continue to carry our products. For example, our OEM customers have incorporated into their products the technologies of other companies or internally developed technologies in addition to, or instead of, our technologies and will likely continue to do so in the future. If our OEM customers do not effectively and successfully market products containing our technologies, our revenue will likely be materially and adversely affected. Our OEM customers work closely with us to develop products that are specific to each OEM customers copiers and printers. Many of the products and technologies we are developing require that we coordinate development, quality testing, marketing and other tasks with our OEM customers. We cannot control our OEM customers development efforts or the timing of these efforts and coordinating with our OEM customers may cause delays in our own product development efforts that are outside of our control. If our OEM customers delay the release of their products, our revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, our revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot meet our OEM customers product needs for their specific copiers and printers, as well as successfully manage the additional engineering and support effort and other risks associated with such a wide range of products. Ongoing economic uncertainty has had and may continue to have a negative effect on our business. The revenue and profitability of our business depends significantly on the overall demand for information technology products that enable printing of digital data, which in turn depends on a variety of macro- and micro-economic conditions. In addition, our revenue growth and profitability in our Inkjet business depends on demand and spending for advertising and marketing products and programs, which also depends on a variety of macro- and micro-economic conditions. Uncertainty about current global economic conditions poses a risk as our customers may delay purchases of our products in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values. The current financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets and the possibility that financial 14 Table of Contents institutions may consolidate or go out of business have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, and extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets. There could be a number of follow-on effects from the credit crisis on our business, including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays; inability of customers and distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and/or customer and distributor insolvencies; and other financial institutions negatively impacting the Companys treasury operations. Our financial performance could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments or cash equivalents; impairment charges on our assets; related to equity and other investments and; interest rates. The current volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them. Uncertainty about current global economic conditions together with delays or reductions in information technology spending could cause a decline in demand for our products and services and consequently harm our business, operating results, financial condition, prospects and continue to increase the volatility of our stock price. Our operating results may fluctuate based upon many factors, which could adversely affect our stock price. Stock prices of high technology companies such as ours tend to be volatile as a result of various factors, including variations in operating results and, consequently, fluctuations in our operating results could adversely affect our stock price. Factors that have caused our operating results and stock price to fluctuate in the past and that may cause future fluctuations include:  varying demand for our products, due to seasonality, OEM customer product development and marketing efforts, OEM customer financial and operational condition, OEM inventory management practices and general economic conditions;  shifts in customer demand to lower cost products;  success and timing of new product introductions by us and our OEM customers and the performance of our products generally;  success and timing of new inkjet product introductions;  volatility in foreign exchange rates, changes in interest rates and or financing credit to consumers of digital copiers and printers;  price reductions by us and our competitors, which may be exacerbated by competitive pressures caused by economic conditions generally;  substitution of third-party inks for our own ink products by users of our super-wide format inkjet printers;  delay, cancellation or rescheduling of orders or projects;  delays or shortages of supply of our key components, including without limitation inkjet print heads, and inability of our suppliers to meet our requirements;  availability of key components and licenses, including possible delays in deliveries from suppliers, the performance of third-party manufacturers and the status of our relationships with our key suppliers;  potential excess or shortage of employees and location of research and development centers;  changes in our product mix such as shifts from higher revenue or gross margin products to lower revenue or gross margin products such as our inkjet products;  costs associated with complying with any applicable governmental regulations;  cost associated with possible SEC and regulatory actions regarding our historical stock option granting practices and remedial measures with respect to our historical stock option granting practices;  acquisitions and integration of new businesses; 15 Table of Contents  costs related to our entry into new markets, such as commercial printing and office equipment service automation;  general economic conditions, such as the current economic uncertainty;  commencement of litigation or adverse results in pending litigation; and  other risks described herein. We face competition from other suppliers as well as our own OEM customers and if we are not able to compete successfully our business may be harmed. The digital printing marketplace is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid technological changes. We compete against a number of other suppliers of imaging products and technologies, including our OEM customers themselves. Although we attempt to develop and support innovative products that end-users demand, products or technologies developed by competing suppliers, including our own OEM customers, could render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. While many of our OEM customers incorporate our technologies into their end products on an exclusive basis, we do not have any formal agreements that prevent these OEM customers from offering alternative products that do not incorporate our technologies. If, as has occurred in the past, an OEM customer offers products incorporating technology from alternative suppliers instead of, or in addition to, products incorporating our technologies, our market share could decrease, which would likely reduce our revenue and adversely affect our financial results. In addition, many OEMs in the printer and copier industry, including most of our OEM customers, internally develop and sell products that compete directly with our current products. These OEMs have significant investments in their existing solutions and have substantial resources that may enable them to develop or improve, more quickly than us, technologies similar to ours that are compatible with their own products. Our OEM customers have in the past marketed, and likely will continue in the future to market, their own internal technologies and solutions in addition to ours, even when their technologies and solutions are less advanced, have lower performance or cost more than our products. Given the significant financial, marketing and other resources of our larger OEM customers and other significant OEMs in the imaging industry who are not our customers, we may not be able to successfully compete against these OEMs selling similar products that they develop internally. If we cannot compete successfully against the OEMs internally developed products, we will lose sales and market share in those areas where the OEMs choose to compete and our business will be harmed. Price reductions for all of our products may affect our revenues in the future. We have made and may in the future make price reductions for our products in order to drive demand and remain competitive. Depending upon the price-elasticity of demand for our products, the pricing and quality of competitive products and other economic and competitive conditions, such price reductions may have an adverse impact on our revenues and profits. If we are not able to compensate for lower gross margins that may result from price reductions with an increased volume of sales, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Entry into new markets or distribution channels could result in higher operating expenses that may not be offset by increased revenue. We continue to explore opportunities to develop or acquire product lines different from our current controllers, such as print management software, document scanning solutions and inkjet printers. We expect to continue to invest funds to develop new distribution and marketing channels for these and additional new products and services, which will increase our operating expenses. We do not know if we will be successful in developing these channels or whether the market will accept any of our new products or services or if we will generate sufficient revenues from these activities to offset the 16 Table of Contents additional operating expenses we incur. In addition, even if we are able to introduce new products or services, if customers do not accept these new products or services or if we are not able to price such products or services competitively, our operating results will likely suffer. We license software used in most of our products from Adobe Systems Incorporated and the loss of this license would prevent us from shipping these products. Many of our current products include software that we must license from Adobe. Specifically, we are required to obtain separate licenses from Adobe for the right to use Adobe PostScript® software in each type of copier or printer used with a Fiery Controller. Although to date we have successfully obtained licenses to use Adobes PostScript® software when required, Adobe is not required to, and we cannot be certain that Adobe will, grant future licenses to Adobe PostScript® software on reasonable terms, in a timely manner, or at all. In addition, in order to obtain licenses from Adobe, Adobe requires that we obtain from them quality assurance approvals for our products that use Adobe software. Although to date we have successfully obtained such quality assurances from Adobe, we cannot be certain Adobe will grant us such approvals in the future. If Adobe does not grant us such licenses or approvals, if the Adobe licenses are terminated, or if our relationship with Adobe is otherwise materially impaired, we would likely be unable to sell products that incorporate Adobe PostScript® software and our financial condition and results of operations would be significantly harmed. We depend upon a limited group of suppliers for key components in our products. The loss of any of these suppliers, the inability of any of these suppliers to meet our requirements, or the delays or shortages of supply of these components could adversely affect our business. Certain components necessary for the manufacture of our products are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. These include processors from Intel and other related semiconductor components and inkjet print heads for our super-wide format printers. We do not maintain long-term agreements with any of our component suppliers and conduct our business with such suppliers solely on a purchase order basis. If we are unable to continue to procure these sole-sourced components from our current suppliers in the required quantities, we will have to qualify other sources, if possible, or design our products so that they no longer require these components. In addition, these suppliers may be concentrated within similar industries or geographic locations, which could potentially exacerbate these risks. We cannot provide assurance that other sources of these components exist or will be willing to supply us on reasonable terms or at all, or that we will be able to design around these components. Therefore any unavailability, delays or shortages of supply of these components or any inability of our suppliers to meet our requirements could harm our business. Because the purchase of certain key components involves long lead times, in the event of unanticipated volatility in demand for our products, we have been in the past and may in the future be unable to manufacture certain products in a quantity sufficient to meet demand. Further, as has occurred in the past, in the event that anticipated demand does not materialize, we may hold excess quantities of inventory that could become obsolete. In order to meet projected demand, we maintain an inventory of components for which we are dependent upon sole or limited source suppliers and components with prices that fluctuate significantly. As a result, we are subject to a risk of inventory obsolescence, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, the market prices and availability of certain components, particularly memory and Intel-designed components, which collectively represent a substantial portion of the total manufactured cost of our products, have fluctuated significantly in the past. Such fluctuations in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition including a reduction in gross margins. We are dependent on a limited number of subcontractors, with whom we do not have long-term contracts, to manufacture and deliver products to our customers and the loss of any of these subcontractors could adversely affect our business. We subcontract with other companies to manufacture our products and we do not have long-term agreements with these subcontractors. We rely on the ability of our subcontractors to produce products to be sold to our customers 17 Table of Contents and while we closely monitor our subcontractors performance we cannot assure you that such subcontractors will continue to manufacture our products in a timely and effective manner. In the past a weakened economy led to the dissolution, bankruptcy or consolidation of some of the subcontractors who are able to manufacture our products, decreasing the available number of subcontractors. If the available number of subcontractors were to again decrease, it is possible that we would not be able to secure appropriate subcontractors to fulfill our demand in a timely manner or at all, particularly if demand for our products increases. The existence of fewer subcontractors may also reduce our negotiating leverage potentially resulting in higher product costs. Difficulties experienced by our subcontractors, including financial problems and the inability to make or ship our products or fix quality assurance problems, could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. If we decide to change subcontractors, we could experience delays in finding, qualifying and commencing business with new subcontractors which would result in both delay in delivery of our products and also potentially the cancellation of orders for our products. In 2008, a high concentration of our Fiery controllers is manufactured at a single subcontractor location, Celestica in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We are transferring to a new sub-contractor in 2009: Bell Microproducts. Should Celestica or Bell Microproducts experience any inability to, or refuse to, manufacture or deliver product from this location our business, financial condition and operations could be harmed. Since we do not maintain long-term agreements with our subcontractors, any of our subcontractors could enter into agreements with our competitors that might restrict or prohibit such subcontractors from manufacturing our products or could otherwise lead to an inability of such subcontractors from filling our orders in a timely manner. In such event, we may not be able to find suitable replacement subcontractors and our business, financial condition and operations would likely be harmed. We may face increased risk of inventory obsolescence related to our super-wide format inkjet printers and ink. We procure raw materials and build our super-wide printers and ink products based on our sales forecasts. If we do not accurately forecast demand for our products we may end up with excess inventory, or we may lose sales because we do not have the correct products available for sale. If we have excess printers or other products we may have to lower prices to stimulate demand. We may also run the risk that our inventory of raw materials may become obsolete. Our ink products have a defined shelf life. If we do not sell the ink before the end of its shelf life it will no longer be sellable and will have to be expensed. If we are not able to hire and retain skilled employees, we may not be able to develop products or meet demand for our products in a timely fashion. We depend upon skilled employees, such as software and hardware engineers, quality assurance engineers and other technical professionals with specialized skills. We are headquartered in the Silicon Valley and additionally have research and development offices in India. Competition in both locations has historically been intense amongst companies hiring engineering and technical professionals. In times of professional labor imbalances, it has in the past and is likely in the future to be difficult for us to locate and hire qualified engineers and technical professionals and for us to retain these people. There are many technology companies located near our corporate offices in the Silicon Valley and our operations in India that may try to hire our employees. The movement of our stock price may also impact our ability to hire and retain employees. If we do not offer competitive compensation, we may not be able to recruit or retain employees, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to develop products in a timely fashion, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. We offer a broad-based equity compensation plan based on granting options and restricted stock from stockholder-approved plans in order to be competitive in the labor market. If we cannot offer equity awards when necessary to enable us to offer compensation competitive with those offered by other companies seeking the same employees, it may be difficult for us to hire and retain skilled employees. 18 Table of Contents Our acquisitions in the Inkjet and APPS product categories increased the chance that we will experience additional bad debt expense. Our OEM customers are typically large profitable customers who present little credit risk to us. Our APPS and Inkjet businesses sell primarily via a direct sales force to a broader base of customers, many of whom are smaller and potentially less credit worthy. In addition, as we continue to increase our revenues from our Inkjet customers, many of whom are located overseas in many countries, it may be hard to enforce our legal rights should collection issues arise. Because of our acquisitions we now sell our products to distributors and directly to the end-user. If we are unable to effectively manage a direct sales force, sales and revenues could decline. We have traditionally sold our products to our OEM partners, who in turn sold the product to the end-user. Our marketing focused on manufacturers and distributors of the manufacturers equipment, not on the end-user of the product. We now sell our professional printing applications and our inkjet printers and ink to distributors and directly to the end-user. If we are unable to effectively manage a direct sales force and develop a marketing program that can reach the end-users, we are likely to see a decline in revenues from those products. Acquisitions may result in unanticipated accounting charges or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations, personnel, technologies, products and information systems of acquired companies or businesses. We seek to develop new technologies and products from both internal and external sources. As part of this effort, we have in the past made, and will likely continue to make, acquisitions of other companies or other companies assets. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, such as:  if we issue equity securities in connection with an acquisition, the issuance may be dilutive to our existing stockholders; alternatively, acquisitions made entirely or partially for cash (such as our acquisition of VUTEk) will reduce our cash reserves;  difficulties in integration of operations, employees, technologies, or products and the related diversion of management time and effort to accomplish successful integration;  risks of entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience, or entering markets where competitors have stronger market positions;  possible write-downs of impaired assets;  potential loss of key employees of the acquired company;  possible expense overruns;  an adverse reaction by customers, suppliers or partners of the acquired company or EFI;  the risk of changes in ratings by stock analysts;  potential litigation surrounding transactions or the prior actions of the acquired company, such as the VUTEk patent lawsuit or any administrative proceedings;  the inability to protect or secure technology rights; and  increases in operating costs; Mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky and we cannot provide assurance that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not harm our business, operating results, financial condition, or stock price. 19 Table of Contents We may ultimately not receive amounts held in escrow related to disposition of assets. On January 29, 2009, we sold a portion of our Foster City campus to Gilead Sciences, Inc. for a total price of $137.5 million, subject to an escrow holdback of $15.5 million. While the escrow holdback is expected to be released by January 2010, no assurance can be given that we will ultimately receive amounts held in escrow. We face risks relating to the impairment of our goodwill and long-lived assets. We complete a review of the carrying value of our assets annually and, based on a combination of factors, we may be required to perform an interim analysis. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Companys market capitalization declined significantly as a result of declining worldwide economic conditions caused by the tightening of global credit markets. Based on a combination of factors including the recent economic environment, the resulting erosion in our market capitalization, and the degradation of our revenue forecast subsequent to the third quarter of 2008, we performed an interim impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of 2008. Based on the outcome of the interim impairment analysis, we concluded that an impairment had occurred relating to the Inkjet product category resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $111.9 million during the quarter related to both goodwill and other long-lived assets. Given the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the duration of the ongoing economic downturn, or the period or strength of recovery, made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2008 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or gross margin rates are not achieved, we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods relating to any of our reporting units, whether in connection with the next annual impairment testing in the third quarter of 2009 or prior to that, if any such change constitutes a triggering event outside of the quarter from when the annual goodwill impairment test is performed. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such charge would be material. While impairment does not impact reported cash flows, it does result in a non-cash charge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and thus no assurance can be given that any future impairments would not affect our financial performance and valuation of assets and, as a result, harm our business, operating results, financial condition, or stock price. We face risks from currency fluctuations. Approximately $262.5 million and $293.4 million of our revenue from the sale of products for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, came from sales outside the Americas, primarily to Europe and Japan. We expect that sales outside the Americas will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue. The majority of our revenues are invoiced in U.S. dollars. Given the significance of our non-U.S. sales to our total product revenue, we face a continuing risk from the fluctuation of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies. When we invoice our customers in their respective local currencies, our cash flows and earnings are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates between the currency of the invoice and the U.S. dollar. In addition, we have a substantial number of international employees which creates material operating costs denominated in foreign currencies. We have attempted to limit or hedge these exposures through operational strategies where we have considered it appropriate in the past, although no hedging activities occurred in 2008. Our efforts to reduce the risk from our international operations and from fluctuations in foreign currencies or interest rates may not be successful, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. We face risks from our international operations. We are subject to certain risks because of our international operations. Changes to and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations that may increase our cost of doing business and our inability or failure to obtain 20 Table of Contents required approvals could harm our international and domestic sales. Trade legislation in either the United States or other countries, such as a change in the current tariff structures, export compliance laws or other trade policies, could adversely affect our ability to sell or to manufacture in international markets. Some of our sales to international customers are made under export licenses that must be obtained from the United States Department of Commerce (DOC) and certain transactions require prior approval of the DOC. Changes in governmental regulation and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals, permits or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenues, business and operations. Any violations could result in fines and penalties, including prohibiting us from exporting our products to one or more countries, and could materially and adversely affect our business. Moreover, local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the United States. We incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations, which may be substantially different from those in the United States. In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by United States regulations applicable to us such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such United States laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Other risks include natural disasters and political or economic conditions in a specific country or region. In addition, many countries in which we derive revenues do not currently have comprehensive and highly developed legal systems, particularly with respect to the protection of intellectual property rights, which, among other things, can result in the prevalence of infringing products and counterfeit goods in certain countries, which could harm our business and reputation. We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary information and may incur expenses to defend our proprietary information. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret protection, nondisclosure agreements and licensing and cross-licensing arrangements to establish, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights, all of which afford only limited protection. We have patents and pending patent applications in the United States and in various foreign countries. There can be no assurance that patents will issue from our pending applications or from any future applications, or that, if issued, any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any failure to adequately protect our proprietary information could harm our financial condition and operating results. We cannot be certain that any patents that have been or may in the future be issued to us, or which we license from third parties, or any other of our proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, we cannot be certain that any rights granted to us under any patents, licenses or other proprietary rights will provide adequate protection of our proprietary information. In addition, as different areas of our business change or mature, from time to time we evaluate our patent portfolio and make decisions either to pursue or not to pursue specific patents and patent applications related to such areas. Choosing not to pursue certain of our patents, patentable applications and failing to file applications for potentially patentable inventions, may harm our business by, among other things, enabling our competitors to more effectively compete with us, reducing the potential claims we can bring against third parties for patent infringement and limiting our potential defenses to intellectual property claims brought by third parties. Litigation has been and may continue to be necessary to defend and enforce our proprietary rights. Such litigation, whether or not concluded successfully for us, could involve significant expense and the diversion of our attention and other resources, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. 21 Table of Contents We face risks from third party claims of infringement and potential litigation. Third parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future that our products infringe, or may infringe, their proprietary rights. Such claims have in the past resulted in lengthy and expensive litigation and could do so in the future. Such claims and any related litigation, whether or not we are successful in the litigation, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. Although we may seek licenses from third parties covering intellectual property that we are allegedly infringing, we cannot assure you that any such licenses could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all. We may be subject to environmental related liabilities due to our use of hazardous materials and solvents. We conduct our business operations that involve the use of certain hazardous materials at two separate locations. At these facilities, we mix ink used in some of our printers with solvents and other hazardous materials. Those materials are subject to various governmental regulations relating to their transfer, handling, packaging, use and disposal. We store the ink at warehouses worldwide, including Europe and the United States, and shipping companies ship it at our direction. We face potential responsibility for problems such as spills that may arise when we ship the ink to customers. While we customarily obtain insurance coverage typical for this kind of risk, such insurance may not be sufficient in amount. If we fail to comply with these laws or an accident involving our ink waste or solvents occurs, or if our insurance coverage is not sufficient, then our business and financial results could be harmed. Future sales of our hardware products in European Union (EU) member countries could be limited due to the enactment of the EU Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (ROHS). Since July 1, 2006 forward, new electrical and electronic equipment sold in the EU must not contain lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) or polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). These must be replaced by other non- or less than-toxic substances. Manufacturers must comply with significant, and potentially costly, compliance requirements in order to meet the ROHS deadline. Some of our products may not have been converted before the deadline. As a result, we may not be allowed to sell those products in the EU until the products are made fully compliant, which could harm our business and financial results. We could also incur additional costs and liabilities in connection with non-compliant product recalls, regulatory fines and exclusion of non-compliant products from certain markets. Our products may contain defects which are not discovered until after shipping. Our products consist of hardware and software developed by ourselves and others. Our products may contain undetected errors and we have in the past discovered software and hardware errors in certain of our products after their introduction, resulting in warranty expense and other expenses incurred in connection with rectifying such errors. Errors could be found in new versions of our products after commencement of commercial shipment and any such errors could result in a loss or delay in market acceptance of such products and thus harm our reputation and revenues. In addition, errors in our products (including errors in licensed third party software) detected prior to new product releases could result in delays in the introduction of new products and our incurring additional expense, which could harm our operating results. We generally provide a twelve month warranty for certain products, which may cover both parts and labor. In the future, we may incur substantial warranty claim expenses on our products which may exceed our estimated warranty reserves, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could adversely affect our revenues. Maintaining the security of our software and hardware products is an issue of critical importance to our customers and for us. There are individuals and groups who develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products. Although we take preventative measures to protect our products, and we have a response team that is notified of high-risk malicious events, these procedures may 22 Table of Contents not be sufficient to mitigate damage to our products. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could lead some customers to seek to return products, to reduce or delay future purchases or to purchase competitive products. Customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their computer systems from attack, which could delay or reduce purchases of our products. Any of these actions or responses by customers could adversely affect our revenues. System failures or system unavailability could harm our business. We rely on our network infrastructure, internal technology systems and our internal and external websites for our development, marketing, operational, support and sales activities. Our hardware and software systems related to such activities are subject to damage from malicious code released into the public Internet through recently discovered vulnerabilities in popular software programs. These systems are also subject to acts of vandalism and to potential disruption by actions or inactions of third parties. Any event that causes failures or interruption in our hardware or software systems could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. The location and concentration of our facilities subjects us to the risk of earthquakes, floods or other natural disasters and public health risks. Our corporate headquarters, including most of our research and development facilities, are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, an area known for seismic activity. This area has also experienced flooding in the past. In addition, many of the components necessary to supply our products are purchased from suppliers based in areas including the San Francisco Bay Area, Taiwan and Japan and are therefore subject to risk from natural disasters. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, flood or typhoon, could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Our employees, suppliers and customers are located worldwide. We face the risk that our employees, suppliers, or customers, either through travel or contact with other individuals, could become exposed to contagious diseases endemic to particular regions of the world. In addition, governments in those regions have from time-to-time imposed quarantines and taken other actions in response to contagious diseases that could affect our operations. If a significant number of employees, suppliers, or customers were unable to fulfill their obligations, due to contagious diseases, actions taken in response to contagious diseases, or other reasons, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed. We are subject to numerous federal and state employment laws and may face claims in the future under such laws. We are subject to numerous federal and state employment laws, and from time to time we face claims by our employees and former employees under such laws. Although there are no pending or threatened claims under wage and hour laws against us, we cannot assure you that claims under such laws or other employment-related laws will not be attempted in the future against us, nor can we predict the likely impact of any such claims on us, or that, if asserted, we would be able to successfully resolve any such claims without incurring significant expenses. We may be subject to the risk of loss due to fire because the materials we use in the manufacturing process of our inks are flammable. We use flammable materials in the manufacturing processes of our inks and may therefore be subject to the risk of loss arising from fires. The risk of fire associated with these materials cannot be completely eliminated. We own certain facilities that manufacture our inks, which increases our exposure to such risk in case these facilities are destroyed. We maintain insurance policies to reduce losses caused by fire, including business interruption insurance. If one or more of these facilities is damaged or otherwise ceases operations as a result of a fire, it would reduce manufacturing capacity and, consequently, may reduce revenues and adversely affect our business. 23 Table of Contents The value of our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate volatility. We have an investment portfolio of mainly fixed income securities classified as available-for-sale securities. As a result, our investment portfolio is subject to volatility if market interest rates fluctuate and counterparty risk. We attempt to limit this exposure to interest rate risk by investing in securities with maturities of less than three years; however, we may be unable to successfully limit our risk to interest rate fluctuations and this may cause volatility in our investment portfolio value. Our stock price has been volatile historically and may continue to be volatile. The market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2008, the price of our common stock as reported on The NASDAQ Global Select Market ranged from a low of $7.56 to a high of $22.44. We expect our stock price to be subject to fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors, including factors beyond our control. These factors include:  actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly or annual operating results;  ability to complete share repurchase programs;  our failure to meet analyst expectations;  announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors;  announcements relating to strategic relationships, acquisitions or investments;  announcements by our customers regarding their businesses or the products in which our products are included;  changes in financial estimates or other statements by securities analysts;  changes in general economic conditions;  terrorist attacks and the effects of military engagements or natural disasters;  changes in the rating of our securities;  changes in the economic performance and/or market valuations of other software and high-technology companies; and  commencement of litigation or adverse results in pending litigation. Because of this volatility, we may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or of securities analysts from time-to-time and the trading prices of our securities could decline as a result. In addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the trading prices of equity securities of many high-technology companies, including the economic uncertainty over the past several months. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Any negative change in the publics perception of high-technology companies could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results. On February 5, 2009, our Board of Directors approved a $100 million share repurchase program, including a $30 million accelerated share repurchase (ASR) by utilizing a portion of the proceeds from the recent sale of land and building to Gilead. On February 18, 2009, we entered into an agreement with UBS AG, London branch (UBS) to repurchase $30 million of our common stock under the ASR program. We expect to complete the repurchases under the ASR program in the second or third quarter of 2009, with the final completion date subject to the discretion of UBS. Our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and add volatility. Any repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program, including our accelerated share repurchase program, could affect our stock price and add volatility. There can be no assurance that the repurchases will be made at the best possible price. Potential risks and uncertainties also include, but are not necessarily limited to, our ability to 24 Table of Contents complete the share repurchases within the originally expected timing, the amount and timing of future share repurchases and the original funds used for such repurchases. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, we are permitted to and could discontinue our stock repurchase program at any time and any such discontinuation could cause the market price of our stock to decline. Under regulations required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our internal controls over financial reporting may become ineffective, and this could have a negative impact on our stock price. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we establish and maintain an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting and assess on an ongoing basis the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. Although no known material weaknesses are believed to exist at this time, it is possible that material weaknesses could be identified. If we are unable to remediate the weaknesses, our management would be required to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective. In addition to their inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements, errors, omissions, or fraud. The matters relating to the shareholder derivative litigation concerning our historical stock option granting practices could require us to continue incurring additional expenses for accounting, legal and other professional services, diverted our managements attention from our business and had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. The matters relating to our historical stock option practices and shareholder derivative litigation required us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting, legal and other expenses. During the fiscal year of 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) notified us that it had terminated the informal inquiry into the Companys historical stock option practices and that no enforcement action had been recommended and the Delaware Chancery Court approved the proposed settlement of related shareholder derivative litigation. The settlement provided for the adoption of certain remedial measures, including the cancellation and repricing of certain stock options, certain payments to be made to the Company and the adoption of a number of changes to our corporate governance and procedures. Although we have substantially implemented the proposed remedial measures and the SEC investigation and related shareholder derivative litigation are now closed, there can be no guarantee that we will not incur additional expenses in the future, related to our historical stock option granting practices, the settlement and the remedial measures. A reduction in our net income as reported on our financial statements could increase the likelihood of identifying a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. The threshold for determining whether or not we have a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting and procedures as defined by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is, in part, based on our generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, net income. Lowered GAAP net income, with an associated lowered materiality threshold, may increase our risk that internal control weaknesses may result in a material misstatement in the financial statements. For example, continued acquisitions, and the associated amortization of intangibles, will increase our amortization expenses and in the future may lower our GAAP earnings which would result in a lower materiality threshold for internal control testing. Our synthetic lease arrangements may adversely affect our cash flow. As of December 31, 2008, we were a party to two synthetic leases (the 301 Lease and the 303 Lease, together Leases) covering our Foster City facilities located at 301 and 303 Velocity Way, Foster City, California. These leases provided a cost effective means of providing adequate office space for our corporate 25 Table of Contents offices. Both Leases were scheduled to expire in July 2014. The leases included an option to purchase the facilities during or at the end of the term of the leases for the amount expended by the lessor to purchase the facilities. We have exercised our purchase option in January 2009 with respect to the 301 Lease. On January 29, 2009, we completed the sale of land and building to Gilead for a total price of $137.5 million, subject to an escrow holdback of $15.5 million. The escrow period expires January 2010. The property sold included approximately thirty acres of land and the office building located on the land at 301 Velocity Way, Foster City, California, consisting of approximately 163,000 square feet and certain other assets related to the property. We have guaranteed to the lessor a residual value associated with the buildings equal to 82% of their funding of the respective Leases. Under the financial covenants, we must maintain a minimum net worth and a minimum tangible net worth as of the end of each quarter. There is an additional covenant regarding mergers. We were in compliance with all such financial and merger related covenants as of December 31, 2008. We are liable to the lessor for the financed amount of the buildings if we default on our covenants. Since we exercised our purchase option with respect to the 301 Lease, our exposure under our remaining synthetic lease arrangements is $56.9 million as of January 29, 2009. Our remaining synthetic lease arrangement with respect to the 303 Lease could have significant negative consequences. For example, it could:  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, as we are required to maintain compliance with financial covenants regardless of external conditions;  limit our ability to obtain additional financing due to covenants and the existing leverage;  require the dedication of funds to comply with the financial covenants, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow and/or ability to obtain financing to fund our growth strategy, working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes; and  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry by restricting the funds available for use in addressing such changes; and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors.
