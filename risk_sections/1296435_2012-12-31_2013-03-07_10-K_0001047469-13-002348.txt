Item 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the risks described below relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate, while others relate principally to our indebtedness. The remaining risks relate principally to the securities markets generally and ownership of our common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity could be materially affected by any of these risks, and, as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Our business will suffer if we are unable to effectively respond to decreased demand for some of our products due to conditions in the global economy or secular decline of some markets. We have experienced and may experience in the future decreased demand for some of our products due to slowing or negative global economic growth, uncertainty in credit markets, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, increased unemployment and other challenges affecting the global economy. The North American uncoated free sheet market has been declining two to four percent annually due to the increasing use of electronic media for communication. For 2012, the Pulp and Paper Products Council (the "PPPC") reported a 4.7 percent year-over-year industry decline in the uncoated free sheet paper category. Premium fine papers represent approximately two and a half to three percent of the North American uncoated free sheet market. In addition, our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow shortages, and difficulty obtaining financing. If we are unable to implement business strategies to effectively respond to decreased demand for our products, our financial position, cash flows and results of operations would be adversely affected. Changes in international conditions generally, and particularly in Germany, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our operating results and business prospects could be adversely affected by risks related to the countries outside the United States in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products, including Germany, the Eurozone and elsewhere. Downturns in economic activity, adverse tax consequences, fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the U.S. dollar, or any change in social, political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could negatively affect our financial results. For example, the European sovereign debt crisis has negatively affected economic conditions in Europe and globally. We have significant operations and financial relationships based in Europe. Europe has historically accounted for over 40 percent of our net revenues. If the European sovereign debt crisis continues or deepens, economic conditions in Europe may further deteriorate. In that case, our business in Europe and elsewhere, as well as the businesses of our customers and suppliers, may be adversely affected. The availability of and prices for raw materials and energy will significantly impact our business. We purchase a substantial portion of the raw materials and energy necessary to produce our products on the open market, and, as a result, the price and other terms of those purchases are subject to change based on factors such as worldwide supply and demand and government regulation. We do not have significant influence over our raw material or energy prices and our ability to pass increases in those prices along to purchasers of our products may be challenged, unless those increases coincide with increased demand for the product. Therefore, raw material or energy prices could increase at the same time that prices for our products are steady or decreasing. In addition, we may not be able to recoup other cost increases we may experience, such as those resulting from inflation or from increases in wages or salaries or increases in health care, pension or other employee benefits costs, insurance costs or other costs. Our technical products business acquires all of its specialized pulp requirements from two global suppliers and certain critical specialty latex grades from four suppliers. In general, these supply arrangements are not covered by 9 Table of Contents formal contracts, but represent multi-year business relationships that have historically been sufficient to meet our needs. We expect these relationships to continue to operate in a satisfactory manner in the future. In the event of an interruption of production at any one supplier, we believe that each of these suppliers individually would be able to satisfy our short-term requirements for specialized pulp or specialty latex. In the event of a long-term disruption in our supply of specialized pulp or specialty latex, we believe we would be able to substitute other pulp grades or other latex grades that would allow us to meet required product performance characteristics and incur only a limited disruption in our production. Our fine paper business acquires a substantial majority of the cotton fiber used in the production of certain branded bond paper products pursuant to annual agreements with two North American producers. The balance of our cotton fiber requirements are acquired through "spot market" purchases from a variety of other producers. We believe that a partial or total disruption in the production of cotton fibers at our two primary suppliers would increase our reliance on "spot market" purchases with a likely corresponding increase in cost. Our operating results are likely to fluctuate. Our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Operating results could be adversely affected by general economic conditions causing a downturn in the market for paper products. Additional factors that could affect our results include, among others, changes in the market price of pulp, the effects of competitive pricing pressures, production capacity levels and manufacturing yields, availability and cost of products from our suppliers, the gain or loss of significant customers, our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis, changes in the mix of products produced and sold, seasonal customer demand, the relative strength of the Euro versus the U.S. dollar, increasing interest rates and environmental costs. The timing and effect of the foregoing factors are difficult to predict, and these or other factors could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. We face many competitors, several of which have greater financial and other resources. We face competition in each of our business segments from companies that produce the same type of products that we produce or that produce lower priced alternative products that customers may use instead of our products. Some of our competitors have greater financial, sales and marketing, or research and development resources than we do. Greater financial resources and product development capabilities may also allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new opportunities or changes in customer requirements. We cannot be certain that our tax planning strategies will be effective and that our net operating losses ("NOLs") will continue to be available to offset our tax liability. We are continuously undergoing examination by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") as well as taxing authorities in various state and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. The IRS and other taxing authorities routinely challenge certain deductions and credits reported on our income tax returns. In November 2010, we received a tax examination report from the German tax authorities challenging the validity of certain interest expense deductions claimed on our tax returns for the years 2006 and 2007. We are indemnified by FiberMark, Inc. for any tax liabilities arising from the operations of Neenah Germany prior to October 2006. In August 2011, we received tax assessments totaling €3.7 million from the German tax authorities and submitted an appeal challenging these assessments. We believe that the finding which invalidates the deductibility of certain interest expense deductions is improper and are vigorously contesting the finding. As of December 31, 2011, no amounts were reserved related to these issues. In November 2011 and January 2012, we paid a total of €1.9 million against the August 2011 tax assessments. We reflected these payments as assets ($2.5 million in "Income taxes receivable" on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2012) in recognition that such amounts would be treated as prepayments against any assessments ultimately owed. During 2012, we submitted additional information to the German tax authorities to support the validity of our interest expense deductions; however, as of December 31, 2012, they had not rendered a decision on our appeal. In the fourth quarter of 2012, legislation was proposed in the German legislature that would eliminate certain previously allowable interest expense deductions on a prospective and retroactive basis. The legislation was subsequently enacted in the first quarter of 2013. We believe the retroactive application of the legislation is unconstitutional and the likelihood of it being sustained is remote. As of December 31, 2012, we recorded a liability for uncertain income tax positions based on an assessment of the likelihood of alternative outcomes, including, the possibility of a potential compromise related to this issue for the 2006 and 2007 tax years and for 10 Table of Contents subsequent periods through 2012. We believe it is remote that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to these matters will significantly increase within the next 12 months. While we believe that retroactive application of this legislation is remote, should retroactive application of the legislation be sustained, the outcome could have a material effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately $65.9 million of U.S. Federal and $76.9 million of U.S. State tax NOLs which may be used to offset taxable income in the future. In order to utilize the NOLs, we must generate consolidated taxable income. If not used, substantially all of the NOLs will expire in various amounts between 2028 and 2030. The availability of NOLs to offset taxable income could also be substantially reduced if we were to undergo an "ownership change" within the meaning of Section 382(g)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code. We will be treated as having had an "ownership change" if there is more than a 50% increase in stock ownership during a three-year "testing period" by "5% stockholders." In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 740, Income Taxes ("ASC Topic 740"), as of December 31, 2012, we have recorded a liability of $4.8 million for uncertain tax positions where we believe it is "more likely than not" that the benefit reported on our income tax return will not be realized. There can be no assurance, however, that the actual amount of unrealized deductions will not exceed the amounts we have recognized for uncertain tax positions. We have significant obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits. We have significant obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits which could require future funding beyond that which we have funded in the past or which we currently anticipate. At December 31, 2012, our projected pension benefit obligations were $325.3 million and exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets by approximately $86.0 million. In 2012, we made total contributions to qualified pension trusts of $15.3 million. In addition, during 2012 we paid pension benefits for unfunded qualified and supplemental retirement plans of $8.9 million. At December 31, 2012, our projected other postretirement benefit obligations were $46.7 million. No assets have been set aside to satisfy our other postretirement benefit obligations. In 2012, we made payments for postretirement benefits other than pensions of $3.0 million. A material increase in funding requirements or benefit payments could have a material effect on our cash flows. The outcome of legal actions and claims may adversely affect us. We are involved in legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. The outcome of such legal actions and claims against us cannot be predicted with certainty. The legal actions and claims against us could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Labor interruptions would adversely affect our business. Substantially all of our hourly employees are unionized. In addition, some key customers and suppliers are also unionized. Strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages or slow downs involving our unionized employees could have a material effect on us. As of December 31, 2012, 645 hourly employees in the United States were covered by collective bargaining agreements that have expired or will expire within the next 12-months. Under German law union membership is voluntary and does not need to be disclosed to us. As a result, the number of employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement with the IG BCE that expires in May 2013 cannot be determined. For the current status of our U.S. collective bargaining agreements see "Part I Item 1  Business, Employee and Labor Relations." Future dividends on our common stock may be restricted or eliminated. For the year ended December 31, 2012, we paid cash dividends of $0.48 per common share or approximately $7.8 million. In November 2012, our Board of Directors approved a 25 percent increase in the annual dividend on our common stock to $0.60 per share. The dividend will be paid in four equal quarterly installments beginning in March 2013. Dividends are declared at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and future dividends will depend on our future earnings, cash flow, financial requirements and other factors. Our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock is limited under the terms of both our bank credit agreement and the indenture for our $90 million of ten-year senior notes due November 2014 (the "Senior Notes"). As of December 31, 2012, under the most restrictive terms of the indenture for the Senior Notes, our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock is limited to a total of $8 million in a 12-month period. However, we can pay dividends in excess of $8 million in a 12-month period by making restricted payments as defined in the indenture for the Senior Notes. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future. 11 Table of Contents If we have a catastrophic loss or unforeseen or recurring operational problems at any of our facilities, we could suffer significant lost production and/or cost increases. Our technical products and fine paper businesses may suffer catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism, mechanical failure, or other natural or man-made events. If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, delay or reduce shipments, reduce revenue, and result in significant expenses to repair or replace the facility. These expenses and losses may not be adequately covered by property or business interruption insurance. Even if covered by insurance, our inability to deliver our products to customers, even on a short-term basis, may cause us to lose market share on a more permanent basis. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results. Exchange rate fluctuations for the Euro do not have a material effect on the operations or cash flows of our German technical products business. Our German technical products business incurs most of its costs and sells most of its production in Europe and, therefore, its operations and cash flows are not materially affected by changes in the exchange rate of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Changes in the Euro exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar will, however, have an effect on our balance sheet and reported results of operations. See "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Foreign Currency Risk." In addition, because we transact business in other foreign countries, some of our revenues and expenses are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of our operations. As a result, changes in exchange rates between the currency in which the transaction is denominated and the local currency of our operations into which the transaction is being recorded can impact the amount of local currency recorded for such transaction. This can result in more or less local currency revenues or costs related to such transaction, and thus have an effect on our reported sales and income before income taxes. Our activities are subject to extensive government regulation, which could increase our costs, cause us to incur liabilities and adversely affect the manufacturing and marketing of our products. Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances in the United States and Germany relating to various environmental, health and safety matters. The nature of our operations requires that we invest capital and incur operating costs to comply with those laws, regulations and ordinances and exposes us to the risk of claims concerning non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws or standards. We cannot assure that significant additional expenditures will not be required to maintain compliance with, or satisfy potential claims arising from, such laws, regulations and ordinances. Future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations or contamination of sites owned, operated or used for waste disposal by us (including currently unknown contamination and contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or other waste generators) may give rise to additional costs that could require significantly higher capital expenditures and operating costs, which would reduce the funds otherwise available for operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities or other purposes. We are subject to risks associated with possible climate change legislation and various cost and manufacturing issues associated with such legislation. GHG emissions have increasingly become the subject of political and regulatory focus. Concern over potential climate change, including global warming, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting GHG emissions. All the states in which we operate are currently considering GHG legislation or regulations, either individually and/or as part of regional initiatives, that are independent of any federal proposals. While not all are likely to become law it is reasonably possible that additional climate change related mandates will be forthcoming, and it is expected that they may adversely impact our costs by increasing energy costs and raw material prices, requiring operational or equipments modifications to reduce emissions and creating costs to comply with regulations or to mitigate the financial consequences of compliance. Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness We may not be able to fund our future capital requirements internally or obtain third-party financing. We may be required or choose to obtain additional debt or equity financing to meet our future working capital requirements, as well as to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions. To the extent we must obtain financing from external sources to fund our capital requirements, we cannot guarantee financing will be available on 12 Table of Contents favorable terms, if at all. As of December 31, 2012, we have required debt payments of $94.6 million during the year ending December 31, 2014. Such required debt payments include $90 million on our Senior Notes. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt obligations, including the Senior Notes. Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to the Senior Notes, our other debt and our other liabilities will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations and other liabilities, we could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay scheduled expansions and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient to repay our debt in the future. In the event that we are required to dispose of material assets or operations or restructure our debt to meet our debt and other obligations, we can make no assurances as to the terms of any such transaction or how quickly any such transaction could be completed. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result: our debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable; our senior secured lenders could terminate their commitments and commence foreclosure proceedings against our assets; and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating performance declines in the future or we breach our covenants under the revolving credit facility, we may need to obtain waivers from the lenders under our revolving credit facility to avoid being in default. We may not be able to obtain these waivers. If this occurs, we would be in default under our revolving credit facility. We have significant indebtedness which subjects us to restrictive covenants relating to the operation of our business. As of December 31, 2012, we had $90 million of Senior Notes, $55.7 million in senior secured revolver borrowings, $30.0 million in Term Loan borrowings and $6.6 million of project financing outstanding. In addition, availability under our bank credit agreement was approximately $48.6 million. Our leverage could have important consequences. For example, it could: make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on the Senior Notes and our other indebtedness; place us at a disadvantage to our competitors; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for other purposes; increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or the industry in which we operate; limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes; and limit our ability to plan for and react to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate. The terms of our indebtedness, including our bank credit agreement and the indenture governing the Senior Notes, contain covenants restricting our ability to, among other things, incur certain additional debt, make specified restricted payments, pay dividends, authorize or issue capital stock, enter into transactions with our affiliates, consolidate or merge with or acquire another business, sell certain of our assets or liquidate, dissolve or wind-up our company. As of December 31, 2012, under the most restrictive terms of the indenture for the Senior Notes, our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock is limited to a total of $8 million in a 12-month period. However, we can pay dividends in excess of $8 million in a 12-month period by making restricted payments as defined in the indenture for the Senior Notes. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains covenants with which we must comply during the term of the agreement. Among other things, such covenants restrict our ability to incur certain additional debt, make specified restricted payments, authorize or issue capital stock, enter into transactions with affiliates, consolidate or merge with or acquire another business, sell certain of its assets, or dissolve or wind up. In addition, if we have 13 Table of Contents outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan or if borrowing availability under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is less than $20 million, we are required to achieve a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.1 to 1.0 for the preceding 12-month period, tested as of the end of such quarter. As of December 31 2012, we were in compliance with all terms of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Our Term Loan and revolving credit facilities accrue interest at variable rates. As of December 31, 2012, we had 55.7 million of senior secured revolver borrowings outstanding and $30.0 million in Term Loan borrowings outstanding. We may reduce our exposure to rising interest rates by entering into interest rate hedging arrangements, although those arrangements may result in us incurring higher interest expenses than we would incur without the arrangements. If interest rates increase in the absence of such arrangements, we will need to dedicate more of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our debt. For more information on our liquidity, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources." Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in our revolving credit facility or the indenture governing the Senior Notes could result in an event of default that could cause acceleration of our indebtedness. Our failure to comply with the covenants and other requirements contained in the indenture governing the Senior Notes, our revolving credit facility or our other debt instruments could cause an event of default under the relevant debt instrument. The occurrence of an event of default could trigger a default under our other debt instruments, prohibit us from accessing additional borrowings and permit the holders of the defaulted debt to declare amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be immediately due and payable. Our assets or cash flows may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments, and we may be unable to refinance or restructure the payments on indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. Despite our indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our substantial indebtedness. Because the terms of our bank credit agreement and the indenture governing the Senior Notes do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, some of which may be secured. If we or any of our subsidiaries incur additional indebtedness, the related risks that we and they now face may intensify. Our bank credit agreement is secured by a majority of our North American assets. Our bank credit agreement, as amended, is secured by a majority of our North American assets, including the capital stock of our subsidiaries. Neenah Germany is not a borrower or guarantor with respect to the bank credit agreement. Availability under our bank credit agreement will fluctuate over time depending on the value of our inventory, receivables and various capital assets. An extended work stoppage or decline in sales volumes would result in a decrease in the value of the assets securing the bank credit agreement. A reduction in availability under the bank credit agreement could have a material effect on our liquidity. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. A downgrade of our credit ratings below current levels (Moody's Investors Service  Ba3, Standard & Poor's  BB- as of December 31, 2012) may reduce our access to the capital markets, have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities and increase our cost of borrowing. We depend on our subsidiaries to generate cash flow to meet our debt service obligations, including payments on the Senior Notes. We conduct a substantial portion of our business through our subsidiaries. Consequently, our cash flow and ability to service our debt obligations, including the Senior Notes, depend upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to us, or upon loans, advances or other payments made by these entities to us. The ability of these entities to pay dividends or make other payments or advances to us will be subject to applicable laws and contractual restrictions contained in the instruments governing their debt, including our revolving credit 14 Table of Contents facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes. These limitations are also subject to important exceptions and qualifications. The ability of our subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to allow us to make scheduled payments on our debt, including the Senior Notes, will depend upon their future financial performance, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control. If our subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to help us satisfy our debt obligations, including payments on the Senior Notes, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures or seeking to raise additional capital. Refinancing may not be possible, and any assets may not be saleable, or, if sold, we may not realize sufficient amounts from those sales. Additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, or we may be prohibited from incurring it, if available, under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on our ability to satisfy our obligations on the Senior Notes. The amount of earnings that our operating subsidiaries are able to distribute to us as dividends, or otherwise, may not be adequate for us to service our debt obligations. 15 Table of Contents FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may constitute "forward-looking" statements as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the "PSLRA"), or in releases made by the SEC, all as may be amended from time to time.
