ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND DISCRETIONARY SPENDING PATTERNS, POTENTIAL OUTBREAKS OF "MAD COW DISEASE" OR "FOOT/MOUTH DISEASE" AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE AVAILABILITY OF BEEF COULD FORCE US TO MODIFY OUR RESTAURANTS' CONCEPT AND MENU AND COULD RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN OUR REVENUES. Even if we are able to successfully compete with other restaurant companies with similar concepts, we may be forced to make changes in one or more of our concepts in order to respond to changes in consumer tastes or dining patterns. Consumer preferences could be affected by health concerns about the consumption of beef, the primary item on our menus, or by specific events such as cases of "mad cow disease" or "foot/mouth disease". In addition, these events could reduce the available supply of beef or significantly raise the price of beef. If we change a restaurant concept, we may lose additional customers who do not prefer the new concept and menu, and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new customer base to produce the revenue needed to make the restaurant profitable. In addition, we may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of such a concept change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors. Our success also depends on numerous factors affecting discretionary consumer spending, including economic conditions, the cost of gasoline, disposable consumer income and consumer confidence. Adverse changes in these factors could reduce guest traffic or impose practical limits on pricing, either of which could reduce revenues and operating income. UNFORESEEN COST INCREASES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. Our profitability is highly sensitive to increases in food, labor and other operating costs. During fiscal 2005 and 2004, our beef prices were generally above historical levels. To the extent that beef prices continue to be significantly above historical levels, it will have a material negative effect on operating margins. In addition, our dependence on frequent deliveries of fresh food supplies means that shortages or interruptions in supply could materially and adversely affect our operations. Moreover, unfavorable trends or developments concerning the following factors could adversely affect our results: o Inflation, food, labor, energy and utilities and employee benefit costs; and o rent increases resulting from rent escalation provisions in our leases. We may be unable to anticipate or react to changing prices. If we are unable to modify our purchasing practices or quickly or readily pass on increased costs to customers, our business could be materially affected. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WITH OUR COMPETITORS, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO INCREASE REVENUES OR GENERATE PROFITS. OUR INABILITY TO INCREASE REVENUES IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WITH OUR COMPETITORS. KEY COMPETITIVE FACTORS INCLUDE: -10- o The quality and numbers of employees needed to adequately staff our restaurants; o the quality and value of the food products offered; o the quality of service; o the cost of our raw products; o the price of the food products offered; o the restaurant locations; and o the ambiance of facilities. We compete with other steakhouse restaurants specifically and with all other restaurants generally. We compete with national and regional chains, as well as individually owned restaurants. The restaurant industry has few non-economic barriers to entry, and as our competitors expand operations, competition from steakhouse restaurants with concepts similar to ours can be expected to intensify. Many of our competitors are well established in the upscale and mid-scale steak segments and certain competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than us. Such increased competition could adversely affect our revenues. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE. Our restaurant operations are subject to certain federal, state and local laws and government regulations, such as: o Obtaining of licenses for the sale of food and alcohol beverages; o national and local health sanitation laws and regulations; o national and local employment and safety laws and regulations; and o local zoning, building code and land-use regulations. While we have never experienced any significant difficulties in obtaining necessary governmental approvals, the failure to obtain or retain food and liquor licenses or any other governmental approvals could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We may be subjected to "dram-shop" liability, which generally provides a person injured by an intoxicated person with the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. Although we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance, if we lost a lawsuit related to this liability, our business could be materially harmed. THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY IS AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF TRENDS, AS WELL AS BY COMPETITION. The restaurant industry is affected by changes in consumer tastes and by national, regional, and local economic conditions and demographic trends. The performance of individual restaurants may be affected by factors such as traffic patterns, demographic considerations and the type, number and location of competing restaurants. In addition, factors such as inflation, increased food, labor and employee benefit costs and the availability of experienced management and hourly employees to successfully operate the restaurants may also adversely affect the restaurant industry in general and our restaurants in particular. -11- CONSUMER PERCEPTIONS OF FOOD SAFETY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS Our business could be adversely affected by consumer perceptions of food safety in the United States or in the market areas in which we operate, whether such perceptions are based on fact or not. In addition, adverse publicity resulting from poor food quality, illness, injury or other health concerns at one or a limited number of our restaurants could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF KEY PERSONNEL, THE LOSS OF WHOM COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US. Some of our senior executives are important to our success because they have been instrumental in setting the strategic direction of our Company, operating our business, identifying, recruiting and training key personnel, identifying areas for expansion and arranging necessary financing. These key personnel include Jamie B. Coulter, our Chief Executive Officer and certain of our other executive officers. Although we believe there is a significant pool of talented personnel in the restaurant industry, if these members of our senior management team become unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, it could adversely affect our business and development. SHAREHOLDERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RESELL THEIR STOCK OR MAY HAVE TO SELL AT A PRICE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN THE PRICE THEY PAID FOR IT. The trading price for our common stock has been volatile and could continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in our quarterly operating results, general conditions in the restaurant industry or the general economy, and other factors. In addition, the stock market is subject to price and volume fluctuations affecting the market price for public companies generally, or within broad industry groups, which fluctuations may be unrelated to the operating results or other circumstances of a particular company. Such fluctuations may adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock, as well as the price that holders may achieve for their shares upon any future sale. STAGGERED BOARD; BLANK-CHECK PREFERRED STOCK. Our current certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for three classes of directors to be elected on a staggered basis. This enables existing directors to exercise significant control over our affairs, and may act as an impediment to any future attempts by third parties to take control of our board of directors. In addition, our board of directors has the authority without further action by the stockholders to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof. The exercise of this authority may act as a further impediment to any future attempts by third parties to take control of our board of directors. A SINGLE VENDOR DISTRIBUTES MOST OF OUR CONSUMABLE PRODUCTS. Approximately 53% of the consumable products used in our restaurants are distributed through and delivered by a single vendor. While we believe we could replace this vendor, any disruption of services by this vendor or any change to a new vendor could adversely affect our restaurants. THE RISK OF FUTURE TERRORIST ATTACKS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR REVENUE. As a result of the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, a number of our restaurants, particularly our Del Frisco's and Sullivan's restaurants, were negatively affected. Additionally, recent terrorist warnings, both in the United States and internationally, suggest the possibility of future terrorist attacks, which together with the unpredictability of future military action and other responses to such -12- terrorist attacks has resulted in economic uncertainty. The occurrence of future terrorist attacks may adversely affect our business and make it more difficult to forecast our future results of operation. A KEY ELEMENT OF OUR STRATEGY IS OPENING NEW RESTAURANTS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OPEN A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THESE RESTAURANTS WHEN WE EXPECT THEM TO OPEN OR OUR SALES VOLUMES FOR THESE RESTAURANTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW OUR EXPECTATIONS, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL SUFFER. Part of our corporate strategy is to open new restaurants. Since the start of the 2006 fiscal year, we have opened two new Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon restaurants and have commitments to open an additional 20 new units throughout the year, or early 2007. We also believe that seven Texas Land & Cattle restaurants, five Sullivan Steakhouses and one Del Frisco Double Eagle Steakhouse will open during 2006 or early in 2007. This time frame is predicated by our experience that, assuming we can obtain certain governmental approvals and license, such as liquor licenses, it generally takes from 9 to 12 months after the signing of a lease or the closing of a purchase to complete construction and open a new restaurant. If a significant number of restaurants do not open when we expect them to open, it could negatively impact our future results of operations. In addition, although limited in number, our newest Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon restaurants are opening at projected annualized sales volumes in excess of $3.4 million. If this trend continues for such restaurants and the additional Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon restaurants we intend to open, it should provide substantial increases in all metrics when compared with those of our recently closed restaurants. If we fail to achieve our projected volume for our new Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon restaurants as well as the volumes for the new restaurants in other concepts our results of operations will be negatively impacted. WE RECENTLY DECIDED TO CLOSE 30 RESTAURANTS AND PART OF OUR STRATEGY IS TO CLOSE UNDER-PERFORMING UNITS. On March 11, 2006, our Board of Directors approved management's recommendation to close certain Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon restaurants. As a result, we will immediately close 30 under-performing stores. Part of our corporate strategy is to review other alternatives for enhancing stockholder value including closing and/or relocating under-performing units. Accordingly, if other units under-perform we will need to consider closing additional restaurants and our results of operations could be negatively impacted. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT WHETHER WE WILL RECEIVE ANY BENEFIT FROM OUR ADVERTISING AND MARKETING EFFORTS. While we have primarily relied on word of mouth to promote our restaurants and build customer awareness, we do utilize other marketing and advertising strategies. Recently we agreed to sponsor a NASCAR car for 2006 and 2007. While we believe that the advertising and marketing benefit from the NASCAR sponsorship and other advertising strategies will more than recover the cost, there can be no assurance that it will and we may need to continue and/or increase our traditional marketing programs and associated expenses.
