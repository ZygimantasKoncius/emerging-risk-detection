Item 1A. Risk Factors. You should carefully consider the risk factors described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional considerations not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially and adversely affected, the value of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. 10 Risks Related to the Plan of Dissolution There are risks associated with the proposed Plan of Dissolution, one of which is set forth below. Other risks related to the proposed Plan of Dissolution will be set forth in our definitive proxy statement that will be filed with the SEC. Please read our definitive proxy statement when it is available for a description of such risks. If our shareholders do not approve the Plan of Dissolution, our resources may diminish completely. If our shareholders do not approve the proposed Plan of Dissolution of if the Plan of Dissolution is otherwise not implemented pursuant to our boards ability to abandon the Plan of Dissolution if our board determines such action is in the best interests of our company and our shareholders, our board of directors will explore what, if any, strategic alternatives are available for the future of our company, which may include the continued exploration of our NOL Strategy. Other possible alternatives include seeking to raise capital from the sale of securities, which could result in substantial dilution to our existing shareholders and the granting of superior rights to the new shareholders, selling all of our stock or assets, changing our business focus, expanding the scope of our business through relationships with third parties, seeking voluntary dissolution at a later time and with potentially diminished assets or seeking bankruptcy protection. There can be no assurance that any of these alternatives would result in greater shareholder value than the proposed Plan of Dissolution. Moreover, any alternative we select may have unanticipated negative consequences, and we will face a number of risks, including: · We are likely to continue to incur net losses from the operation of our Home and Garden Business. Moreover, our Home and Garden Business may be negatively impacted by our announced intent to dissolve our company, which may cause our customers to transition to other products. Our net losses may increase in the future as we continue to operate our Home and Garden Business and could consume a material amount of our limited cash resources. We discuss the risks of the continued operation of our Home and Garden Business in further detail below under the heading "–Risks Related to Our Continuing Business Operations;" · If we were to continue to explore our NOL Strategy, we cannot assure you that we would ever realize the value of our deferred tax assets. For example, if shareholders do not approve the Plan of Dissolution, there can be no assurance that the holders of our common stock, including one or more of the holders of 5% or more of our common stock, will not sell their shares and thereby potentially impair our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards by causing an "ownership change" (as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code). In such case, pursuit of the NOL Strategy may not be among the alternatives available to us. The NOL Strategy is extremely speculative and subject to a number of risks that we describe in further detail below under the heading “— Risks Related to Our Business Plan to Utilize Net Operating Loss Carryforwards,” and the continued pursuit of the NOL Strategy may consume substantially all of our remaining cash resources; · Any financing we may require to continue our operations or to acquire another business as part of the NOL Strategy may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, particularly in light of the current economic crisis, which we believe will significantly impair our ability to attract capital through the sale of securities or otherwise obtain financing. Any financing we are able to obtain may substantially dilute the interests of our current shareholders; · We would continue to incur expenses associated with being a public reporting company, including ongoing SEC reporting obligations. These expenses would accelerate the depletion of our existing cash resources; and · Prior to the public announcement of our board's approval of the Plan of Dissolution, our common stock had generally been trading below $1.00 per share for the prior two months. If our shareholders do not approve the Plan of Dissolution, we believe it is likely that the price of our common stock will fall below The Nasdaq Capital Market’s $1.00 minimum bid price requirement and that our common stock will eventually be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market, which could significantly impair our ability to fund operations through the sale of our securities. Risks Related to Our Continuing Business Operations 11 If our shareholders do not approve the proposed Plan of Dissolution or if the Plan of Dissolution is not otherwise implemented, our board of directors will explore what, if any, strategic alternatives are available for the future, which may include the continued exploration of the NOL Strategy. Other possible alternatives include seeking to raise capital from the sale of securities, which could result in substantial dilution to our existing shareholders and the granting of superior rights to the new shareholders, selling all of our stock or assets, changing our business focus, expanding the scope of our business through relationships with third parties, seeking voluntary dissolution at a later time and with potentially diminished assets or seeking bankruptcy protection. At this time, our board of directors does not know which alternatives might be considered, or what impact any alternative might have on shareholder value. Any alternative we select may have unanticipated negative consequences. The risks below describe the risks related to our business if the Plan of Dissolution is not approved or implemented and we continue to pursue the NOL Strategy. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company, and our risks and uncertainties may change if the Plan of Dissolution is not approved or implemented and we alter our business strategy. Additional considerations not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially and adversely affected, the value of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. 12 Risks Related to Our Home and Garden Business Our ongoing business would be dependent on the success of our Home and Garden Business, which has a limited operating history, has generated only limited revenue to date and in which we do not expect to substantially increase our investment. On February 28, 2007, we completed the sale of all of the Harpin Protein Technology to Plant Health Care. Following the sale, we retained only our cash, accounts receivable, tax attributes and assets related to our Home and Garden Business, primarily our inventory of harpin protein-based products designated for the Home and Garden Market. In connection with the sale, Plant Health Care granted us the exclusive license and right to sell harpin protein-based products in the Home and Garden Market. In selling the Harpin Protein Technology, we sold all of our technology and our most significant source of revenue. The Harpin Protein Technology represented approximately 90% of our total net revenue in each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Since then, our operations have been dependent upon the success of our Home and Garden Business. Our Home and Garden Business has a limited operating history and has had only limited revenues to date. We generated revenue from our Home and Garden Business of approximately $0.2 million in 2008, $0.3 million in 2007, $0.4 million in 2006 and $0.4 million in 2005. We do not intend to significantly increase our investment toward the development of our Home and Garden Business, and we cannot provide any assurance that our Home and Garden Products will achieve greater market acceptance. If we are not successful in operating our Home and Garden Business, our results of operations and financial condition, as well as our ability to explore the NOL Strategy or any other business strategy will be adversely affected and ultimately may be unsuccessful. We may not be able to become profitable unless we identify and acquire other businesses on favorable terms. We believe that our ability to achieve profitability depends in substantial part on our ability to identify and acquire suitable acquisitions on favorable terms, so that we can increase our revenues and generate new income. If we are unable to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, our business will be very limited and may not generate sufficient revenue to cover our expenses. There is no assurance that we will be able to complete any future acquisitions or that such transactions, if completed, will contribute positively to our operations and financial results and condition. Despite our significant efforts since the sale of the Harpin Protein Technology in February 2007, we have been unable to identify an acceptable transaction that would enable us to utilize the value from our net operating loss carryforwards. If we issue stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for stock in connection with any acquisition, our shareholders may experience substantial dilution and new shareholders could have rights superior to current shareholders. In addition, as further noted below, the provisions of the Code and certain applicable Treasury regulations will limit the number of shares of stock we can sell from time to time without causing a limitation on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards. We would continue to incur significant operating losses and negative cash flow, and we may never be profitable. We have incurred significant operating and net losses and negative cash flow and have never achieved profitability. As of December 31, 2008, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $127.8 million. We expect to continue to experience operating losses in our Home and Garden Business for the foreseeable future. To achieve operating profitability in our Home and Garden Business, we will need to substantially grow the customer base for our Home and Garden Business; however, as noted above, we do not currently intend to significantly increase our investment toward the development of our Home and Garden Business. We may not be able to increase our revenue in this manner. The future prospects of our Home and Garden Business must be considered in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development. Some of these risks relate to our potential inability to: · obtain timely access to adequate and cost-effective supply of harpin proteins and harpin protein-based products; 13 · attract and retain customers, particularly in light of uncertain economic conditions and the seasonality of our product use; · establish awareness of our Home and Garden Business and Home and Garden Products; · expand current, and develop new, distribution channels to sell products in the Home and Garden Market; · obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals; · develop additional strategic partnerships to facilitate our marketing and sales efforts; and · respond to the rapidly changing market for plant protection and yield enhancement products. We may not successfully address some or all of these risks. If we do not successfully address these risks, we may not realize sufficient revenue or net income to reach or sustain profitability or continue operations. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, we will eventually not have the resources to explore the NOL Strategy or any other business strategy. Even if we were to achieve profitability, there are significant material uncertainties about our ability to effectively utilize or otherwise realize potential value from our net operating loss carryforwards. Some of these risks and uncertainties are described below under the heading “— Risks Related to Our Business Plan to Utilize Net Operating Loss Carryforwards.” We would be dependent on Plant Health Care for the manufacture and supply of harpin proteins and harpin protein-based products for our Home and Garden Business, and any failure of Plant Heath Care to provide timely delivery of high quality products could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Upon depletion or expiration of our existing home and garden inventory, we would expect to acquire all harpin proteins and harpin protein-based products for our Home and Garden Business from Plant Health Care pursuant to a license and supply agreement with Plant Health Care. Under this agreement, Plant Health Care has granted us an exclusive worldwide right and license to sell harpin protein-based products in the Home and Garden Market, as well as a royalty-free, worldwide exclusive non-transferable license to use the Messenger, MightyPlant and Harp-N-Tek trademarks in connection with our advertising, promotion, distribution and sale of such products. The agreement provides that Plant Health Care will supply us with harpin proteins and harpin protein-based products in quantities requested by us through purchase orders submitted pursuant to the supply and license agreement, at a price equal to 80% of Plant Health Care’s actual U.S. agricultural distributor price. In the event that Plant Health Care is unable or unwilling to provide us with requested products, we may declare a “failure of supply” (as defined in the license and supply agreement) and select and qualify a second source to provide us harpin proteins and harpin protein-based products, which may not be available. The license and supply agreement continues until expiration of the last U.S. or foreign patent relating to the products held or acquired by Plant Health Care in connection with the sale. Thereafter, the license and supply agreement automatically extends for consecutive five-year periods, unless we elect to terminate the license and supply agreement at our sole option. We have no assurance that Plant Health Care would be able to manufacture and provide sufficient quantities or quality of harpin proteins and harpin protein-based products on a timely basis, or at all, or otherwise perform its obligations under the license and supply agreement. If Plant Health Care were unwilling or unable to perform such obligations, our Home and Garden Business and results of operations could be materially adversely impaired. We may suffer delays in, or be prevented from, fulfilling customer orders and may incur substantial legal and other expenses in enforcing our rights under the license and supply agreement, including identifying and qualifying a second source of supply, if one is even available. In addition, Plant Health Care has agreed to maintain in certain jurisdictions, as specified within the license and supply agreement, all regulatory approvals with the Environmental Protection Agency, or the “EPA,” relating to our Home and Garden Products. Failure of Plant Health Care to secure and maintain applicable EPA approvals or otherwise comply with applicable regulations could adversely affect or interrupt our sole source of supply of Home and Garden Products. If our sole source of supply is interrupted, our Home and Garden Business and results of operations could be materially adversely impaired. Our Home and Garden Business is relatively new and has limited market awareness, and we may not be 14 successful in building greater market awareness and increasing sales. Our Home and Garden Products are not well known in the market. Our sales of Home and Garden Products to date have come primarily through independent distributors, retailers and our website and we believe have been driven by word-of-mouth recommendations from current customers. Our future success would depend in significant part on our ability to generate demand for harpin protein-based products in the Home and Garden Market, specifically among the general public, resellers or businesses that sell the products to the general public and businesses that incorporate harpin protein-based products into existing or new products to be sold to the general public. To this end, our direct and indirect sales operations must increase market awareness of our Home and Garden Business and our products to generate increased revenue. However, we have not invested significant resources in, and do not intend to significantly increase our investment toward the development of our Home and Garden Business. At March 2, 2009, we had only one part-time employee focused on sales and marketing of our Home and Garden Products. We have no current plans to increase our sales and marketing capabilities in the Home and Garden Market, and we expect to continue to generate a substantial portion of our sales through our website based on positive word-of-mouth. Our sales and marketing personnel may not successfully compete against the sales and marketing operations of our current and future competitors that have greater resources and more established relationships with distributors, retailers and growers. If we are not successful in building greater market awareness and generating increased sales, our future results of operations will be adversely affected. If we fail to generate sufficient sales from our Home and Garden Business to cover our operating expenses, our business operations and prospects, including our ability to explore whether there may be opportunities to realize potential value from our remaining business assets, primarily our net operating loss carryforwards, would be adversely affected, creating substantial doubt about our ability to stay in business. We may be unable to establish or maintain successful relationships with independent distributors and retailers, which could adversely affect our sales and our ability to generate revenue from our Home and Garden Business. Our ability to sell our Home and Garden Products will be significantly impaired if we fail to develop and maintain our distribution channels. We would need to increase sales to independent distributors and retailers in the Home and Garden Market to expand sales of our products. We have engaged several independent distributors and retailers for the distribution and sale of our Home and Garden Products. Our future revenue growth will depend in large part on our success in establishing and maintaining these sales and distribution channels. Moreover, we cannot assure you that the distributors and retailers on which we rely will focus adequate resources on selling these products or will be successful in selling them. Many of our potential distributors and retailers are in the business of distributing and sometimes manufacturing other, possibly competing, plant health products for the Home and Garden Market and may perceive our products as a threat to various product lines currently being manufactured or distributed by them. In addition, the distributors and retailers may earn higher margins by selling competing products or combinations of competing products. If we are unable to establish or maintain successful relationships with independent distributors and retailers, we would need to further develop our own distribution and sales and marketing capabilities, which would be expensive and time-consuming and the success of which would be uncertain. We currently have two key distributors of our Home and Garden Products. If any distributor or retailer that purchases a significant amount of our Home and Garden Products were to discontinue purchasing our products any time, our sales would be adversely affected. In addition, the failure of any of these distributors and retailers, or any other distributor or retailer to which we extend a significant amount of credit, to pay its account now or in the future may harm our operating results. The market for Home and Garden Products is competitive and we may not have the resources required to compete effectively. The high level of competition in these markets may result in price reductions, reduced margins or the inability of our products to achieve market acceptance. The market for home and garden plant protection and plant health products is intensely competitive, rapidly changing and undergoing consolidation. We may be unable to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, which may result in price reductions, reduced margins or the inability to 15 achieve market acceptance of our products. We expect competition within the plant protection and plant health industry to intensify as regulatory pressures on traditional chemical solutions increase. This may occur as advances in plant protection and disease resistance technologies become more widely known. The plant health industry is dominated by multinational chemical and pharmaceutical companies, including The Scotts Miracle-Grow Company, Syngenta AG, BASF AG, and Bayer AG. Many of the large chemical pesticide companies are also developing products that they believe are less environmentally harmful than traditional chemical pesticides and that may directly compete with our Home and Garden Products. Other small companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery, research, development and marketing of products similar to ours. Many of our current and potential future competitors have significantly more capital, research and development, regulatory, manufacturing, distribution, sales, marketing, human and other resources than we do. As a result, they may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products, receive greater resources and support from independent distributors, initiate or withstand substantial price competition or take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily. Furthermore, large chemical and pharmaceutical companies have a more diversified product offering than we do, which may give them an advantage in meeting customer needs by enabling them to offer integrated solutions to plant protection and plant health in the Home and Garden Market. Our Home and Garden Business depends on products that are based on the same new technology, and our commercialization of those products may not be successful. We are dependent on the successful commercialization in the Home and Garden Market of three products (Messenger, Messenger Seed Treatment and MightyPlant with Messenger Gold, the latter of which was introduced into the Home and Garden Market in the second quarter of 2007) that are based on the same new technology. Substantially all of our sales in the Home and Garden Market have come from our first harpin protein and from a single product, Messenger. These sales have been limited and quite small in comparison to the size of the overall Home and Garden Market. Our Home and Garden Products may not be commercially successful and may not prove effective or economically viable. In addition, because our Home and Garden Products have not been put to widespread use over significant periods of time, no assurance can be given that adverse consequences might not result from their use, such as soil or other environmental degradation, the development of negative effects on animals or plants or reduced benefits in terms of plant health or protection. A variety of factors would determine the success of our market development and commercialization efforts and the rate and extent of acceptance of our Home and Garden Products, including our ability to implement and maintain an appropriate pricing policy, general economic conditions in the Home and Garden Market, weather conditions and the extent to which the general public and regulatory authorities accept new plant and seed protection and plant health products developed through biotechnology. Our inability to obtain regulatory approvals, or to comply with ongoing and changing regulatory requirements, could delay or prevent sales of our Home and Garden Products. The sale and use of plant health products containing harpin proteins are extensively regulated by the EPA and/or state, local and foreign governmental authorities. These regulations substantially increase the cost and time associated with bringing our Home and Garden Products to market. All EPA (federal) registrations were transferred to Plant Health Care in connection with the sale of the Harpin Protein Technology while state registrations and permits are not transferable. We currently sell our Home and Garden Products pursuant to regulatory approvals under the EPA’s “me too” registration process and will subsequently register our Home and Garden Products in the States and other jurisdictions, as necessary. If we do not continue to receive the necessary governmental approvals to market these products, obtain required approvals in the future, or if the regulatory authorities revoke our approvals or grant them subject 16 to restrictions on their use, we may be unable to sell our Home and Garden Products and our business may fail. We are required to obtain regulatory approval from certain state and foreign regulatory authorities before we market our products in those jurisdictions. Some of these jurisdictions may apply different criteria than the EPA in connection with their approval processes. Although we are currently authorized to sell Messenger for virtually all home and garden uses in 49 states, and in California for disease management use on strawberries, grapes and fruiting vegetables, we may not be able to obtain future registrations for current or future products or maintain these registrations. Even if we obtain all necessary regulatory approvals to market and sell our products, these products will be subject to continuing review and extensive regulatory requirements. The EPA, as well as state and foreign governmental authorities, could withdraw a previously approved product from the market upon discovery of new information, including an inability or failure to comply with regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unanticipated problems with the product, or for other reasons. In addition, federal, state and foreign regulations relating to plant protection products developed through biotechnology are subject to public concerns and political circumstances and, as a result, regulations have changed and may change substantially in the future. These changes may result in limitations on the manufacturing, marketing or use of our current and any future Home and Garden Products. We may be exposed to product liability claims, which could adversely affect our operations. We may be held liable or incur expenses to settle product liability claims if the products we sell cause injury or are found unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing, sale or use. These risks exist even with respect to any products that have received, or may in the future receive, regulatory approval, registration or clearance for commercial use. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to avoid product liability exposure. We currently maintain product liability insurance at levels we believe are sufficient and consistent with industry standards for companies at our stage of development. Our product liability insurance may not be adequate, and, at any time, it is possible that such insurance coverage may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. A product liability claim could result in liability to us greater than our assets and insurance coverage. Moreover, even if we have adequate insurance coverage, product liability claims or recalls could result in negative publicity or force us to devote significant time and attention to matters other than those that arise in the normal course of business. Rapid changes in technology could render our products unmarketable or obsolete. We are engaged in an industry characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological development. Our competitors, which generally have substantially greater technological and financial resources than we do, may develop plant protection and plant health technologies and products that are more effective than ours or that render harpin protein-based technology and our Home and Garden Products obsolete or uncompetitive. To be successful, we will need to continually enhance our products and develop and market new products that keep pace with new technological and industry developments. If we are unable to retain our existing personnel, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives. We are highly dependent on the efforts and abilities of Nathaniel T. Brown, our chief executive officer, chief financial officer and secretary. Our failure to retain Mr. Brown would seriously disrupt our operations and our ability to explore the NOL Strategy or any other business strategy and increase our expenses by forcing us to use more expensive outside consultants and impair our ability to generate revenue. 17 Risks Related to Our Business Plan to Utilize Net Operating Loss Carryforwards Our ability to realize potential value from our net operating loss carryforwards is highly speculative and subject to numerous material uncertainties. From and after the sale of the Harpin Protein Technology until our board's approval of the Plan of Dissolution, our business strategy had been to use the proceeds from the sale of the Harpin Protein Technology to fund the working capital requirements of our Home and Garden Business while we explore our NOL Strategy. If the proposed Plan of Dissolution is not approved by our shareholders or is otherwise not implemented, we may seek to continue to pursue the NOL Strategy. However, the NOL Strategy is extremely speculative and subject to a large number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in this section and elsewhere in our public filings with the SEC. In order to confirm whether there are opportunities to realize potential value from our net operating loss carryforwards, we have engaged legal advisors to validate the underlying assumptions related to our net operating loss carryforwards and analyze and provide advice on the options that may be available to preserve and maximize the potential use of our deferred tax assets, as well as on potential limitations and risks of such utilization strategy. This will continue to be an expensive and time consuming process, and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue from our Home and Garden Business or otherwise attract sufficient capital to support the process for its duration. A continued business plan for the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may not be successfully implemented or may not result in any increase in shareholder value, and the continued pursuit of the NOL Strategy may consume substantially all of our remaining cash resources. We may not be able to realize value from, or otherwise preserve and utilize, our net operating loss carryforwards. As noted above, our business strategy had been to explore whether there may be opportunities to realize potential value from our net operating loss carryforwards. Our net operating loss carryforwards permit us to apply our net operating losses from prior fiscal years to taxable income in future years in order to reduce our tax liability. As we have incurred losses since our inception and do not currently expect to turn a profit in the near future, we are unable to realize value from our net operating loss carryforwards unless we find a way to become profitable, either through the acquisition of a profitable company or otherwise. The success of the NOL Strategy is predicated on maintaining the value of and utilizing all or substantially all of our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income of our company or any acquired company. This strategy would be adversely affected if we are unable to realize value from, or otherwise preserve and utilize, our net operating loss carryforwards, including for any of the following reasons: 18 · Past Ownership Changes. In the event that we were to undergo an “ownership change” (as defined in Section 382 of the Code), our net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to the ownership change would be subject to annual limitations, which could reduce, eliminate, or defer the utilization of these losses. Generally, an “ownership change” occurs if one or more shareholders, each of whom owns 5% or more in value of a corporation’s stock, increase their aggregate percentage ownership by more than 50% over the lowest percentage of stock owned by those shareholders at any time during the preceding three-year period. Based upon an analysis completed during the third quarter of 2007 of past ownership changes (as defined under Section 382 of the Code), we believe that we have experienced ownership changes on March 20, 1996 and October 2, 2000. Absent any other ownership changes in the future, we believe there are no significant limitations on our future ability to use net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to those dates. We do not believe that the sale of assets to Plant Health Care in February 2007 resulted in another ownership change that would further limit our future ability to use net operating loss carryforwards generated after October 2000 because it was a sale of assets. However, the Internal Revenue Service, or “IRS,” or some other taxing authority may disagree with our position and contend that we have already experienced other such ownership changes or that the sale of assets resulted in an ownership change. · Future Ownership Changes. Even if an ownership change has not occurred in the past, there is still the potential for an ownership change to occur under Section 382 of the Code as a result of future changes in stock ownership. For example, if shareholders do not approve the Plan of Dissolution, the holders of our common stock, including one or more of the holders of 5% or more of our common stock, could sell their shares in sufficient quantities to trigger an ownership change. In addition, if shareholders do not approve the Plan of Dissolution and we continue to explore whether there may be opportunities to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards, we will be limited in our ability to issue additional stock in the future to provide capital for our business due to the importance of avoiding a future ownership change. We would only be able to issue additional stock in a manner that would not cause an ownership change pursuant to Section 382 of the Code. Accordingly, our ability to access the equity markets or issue stock in connection with an acquisition could be restricted. · Change of Control. In order to preserve our net operating loss carryforwards, we must ensure that there has not been a “change of control” of our company. A “change in control” includes a more than 50 percentage point increase in the ownership of our company by certain equity holders who are defined in Section 382 of the Code as “5 percent shareholders”. The IRS has viewed an acquisition of an ownership percentage in a company that is represented by certain equity instruments, including certain preferred stock, debt instruments, or stock options, that are issued in connection with a change in the board of directors to include the holders of the equity instruments or their agents as indicative of a transfer of a beneficial ownership interest in a company under Section 382 of the Code. Accordingly, a change in our board of directors that is accompanied by other equity events could be viewed as contributing to a more than 50 percentage point change in control of our company under Section 382 of the Code. · De Facto Liquidation. In order to preserve our net operating loss carryforwards, there must not be a “de facto liquidation” of our company. The IRS has interpreted a “de facto liquidation” to include a sale or discontinuation of the current business of a company. Accordingly, the IRS may view the Plan of Dissolution as a strong factor in a potential determination that a “de facto liquidation” of our Home and Garden Business has occurred. For other risks related to our NOL Strategy, see Risks Related to Our Business Plan to Utilize Net Operating Loss Carryforwards. We may not be able to use our net operating loss carryforwards because we may not generate taxable income. The use of our net operating loss carryforwards is subject to uncertainty because, in addition to the factors discussed above, it is dependent upon the amount of taxable income we generate. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income, if any, in future years to use the net operating loss carryforwards before they expire. We believe that our ability to achieve profitability would depend in substantial part on our ability to identify and acquire suitable businesses on favorable terms, so that we can increase our revenues and generate new income. Despite our significant efforts since February 2007, we have been unable to identify a suitable acquisition and may be unable to identify or complete any acquisitions in the future. Moreover, any such transactions may not be successful or enable us to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards. In order to complete any acquisition to effectuate the NOL Strategy we 19 may need to seek additional capital, including through the sale of stock or other securities, which may result in dilution to existing shareholders and the granting of superior rights to the new shareholders. In addition, as noted above, the provisions of the Code and certain applicable Treasury regulations will limit the number of shares of stock we can sell from time to time without causing a limitation on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our future tax obligations. The IRS could challenge the amount of our net operating loss carryforwards. The amount of our net operating loss carryforwards has not been audited or otherwise validated by the IRS. The IRS could challenge the amount of our net operating loss carryforwards, which could significantly reduce our net operating loss carryforwards. In addition, calculating whether an ownership change has occurred is subject to uncertainty, both because of the complexity and ambiguity of Section 382 of the Code and because of limitations on a publicly-traded company’s knowledge as to the ownership of, and transactions in, its securities. Therefore, the calculation of the amount of our net operating loss carryforwards may be changed as a result of a challenge by a governmental authority or our learning of new information about the ownership of, and transactions in, our securities. Possible changes in legislation could negatively affect our ability to use the tax benefits associated with our net operating loss carryforwards. The rules relating to U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department, resulting in revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts as well as statutory changes. Revisions in U.S. federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could adversely impair our ability to use the tax benefits associated with our net operating loss carryforwards. Limits on ownership of our common stock and our shareholder rights plan could have an adverse consequence to you and could limit your opportunity to receive a premium on our stock. As noted above, if we continue to explore our NOL Strategy, we must avoid an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code in order to potentially retain the ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future income. This means that a potential buyer of our stock might be deterred from acquiring our common stock while we still have significant tax losses being carried forward, because such an acquisition might trigger an ownership change and severely impair our ability to use our tax losses against future income. Thus, this potential tax situation could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control and, therefore, could adversely affect our shareholders’ ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for our common stock in connection with a change in control. To further deter a potential buyer of our stock from accumulating an ownership position that could jeopardize our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards, in June 2007, our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right on each outstanding share of our common stock. This shareholder rights plan is described in more detail below under the risk factor titled “— Risks Related to Our Common Stock — Certain provisions in our charter document and Washington law, as well as our shareholder rights plan, could discourage a change of control or make it difficult to change the composition of directors and management.” The shareholder rights plan may make it more difficult for other persons or entities, without the approval of our board of directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire substantial amounts of our common stock, or to launch other takeover attempts that a shareholder might consider to be in such shareholder’s best interests. The shareholder rights plan also may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. The shareholder rights plan could also result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code which may severely impair our ability to use our tax losses against future income. Risks Related to Our Common Stock We may be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market if we do not satisfy continued listing requirements. 20 Our common stock currently trades on The Nasdaq Capital Market. If we fail to meet any of the continued listing standards of The Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock will be delisted. Nasdaq’s continued listing standards include specifically enumerated criteria, such as a $1.00 minimum closing bid price, shareholders’ equity of $2.5 million or market value of publicly held shares of $35.0 million and 500,000 shares of common stock publicly held and market value of publicly held shares of at least $1 million, as well as additional or more stringent criteria that may be applied in the exercise of Nasdaq’s discretionary authority to maintain the quality of and public confidence in the Nasdaq market, prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices, promote just and equitable principles of trade, and protect investors and the public interest. For example, we failed to satisfy Nasdaq’s $1.00 minimum bid price requirement on more than one occasion over the past few years. If we were unable to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, our common stock would have been delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market. Each time we were able to cure the failure to satisfy the minimum bid price requirement and avert having our common stock delisted. However, we have no assurance that Nasdaq will not in the future seek to delist us for our failure to meet the enumerated conditions for continued listing. In particular, prior to the public announcement of the decision of our board of directors to adopt the Plan of Dissolution, the trading price of our common stock had generally been trading below $1.00 per share for the prior two months. If our shareholders do not approve the Plan of Dissolution, we believe it is likely that the price of our common stock will fall below Nasdaq’s $1.00 minimum bid price requirement and that our common stock will eventually be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market. In addition, if our Home and Garden Business continues to generate declining revenues, we may be deemed a “shell” company, which may result in delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market. If our common stock were delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market, you may find it difficult to dispose of your shares. If our common stock were to be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market, trading of our common stock most likely will be conducted in the over-the-counter market on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board. Such trading will reduce the market liquidity of our common stock. As a result, an investor would find it more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations for the price of, our common stock. If our common stock is delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market and the trading price remains below $5.00 per share, which is likely, trading in our common stock might also become subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the Exchange Act, which require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection with any trade involving a stock defined as a “penny stock” (generally, any equity security not listed on a national securities exchange that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions). Many brokerage firms are reluctant to recommend low-priced stocks to their clients. Moreover, various regulations and policies restrict the ability of shareholders to borrow against or “margin” low-priced stocks, and declines in the stock price below certain levels may trigger unexpected margin calls. Additionally, because brokers’ commissions on low-priced stocks generally represent a higher percentage of the stock price than commissions on higher priced stocks, the current price of the common stock can result in an individual shareholder paying transaction expenses that represent a higher percentage of total share value than would be the case if our share price were higher. This factor may also limit the willingness of institutions to purchase our common stock. Finally, the additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements could discourage broker-dealers from facilitating trades in our common stock, which could severely limit the market liquidity of the stock and the ability of investors to trade our common stock. Certain provisions in our charter documents and Washington law, as well as our shareholder rights plan, could discourage a change of control or make it difficult to change the composition of directors and management. Provisions of our charter documents and Washington law, as well as our shareholders rights plan, may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change of control, even if this change would be beneficial to our shareholders. In addition, some of these provisions may make it difficult for shareholders to remove or replace our current directors and management in the event our shareholders believe this 21 would be in the best interests of our company and our shareholders. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws: · prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of the stock to elect some directors; · stagger our board of directors, making it more difficult to elect a majority of the directors on our board and preventing our directors from being removed without cause; · limit who may call special meetings of shareholders; and · establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at shareholder meetings. Washington law imposes restrictions on certain transactions between a corporation and significant shareholders. Chapter 23B.19 of the WBCA prohibits a target corporation, with some exceptions, from engaging in particular significant business transactions with an acquiring person, which is defined as a person or group of persons that beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting securities of the target corporation, for a period of five years after the date the acquiring person first became a 10% beneficial owner of voting securities of the target corporation, unless the business transaction or the acquisition of shares is approved by a majority of the members of the target corporation’s board of directors prior to the time the acquiring person first became a 10% beneficial owner of the target corporation’s voting securities. Prohibited business transactions include: · a merger or consolidation with, disposition of assets to, or issuance or redemption of stock to or from the acquiring person; · termination of 5% or more of the employees of the target corporation; or · receipt by the acquiring person of any disproportionate benefit as a shareholder. After the five-year period, a significant business transaction may occur if it complies with “fair price” provisions specified in the statute. A corporation may not opt out of this statute. This provision may have an antitakeover effect with respect to transactions that our board of directors does not approve in advance. In June 2007, our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right on each outstanding share of our common stock. In addition to helping to protect the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards by deterring a potential buyer of our stock from accumulating an ownership position that could jeopardize our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards, the shareholder rights plan is also designed to ensure that our board of directors has adequate time to consider any proposed transaction involving the Company and that all of our shareholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of a proposed takeover of the Company. The rights will be exercisable only if a person or group acquires 5%, or in the case of any person or group that owned beneficially more than 5% of our outstanding common stock on June 1, 2007, 13% (or 18% in the case of SF Holding Corp., an existing investor that owned in excess of 16% of our outstanding common stock on June 1, 2007) or more of our outstanding common stock or launches or announces an intent to launch a tender or exchange offer that could result in the offeror becoming the beneficial owner of 5%, 13% or 18%, as the case may be, or more of our common stock. Each right will entitle shareholders to buy one one-hundredth of a share of a series of preferred stock called Series R Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $36.00. If a person or group acquires 5%, 13% or 18%, as the case may be, or more of our outstanding common stock, each right will entitle its holder (other than the acquiring person or group) to purchase, at the right’s then-current exercise price, the number of shares of our common stock having a market value of twice the exercise price. In addition, if we are acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after a person has acquired 5% or 13%, as the case may be, or more of our outstanding common stock, each right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the right’s then-current exercise price, a number of the acquiring company’s common shares having a market value of twice the exercise price. Following the acquisition by a person or group of beneficial ownership of 5% or 13%, as the case may be, or more of our outstanding common stock and before the acquisition of 50% or more of this common stock, our board of directors may exchange all or part of the rights (other than rights owned by the acquiring person or group) for a consideration per right consisting of one-half of the common stock that 22 would be issuable upon the exercise of one right. Alternatively, the rights are redeemable for one cent per right at the option of our board of directors, prior to the acquisition by a person or group of beneficial ownership of 5% or 13%, as the case may be, or more of our outstanding common stock. The shareholder rights plan may make it more difficult for other persons or entities, without the approval of our board of directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire substantial amounts of our common stock, or to launch other takeover attempts that a shareholder might consider to be in such shareholders best interests. The shareholder rights plan also may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None.
