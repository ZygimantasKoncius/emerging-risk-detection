Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report. We are an international shipping company with extensive operational experience that owns and operates a fleet of dry bulk carrier vessels. Our vessels transport a broad range of major and minor bulk commodities, including ores, coal, grains and fertilizers, along worldwide shipping routes. A.Operating Results As of February 29, 2016, we employ eight of our vessels on medium to long-term time charters with an average remaining term of approximately 0.6 years and 64 of our vessels in the spot market under short-term time charters or voyage charters. Under our time charters, the charterer typically pays us a fixed daily charterhire rate and bears all voyage expenses, including the cost of bunkers (fuel oil) and port and canal charges. We remain responsible for paying the chartered vessels operating expenses, including the cost of crewing, insuring, repairing and maintaining the vessel, the costs of spares and consumable stores, tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses, and we also pay commissions to affiliated and unaffiliated ship brokers and to in-house brokers associated with the charterer for the arrangement of the relevant charter. In addition, we are also responsible for the dry docking costs related to our vessels. Eight of our vessels in our fleet are employed on medium to long-term time charters, scheduled to expire from June 2016 until May 2017. In the future, we may employ these and our other vessels in the spot market under short term time charters or voyage charters, under bareboat charters, under contracts of affreighment, or in dry bulk carrier pools. Key Performance Indicators Our business is comprised of the following main elements: ·employment and operation of dry bulk vessels constituted our operating fleet ; and ·management of the financial, general and administrative elements involved in the conduct of our business and ownership of dry bulk vessels constituted our operating fleet. The employment and operation of our vessels require the following main components: ·vessel maintenance and repair; ·crew selection and training; 58 ·vessel spares and stores supply; ·contingency response planning; ·onboard safety procedures auditing; ·accounting; ·vessel insurance arrangement; ·vessel chartering; ·vessel security training and security response plans pursuant to the requirements of the ISPS Code; ·obtaining ISM Code certification and audits for each vessel within the six months of taking over a vessel; ·vessel hire management; ·vessel surveying; and ·vessel performance monitoring. The management of financial, general and administrative elements involved in the conduct of our business and ownership of our vessels requires the following main components: ·management of our financial resources, including banking relationships (i.e., administration of bank loans and bank accounts); ·management of our accounting system and records and financial reporting; ·administration of the legal and regulatory requirements affecting our business and assets; and ·management of the relationships with our service providers and customers. The principal factors that affect our profitability, cash flows and shareholders return on investment include: ·charter rates and periods of charterhire; ·levels of vessel operating expenses; ·depreciation and amortization expenses; ·financing costs; and ·fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We believe that the important measures for analyzing trends in the results of operations consist of the following: ·Average number of vessels is the number of vessels that constituted our operating fleet (including charter-in vessels) for the relevant period, as measured by the sum of the number of days all vessels were part of our operating fleet during the period divided by the number of calendar days in that period. ·Ownership days are the total number of calendar days all operating vessels in our fleet were owned by us for the relevant period. ·Available days for the fleet are equal to the ownership and charter-in days minus off-hire days, as a result of major repairs, dry docking or special or intermediate surveys and lay-up days, if any. ·Voyage days are equal to the total number of days the vessels were in our possession or chartered-in for the relevant period minus off-hire days incurred for any reason (including off-hire for dry docking, major repairs, special or intermediate surveys, transfer of ownership or lay-up days, if any). ·Fleet utilization is calculated by dividing voyage days by available days for the relevant period. Ballast days for which a charter is not fixed are not included in the voyage days for the fleet utilization calculation. ·Time charter equivalent rate. Our method of calculating the time charter equivalent rate (the TCE rate) is determined by dividing voyage revenues (net of voyage expenses and amortization of fair value of above or below market acquired time charter agreements) by voyage days for the relevant time period. The following table reflects our voyage days, ownership days, fleet utilization and TCE rates for the periods indicated: 59 (TCE rates expressed in U.S. dollars) Year Ended December 31, 2013 Year Ended December 31, 2014 Year Ended December 31, 2015 Average number of vessels 13.34 28.88 69.35 Number of vessels in operation (as of the last day of the periods reported) 15 62 70 Average age of operational fleet (in years) 9.6 9.4 7.4 Ownership days 4,868 10,541 25,206 Available days 4,763 10,413 24,204 Voyage days for fleet 4,651 8,948 21,171 Fleet Utilization 98% 86% 88% Time charter equivalent rate $14,427 $12,161 $8,063 Voyage Revenues $68,296 $145,041 $234,035 Time Charter Equivalent (TCE) Time charter equivalent rate (the TCE rate) is a measure of the average daily revenue performance of a vessel on a per voyage basis. Our method of calculating TCE rate is determined by dividing voyage revenues (net of voyage expenses and amortization of fair value of above or below market acquired time charter agreements) by voyage days for the relevant time period. Voyage expenses primarily consist of port, canal and fuel costs that are unique to a particular voyage, which would otherwise be paid by the charterer under a time charter contract, as well as commissions. TCE rate is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in a shipping companys performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., spot charters, time charters and bareboat charters) under which the vessels may be employed between the periods. We report TCE revenues, a non-GAAP measure, since our management believes it provides additional meaningful information in conjunction with voyage revenues, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, because it assists our management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of our vessels and in evaluating their financial performance. The TCE rate is also included herein because it is a standard shipping industry performance measure and we believe that it presents useful information to investors. Our calculation of TCE, however, may not be comparable to that reported by other companies. The following table reflects the calculation of our TCE rates and the reconciliation of TCE revenue to voyage revenue as reflected in the consolidated statement of operations: (In thousands of U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise stated) Year Ended December 31, 2013 Year Ended December 31, 2014 Year Ended December 31, 2015 Voyage revenues $68,296 $145,041 $234,035 Less: Voyage expenses (7,549) (42,341) (72,877) Amortization of fair value of above market acquired time charter agreements $6,352 $6,113 $9,540 Time Charter equivalent revenues $67,099 $108,813 $170,698 Voyage days for fleet 4,651 8,948 21,171 Time charter equivalent (TCE) rate (in U.S. Dollars) $14,427 $12,161 $8,063 Voyage Revenues Voyage revenues are driven primarily by the number of vessels in our fleet, the number of voyage days and the amount of daily charter hire and the level of freight rates that our vessels earn under time and voyage charters, respectively, which, in turn, are affected by a number of factors, including our decisions relating to vessel acquisitions and disposals, the amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels, the amount of time that our vessels spend in dry dock undergoing repairs, maintenance and upgrade work, the age, condition and specifications of our vessels, levels of supply and demand in the seaborne transportation market. 60 Vessels operating on time charters for a certain period of time provide more predictable cash flows over that period of time, but can yield lower profit margins than vessels operating in the spot charter market during periods characterized by favorable market conditions. Vessels operating in the spot charter market generate revenues that are less predictable, but may enable us to capture increased profit margins during periods of improvements in charter rates, although we would be exposed to the risk of declining vessel rates, which may have a materially adverse impact on our financial performance. If we employ vessels on period time charters, future spot market rates may be higher or lower than the rates at which we have employed our vessels on period time charters. Vessel Voyage Expenses Voyage expenses include, port and canal charges, agency fees, fuel (bunker) expenses and brokerage commissions payable to related and third parties. Our voyage expenses primarily consist of bunkers cost and commissions paid for the chartering of our vessels. Charter-in Hire Expenses Expenses related to the chartering-in of vessels owned by third parties are recognized on a pro-rata basis over the duration of the voyage, except for the hire expense for chartering-in the respective vessels, which is included within Charter - in hire expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Vessel Operating Expenses Vessel operating expenses include crew wages and related costs, the cost of insurance and vessel registry, expenses relating to repairs and maintenance, the costs of spares and consumable stores, tonnage taxes, regulatory fees, technical management fees, lubricants and other miscellaneous expenses. Other factors beyond our control, some of which may affect the shipping industry in general, including for instance developments relating to market prices for crew wages, lubricants and insurance, may also cause these expenses to increase. Dry Docking expenses Dry docking expenses relate to regularly scheduled intermediate survey or special survey dry docking necessary to preserve the quality of our vessels as well as to comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations. Dry docking expenses can vary according to the age of the vessel, the location where the dry docking takes place, shipyard availability and the number of days the vessel is off-hire. We utilize the direct expense method, under which we expense all dry docking costs as incurred. Depreciation We depreciate our vessels on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives determined to be 25 years from the date of their initial delivery from the shipyard. Depreciation is calculated based on a vessels cost less the estimated residual value. General and Administrative Expenses We incur general and administrative expenses, including our onshore personnel related expenses, directors and executives compensation, legal, consulting and accounting expenses. Interest and Finance Costs We incur interest expense and financing costs in connection with vessel-specific debt and the Notes issued in 2014 relating to the acquisition of our vessels. We defer financing fees and expenses incurred upon entering into our credit facility and amortize them to interest and financing costs over the term of the underlying obligation using the effective interest method. 61 Gain / (Loss) on Derivative Financial Instruments From time to time, we may take positions in freight derivatives, including freight forward agreements (the FFAs) and freight options with an objective to utilize those instruments as economic hedges that are highly effective in reducing the risk on specific vessels trading in the spot market and to take advantage of short term fluctuations in the market prices. Upon the settlement, if the contracted charter rate is less than the average of the rates, as reported by an identified index, for the specified route and time period, the seller of the FFA is required to pay the buyer an amount equal to the difference between the contracted rate and the settlement rate, multiplied by the number of days in the specified period. Conversely, if the contracted rate is greater than the settlement rate, the buyer is required to pay the seller the settlement sum. All of our FFAs are settled on a daily basis through London Clearing House (LCH), and there is also a margin maintenance requirement based on marking the contract to market. Freight options are treated as assets/liabilities until they are settled. Any such settlements by us or settlements to us under FFAs are recorded as gain or loss on derivative financial instruments. In addition, we may enter into interest rate swap transactions to manage interest costs and risk associated with changing interest rates with respect to our variable interest loans and credit facilities. Interest rate swaps are recorded in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities, measured at their fair value, with changes in such fair value recognized in earnings, unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Interest income We earn interest income on our cash deposits with our lenders. Inflation Inflation does not have a material effect on our expenses given current economic conditions. In the event that significant global inflationary pressures appear, these pressures would increase our operating, voyage, administrative and financing costs. Foreign Exchange Fluctuations Please see Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Lack of Historical Operating Data for Vessels before Their Acquisition by Us Consistent with shipping industry practice, other than inspection of the physical condition of the vessels and examinations of classification society records, there is no historical financial due diligence process when we acquire vessels. Accordingly, we do not obtain the historical operating data for the vessels from the sellers because that information is not material to our decision to make vessel acquisitions, nor do we believe it would be helpful to potential investors in our shares in assessing our business or profitability. Most vessels are sold under a standardized agreement, which among other things provides the buyer with the right to inspect the vessel and the vessels classification society records. The standard agreement does not give the buyer the right to inspect, or receive copies of, the historical operating data of the vessel. Prior to the delivery of a purchased vessel, the seller typically removes from the vessel all records, including past financial records and accounts related to the vessel. In addition, the technical management agreement between the sellers technical manager and the seller is automatically terminated and the vessels trading certificates are revoked by its flag state following a change in ownership. Consistent with shipping industry practice, we treat the acquisition of a vessel (whether acquired with or without charter) as the acquisition of an asset rather than a business, which we believe to be in accordance with applicable U.S. GAAP and rules of the Commission. Where a vessel has been under a voyage charter, the vessel is delivered to the buyer free of charter. In the shipping industry, the last charterer of the vessel in the hands of the seller rarely continues as the first charterer of the vessel in the hands of the buyer. In most cases, when a vessel is under time charter and the buyer wishes to assume that charter, the vessel can be acquired only if the charterer consents to the acquisition and the buyer enters into a separate direct agreement (called a novation agreement) with the charterer to assume the charter. The purchase of a vessel itself does not transfer the charter because the latter is a separate services agreement between the vessel owner and the charterer. Where we identify any intangible assets or liabilities associated with the acquisition of a vessel, we allocate the purchase price of acquired tangible and intangible assets based on their relative fair values. Where we have either assumed an existing charter obligation or entered into a time charter with the existing charterer in connection with the purchase of a vessel at charter rates that are less than market charter rates, we record a liability based on the difference between the assumed charter agreement rate and the market charter rate for an equivalent charter agreement. Conversely, where we either assume an existing charter obligation or enter into a time charter with the existing charterer in connection with the purchase of a vessel at charter rates that are above prevailing market charter rates, we record an asset based on the difference between the market charter rate and the assumed contracted charter rate for an equivalent vessel. This determination is made at the time the vessel is delivered to us, and such assets and liabilities are amortized to revenue over the remaining period of the charter. 62 When we purchase a vessel and assume or renegotiate a related time charter, depending on the charter party terms, we may need to take the following steps before the vessel is ready to commence operations: ·obtain the charterers consent to us as the new owner; ·obtain the charterers consent to a new technical manager; ·arrange for a new crew for the vessel, and where the vessel is on charter, in some cases, the crew must be approved by the charterer; ·replace all hired equipment on board, such as gas cylinders and communication equipment; ·negotiate and enter into new insurance contracts for the vessel through our own insurance brokers; ·in some cases, register the vessel under a flag state and obtain the charterers consent to a new flag for the vessel; ·perform the related inspections in order to obtain new trading certificates from the flag state; ·implement a new planned maintenance program for the vessel; and ·ensure that the new technical manager obtains new certificates for compliance with the safety and vessel security regulations of the flag state. The above discussion is intended to help you understand how acquisitions of vessels may affect our business and results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies We make certain estimates and judgments in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments or uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We have described below what we believe are the most critical accounting policies that involve a high degree of judgment and the methods of their application. For a description of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 (Significant Accounting Policies) to our consolidated financial statements included herein for more information. Impairment of long-lived assets: We follow guidance related to the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for such impairment or disposal. The standard requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The guidance calls for an impairment loss when the estimate of undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to be generated by the use and eventual disposition of the asset is less than its carrying amount. The impairment loss is determined by the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the fair value of the asset. The Company determines the fair value of its assets based on management estimates and assumptions and by making use of available market data and taking into consideration third party valuations. In this respect, management regularly reviews the carrying amount of each vessel, including new building contracts, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a vessel might not be recoverable (as determined by comparison to vessel sales and purchases, business plans, obsolesce or damage to the asset and overall conditions). 63 When impairment indicators are present, we determine if the carrying value of each asset is recoverable by comparing (A) the undiscounted cash flows for each asset, using the Value-In-Use (VIU) method, to (B) the carrying values for such asset. Our managements subjective judgment is required in making assumptions used in forecasting future operating results for this calculation. Such judgment is based on current market conditions, historical industrys and Companys specific trends, as well as expectations regarding future charter rates, vessel operating expenses and fleet utilization over the remaining useful life of the vessel, which is assumed to be 25 years from its delivery from the shipyard. These estimates are also consistent with the plans and forecasts used by the management to conduct our business. The undiscounted projected net operating cash flows are determined by considering the charter revenues from existing time charters for the fixed vessel days and an estimated daily time charter equivalent rate for the unfixed days over the estimated remaining economic life of each vessel, net of brokerage and address commissions. Estimates of the daily time charter equivalent for the unfixed days are based on the current Forward Freight Agreement (FFA) rates, for the first three-year period, and historical average rate levels of similar size vessels for the period thereafter. The expected cash inflows from charter revenues are based on an assumed fleet utilization rate of approximately 98% for the unfixed days, and take into account that assumed charter rates are based on time charter equivalent rates, which include the ballast and laden portion of each relevant voyage. In assessing expected future cash outflows, management forecasts vessel operating expenses, which are based on our internal budget for the first annual period, and thereafter assume an annual inflation rate of up to 3% (escalating to such level during the first three-year period and capped at the tenth year), as well as vessel expected maintenance costs (for dry docking and special surveys). The estimated salvage value of each vessel is $300 per light weight ton, in accordance with our vessel depreciation policy. We use a probability weighted approach for developing estimates of future cash flows used to test our vessels for recoverability when alternative courses of action are under consideration (i.e. sale or continuing operation of a vessel). If our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows for any vessel is lower than the vessels carrying value, the carrying value is written down to the vessels fair market value with a charge recorded in earnings. On September 30, 2012, we performed an impairment test and recognized an impairment loss of $303.2 million, thereby adjusting the carrying value of our vessels to be in line with their market values at that time. As of December 31, 2013, we performed impairment review only for the two vessels Star Aurora and Star Polaris whose carrying values were below their market values, because (i) during the year 2013, the BDI recovered to an annual average of 1,206, as compared to 920 in 2012; (ii) after the recognized impairment loss of $303.2 million in 2012 as described above, the carrying values of all of our vessels had been adjusted to be in line with their market values; and (iii) events and circumstances indicated that, since our latest performed impairment test of September 30, 2012, no adverse factors had occurred or were evidenced that could indicate that the carrying values of our vessels may not be recoverable. For the impairment review of the Star Aurora and Star Polaris, we used the same framework for estimating projected undiscounted cash flows as described above. As a result of the improved market conditions at the time, we indicated that the carrying amount of the respective vessels was recoverable, and no asset impairment was necessary. Due to the continued global economic downturn and the prevailing conditions in the shipping industry, as of December 31, 2014, we performed an impairment analysis for 51 of our 62 vessels whose carrying values were above their respective market values. Based on our analysis conducted under the framework for estimating undiscounted projected cash flows described above, the future undiscounted projected cash flows expected to be earned by each of these vessels over its operating life were in excess of each vessels carrying value. No asset impairment was, therefore, necessary for the year ended December 31, 2014. As further discussed elsewhere in this report, since late December 2014 and up to early 2016, we entered into separate agreements with third parties to sell 23 of our vessels. As part of these sales, we recognized an impairment loss of $219.4 million. In addition, in view of the continued economic downturn and the prevailing conditions in the shipping industry, as of December 31, 2015 we performed an impairment analysis for all of our vessels whose carrying values were above their respective market values. Based on our impairment analysis conducted under the framework described above, for estimating undiscounted projected net operating cash flows expected to be earned for certain of our vessels were below their carrying value and accordingly, we recognized an additional impairment loss of $102.6 million, which took into consideration the possibility of a sale of certain additional vessels if attractive sale prices are attainable. 64 Although we believe that the assumptions used to evaluate potential asset impairment are based on historical trends and are reasonable and appropriate, such assumptions are highly subjective. To minimize such subjectivity, our analysis for the year ended December 31, 2015, also involved sensitivity analysis to the model inputs we believe are more important and likely to change. In particular, we modified the utilization ratio of each vessel, in order to account for the effect of increased idle time of vessels under a weak market environment. In addition, in terms of our estimates for the charter rates for the unfixed period, we consider that the FFA as of December 31, 2015, which is applied in our model for the first three years period, approximates historical low levels and fully reflects the conceivable downside scenario. We, however, sensitized our model with regards to freight rate assumptions for the unfixed period beyond the first three years. Our sensitivity analysis revealed that, to the extent the historical rates would not decline by more than a range of 6% to 57%, depending on the vessel, or the utilization rate would not be reduced by more than a range of 8% to 59%, we would not require to recognize additional impairment. Vessel Acquisitions and Depreciation: We record the value of our vessels at their cost (which includes acquisition costs directly attributable to the vessel and delivery expenditures, including pre-delivery expenses and expenditures made to prepare the vessel for its initial voyage) less accumulated depreciation. We depreciate our vessels on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, after considering the estimated salvage value. We estimate the useful life of our vessels to be 25 years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard, with secondhand vessels depreciated from the date of their acquisition through their remaining estimated useful life. Effective January 1, 2015, and following managements reassessment of the residual value of our vessels, the estimated scrap value per light weight tonnage was increased from $200 to $300. The current value of $300 was based on the historical average demolition prices prevailing in the market. The effect of this change in accounting estimate, which pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections was applied in our financial statements prospectively and did not require retrospective application, was to decrease the depreciation expense and the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015, by $6.3 million, or $0.03 loss per basic and diluted share. An increase in the useful life of a vessel or in its residual value would have the effect of decreasing the annual depreciation and extending it into later periods. A decrease in the useful life of a vessel or in its residual value would have the effect of increasing the annual depreciation and accelerating it into earlier periods. A decrease in the useful life of the vessel may occur as a result of poor vessel maintenance, harsh ocean going and weather conditions, or poor quality of shipbuilding. When regulations place limitations over the ability of a vessel to trade on a worldwide basis, its remaining useful life is adjusted to end at the date such regulations preclude such vessels further commercial use. Weak freight market rates result in owners scrapping more vessels, and scrapping them earlier in their lives due to the unattractive returns. An increase in the useful life of the vessel may occur as a result of superior vessel maintenance performed, favorable ocean going and weather conditions, superior quality of shipbuilding, or high freight market rates, which result in owners scrapping the vessels later due to the attractive cash flows. Fair value of above/below market acquired time charter: If time charters are assumed when vessels are acquired, we value any asset or liability arising from the market values of the time charters. The value of above or below market acquired time charters is determined by comparing existing charter rates in the acquired time charter agreements with the market rates for equivalent time charter agreements prevailing at the time the foregoing vessels are delivered. Such intangible assets or liabilities are recognized ratably as adjustments to revenues over the remaining term of the assumed time charter. Due to early time charter terminations the remaining unamortized balances of the intangible assets and liabilities associated with such below or above market acquired time charters were recognized as Gain/(Loss) on time charter agreement termination or in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. See note 7 of our consolidated financial statements. 65 Stock Incentive plan awards: Stock-based compensation represents the cost of vested and non-vested shares and share options granted to employees and to directors, for their services, and is included in General and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. These shares are measured at their fair value equal to the market value of our common stock on the grant date. The shares that do not contain any future service vesting conditions are considered vested shares and the total fair value of such shares is expensed on the grant date. Applicable guidance related to stock compensation describes two generally accepted methods of recognizing an expense for non-vested share awards with a graded vesting schedule for financial reporting purposes: (1) the accelerated method, which treats an award with multiple vesting dates as multiple awards and results in a front-loading of the costs of the award; and (2) the straight-line method, which treats such awards as a single award and results in recognition of the cost ratably over the entire vesting period. The shares that contain a time-based service vesting condition are considered non-vested shares on the grant date and a total fair value of such shares is recognized using the accelerated method. The fair value of share option grants is determined with reference to option pricing models, and depends on the terms of the granted options. The fair value is recognized (generally as compensation expense) over the requisite service period for all awards that vest. We currently assume that all non-vested shares and share options will vest. We do not include estimated forfeitures in determining the total stock-based compensation expense because we estimate the forfeitures of non-vested shares to be immaterial and we did not have forfeitures in the past. We, however, re-evaluate the reasonableness of our assumption at each reporting period. We pay dividends on all issued shares regardless of whether they have vested and there is an obligation of the employee to return the dividend if the employment ceases prior to the date that shares vest. The dividends declared and paid on issued and non-vested shares that are expected to vest are charged to retained earnings. Trade accounts receivable, net: The amount shown as trade accounts receivable, at each balance sheet date, includes estimated recoveries from each voyage or time charter net of any provision for doubtful debts. At each balance sheet date, we provide for doubtful accounts on the basis of identified doubtful receivables. Derivatives: We designate our derivatives based upon guidance on accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments. The guidance on accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities requires all derivative instruments to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings, unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Hedge Accounting: If the instruments are eligible for hedge accounting, at the inception of a hedge relationship, we formally designate and document the hedge relationship to which we wish to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy undertaken for the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how we will assess the hedging instruments effectiveness in offsetting exposure to changes in the hedged items cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine whether they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. Currently, we are party to interest swap agreements under which we receive a floating interest rate and pay a fixed interest rate for a certain period in exchange. Contracts that meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as cash flow hedges. A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasted transaction that could affect profit or loss. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in their fair value is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) in equity and is subsequently recognized in earnings, under Interest and finance costs when the hedged items impact earnings, while any ineffective portion, if any, is recognized immediately in current period earnings under Gain / (Loss) on derivative financial instruments, net. The changes in the fair value of derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are recognized in earnings. We discontinue cash flow hedge accounting if the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated or exercised and it or no longer meets all the criteria for hedge accounting, or if we will discontinue cash flow hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognized in equity remains in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs or until it becomes probable of not occurring. When the forecasted transaction occurs, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized in earnings. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognized in equity is reclassified to earnings. 66 Year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Voyage revenues: For the year ended December 31, 2015, total voyage revenues were $234.0 million, compared to $145.0 million for the same period in 2014. This increase was mainly due to the increase in the average number of our vessels to 69.4 in the year ended December 31, 2015, from 28.9 vessels in the same period in 2014. The increase in voyage revenues from the additional vessels was partially offset by significantly lower charterhire rates prevailing in the dry bulk market during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014. Management fee income: Management fee income during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $0.3 million, compared to $2.3 million for the same period in 2014. This decrease was mainly due to the decrease in the average number of third-party vessels under management to 1.0 vessel for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 8.6 vessels in the same period in 2014. As a result of the acquisition of Oceanbulk, 11 Oceanbulk vessels that had been under our management became part of our fleet as of July 11, 2014. We, therefore, stopped receiving fees for the management of these vessels. Voyage expenses: For the year ended December 31, 2015, voyage expenses were $72.9 million, compared to $42.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in voyage expenses was due to the increase in the average number of vessels for the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as the increased level of spot market activity, which is associated with higher voyage expenses than time charters, partially offset by the decrease in the price of oil. Charter-in hire expense: For the year ended December 31, 2015, charter hire expense was $1.0 million, representing the expense for leasing back the vessel Astakos (ex-Maiden Voyage), which we sold in September 2015. Vessel operating expenses: For the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, vessel operating expenses were $112.8 million and $53.1 million, respectively. The increase in operating expenses was mainly due to higher average number of vessels during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014. Our average daily operating expenses per vessel for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $4,475, compared to $5,037 during the same period in 2014, representing a 11% reduction as a result of synergies and economies of scale from operating a larger fleet. In addition, vessel operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 included $6.1 million and $3.0 million of pre-delivery expenses, respectively, which related to the initial crew manning and the initial supply of stores for our vessels upon delivery. Dry docking expenses: Dry docking expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $15.0 million and $5.4 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, 23 of our vessels underwent their periodic dry docking surveys, compared to four vessels in the same period in 2014. Depreciation: Depreciation expense increased to $82.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $37.2 million for the same period in 2014. The increase was due to the higher average number of vessels in our fleet in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, partially offset by an increase in the estimated scrap rate per light weight ton from $200 to $300, which became effective as of January 1, 2015 following our managements reassessment based on the historical average demolition prices prevailing in the market. Management fees: Management fees for year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $8.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, management fees included a daily fee of $295 per vessel to SPS, an unaffiliated third party, which we engaged on January 1, 2015 to provide our fleet with certain procurement and remote vessel performance monitoring services. In addition, management fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 included a monthly fee of $17,500 we paid to Maryville Maritime Inc. (Maryville) for the management of one of three of the Excel Vessels (Star Martha, Star Pauline and Star Despoina) until the expiration of their existing time charter agreements (the last expired in November 2015). General and administrative expenses: During the year ended December 31, 2015, we had $23.6 million of general and administrative expenses, compared to $32.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was mainly due to non-recurring transaction costs of $9.4 million, which we incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014 in connection with the acquisition of Oceanbulk, and stock-based compensation expenses of $1.8 million, also incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014, relating to a severance payment to our former Chief Executive Officer. Excluding the above mentioned non-recurring transaction costs and stock based compensation expense for both years 2015 and 2014 of $2.7 million and $4.0 million, respectively, general and administrative expenses increased by 19% because of the increase in average number of employees by 30% during the year 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. 67 Impairment loss: During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an impairment loss of an aggregate of $322.0 million relating to: (i) the agreements signed to sell certain operating vessels and newbuilding vessels upon their delivery from the shipyards, (ii) two agreements to reassign the corresponding leases for two newbuilding vessels back to the vessels owners for a one-time refund to us of $5.8 million each, and (iii) our impairment analysis performed for the year ended December 31, 2015. The impairment loss includes an amount of $126.8 million representing write-off of the fair value adjustment recognized upon our merger with Oceanbulk in July 2014. Loss on time charter agreement termination: During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a $2.1 million write-off of the unamortized fair value of the above market acquired time charter of the vessel Star Big due to its redelivery prior to the end of its time charter in connection with its sale and delivery to its new owners in June 2015. Other operational gain: For the year ended December 31, 2015, other operational gain of $0.6 million mainly consisting of cash received from the sale of KLC shares acquired in past years in connection with the rehabilitation plan. Loss on sale of vessel: During the year ended December 31, 2015 we recognized an aggregate loss on sale of vessels of $20.6 million relating to the sale of certain operating and newbuilding vessels. Total proceeds from these sales were $71.4 million, of which $1.1 million was received in 2014 as an advance for the sale of the Star Kim. Interest and finance costs: Interest and finance costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $29.7 million and $9.6 million, respectively. The increase is attributable to the higher average balance of our outstanding indebtedness of $957.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, including $50.0 million under the 8.00% Senior Notes and our capital lease obligations, compared to $412.3 million for the same period in 2014. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2015, interest and finance costs included $2.4 million relating to interest rate swaps compared to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Interest and finance costs incurred in the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were set-off with interest capitalized from general debt of $12.1 million and $7.8 million, respectively, in connection with the payments made for our newbuilding vessels. Loss on debt extinguishment: During the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded $1.0 million and $0.7 million, respectively, of loss on debt extinguishment in connection with the non-cash write off of unamortized deferred finance charges due to prepayments of certain of our loan facilities. Gain/ (Loss) on derivative financial instrument, net: We recorded a loss on derivative financial instruments for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $3.3 million, which included realized and unrealized gains/losses from swaps that were de-designated as accounting cash flow hedges from April 1, 2015 onwards (date of de-designation). Loss on derivative financial instruments of $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, represented the non-cash loss from the mark to market valuation of four of our interest rate swaps up to August 31, 2014, the date we designated the respective interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. Year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Voyage revenues: Voyage revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, were approximately $145.0 million and $68.3 million, respectively. This increase was mainly attributable to the increase in the average number of vessels operated during the year ended December 31, 2014 to 28.9, compared to 13.3 during the year ended December 31, 2013, as a result of the 2014 Transactions. This increase was partially offset by the decrease in the charter rates earned by our vessels for the respective periods. During the year ended December 31, 2014, our operated vessels earned $12,161 TCE rate per day as compared to $14,427 TCE rate per day, for the year ended December 31, 2013. Management fee income: For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, management fee income was approximately $2.3 million and $1.6 million, respectively. The increase was due to the increase in the average number of vessels under management to 8.6 vessels during the year ended December 31, 2014, from 5.8 during the year ended December 31, 2013. As a result of the July 2014 Transactions, 11 vessels under our management that were part of the fleets of Oceanbulk and the Pappas Companies became part of our fleet as of July 11, 2014. We, therefore, stopped receiving fees for the management of these 11 vessels. 68 Voyage expenses: For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, voyage expenses were approximately $42.3 million and $7.5 million, respectively. Consistent with dry bulk industry practice, we paid broker commissions as a percentage of the total daily charterhire rate of each charter to ship brokers associated with the charter. Additionally, effective January 1, 2014, we began to pay a fixed brokerage fee to Interchart. Voyage expenses also consist of fees for hiring, port, canal and fuel costs. The increase in voyage expenses was mainly attributable to the increase in the average number of vessels for the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of the 2014 Transactions, and the increased level of spot market activity, which resulted in higher port, canal and fuel costs, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Vessel operating expenses: For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our vessel operating expenses were approximately $53.1 million and $27.1 million, respectively. The increase in operating expenses was mainly due to higher average number of vessels during the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, as a result of the 2014 Transactions. In addition, vessel operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 include $3.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively, related to one-time pre-delivery and pre-joining expenses incurred in connection with the delivery of the new vessels in our fleet. Pre-joining and pre-delivery expenses relate to the expenses for the initial crew manning, as well as the initial supply of stores for the vessel upon delivery. Our average daily operating expenses per vessel for the year ended December 31, 2014, were $5,037, compared to $5,564 during the year ended December 31, 2013, representing a 10% reduction, as a result of synergies and economies of scale from operating a larger fleet. Excluding the amount of pre-joining and pre-delivery expenses, our average daily operating expenses per vessel for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 would have been $4,750 and $5,523, respectively, which would have represented a decrease of 14%. Dry docking expenses: For the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our dry docking expenses were $5.4 million and $3.5 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2014, two of our Capesize vessels and two Supramax vessels underwent dry docking surveys. Dry docking expenses were higher in 2014 mainly due to the fact that one of the Capesize vessels in dry dock was one of our oldest vessels. During the year ended December 31, 2013, one Capesize and three Supramax vessels underwent dry docking surveys. Depreciation: For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recorded vessel depreciation charges of $37.2 million and $16.1 million, respectively. The increase in depreciation was due to the increase in the average number of vessels in our fleet during the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, as a result of the 2014 Transactions, and the corresponding increase in the depreciable asset base. General and administrative expenses: For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, general and administrative expenses were $32.7 million and $9.9 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our general and administrative expenses consisted of salaries and other related costs of our executive officers and other employees ($11.2 million), office renovation costs and office rents, legal, accounting costs and consultancy fees, regulatory compliance costs and other miscellaneous expenses ($6.3 million), costs related to vested and non-vested stock grants under the equity incentive plan ($4.0 million), severance payment in shares to our former Chief Executive Officer pursuant to the terms of his release agreement ($1.8 million), and acquisition costs in connection with the July 2014 Transactions ($9.4 million). For the year ended December 31, 2013, our general and administrative expenses consisted of salaries and other related costs of our executive officers and other employees ($6.2 million), office renovation costs and office rents, legal, accounting costs and consultancy fees, regulatory compliance costs and other miscellaneous expenses ($2.2 million) and costs related to vested and non-vested stock grants under the equity incentive plan ($1.5 million). The increase in salaries and other related costs of our executive officers and other employees was due to the higher number of employees during the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, as a result of the growth of our fleet due to the 2014 Transactions, and in anticipation of the deliveries of our newbuilding vessels. Bad debt expense: For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized bad debt expense of $0.2 million, representing a write off related to unpaid hires from charterers, since we determined that such amounts were not recoverable. No bad debt expense was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2013. Other operational loss: For the year ended December 31, 2014, other operational loss was $0.1 million. In September 2010, we signed an agreement to sell a 45% interest in the future proceeds related to the settlement of certain commercial claims. As a result, in connection with the settlement of one of the commercial claims described in other operational gain below, for the year ended December 31, 2013, we incurred an expense of $1.1 million, which is included under other operational loss for the year ended December 31, 2013. 69 Other operational gain: For the year ended December 31, 2014, other operational gain was $10.0 million and mainly consisted of: (i) $8.0 million of revenue from the sale to a third party of the claim against the previous charterer of Star Borealis for charter party repudiation due to early redelivery of the vessel (please see Item 8. Financial Information – Consolidated statements and other financial information - Legal proceedings); (ii) $1.4 million regarding the extinguishment of the liability to the previous charterer of Star Borealis, related to the amount of fuel and lubricants remaining on board at the time of the charter repudiation; (iii) $0.2 million received as a rebate from our previous manning agent; and (iv) a $0.5 million gain derived from a hull and machinery and protection and indemnity claims. For the year ended December 31, 2013, other operational gain was $3.8 million and mainly consisted of: (i) $2.7 million revenue, related to the payment of installments due to us under settlement agreements for two commercial claims; and (ii) $1.0 million of gain from a hull and machinery insurance claim. Gain from bargain purchase: For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a gain from bargain purchase of $12.3 million, representing the excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired in the acquisition of Oceanbulk and the Pappas Companies, over the aggregate purchase consideration. Interest and finance costs: For the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, interest and finance costs were $9.6 million and $6.8 million, respectively. The increase is attributable to higher average balance of our outstanding indebtedness amounting to $412.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $200.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Additionally for the year ended December 31, 2014, interest and finance costs include an amount of $1.1 million relating to interest rate swap settlements. No interest swap settlements were included in interest and finance costs for the year ended December 31, 2013, since at that time our interest rate swaps did not qualify for hedge accounting. Interest and finance costs, for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, also included interest capitalized from general debt amounting to $7.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively, in connection with our newbuilding vessels. Interest and other income: For the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, interest income was $0.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively. The increase was mainly due to an increased average cash balance during the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Gain/ (Loss) on derivative financial instrument, net: Loss on derivative financial instruments of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 represents the non-cash loss from the mark to market valuation of four of our interest rate swaps up to August 31, 2014, the date we designated the respective interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. The change in the fair value of these swaps after the hedging designation was recorded in equity to the extent these hedges were effective. Gain on derivative financial instruments of $0.09 million during the year ended December 31, 2013, represented the non-cash gain from the mark to market valuation of two interest rate swaps outstanding as of December 31, 2013, that were not designated as cash flow hedges. Loss on debt extinguishment: During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an amount of $0.7 million under loss on debt extinguishment, in connection with the non-cash write off of unamortized deferred finance charges due to the partial prepayment of the Excel Vessel Bridge Facility (as defined below). Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. B.Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal source of funds has been equity provided by our shareholders, additional debt under secured credit facilities or unsecured bond notes, capital leases and operating cash flow. Our principal use of funds has been capital expenditures to grow our fleet, maintain the quality of our dry bulk carriers, comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations, fund working capital requirements, make interest and principal repayments on outstanding loan facilities, and pay dividends. Our short-term liquidity requirements relate to servicing our debt, paying of operating costs, funding working capital requirements and maintaining cash reserves against fluctuations in operating cash flows and paying cash dividends when permissible. Our primary source of short-term liquidity is our operating revenues. Our medium- and long-term liquidity requirements relate to funding the equity portion of any possible investments in additional secondhand vessels, newbuilding vessels and the repayment of long-term debt balances. Sources of funding for our medium- and long-term liquidity requirements include new loans, capital leases, equity issuance or vessel sales. 70 Recent Equity Offerings and Senior Notes On July 25, 2013, pursuant to the Rights Offering, approved by our Board of Directors in April 2013, we issued 15,338,861 shares of common stock, which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $77.9 million, after deducting offering expenses of $2.2 million. On October 7, 2013, we issued and sold 8,050,000 common shares in an underwritten public offering, which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $68.1 million, after deducting offering expenses of $2.7 million. On November 6, 2014, we issued $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.00% Senior Notes due 2019 (the 2019 Notes). The 2019 Notes mature in November 2019 and are senior, unsecured obligations of Star Bulk Carriers Corp. The 2019 Notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries. On January 14, 2015, we issued and sold 49,000,418 common shares in an underwritten public offering, at a price of $5.00 per share. The aggregate proceeds net of underwriting commissions were $242.2 million, which we used for the financing of our newbuilding program and general corporate purposes. On May 18, 2015, we issued and sold 56,250,000 common shares in an underwritten public offering, at a price of $3.20 per share. The aggregate proceeds net of underwriting commissions were $175.6 million, which we used for the financing of our newbuilding program and general corporate purposes. Significant Changes in our Fleet On July 11, 2014, we completed the July 2014 Transactions. A total of 54,104,200 of our common shares were issued to the various selling parties in the July 2014 Transactions, of which 45,460,324 shares were issued to Oaktree, and 8,643,876 were issued to the owners of the Pappas Companies. In the July 2014 Transactions we acquired 12 then-existing vessels, 25 contracts for newbuilding vessels and an equity interest in Heron, which eventually resulted in the distribution to us of two additional vessels. In August 2014, we entered into definitive agreements relating to the Excel Transactions with Excel, pursuant to which we are acquired the 34 Excel Vessels for an aggregate of 29,917,312 common shares and $288.4 million of cash. At the transfer of each Excel Vessel, we paid the cash and share consideration for such Excel Vessel to Excel. We used cash on hand, together with borrowings under various of our credit facilities (described below), to pay the cash consideration for the Excel Vessels. Since late December 2014, we entered into separate agreements with third parties to sell 17 of our vessels (Star Big, Star Mega, Maiden Voyage, Star Natalie, Star Tatianna, Star Christianna, Star Monika, Star Julia, Star Kim, Star Nicole, Rodon, Star Claudia, Indomitable, Magnum Opus, Tsu Ebisu, Deep Blue and Obelix). Of these vessels, 12 were delivered to their purchasers in 2015, while the remaining five (Indomitable, Magnum Opus, Tsu Ebisu, Deep Blue and Obelix) were delivered to their purchasers in early 2016. Additionally, in 2015 and early 2016, we entered into separate agreements with third parties to sell the newbuilding vessels Behemoth, Bruno Marks, Megalodon, Star Aries, Jenmark, and Star Taurus upon their delivery to us from the shipyard. The first four of these vessels were delivered to purchasers in January and February 2016, while the remaining two are expected to be delivered in March 2016 and April 2016, respectively. As of February 29, 2016, the total payments for our ten newbuilding vessels were expected to be $471.8 million, of which we had already paid $112.1 million. As of February 29, 2016, we had obtained commitments for $291.6 million of secured debt for our newbuilding vessels (other than the two newbuilding vessels which will be sold upon their delivery to us). A portion of the net proceeds from our sale of the $50.0 million 2019 Notes, from the January 2015 Equity Offering and the May 2015 Equity Offering will also be used for the financing of our current capital expenditures. The remaining payments for the newbuilding vessels are expected to be paid from cash on hand or from proceeds of additional debt, capital leases or equity financings. As of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding borrowings of $861.8 million, including the $50.0 million under the issued 2019 Notes, of which $96.5 million is scheduled to be repaid in the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding borrowings of $991.3million, including the $50.0 million under the issued 2019 Notes and recognized capital lease obligations of $79.5 million, of which $117.4 million was scheduled to be repaid in the next twelve months (without including the shortfall in the SCR). As of February 29, 2016 we had $175.8 million in cash and outstanding borrowings of $1,016.7 million, including the $50.0 million under the issued 2019 Notes and the amount of $78.8 million under our capital lease obligations. See Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for the outstanding borrowings of each of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, all of which are described below and Notes 5 and 6 for our capital leases. 71 We believe that our current cash balance and our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our 2016 liquidity needs, even though the dry bulk charter market has remained at relatively depressed levels throughout 2013, 2014 and 2015. Since the last quarter of 2014, the dry bulk shipping industry has experienced very low charter rates, and if such rates continue at such levels, our operating cash flows may be adversely affected. As a result, we may be required to sell additional vessels or obtain additional financing (either equity or debt financing) in order to meet our liquidity needs. Our results of operations have been and may in the future be adversely affected if market conditions do not improve. We may fund possible growth through our cash balances, operating cash flows, additional long-term borrowing, capital leases and the issuance of new equity. Our practice has been to acquire dry bulk carriers using a combination of funds from operations and bank debt secured by mortgages on our dry bulk carriers. Our business is capital-intensive and its future success will depend on our ability to maintain a high-quality fleet through the acquisition of newer dry bulk carriers and the selective sale of older dry bulk carriers. These acquisitions will be principally subject to managements expectation of future market conditions as well as our ability to acquire dry bulk carriers on favorable terms. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015, amounted to $208.1 million, compared to $86.0 million as of December 31, 2014. We define working capital as current assets minus current liabilities, including the current portion of long-term debt. Our working capital surplus was $85.1 million as of December 31, 2015, compared to working capital deficit of $5.8 million as of December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we were required to maintain minimum liquidity, not legally restricted, of $150.0 million and $35.4 million, respectively, which is included within Cash and cash equivalents in 2015 and 2014 balance sheets, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we were required to maintain minimum liquidity, legally restricted, of $14.0 million and $14.0 million, respectively, which is included within Restricted cash in the 2015 and 2014 balance sheets, respectively. We believe that our current cash balance and our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs over the next twelve months. Year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $14.6 million while net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $12.8 million.

All of our bank loans bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin. Credit Facility Covenants Our outstanding credit facilities generally contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, on a subsidiary level, including limitations to: ·incur additional indebtedness, including the issuance of guarantees; ·create liens on our assets; 81 ·change the flag, class or management of our vessels or terminate or materially amend the management agreement relating to each vessel; ·sell our vessels; ·merge or consolidate with, or transfer all or substantially all our assets to, another person; or ·enter into a new line of business. Under the DNB–SEB–CEXIM $227.5 million Facility, we are not permitted to pay dividends until December 2017, if our liquid funds are less than (i) $200.0 million in the aggregate or (ii) $2.0 million per fleet vessel. Under certain of our other loan agreements, we are restricted from paying dividends until December 31, 2016. Additionally, we may not pay dividends or distributions if an event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from such dividend or distribution. Furthermore, our credit facilities contain financial covenants requiring us to maintain various financial ratios, including: ·a minimum percentage of aggregate vessel value to loans secured (security cover ratio or SCR); ·a maximum ratio of total liabilities to market value adjusted total assets; ·a minimum EBITDA to interest coverage ratio; ·a minimum liquidity; and ·a minimum equity ratio. In connection with the May 2015 Equity Offering, during the second quarter of 2015, we reached agreements with all our lenders to amend certain financial covenants included in our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2014 and 2015, we were required to maintain minimum liquidity, not legally restricted, of $35.4 million and $150.0 million, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2014 and 2015, we were required to maintain minimum liquidity, legally restricted, of $14.0 million and $14.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, as a result of market conditions, the market value of certain of our vessels was below the minimum SCR required under certain loan agreements. Under the respective loan agreements, the required SCR ranges from 110% to 140%. Based on the appraisal received, the calculated SCR ranged from 91% to 133%. A SCR shortfall does not automatically trigger the acceleration of the corresponding loans or constitute a default under the relevant loan agreements. Under these loan agreements, we may have to prepay the amount drawn under a loan agreement, pay a certain amount to cover the security shortfall or provide additional security to remedy the security shortfall upon request by the relevant lenders. If we fail to take any such requested measures, such circumstances could result in an event of default under our loan agreements. We have not received any notices from the relevant lenders that would indicate their intention to exercise their rights under the SCR provisions of the relevant loan agreements and cause acceleration of respective outstanding loan amounts. As of December 31, 2015, $14.3 million, which was the amount that could be made repayable under the SCR provisions by the lenders, was reclassified as current portion of long term debt within current liabilities. Apart from this, as of December 31, 2014 and 2015, we were in compliance with the applicable financial and other covenants contained in our debt agreements. 2019 Notes On November 6, 2014, we issued $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.00% Senior Notes due 2019 (the 2019 Notes). The net proceeds were $48.4 million. The 2019 Notes mature in November 2019 and are senior, unsecured obligations of Star Bulk Carriers Corp. The 2019 Notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries. The 2019 Notes bear interest at a rate of 8.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th of February, May, August and November of each year, commencing on February 15, 2015. 82 We may redeem the 2019 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time on or after November 15, 2016 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. Prior to November 15, 2016, we may redeem the 2019 Notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium and accrued interest to the date of redemption. In addition, we may redeem the 2019 Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date, if certain events occur involving changes in taxation. The indenture governing the 2019 Notes requires us to maintain a maximum ratio of net debt to consolidated total assets and a minimum consolidated tangible net worth. The indenture governing the 2019 Notes also contains various negative covenants, including a limitation on asset sales and a limitation on restricted payments. The indenture governing the 2019 Notes prevents us from paying dividends if the two above financial ratios are not met. The indenture governing the 2019 Notes also contains other customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes then outstanding may declare the entire principal amount of all the 2019 Notes plus accrued interest, if any, to be immediately due and payable. Upon certain change of control events, we are required to offer to repurchase the 2019 Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption. If we receive net cash proceeds from certain asset sales and do not apply them within a specified deadline, we will be required to apply those proceeds to offer to repurchase the 2019 Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the applicable financial and other covenants contained in the 2019 Notes. Dividend Payments Currently, as mentioned above, we are restricted from paying dividends under certain of our facilities until December 31, 2016.
