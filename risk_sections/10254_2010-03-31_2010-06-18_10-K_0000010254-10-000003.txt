Subsequently obtained information concerning the merits of any property, as well as changes in estimated exploration and development costs and ownership interest, may result in revisions to our expectations and intentions and, thus, we may alter our plans regarding any exploration and development activities. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, those expectations may prove to be incorrect. Disclosure of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, or cautionary statements, are included in our Annual Report on this Form 10-K, including, without limitation, in conjunction with the forward-looking statements. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements.
