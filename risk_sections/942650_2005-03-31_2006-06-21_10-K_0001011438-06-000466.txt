ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS SEVERAL OF THE MATTERS DISCUSSED IN THIS REPORT CONTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM THOSE PROJECTED OR FORECASTED IN THIS REPORT ARE INCLUDED IN THE STATEMENTS BELOW. IN ADDITION TO OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS. THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED BELOW ARE NOT THE ONLY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES WE FACE. ADDITIONAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY DEEM IMMATERIAL ALSO MAY IMPAIR OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS ACTUALLY OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD SUFFER. IN THAT EVENT, THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE, AND YOU MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK. THE RISKS DISCUSSED BELOW ALSO INCLUDE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER SUBSTANTIALLY FROM THOSE DISCUSSED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO BUSINESS OPERATIONS OR REVENUE AND WILL BE REQUIRED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL DEBT OR EQUITY FINANCING TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN. In April 2005 we discontinued all business operations, other than assisting our secured creditor to liquidate its collateral and we currently have no sales or other sources of revenues to generate the cash flows to meet our operating and capital needs, which we expect to be $0.8 million for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2006. As of June 16, 2006, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of $0.1 million and we have no committed sources of funding. Our current forecast projects that our current cash resources will only be sufficient to fund our operations until July 31, 2006. If we do raise additional debt or equity financing we may be forced to liquidate our remaining assets which are insufficient to meet our obligations to our creditors. OUR LACK OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND SIGNIFICANT INDEBTEDNESS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONSUMMATE A MERGER OR OTHER STRATEGIC BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. We currently have no sales or other sources of revenue. Unless we secure additional financing, we may not be able to consumate a merger or other business combination before our existing sources of liquidity are exhausted, in which case we may be forced to liquidate our remaining assets which are to meet our obligations to our creditors. We have and will continue to have a significant amount indebtedness and other obligations. As of June 16, 2006, we had approximately $2.0 million of secured debt and approximately $7.8 million of unsecured debt. Due to our lack of revenue generating operations and significant indebtedness, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms to us, or at all. CONSUMMATION OF THE PROTRON MERGER WILL RESULT IN CHANGE IN OUR VOTING CONTROL. At the effective time of the merger, we will issue 74,353,942 shares of our common stock to the stockholders of Protron, representing 70% of our issued and outstanding shares. As a result the stockholders of Protron will acquire voting control of us and will be able to control the composition of our board of directors and to control all other decisions that may materially affect us. WE HAVE NOT TIMELY FILED QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL REPORTS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION SINCE NOVEMBER 2004. The Company has not filed its quarterly or annual reports required to be filed with the SEC since November 2004, which limits the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to sell our securities in the secondary market. On April 7, 2006, the Company filed its annual report on From 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 and is currently taking action to become current in its reporting obligations but it cannot guarantee that it will do so. If the Company continues to remain delinquent in its filing obligations it may be subject to disciplinarian action by the SEC and may be prevented from trading on the Pink Sheets, LLC. 6 Due to our failure to remain current in our reporting requirements under the Exchange Act, we are prevented from registering additional securities by means of a S-3 registration statement and we will remain ineligible to use this form for a least one year after we become current in our reporting obligations. This increases the difficulty, time and expense for us to register additional securities and reduces our ability to raise additional capital through public sales of our securities. Additionally, our having filed all reports required to be filed pursuant to the Exchange Act, is a condition to the consummation of the merger with Protron. Our failure to file all our public reports by December 31, 2006 will prevent the merger from closing. WE HAVE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING THAT MAY PREVENT US FROM BEING ABLE TO ACCURATELY REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OR PREVENT FRAUD, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable and accurate financial reports and prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed. In our reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004 and our report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, we reported our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in all material respects as of such periods, and had not been effective as of December 31, 2003. We continue to experience significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures, however, we believe that the measures we have implemented in connection with the preparation of this Report, and which are discussed in Item 9A - "Controls and Procedures," have been effective to ensure that our financial statements, and other financial information included in this Report, have been recorded, processed, summarized and reported correctly. We cannot be certain the steps we have taken in connection with the preparation of our past periodic reports (as discussed therein) or this Report and any steps that we may take in connection with the preparation of future periodic reports have been, or will be, effective in identifying and correcting all weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures. As a result our past, current and future periodic reports may contain material errors. Remedying the material weaknesses that have been identified, and any additional deficiencies, significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that we may identify in the future, could require us to incur significant costs, expend significant time and management resources or make other changes. Any delay or failure to design and implement new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation or operation, could harm our ability to consummate a business combination, cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, or prevent us from providing reliable and accurate financial reports or avoiding or detecting fraud. Disclosure of significant deficiencies or material weaknesses or our failure to remediate any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in a timely fashion could cause investors and financing institutions to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on our ability to access capital markets in the future. WE FACE STRONG COMPETITION FOR A MERGER PARTNER. In view of our limited financial resources and personnel, the fact that we are not current in our public filings with the SEC, and the fact that we have a large amount of debt and all of our assets are pledged as collateral to our existing lenders, we will be at a significant competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. Additionally, many of the companies we will be competing with have significantly greater experience, financial and personnel resources, and managerial and technical capabilities WE AND OUR STOCKHOLDERS MAY SUFFER NEGATIVE TAX TREATMENT AS THE RESULT OF ANY BUSINESS COMBINATION. We will endeavor to minimize any negative tax consequences in any merger we may undertake. While we expect to undertake any merger so as to minimize federal and state tax consequences to both us and the "target" company, we can not assure you that a business combination will meet the statutory requirements of a reorganization or that the parties will obtain the intended tax-free treatment upon a transfer of stock or assets. A nonqualifying reorganization could result in the imposition of both federal and state taxes which may have substantial adverse effect on us. 7 WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT IN CONNECTION WITH OUR PURSUIT OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION. There are currently no limitations relating to our ability to borrow funds and we may incur additional debt in our pursuit of consummating a business combination. We can not assure you that any debt financing, if required or otherwise sought, will be available on terms deemed to be commercially acceptable and in our the best interests. The amount and nature of any borrowings by us will depend on numerous considerations, including our capital requirements, our perceived ability to meet debt service on those borrowings, and then-prevailing conditions in the financial markets, as well as general economic conditions. Additionally, to the extent that debt financing ultimately proves to be available, any borrowings may subject us to various risks traditionally associated with incurring indebtedness, including the risks of interest rate fluctuations and insufficient of cash flow to pay principal and interest. Furthermore, any entity with which we may combine may already have previously incurred debt financing and, therefore, the risks inherent thereto, as discussed above. AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE LESS ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE IT IS NOT TRADED ON A RECOGNIZED PUBLIC MARKET. In April 2001, our common stock was de-listed from trading on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market. In May 2005, our common stock was de-listed from trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, and currently trades on the Pink Sheets, LLC. This is viewed by most investors as a less desirable, and less liquid, marketplace. As a result, an investor may find it more difficult to purchase, dispose of and obtain accurate quotations as to the value of our common stock. In addition, since the trading price of our common stock is less than $5.00 per share, trading in our common stock is also subject to the requirements of Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act. Our common stock is also considered a penny stock under the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990, which defines a penny stock, generally, as any equity security not traded on an exchange or quoted on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share. Under Rule 15g-9, brokers who recommend our common stock to persons who are not established customers and accredited investors, as defined in the Exchange Act, must satisfy special sales practice requirements, including requirements that they: o make an individualized written suitability determination for the purchaser; and o receive the purchaser's written consent prior to the transaction. The Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 also requires additional disclosures in connection with any trades involving a penny stock, including the delivery, prior to any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with that market. Such requirements may severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to sell their securities in the secondary market. For all of these reasons, an investment in our equity securities may not be attractive. OUR STOCK PRICE IS VOLATILE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF YOUR INVESTMENT. The market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile. Factors that may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock include the following: o additions or departures of key personnel; o sales of capital stock in the future; o stock liquidity or cash flow constraints; o announcements related to strategic transactions; and o other factors and events beyond our control. 8 In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. As a result of this potential stock price volatility, investors may be unable to sell their shares of our common stock at or above the cost of their purchase prices. In addition, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the object of securities class action litigation. If we were the subject of securities class action litigation, this could result in substantial costs, a diversion of our management's attention and resources and harm to our business and financial condition. FUTURE SALES OF CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING SHARES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE. The market price of our common stock could drop as a result of sales of a large number of shares in the market or in response to the perception that these sales could occur. In addition these sales might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. We have 32,865,975 shares of common stock outstanding as of June 16, 2006. In addition, as of June 16, 2006, we had approximately 27,976,000 shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under warrants, stock options and convertible notes. WE DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT AUTHORIZED SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK We have only 50,000,000 shares of common stock authorized for issuance. As of June 16, 2005, we had 32,865,975 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and approximately 27,976,000 shares of our common stock are issuable upon the exercise of warrants and options or the conversion of certain convertible promissory notes. The number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants and options or the conversion of certain convertible promissory notes fluctuates depending upon the current trading price of common stock. In order to provide us the flexibility to raise additional equity, to consummate the proposed merger with Protron or even to have sufficient shares for our existing financial instruments, we will need to amend our certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares, which would require the approval of our existing stockholders. We are uncertain that we could obtain this approval based on the dilutive effect of the issuance of additional shares of our common stock. Any failure to obtain this approval could adversely affect us and the market for our common stock. WE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK, AND THEREFORE OUR STOCKHOLDERS WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER THEIR INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK, IF AT ALL, ONLY BY SELLING THE SHARES OF OUR STOCK THAT THEY HOLD. Some investors favor companies that pay dividends on common stock. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently have no operations and we intend to retain any future earnings to pay our existing liabilities and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Because we may not pay dividends, a return on an investment in our stock likely depends on the ability to sell our stock at a profit. ITEM1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. Not applicable.
