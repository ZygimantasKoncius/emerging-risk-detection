BUSINESS General As used herein, the terms we, us, our or the company refer to Columbia Equity Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and our subsidiaries, including Columbia Equity, LP, a Virginia limited partnership (our Operating Partnership), and, when the context applies, Columbia Equity Trust, Inc. Predecessor (Columbia Predecessor), our predecessor. Columbia Equity Trust, Inc. is a self-advised and self-managed real estate company. We focus primarily on acquiring, renovating, repositioning, developing, owning, managing and operating commercial office properties in the Greater Washington, D.C. area. As of December 31, 2005, we:  owned interests in 17 commercial office properties consisting of approximately 2.5 million square feet and one development property, including:  100% fee simple ownership in eight properties totaling approximately 831,000 square feet of net rentable area;  a 100% leasehold interest in an approximately 126,000 square foot office building in North Rockville, Maryland (the property is subject to a ground lease with a remaining term, including extension options, of 70 years);  partial interests ranging from 9% to 50% in eight office properties totaling approximately 1.6 million square feet of net rentable area; and  an 8.1% joint venture interest in an approximately 115,000 square foot office building development adjacent to our Independence Center I property.  provided asset management services to related parties for three office buildings containing approximately 690,000 net rentable square feet and two hotel properties containing approximately 610 rooms. We were formed in September 2004 and commenced operations on July 5, 2005 after completing our initial public offering (IPO). Our IPO consisted of the sale of 13,800,000 shares of common stock, including 1,800,000 shares sold pursuant to the underwriters exercise of an over-allotment option. The offering price was $15.00 per share resulting in gross proceeds of $207,000,000. The proceeds to us, net of underwriters discount, financial advisory fees and other offering expenses, were approximately $188.4 million. In connection with our IPO, we completed certain formation transactions pursuant to which we acquired interests in 13 properties and five asset management agreements (collectively, the Formation Transactions), which we completed on July 15, 2005. Upon completion of the IPO, we succeeded to the commercial office property business of Carr Capital Corporation (Carr Capital), a recognized owner and operator of commercial office properties in the Greater Washington, D.C. area. Carr Capital was founded in 1994 by our chairman, president and chief executive officer, Oliver T. Carr, III, and our senior vice president and director of acquisitions, Clinton D. Fisch. We own all of our interests in our properties and conduct all our business through Columbia Equity, LP, our operating partnership. At December 31, 2005, we were the general partner of, and owned a 92.8% interest in, Columbia Equity, LP. Our senior management team has an average of over 18 years of individual experience in real estate and capital markets, including substantial experience investing in, acquiring, financing, repositioning, managing and leasing office properties and raising equity and debt capital. We intend to elect to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code, effective for our short taxable year ended on December 31, 2005, upon filing our federal income tax return for that year. We have formed Columbia TRS Corporation, or Columbia TRS, as a taxable REIT subsidiary. We 2 conduct asset management, development and other activities through Columbia TRS to the extent necessary to maintain our REIT status. The income of our taxable REIT subsidiaries is subject to taxation at normal corporate rates. 2005 Highlights Since Our Initial Public Offering The following is a summary of our significant events for the period July 5, 2005 through December 31, 2005:  During July 2005, the joint venture that owns Independence Center I, an approximately 275,002 net rentable square foot commercial office building in Chantilly, Virginia, commenced development on Independence Center II, an approximately 115,000 net rentable square foot office building adjacent to Independence Center I. The total cost of the development is expected to be approximately $24.5 million. In October 2005, a separate joint venture was formed to own Independence Center II. We maintain an 8.1% ownership interest in the Independence Center II joint venture. The equity required to capitalize our share of the Independence Center II joint venture was approximately $713,000 and funded through proceeds from our IPO. The remaining costs of the project are expected to be funded through a $15.7 million construction loan that the joint venture closed in October 2005. As of December 31, 2005, approximately $7.5 million, or 31%, of total joint venture project costs had been expended. The project is expected to be completed in September 2006.  On August 23, 2005, we completed the acquisition of 14700 Lee Road in Fairfax, Virginia for a purchase price of approximately $24.0 million, net of transaction costs. The acquisition was funded 100% with proceeds from our IPO. The property contains approximately 85,000 net rentable square feet of space and was 100% leased to one tenant as of December 31, 2005.  On September 29, 2005 we completed the acquisition of a 100% leasehold interest in the Park Plaza II office building in Rockville, Maryland for a purchase price of $35.0 million, net of transaction costs. The acquisition was funded 100% with proceeds from our IPO. The property contains approximately 126,000 net rentable square feet of space and was 98% leased to seven tenants as of December 31, 2005. The property is subject to a ground lease with a remaining term, including extension options, of 70 years.  On November 28, 2005, we closed on a $75,000,000 secured, revolving credit facility, which we use to finance acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes. We refer to this secured revolving credit facility in this Annual Report as our credit facility.  On December 1, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Patrick Henry Corporate Center in Newport News, Virginia for a purchase price of $14.5 million, net of transaction costs. The transaction was funded with proceeds from our IPO and the assumption of an $8.5 million mortgage loan which bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.02% and matures in April 2009. The property contains approximately 99,000 net rentable square feet of space and the property was 92% leased to ten tenants as of December 31, 2005.  On December 7, 2005, we entered into a material definitive agreement to acquire Georgetown Plaza, a five-story, approximately 151,000 square foot multi-tenant office and retail building located in Washington, D.C. for approximately $23,500,000. The ownership of Georgetown Plaza is subject to a ground lease which expires in December 2058. We expect to fund the transaction with proceeds from our revolving line of credit and the assumption of an approximately $16.1 million mortgage loan which bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.78% and matures in June 2013. The purchase of Georgetown Plaza is subject to customary closing conditions, including the satisfactory completion by us of a due diligence review during our inspection periods.  On December 9, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Oakton Corporate Center in Oakton, Virginia for a purchase price of $16.0 million, net of transaction costs. The transaction was funded with borrowings under our credit facility. The property contains approximately 65,000 net rentable square feet of space and was 100% leased to three tenants as of December 31, 2005. 3  Since our IPO through December 31, 2005, we have declared aggregate dividends on our common stock and distributions on our operating partnership units of $0.26 per common share and unit, representing a dividend of $0.12 for the third quarter that was paid in October 2005, and a dividend of $0.14 for the fourth quarter that was paid in January 2006. The fourth quarter dividend of $0.14 is equivalent to an annualized dividend of $0.56 per share and unit. Subsequent Events On January 12, 2006, we completed the acquisition of 1025 Vermont Avenue in Washington, D.C. for a purchase price of approximately $34.1 million, net of transaction costs. The transaction was funded with borrowings under our credit facility and the assumption of a $19.0 million mortgage loan which bears interest at 4.91% and matures in January 2010. Subsequent to the closing of the acquisition, the lender for the mortgage loan advanced an additional $3.5 million in loan proceeds resulting in an outstanding balance of $22.5 million. Concurrent with the increase in loan proceeds, the interest rate was re-set to a fixed rate of 5.11%. The additional loan proceeds were used to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility. The property contains approximately 115,000 net rentable square feet of space and was 97% leased to 27 tenants at the time of acquisition. On February 16, 2006, we completed a $24.3 million, ten-year mortgage financing at a rate of 5.53% per annum that matures in March 2016. The financing requires monthly payments of interest-only at a fixed interest rate of 5.53% through March 2012 and monthly payments of principal and interest from April 2012 through February 2016 based on a fixed interest rate of 5.53% and a 360 month amortization schedule. The financing is secured by our leasehold interest in Park Plaza II. On March 15, 2006, we entered into a material definitive agreement to acquire a two-story, approximately 41,400 square foot office building (the Chubb Building) located in Reston, Virginia for $11,575,000. The property is subject to a mortgage loan with an outstanding principal balance of approximately $7.4 million which bears interest at a fixed rate of 8.28% and matures in February 2010. We expect to fund the transaction with proceeds from our revolving line of credit and either the assumption of the existing mortgage financing or with new mortgage financing. The property includes additional land for development. The purchase of the Chubb Building is subject to customary closing conditions, including the satisfactory completion of a due diligence review during its inspection periods. Our Business Strategy Our goal is to generate attractive, long-term risk-adjusted investment returns for our stockholders through:  Investing in Small-to-Medium Size Office Buildings. We invest principally in small-to-medium size office properties with an initial cost between $10 million and $60 million as we believe these properties present opportunities for attractive, risk-adjusted returns due to the lower degree of institutional focus on this segment of the office market.  Selective and Strategic Geographic Focus. We focus primarily on the Greater Washington, D.C. commercial office property market to take advantage of the strong economic and demographic characteristics of that market, leverage our local market expertise and relationships and create economies of scale through the clustering of properties.  Intensive and Efficient Asset Management. We intensively manage each of our properties through active property leasing and targeted capital improvements, which may include re-positioning or redeveloping certain properties, while maintaining efficiency through the outsourcing of non-strategic property functions.  Strategic Joint Ventures. We selectively enter into joint ventures where appropriate to leverage our equity returns through fees and disproportionate cash flow distributions, as well as manage the risks associated with certain properties that may be inappropriate to wholly own due to size or vacancy levels. 4  Recycling Capital. We evaluate individual properties in our portfolio to assess their future potential growth against current market values. If we believe that we have maximized a propertys value potential, we will look to sell or recapitalize the property and reinvest the profit generated from the sale or recapitalization into new investments that offer improved earnings potential for our stockholders.  Maintain Investment Flexibility. When the market for new acquisitions remains competitive, we will consider allocating additional capital into development and alternative investment structures, including, equity joint ventures and mezzanine debt, which may offer investment yields above those provided through wholly owned property acquisitions. In addition, we will consider investments in contiguous markets, as well as investments in mixed-use properties, that provide an appropriate investment yield premium. Our Acquisition and Development Strategy We follow a disciplined approach to evaluating investment opportunities, targeting office investment opportunities that are priced attractively relative to comparable properties, offer the potential for long-term value creation, and generate above-market earnings. We also concentrate our efforts on acquiring properties that may present complex ownership or tax structures, that if overcome, can offer a return premium for our investors. Our investment strategy focuses on office properties that fall generally into one of the following two categories: value-added and core. We generally define value-added office properties to be properties which have: (1) a moderate-to-high risk profile due to current vacancy levels or a relatively high level of near-term lease expirations, (2) a lower percentage of investment returns received from current income, and (3) greater potential for near-to-intermediate-term capital appreciation as compared to a core property, described below. The additional risk associated with value-added investments generally results from identifiable issues such as market inefficiencies or historically substandard management. We generally will acquire a value-added property only if it meets the following investment criteria:  recovering sub-market fundamentals;  in-place rents below market with ability to re-lease at market rents during the holding period; and  ability to reposition the asset through pro-active leasing, targeted capital improvements, management and/or recapitalization strategies. We generally define core office properties to be properties which have: (1) a lower risk profile due to limited near-term leasing risk, (2) a higher percentage of investment return received from current income, and (3) the ability to generate long-term capital appreciation. We generally will acquire a core property only if it meets the following investment criteria:  significant in-place occupancies;  limited lease rollover exposure; and  attractive valuation to competing properties on a relative basis. We selectively pursue development opportunities where we believe such opportunities will result in a favorable risk-adjusted return on investment. In general, we commence development primarily when economic conditions are favorable and the development site is located in a stable sub-market where demand for office space currently exceeds, or is expected to exceed within the development time horizon, available space. We rely on our management teams extensive market knowledge and long-standing business and personal relationships in the Greater Washington, D.C. office market to identify commercial office properties for 5 acquisition or development. Upon acquisition, we aggressively manage each property in accordance with a strategic plan developed during our pre-acquisition due diligence. Our Operating Strategy We self-manage our portfolio, meaning that we retain the decision making authority and strategic planning responsibility for the assets that we own. We have also entered into a non-exclusive arrangement with the Trammell Crow Company, one of the largest diversified commercial real estate services companies in the United States, to perform routine day-to-day property functions for certain of our properties. Our arrangement with the Trammell Crow Company is cancelable on 30 days notice by either party and provides that the Trammell Crow Company is responsible, with our oversight, for all property level accounting, risk management (insurance), lease administration and physical maintenance and repairs. We believe this structure is optimal for a firm of our size as it is scalable and enables us to integrate newly acquired properties without incurring upfront personnel costs. As of December 31, 2005, Trammell Crow provided property management services for 15 of our 17 properties. Leasing for our portfolio is assigned on a property-by-property basis to third-party brokerage firms based on their demonstrated track record and knowledge of the sub-markets in which our properties are located. Target Markets Our primary market is the Greater Washington, D.C. area which comprises, as of December 31, 2005, the third largest office market in the United States, with approximately 370 million square feet of commercial office space in over 5,600 individual office properties in the following regions:  the District of Columbia;  Northern Virginia, including, but not limited, to Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, Prince William and Stafford counties, and all the cities included within these counties; and  Suburban Maryland, including, but not limited, to Montgomery, Prince Georges, Calvert, Charles and Frederick counties, and all the cities included within these counties. As the home of the U.S. Government, the Greater Washington, D.C. area is one of the countrys primary centers for national and international business, law and politics. The federal governments presence provides stability for the economy through both direct employment and the procurement of goods and services, and generates approximately one-third of the areas gross regional product, serving as a powerful generator of employment and income and tempering the negative impact of national economic cycles on the region. Owing to its highly educated work force, the regions economy is diversified further by an extensive professional and business services market which includes concentrations of knowledge-based firms in biotechnology, telecommunications, computer, information services, management services, media and data communications. In addition to the Greater Washington, D.C. area, we also consider investments in contiguous markets that offer attractive economic fundamentals. We broadly define these contiguous markets as extending from Baltimore, Maryland to the Hampton Roads market in Virginia. At December 31, 2005, we owned one property, Patrick Henry Corporate Center in Newport News, Virginia, located outside the Greater Washington, D.C. area. Competition The commercial real estate market is highly competitive. We compete with other REITs, other public and private real estate companies, and private real estate investors in acquiring properties. Many of these entities have greater resources than we do or other competitive advantages. We also face competition in leasing or subleasing space available at our properties to prospective tenants. 6 Properties At December 31, 2005, we maintained ownership interests in 17 commercial office properties containing an aggregate of approximately 2.5 million net rentable square feet of space and one development property.

Environmental Matters Under various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, a current or previous owner, operator or tenant of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases or threats of releases at such property, and may be held liable to a government entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation, cleanup and monitoring costs incurred by such parties in connection with the actual or threatened contamination. Such laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to fault, or whether or not the owner, operator or tenant knew of or caused the presence of the contamination. The liability under such laws may be joint and several for the full amount of the investigation, cleanup and monitoring costs incurred or to be incurred or actions to be undertaken, although a party held jointly and severally liable may obtain contributions from other identified, solvent, responsible parties for their fair share toward these costs. These costs may be substantial, and can exceed the value of the property. The presence of contamination, or the failure to properly remediate contamination, on such property may adversely affect the ability of the owner, operator or tenant to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral, and may adversely impact our investment in that property. 10 Federal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a buildings management to identify and warn, via signs and labels, of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to installed asbestos-containing materials and potentially asbestos-containing materials in their building. The regulations also set forth employee training, record keeping and due diligence requirements pertaining to asbestos-containing materials and potentially asbestos-containing materials. Significant fines can be assessed for violation of these regulations. Building owners and those exercising control over a buildings management may be subject to an increased risk of personal injury lawsuits by workers and others exposed to asbestos-containing materials and potentially asbestos-containing materials as a result of the regulations. The regulations may affect the value of a building containing asbestos-containing materials and potentially asbestos-containing materials in which we have invested. Federal, state and local laws and regulations also govern the removal, encapsulation, disturbance, handling and/or disposal of asbestos-containing materials and potentially asbestos-containing materials when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction, remodeling, renovation or demolition of a building. Such laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release to the environment of asbestos-containing materials and potentially asbestos-containing materials and may provide for fines to, and for third parties to seek recovery from, owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with asbestos-containing materials and potentially asbestos-containing materials. Prior to closing any property acquisition, if appropriate, we obtain such environmental assessments as may be prudent in order to attempt to identify potential environmental concerns at such properties. These assessments are carried out in accordance with an appropriate level of due diligence and generally may include a physical site inspection, a review of relevant federal, state and local environmental and health agency database records, one or more interviews with appropriate site-related personnel, review of the propertys chain of title and review of historic aerial photographs or other information on past uses of the property. We may also conduct limited subsurface investigations and test for substances of concern where the results of the first phase of the environmental assessments or other information indicates possible contamination or where our consultants recommend such procedures. We believe that our properties are in compliance in all material respects with all federal and state regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters. We have not been notified by any governmental authority of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matter in connection with any of our properties. Regulation Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. The tenants are generally responsible for any additional amounts required to conform their construction projects to the ADA. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect. Insurance Our properties are covered by comprehensive liability, casualty, flood and rental loss insurance. We believe that the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice, and that our properties are covered adequately by insurance. Our properties are also covered by terrorism insurance. Although we believe our properties are adequately covered by insurance, we cannot predict at this time if we will be able to obtain appropriate coverage at a reasonable cost in the future. 11 Employees As of March 15, 2006, we had 12 employees. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. Available Information We maintain a website, http://www.columbiareit.com, which contains additional information concerning our company.

RISK FACTORS Investing in our company involves various risks, including the risk that you might lose your entire investment. The following discussion concerns some of the risks associated with our business. These risks are interrelated, and you should treat them as a whole. The risks described below are not the only risks that may affect us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or not identified below may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Risk Related to Our Business and Properties Substantially all of our properties are located in the Greater Washington, D.C. area, making us vulnerable to changes in economic conditions in that region, including the adverse impact of decreased government spending. Substantially all of our properties are located in the Greater Washington, D.C. area which exposes us to greater economic risks than if we owned properties in several geographic regions. The economic condition of this region may depend on one or more industries and, therefore, an economic downturn in one of these industry sectors may significantly affect the occupancy, rental rates and value of our properties. In particular, economic conditions in our market are directly affected by federal government spending. Any resulting oversupply or reduced demand for commercial office space in the Greater Washington, D.C. area would therefore have a disproportionate negative impact on our profitability and limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. During the past year, the United States Department of Defense has indicated that it plans to reduce the amount of space that it leases within the Greater Washington, D.C. area, which may result in a significant reduction in the demand for leased office space in certain sub-markets. Specifically, in May 2005, the Department of Defense recommended that the Missile Defense Agency be relocated to the Redstone Arsenal in Alabama as part of the Base Realignment and Closure initiative (BRAC). The General Services Administration leases approximately 144,551 square feet of space at the Suffolk Building for use by the Missile Defense Agency, representing approximately 56% of the propertys square footage. In addition, TKC Communications, under an exclusive contract with the Missile Defense Agency, leases the remaining 112,874 square feet in the Suffolk Building, representing approximately 44% of the propertys square footage. These leases represent approximately 7.2% of our pro rata share of annualized base rent at December 31, 2005. If the BRAC recommendation for vacating the Suffolk Building is followed, it is unlikely that TKC Communications will renew its lease upon expiration on June 30, 2009. It is also likely that the General Services Administration will elect to terminate its lease, pursuant to the terms of the lease, at any time after December 16, 2010, upon six months notice. If we are unable to locate suitable replacement tenants for the Suffolk Building, our profitability and ability to make distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected. Our executive officers have limited experience operating a public company or a REIT, which could increase our general and administrative costs and reduce our cash available for distributions. Our senior executive officers have limited experience operating a public company or a REIT. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions. In addition, managing a public company requires compliance with numerous laws and regulations which may not be applicable to a private company. As a result, we may initially incur higher general and administrative expenses than our competitors that are managed by persons with experience operating a public company or a REIT, which would reduce our net income and cash available for distribution. 13 We have experienced, and expect to experience in the future, significant growth and may not be able to adapt our management and operational systems to properly integrate additional properties without unanticipated significant disruption or expense. In connection with our formation transactions, we acquired 13 properties in July 2005 and have subsequently acquired five additional properties and an interest in a development property, and we intend to make a significant number of investments in office properties in the future. As a result of our recent and anticipated future growth, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adapt our management, administrative, accounting and operational systems or hire and retain sufficient operational staff to integrate and manage any future acquisitions of additional properties without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs. Our future acquisitions will generate additional operating expenses that we will be required to pay. As we acquire additional properties, we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties, including tenant retention and mortgage default. In addition, acquisitions may cause disruptions in our operations and divert managements attention away from day-to-day operations, which could impair our relationships with our current tenants and employees. Our failure to successfully integrate any future property acquisitions into our portfolio could cause significant disruption or costs, which in turn could reduce our profitability and limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. We may be unable to renew expiring leases, lease vacant space or re-lease space on a timely basis or on comparable or better terms, which could significantly decrease our cash flow. Leases representing approximately 6.2% of our annualized contractual base rent on a pro rata basis at December 31, 2005 expire on or before December 31, 2006. Current tenants may not renew their leases upon the expiration of their terms. Alternatively, current tenants may attempt to terminate their leases prior to the expiration of their current terms. If non-renewals or terminations occur, we may not be able to locate qualified replacement tenants and, as a result, we could lose a significant source of revenue while remaining responsible for the payment of our obligations. Moreover, the terms of a renewal or new lease may be less favorable than the current lease terms. Any of these factors could cause a decline in lease revenue, which could have a negative impact on our profitability and limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. We may be impacted by our tenants failure to make lease payments, which could cause a significant decrease in our revenues. Our tenants may experience a downturn in their businesses, which may weaken their financial condition, result in their failure to make timely rental payments or their default under their leases. In particular, local economic conditions and factors affecting the industries in which our tenants operate may affect our tenants ability to make lease payments to us. From time to time, one or more tenants may be in default under their leases with us. Currently, tenants representing an immaterial amount of lease revenue at our properties are in default under their leases. Upon a tenant default, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment. We cannot assure you that our tenants will not default on their leases and fail to make rental payments to us or that existing tenants in default will cure such default. Moreover, we may be unable to locate a replacement tenant in a timely manner or on comparable or better terms if a tenant defaults on its lease. The loss of rental revenues from a number of our tenants and our inability to replace such tenants may negatively impact our profitability and our ability to meet our financial obligations. Properties owned in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on our co-venturers financial condition and disputes between us and our co-venturers. As of March 15, 2006, we had investments in eight joint ventures, none of which we control. We may also co-invest in the future with third parties through partnerships, joint ventures or other entities, acquiring non-controlling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a property, partnership, joint 14 venture or other entity. These investments involve risks not present with a property wholly owned by us. Risks related to these investments include:  one or more of our partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions (in which event we and any other remaining general partners, members or co-venturers would generally remain liable for the liabilities of the partnership, joint venture or other entity);  one or more of our partners or co-venturers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals;  one or more of our partners or co-venturers may be in a position to take actions contrary to our instructions, requests, policies or objectives (including those related to our qualification as a REIT for tax purposes);  disputes between us and our partners or co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business; or  most of our joint venture agreements contain provisions that could require us to buy our partners interest or sell our interest or the property or project at a time we do not deem favorable for financial or other reasons, including the availability of cash at such time and the impact of tax consequences resulting from any sale. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in partnerships, limited liability companies or joint ventures. The occurrence of one or more of the events described above could cause unanticipated significant disruption to our operations or unanticipated costs and liability, which could in turn adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow and thereby limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Ownership interests in our joint ventures generally are non-transferable to unaffiliated third parties unless all partners consent to the transfer. Pursuant to our joint venture agreements for three of our properties, a change in control of our company is defined as a non-transferable event requiring the prior consent of our joint venture partners. As a result, the ownership interest transfer restrictions pursuant to the joint venture agreements for these three properties may have the effect of discouraging a third party from acquiring us, which could result in our stockholders receiving less than our then-prevailing market price. If The Barlow Corporation fails to qualify as a REIT, we may fail to qualify as a REIT. As part of our formation transactions in July 2005, we acquired a 40% interest in a limited liability company that owns more than 99% of The Barlow Corporation, which owns the Barlow Building. The Barlow Corporation will elect to be taxed as a REIT for its taxable year ended December 31, 2005. If The Barlow Corporation fails to qualify as a REIT, we would fail to qualify as a REIT, unless we qualified for certain statutory relief provisions. Any such failure to qualify also may prevent us from qualifying as a REIT for any of the following four taxable years. The substantial corporate tax on built-in gain that would be recognized in connection with a sale of the Barlow Building before December 31, 2010 would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution to our stockholders. The Barlow Building is owned by The Barlow Corporation, which prior to our acquisition of a 40% interest in such entity, was a subchapter S corporation. In connection with our acquisition, through a joint venture interest, of a 40% interest in The Barlow Corporation, the subchapter S election was terminated. The Barlow Corporation will make an election to be taxed as a REIT for the taxable year ended December 31, 2005. If The Barlow Corporation disposes of the Barlow Building in a taxable transaction before December 31, 2010, The Barlow Corporation will pay a substantial corporate level tax on its built-in gain (approximately $40 million) that existed when The Barlow Corporation made the S election. That corporate level tax would 15 reduce the funds that The Barlow Corporation has to distribute to the limited liability company in which we own a 40% interest and, in turn, would reduce the funds that we have available for distribution to our stockholders. We could recognize a substantial amount of taxable income in connection with a sale of the Barlow Building. We acquired our interest in the Barlow Building in our formation transactions through an investment in a 40% interest in a limited liability company that owns more than 99% of the outstanding shares of The Barlow Corporation. A subsidiary of the limited liability company merged into The Barlow Corporation in a cash merger that is treated for tax purposes as the acquisition by the joint venture of the shares of The Barlow Corporation. As a result, the tax basis of the Barlow Building was not stepped up to fair market value and is substantially below the price paid for the Barlow Building. Due to the low tax basis on the Barlow Building, if The Barlow Corporation disposes of the Barlow Building in a taxable transaction, we would recognize a substantial amount of taxable income that could exceed our share of the net cash proceeds from the sale. Furthermore, because the other investors in The Barlow Corporation are tax-exempt investors, such investors will likely be less sensitive to the tax implications of a sale of the Barlow Building and may seek a sale of the Barlow Building by The Barlow Corporation, even if such a sale is not in our best interest. In order to avoid the adverse tax impact of a sale of the Barlow Building by The Barlow Corporation, our most efficient liquidity event with respect to our investment in the Barlow Building will be a sale of our limited liability company interests in the joint venture that owns more than 99% of the outstanding stock of The Barlow Corporation or the limited liability companys sale of the stock of The Barlow Corporation. Our interests in the limited liability company or the stock of The Barlow Corporation may not be readily marketable. There can be no assurance that our joint venture partner will honor its obligations to purchase our interests in the limited liability company or that the price we will receive for such interests will represent fair value. The representations and warranties in the merger agreement for the Barlow Building did not survive closing and we may have no recourse against the sellers for breaches of the representations and warranties or unknown liabilities. In our formation transactions, we acquired a 40% interest in a limited liability company that formed a subsidiary to merge with The Barlow Corporation. The Barlow Corporation owns the Barlow Building and survived the merger. Prior to the merger, The Barlow Corporation had elected to be taxed as an S corporation. The Barlow Corporation made certain representations and warranties as to its tax status and other matters in the merger agreement. However, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the representations and warranties of The Barlow Corporation did not survive the closing of the merger. As a result, neither we nor the limited liability company in which we invested have recourse against the stockholders of The Barlow Corporation for breaches of representations and warranties in the merger agreement which may become known since the closing of the merger. Specifically, The Barlow Corporation was organized over 40 years ago, and, while its current principal business is ownership of the Barlow Building, The Barlow Corporation has been engaged in other businesses and had other assets and liabilities during its history, and there can be no assurance that there are no contingent or unknown liabilities that survived the merger, including tax liabilities for failure to qualify as an S corporation. Contingent and unknown liabilities of The Barlow Corporation could adversely affect the value of our investment in the Barlow Building. We compete with other parties for tenants and property acquisitions, and many of these parties have substantially greater resources than we have. Our business strategy contemplates expansion through acquisition. The commercial real estate industry is highly competitive, and we compete with substantially larger companies, including substantially larger REITs, for the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. Some of these companies are national or regional operators with far greater resources than we have. Competition may make it more difficult or costly for us to make suitable investments on favorable terms in the future. Competition in a particular area also could 16 negatively impact our ability to lease our properties or to increase or maintain rental rates. If we are unable to make suitable investments on favorable terms, experience lower occupancy or are unable to increase or maintain rental rates, our returns on investment and profitability may be reduced. We may not be successful in identifying suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria, which may impede our growth. A central part of our business strategy is expansion through acquisitions, which requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy. We may not be successful in identifying suitable real estate properties or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in completing acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms. Failure to identify or complete acquisitions could slow our growth, which could in turn reduce the amount of cash available for distributions to our stockholders. We may invest in properties in other real estate markets outside the Greater Washington, D.C. area where we have no experience. We currently own only one property outside the Greater Washington, D.C. area in Newport News, Virginia. We may make additional selected acquisitions or develop properties outside our focus market of Greater Washington, D.C. from time to time as appropriate opportunities arise. Our historical experience primarily is in the Greater Washington, D.C. market, and we may not be able to operate successfully in other market areas. We may be exposed to a variety of risks if we continue to invest in new markets, including:  a lack of market knowledge and understanding of the local economies;  an inability to identify promising acquisition or development opportunities;  an inability to obtain qualified development and construction personnel; and  an unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures. Any of these factors could cause us to incur costs greater than anticipated outside our focus market and limit the success of our acquisition and development strategy, which could in turn reduce our profitability and limit our growth. Certain of the joint venture agreements to which we are a party restrict our ability to make investments within geographic markets in which the joint venture owns property which could restrict our ability to make attractive investments. Our joint venture agreements with JP Morgan Investment Management, Inc., or JPMIM, contain provisions that restrict our ability to engage in new business ventures, including acquisitions or developments of commercial office properties, within specified market areas in proximity to the property owned by the joint venture. In particular, we cannot undertake investments or development of properties within these specific areas unless we first offer the investment opportunity to JPMIM on terms similar to those in our existing joint ventures with JPMIM. As a result, we may be unable to pursue attractive investment opportunities on a wholly owned basis or with other joint venture partners in these specified areas, which may limit our acquisition and development activities in attractive sub-markets within the greater Washington, D.C. area. Development and construction risks could adversely affect our profitability. We may selectively develop new properties in the future. Our renovation, redevelopment, development and related construction activities may subject us to the risk of being unable to obtain, or suffer delays obtaining, necessary leases permits or authorizations, unexpected construction costs and inability to obtain financing on favorable terms. Additionally, the time frame required for development, construction and lease-up of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns. Because we are required to make cash 17 distributions to our stockholders, if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions. Newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect, which could harm our overall financial performance. In deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property, we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property. In particular, we estimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy and rental rates. If our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate, and the property is unable to achieve the expected occupancy and rental rates, it may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment. When we acquire a property, we often plan to reposition or redevelop that property with the goal of increasing profitability. Our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate, which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals. Additionally, we may acquire new properties not fully leased, and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with that property. Any of these factors could result in our overpayment for a property, which could in turn reduce our profitability and returns on investment. We have agreements for the management of certain of our properties, for certain corporate and administrative services and for corporate headquarters space. The termination of one or more of these agreements could cause us to pay higher costs for those services and office space. In June 2004, we entered into a non-exclusive arrangement with the Trammell Crow Company to perform all routine day-to-day property management functions for certain of our properties. Under individual property management agreements, the Trammell Crow Company is responsible, with our oversight, for all property level accounting, risk management (insurance), lease administration, and physical maintenance and repairs. The joint venture that owns the 1575 Eye Street property, in which we own an interest, has an agreement with CarrAmerica Realty Corporation to provide property management and leasing services. A sibling of our chairman, president and chief executive officer is chairman and chief executive officer of CarrAmerica Realty Corporation. We also have an agreement with The Oliver Carr Company, which is owned by the father of our chairman, president and chief executive officer, for office space and certain administrative functions. If one or all of these agreements are terminated, we could face a substantial disruption in our operations and an increase in costs incurred for management of our properties, for certain corporate and administrative services and for corporate headquarters space. Such an increase could negatively impact our financial condition and limit the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders. Our debt service obligations may have a negative impact on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, pursue our business plan and maintain our REIT status and our management and board of directors have discretion to increase the amount of our outstanding debt at any time without approval of our stockholders. We do not have a policy limiting the amount of debt that we may incur, although we have established 55%  60% as the target range for our total debt-to-market capitalization, including our pro rata share of joint venture debt. Accordingly, our management and board of directors have discretion to increase the amount of our outstanding debt at any time without approval by our stockholders. As of December 31, 2005, our total indebtedness was approximately $126.9 million, including our pro rata share of joint venture indebtedness, and we may incur significant additional debt to finance future acquisition and development activities. Many of our debt obligations will require lump-sum principal payments in the future instead of, or in addition to, periodic principal payments pursuant to a fixed amortization schedule. Payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash resources to operate our properties or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our REIT qualification. 18 If we were to default on our secured debt in the future, the loss of any property securing the debt would adversely affect our business. A substantial portion of our debt is currently secured by first mortgage deeds of trust on our properties. Our cash flow may be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest on our debt. Any default in payment of our indebtedness or violation of any covenants in our loan documents could result in our debt obligations being immediately due and payable and possible loss of property to foreclosure. A default under a loan with cross default provisions could result in default on other indebtedness. For tax purposes, a foreclosure on any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage. If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure but would not receive any cash proceeds which could hinder our ability to meet the REIT distribution requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. Our debt agreements impose limits on our operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. The agreements relating to the debt we have incurred contain financial and operating covenants, including net worth requirements, debt service coverage and other debt ratios, and other limitations on our ability to make distributions or other payments to our stockholders, sell assets or engage in mergers, consolidations or make certain investments or acquisitions. Failure to comply with these covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations, incurrence of debt or changes in general economic conditions. Borrowings under our credit facility are subject to borrowing base requirements and other covenants. These covenants may restrict our ability to fund our operations and conduct our business. Failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of our debt agreements. A default could cause one or more of our lenders to accelerate the timing of payments which could force us to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms. Variable rate debt subjects us to interest rate risk. We have a revolving credit facility that bears interest at a variable rate. We may incur additional variable rate debt in the future. If so, increases in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase our interest expense, which could reduce our net earnings and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to our stockholders. If we originate mezzanine loans, it will subject us to the unique risks of a mezzanine lender, including the risk associated with having a subordinated position relative to other creditors with respect to the collateral underlying the loans we make or acquire. We may originate mezzanine loans that take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property. Because the investment may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender, these types of investments involve a higher degree of risk than long-term senior mortgage loans secured by income producing real property. In the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security, we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity, or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan. If a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt. As a result, we may not recover some or all of our investment. In addition, mezzanine loans may have higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal. A mezzanine lender has some of the same risks as a traditional real estate lender such as lender liability. In addition, a mezzanine lender may increase these risks by pursuing remedies on default that afford greater control over the operations of the borrower, especially if the mezzanine lender exercises its authority as a 19 managing or co-managing member. Courts have discretion to decline to enforce loan features that purport to limit or modify a mortgagors right to redeem real estate after a mortgage default and before foreclosure by paying off the loan, and thus some remedies specified in our mezzanine loans may be unavailable to us. In addition, a borrower may allege that being in the position to control the borrowing entity creates duties by the lender to the borrower, including fiduciary-like duties that may conflict with the lenders actions to exercise its remedies. Finally, to be able to protect its mezzanine loan, a mezzanine lender may have to advance additional funds to cure defaults on senior loans. In such circumstances, we may incur additional costs and allocate resources that divert attention from our core operations. Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure We may experience conflicts of interest with our chairman, president and chief executive officer and certain of our executive officers relating to their ownership of operating partnership units. Our directors and executive officers may have conflicting duties because, in their capacities as our directors and executive officers, they have a duty to us, and in our capacity as general partner of our operating partnership, they have a fiduciary duty to the limited partners. Each of our directors and executive officers is a limited partner of our operating partnership. These conflicts of interest could lead to decisions that are not in our best interest. Conflicts may arise when our interests and the interests of the limited partners of the operating partnership diverge, particularly in circumstances in which there may be an adverse tax consequence to the limited partners, such as upon the sale of certain properties or the repayment of indebtedness. We may experience conflicts of interest with certain members of our senior management team who are also limited partners in our operating partnership relating to the disposition and operation of certain of our properties. Oliver T. Carr, III, our chairman, president and chief executive officer, and Clinton D. Fisch, our senior vice president and director of acquisitions, received, directly or indirectly through their affiliates, 232,099 and 98,188 operating partnership units, respectively, in exchange for our acquisition of their interests in our initial properties in connection with our formation acquisitions. Messrs. Carr and Fisch have unrealized gains associated with their interests in certain of our properties, and, as a result, any sale of such assets or refinancing or prepayment of principal on the indebtedness assumed by us in purchasing such assets may cause adverse tax consequences to Messrs. Carr and Fisch. These individuals may not recommend or otherwise be supportive of the taxable disposition or refinancing of the properties when it might otherwise be in our interest to do so. We depend on key personnel with long-standing business relationships, the loss of whom could threaten our ability to operate our business successfully. Our future success depends, to a significant extent, upon the continued services of our senior management team, including Messrs. Carr and Fisch, our senior vice president and director of acquisitions, Christian H. Clifford, our chief financial officer, John A. Schissel, and our chief accounting officer, John M. Novack. In particular, the relationships that Messrs. Carr, Fisch, Clifford and Schissel have developed in the real estate community in our markets and with financing sources are critically important to the success of our business. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team would harm our business and prospects. Further, loss of a key member of our senior management team could be negatively perceived in the capital markets, which could cause a decline in the market price of our common stock. Our executive officers have agreements that provide them with benefits in the event of a change in control of our company or if their employment agreement is not renewed, which could deter a change in control that could be beneficial to our stockholders. We have employment agreements with Messrs. Carr, Schissel, Fisch, Clifford and Novack that provide them with severance benefits if their employment ends under certain circumstances following a change in control of our company or if the executive officer resigns for good reason as defined in the employment agreements. These benefits could increase the cost to a potential acquiror of our company and thereby prevent 20 or deter a change in control of the company that might involve a premium price for shares of our common stock or otherwise be in the interests of our stockholders. Our growth depends on external sources of capital which are outside of our control. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required under the Internal Revenue Code to distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our net taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain. In addition, we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income, including any net capital gains. Because of these distribution requirements, we may not be able to fund future capital needs, including acquisitions, from operating cash flow. Consequently, we rely on third-party sources to fund our capital needs and may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all. Any additional debt we incur will increase our leverage. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends, in part, on general market conditions, the markets perception of our growth potential, our current debt levels, our current and expected future earnings, our cash flow and cash distributions and the market price per share of our common stock. If we cannot obtain capital from third-party sources, we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities exist, satisfy our debt service obligations or make the cash distributions to our stockholders necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT. We may be required to borrow money or sell assets in order to fund distributions sufficient to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements. Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited, which could limit stockholders recourse in the event of actions not in stockholders best interests. Our charter limits the liability of our directors and officers for money damages, except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services, or a final judgment based upon a finding of active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was material to the cause of action adjudicated. Our charter authorizes us to indemnify our directors and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities to the fullest extent permitted by Maryland law. Our bylaws require us to indemnify each director or officer who has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she is made a party, or threatened to be made a party, by reason of his or her service to us. In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers. Our board of directors may approve the issuance of preferred stock with terms that may discourage a third party from acquiring us. Our charter permits our board of directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock, in one or more classes or series. Our board of directors may also classify or reclassify any unissued shares of preferred stock and establish the preferences and rights (including the right to vote, participate in earnings and to convert into shares of our common stock) of any such shares of preferred stock, which rights may be superior to those of shares of our common stock. Thus, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock with terms and conditions which could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of some or a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock might receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price of our common stock. Our ownership limitations may restrict business combination opportunities. To qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, no more than 50% of the value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned, directly or under applicable attribution rules, by five or fewer individuals (as defined to include certain entities) during the last half of each taxable year (other than our first REIT taxable year). To preserve our REIT qualification, our charter generally prohibits direct or indirect ownership by any person, other than Oliver T. Carr, Jr., of (i) more than 9.1% in number or value of our outstanding shares of common stock or (ii) more than 9.1% in value of our outstanding shares of all 21 classes. Our charter provides that Mr. Carr, Jr., the father of our chairman and chief executive officer, may own up to 13.0% of our outstanding common stock. Generally, shares owned by affiliated owners will be aggregated for purposes of the ownership limitation. Any transfer of shares of our common stock that would violate the ownership limitation will be null and void, and the intended transferee will acquire no rights in such shares. Shares of common stock that would otherwise be held in violation of the ownership limit will be designated as shares-in-trust and transferred automatically to a trust effective on the day before the purported transfer or other event giving rise to such excess ownership. The beneficiary of the trust will be one or more charitable organizations named by us. The ownership limitation could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction in which holders of shares of common stock might receive a premium for their shares of common stock over the then current market price or that such holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interests. The ownership limitation provisions also may make our shares of common stock an unsuitable investment vehicle for any person seeking to obtain, either alone or with others as a group, ownership of (i) more than 9.1% of the number or value of our outstanding shares of common stock or (ii) more than 9.1% in value of our outstanding shares of all classes. Our board of directors may change our investment and operational policies and practices without a vote of our common stockholders, which limits our stockholders control of our policies and practices. Our major policies, including our policies and practices with respect to investments, financing, growth, debt capitalization, REIT qualification and distributions, are determined by our board of directors. Although we have no present intention to do so, our board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies from time to time without a vote of our stockholders. Accordingly, our stockholders will have limited control over changes in our policies. Our charter and bylaws do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we or our operating partnership may incur. If we become highly leveraged, then the resulting increase in debt service could significantly limit our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness and harm our financial condition. Our charter contains provisions that makes removal of our directors difficult, which could make it difficult for our stockholders to effect changes to our management. Our charter provides that a director may only be removed for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Vacancies may be filled only by a majority of the remaining members of the board of directors. This requirement makes it more difficult to change our management by removing and replacing directors. Our bylaws may only be amended by our board of directors, which could limit our stockholders control of certain aspects of our corporate governance. Our charter provides that our board of directors has the sole power to amend our bylaws. Thus, the board is able to amend the bylaws in a way that may be detrimental to stockholders interests. Provisions of Maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of our company. Certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or the MGCL, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for shares of our common stock or otherwise be in stockholders best interests, including:  business combination provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an interested stockholder (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our shares or an affiliate thereof) for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter impose special stockholder voting requirements on these combinations; and  control share provisions that provide that control shares of our company (defined as shares which, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a control share 22 acquisition (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of control shares) have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares. Additionally, Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL permits our board of directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to take certain actions that may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for shares of our common stock or otherwise be in stockholders best interest. Our board of directors has adopted a resolution providing that we are not subject to the business combination provisions of the MGCL. However, our board of directors may elect to make the business combination statute applicable to us at any time, and may do so without stockholder approval. Our bylaws provide that we are not subject to the control share provisions of the MGCL. Our board of directors may elect to make the control share statute applicable to us at any time, and may do so without stockholder approval. Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry Terrorist attacks, such as the attacks that occurred in New York and Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001, and other acts of violence or war may affect any market on which our common stock trades, the markets in which we operate, our operations and our profitability. Terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and the market price of our common stock. These attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact the value of our properties through damage, destruction, loss or increased security costs. Moreover, substantially all of our properties are currently located in the Greater Washington, D.C. area and there may be a decrease in demand for space in the region because it is considered at risk for future terrorist attacks, and this decrease may reduce our revenues from property rentals. The United States may enter into armed conflicts in the future. The consequences of any armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business. Any of these events could result in increased volatility in or damage to the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. They also could result in a continuation of the current economic uncertainty in the United States or abroad. Adverse economic conditions could affect the ability of our tenants to pay rent, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, as well as our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, and may result in volatility in the market price for our securities. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover losses, including those that result from earthquakes or terrorist acts. We carry insurance coverage on our properties of types and in amounts that we believe are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties. In response to the uncertainty in the insurance market following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, or TRIA, was enacted in November 2002 to require regulated insurers to make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism (as defined by the statute) through December 31, 2005. On December 22, 2005, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act, or TRIEA, was enacted to amend TRIA by extending coverage under TRIA through December 31, 2007 and making certain other changes to coverage. Coverage under TRIA includes only physical damage and does not include losses due to biological, chemical or radioactive contamination. Our current property insurance coverage provides for limits on coverage per occurrence, including coverage for certified acts of terrorism, and such limits could prevent us from full recovery for a loss. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. Nevertheless, we might remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. It is also possible that third-party insurance carriers will not be able to maintain reinsurance sufficient to cover any losses that may be incurred. 23 We obtained limited representations and warranties in the contribution and acquisition agreements for the initial properties. In the formation transactions, we acquired interests in the entities that own our initial properties, rather than acquiring real estate assets. The contribution and other acquisition agreements contained limited representations and warranties regarding the initial properties. There could be unknown liabilities with respect to the initial properties or the entities that own the initial properties, and we have limited or no recourse against the parties from whom we are acquiring the interests in our initial properties. The costs of compliance with or liabilities under environmental laws could significantly reduce our profitability. Our operating expenses could be higher than anticipated due to the cost of complying with existing or future environmental laws and regulations. An owner of real property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property. We may face liability regardless of:  our lack of knowledge of the contamination;  the timing of the contamination;  the cause of the contamination; or  the party responsible for the contamination of the property. Environmental laws also impose ongoing compliance requirements on owners and operators of real property. Environmental laws potentially affecting us address a wide variety of matters, including, but not limited to, asbestos-containing building materials, storage tanks, storm water and wastewater discharges, lead-based paint, mold/mildew and hazardous wastes. Failure to comply with these laws could result in fines and penalties and/or expose us to third-party liability. Some of our properties may have conditions that are subject to these requirements, and we could be liable for such fines or penalties and/or liable to third parties. Certain properties in our portfolio may contain, or may have contained, asbestos-containing building materials, or ACBMs. Environmental laws require that ACBMs be properly managed and maintained, and may impose fines and penalties on building owners and operators for failure to comply with these requirements. Also, certain properties have, or may have, or are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. These operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Third parties may be permitted by law to seek recovery from owners or operators for property damage and/or personal injury associated with exposure to contaminants, including, but not limited to, petroleum products, hazardous or toxic substances and asbestos fibers. Independent environmental consultants conducted Phase I environmental site assessments on all of our properties. Phase I environmental site assessments are intended to evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties based generally on visual observations, interviews and certain publicly available databases. These assessments do not typically take into account all environmental issues including, but not limited to, testing of soil or groundwater or the possible presence of asbestos, lead-based paint, radon, wetlands or mold. None of the site assessments revealed any past or present environmental liability that we believe would be material to us. However, the assessments may have failed to reveal all environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns. Material environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the assessments were conducted or may arise in the future; and future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability. We cannot assure you that costs of future environmental compliance will not affect our ability to make distributions or that such costs or other remedial measures will not be material to us. The presence of hazardous substances on a property may limit our ability to sell the property on favorable terms or at all, and we may incur substantial remediation costs, thus harming our financial condition. In addition, although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable laws 24 and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from a tenants activities on the property, we could nonetheless be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest for environmental liabilities created by our tenants, and we cannot be sure that our tenants would satisfy their indemnification obligations under the applicable sales agreement or lease. The discovery of material environmental liabilities attached to our properties could subject us to unanticipated significant costs, which could significantly reduce our profitability and the cash available for distribution to our stockholders. Our properties may contain or develop harmful mold, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediating the problem. When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. Some of the properties in our portfolio may contain microbial matter such as mold and mildew. The presence of significant mold at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property. The presence of significant mold could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants and others if property damage or health concerns arise. If we become subject to claims in this regard, it could materially affect us and our insurability for such matters. Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and fire, safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could significantly reduce the cash available for distribution to our stockholders. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA, all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Although we believe that our properties substantially comply with present requirements of the act, we have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance. If one or more of our existing properties or future properties is not in compliance with the act, then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the property into compliance. Additional federal, state and local laws also may require modifications to our properties, or restrict our ability to renovate our properties. We cannot predict the ultimate amount of the cost of compliance with the act or other legislation. In addition, our properties are subject to various other federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these various requirements, we might incur governmental fines or private damage awards. We believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements. However, we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether future requirements will require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures. If we incur substantial costs to comply with the ADA or any other legislative or regulatory requirements, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, market price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected. Tax Risks of our Business and Structure If we fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we will not be able to deduct our dividends, and our income will be subject to taxation. We plan to elect to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our short taxable year ended on December 31, 2005 upon the filing of our federal income tax return for that year. Qualification as a REIT will afford us significant tax advantages. The requirements for this qualification, however, are complex and our management has limited experience in operating a REIT. If we fail to meet these requirements and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our distributions to our stockholders will not be deductible by us and we will be subject to a corporate level tax on our taxable income. 25 This would substantially reduce our cash available to make distributions to our stockholders and their yield on their investment. In addition, incurring corporate income tax liability might cause us to borrow funds, liquidate some of our investments or take other steps that could negatively affect our operating results. Moreover, if our REIT status is terminated because of our failure to meet a REIT qualification requirement or if we voluntarily revoke our election, we would be disqualified from electing treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which REIT status is lost. Distribution requirements relating to qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes limit our flexibility in executing our business plan. Our business plan contemplates growth through acquisitions. To qualify and maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains. We are also required to pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income (including net capital gains) each year. In addition, we are required to pay a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which certain distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income for that calendar year, 95% of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of our income that was not distributed in prior years. We intend to distribute to our stockholders all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income each year in order to comply with the distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and to avoid federal income tax and the 4% nondeductible excise tax. Our distribution requirements limit our ability to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures through retained earnings. Thus, our ability to grow through acquisitions will be limited if we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing. In addition, differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses in arriving at REIT taxable income and the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT, even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. Moreover, even if we qualify and maintain our status as a REIT, the net income of our taxable REIT subsidiaries will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates. Our disposal of properties may have negative implications, including unfavorable tax consequences. If we make a sale of a property directly or through an entity that is treated as a partnership or disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes, and it is deemed to be a sale of dealer property or inventory, the sale may be deemed to be a prohibited transaction under federal tax laws applicable to REITs, in which case our gain, or our share of the gain, from the sale would be subject to a 100% penalty tax. If we believe that a sale of a property might be treated as a prohibited transaction, we may dispose of that property through a taxable REIT subsidiary, in which case the gain from the sale would be subject to corporate income tax but not the 100% prohibited transaction tax. We cannot assure you, however, that the IRS will not assert successfully that sales of properties that we make directly or through an entity that is treated as a partnership or disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes, rather than through a taxable REIT subsidiary, are sales of dealer property or inventory, in which case the 100% penalty tax would apply. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable.
