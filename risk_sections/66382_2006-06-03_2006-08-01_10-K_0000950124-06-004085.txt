Item 1A RISK FACTORS The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face; others, either unforeseen or currently deemed less significant, may also have a negative impact on our company. If any of the following actually occurs, our business, operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We may not be successful in implementing and managing our growth strategy. We have established a set of key strategic goals for our business. Included among these are specific targets for growth in net sales and operating profit as a percentage of net sales. Our strategic plan assumes our growth targets will be achieved by pursuing and winning new business in the following areas:  Primary Markets  Capturing additional market share within our primary markets by offering superior solutions to customers who value space as a strategic tool.  Adjacent Markets  Further applying our core skills in space environments such as healthcare, higher education, and residential. -6- Table of Contents  Developing Economies  Expanding our geographic reach in areas of the world with significant growth potential.  New Markets  Developing new products and technologies that serve wholly new markets. While we have confidence that our strategic plan targets appropriate and achievable opportunities and anticipates and manages the associated risks, there is the possibility that the strategy may not deliver the projected results due to inadequate execution, incorrect assumptions, or changing customer requirements. There is no assurance that our current product and service offering will allow us to meet these goals. Accordingly, we believe we will be required to continually invest in the research, design, and development of new products and services. There is no assurance that such investments will have commercially successful results. Certain growth opportunities may require us to invest in acquisitions, alliances, and the startup of new business ventures. These investments may not perform according to plan. Future efforts to expand our business within developing economies, particularly within China and India, may expose us to the effects of political and economic instability. Such instability may cause us difficulty in competing for business. It may also put at risk the availability and/or value of our capital investments within these regions. Pursuing our growth plan in new and adjacent markets, as well as within developing economies, will require us to find effective new channels of distribution. There is no assurance that we can develop or otherwise identify these channels of distribution. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we may not be successful in winning new business. We are one of several companies competing for new business within the furniture industry. Many of our competitors offer similar categories of products, including office seating, systems and freestanding office furniture, casegoods, storage, and residential furniture solutions. We believe that our innovative product design, functionality, quality, depth of knowledge, and strong network of distribution partners differentiates us in the marketplace. However, increased market pricing pressure could make it difficult for us to win new business, at an acceptable profit margin, with certain customers and within certain market segments. Additionally, in recent years we have seen an increased market presence from international competitors. We expect this to continue, particularly in the area of low-priced imports into the United States. There is a risk that this competitive pricing pressure could make it difficult for us to raise prices in response to increasing raw-material prices and other inflationary pressures. Adverse economic and industry conditions could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Customer demand within the contract office furniture industry is affected by various macro-economic factors; general corporate profitability, white-collar employment levels, new office construction rates, and existing office vacancy rates are among the most influential of these. History has shown that declines in these measures can have an adverse effect on overall office furniture demand. Additionally, factors and changes specific to our industry, such as developments in technology, governmental standards and regulations, and health and safety issues can influence demand. There is no assurance that current or future economic or industry conditions will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Our business presence outside the United States exposes us to certain risks that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. We have a significant manufacturing and sales operation in the United Kingdom, which represents our largest marketplace outside the United States. In addition to this, our products are sold internationally through wholly-owned subsidiaries or branches in various countries including Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Japan, Australia, Singapore, China, and India. In certain other regions of the world, our products are offered through independent dealerships and licensees. -7- Table of Contents Doing business internationally exposes us to certain risks, many of which are beyond our control and could potentially impact our ability to design, develop, manufacture, or sell products in certain countries. These factors could include, but would not necessarily be limited to:  Political, social, and economic conditions  Legal and regulatory requirements  Labor and employment practices  Cultural practices and norms  Natural disasters  Security and health concerns  Protection of intellectual property In some countries, the currencies in which we import and export products can differ. Fluctuations in the rate of exchange between these currencies could negatively impact our business. Additionally, tariff and import regulations, international tax policies and rates, and changes in U.S. and international monetary policies may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Disruptions in the supply of raw and component materials could adversely affect our manufacturing and assembly operations. We rely on outside suppliers to provide on-time shipments of the various raw materials and component parts used in our manufacturing and assembly processes. The timeliness of these deliveries is critical to our ability to meet customer demand. Any disruptions in this flow of delivery could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Increases in the market prices of manufacturing materials may negatively affect our profitability. The costs of certain manufacturing materials used in our operations are sensitive to shifts in commodity market prices. In particular, the costs of steel components, plastics, particleboard, and aluminum components are sensitive to the market prices of commodities such as raw steel and aluminum, crude oil, lumber, and resins. Increases in the market prices of these commodities may have an adverse impact on our profitability if we are unable to offset them with strategic sourcing and continuous improvement initiatives or, as a result of competitive market conditions, we are unable to increase prices to our customers. Disruptions within our dealer network could adversely affect our business. Our ability to manage existing relationships with our network of independent dealers is crucial to our ongoing success. Although the loss of any single dealer would not have a material adverse effect on our overall business, our business within a given market could be negatively affected by disruptions in our dealer network caused by the termination of our commercial working relationships, ownership transitions, or dealer financial difficulties. If dealers go out of business or restructure, we may suffer losses because they may not be able to pay for products already delivered to them. Also, dealers may experience financial difficulties, creating the need for outside financial support, which may not be easily obtained. In the past, we have, on occasion, agreed to provide direct financial assistance through term loans, lines of credit, and/or loan guarantees to certain dealers. There is no assurance that these dealers will be able to repay amounts owed to us or to banks with which we have offered guarantees. Increasing competition for highly skilled and talented workers could adversely affect our business. The successful implementation of our business strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain a skilled workforce. The increasing competition for highly skilled and talented employees could result in higher compensation costs, difficulties in maintaining a capable workforce, and leadership succession planning challenges. -8- Table of Contents Costs related to product defects could adversely affect our profitability. We incur various expenses related to product defects, including product warranty costs, product recall and retrofit costs, and product liability costs. These expenses relative to product sales vary and could increase. We maintain reserves for product-defect-related costs based on estimates and our knowledge of circumstances that indicate the need for such reserves. We cannot, however, be certain that these reserves will be adequate to cover actual product defect-related claims in the future. Any significant increase in the rate of our product-defect expenses could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Item 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS  N/A
