Item 1A. Risk Factors, Investors in RegeneRx should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. The risks described below may not be the only ones facing our company. Our business could be harmed by any of these risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and investors may lose all or part of their investment. In assessing these risks, investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, including our financial statements and related notes. Risks Related to RegeneRxs Business RegeneRx Has A Lack Of Revenues And A History Of Losses RegeneRx has sustained operating losses since its inception in 1982. It believes these losses will continue for the foreseeable future. To date, RegeneRx has not had revenues from operations and does not expect to in the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2006, RegeneRx had an accumulated 9 deficit of $56.2 million. RegeneRx anticipates substantial and increasing operating losses over the next several years as it continues its research and development efforts and seeks to obtain regulatory approval of its products to make them commercially viable. Therefore, RegeneRxs ability to continue operations depends on its ability to access capital when necessary, cease operating losses by completing development of its products, obtain requisite regulatory approvals and ultimately commercialize such products. There Are Uncertainties Related To The Limited Capital Resources Of RegeneRx RegeneRx anticipates that new capital resources will be required to continue its independent development efforts. The actual amount of funds that RegeneRx will need will be determined by many factors, some of which are beyond RegeneRxs control. These factors include the success of its research and development efforts, the status of its non-clinical and clinical testing, the costs relating to securing approvals of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory authorities, the costs and timing of obtaining new patents, regulatory changes, competition and technological developments in the market. Potential sources of outside capital include entering strategic business relationships, public or private sales of shares of RegeneRxs capital stock or debt or other similar arrangements. RegeneRx does not have any committed sources of outside capital at this time. It is uncertain whether RegeneRx will be able to obtain outside capital when it needs it or on terms that would be acceptable. If RegeneRx raises additional capital through strategic business relationships, such as through collaborations and licensing arrangements, the company may have to give up valuable rights to intellectual property and the value of the companys interest in the licensed products could be negatively impacted by competing strategic and financial interests of the companys collaborators or licensees. If RegeneRx raises funds by selling additional shares of its common stock or securities convertible into its common stock, the ownership interest of its existing stockholders will be diluted. If RegeneRx is unable to obtain outside capital when needed, in the amount needed, its business and future prospects would be adversely affected and it could be forced to suspend or discontinue operations. RegeneRx Has Limited Expertise And Capacity To Conduct Pre-Clinical Testing And Trials Requiring Dependence On Other Parties RegeneRx has only limited experience, resources, and capacity with pre-clinical testing, clinical trials, formulation, manufacturing and commercialization of drug products. As a result, RegeneRx has engaged and intends to continue engaging contract research organizations, or CROs, to perform pre-clinical testing and clinical trials for drug candidates that are chosen for development without a collaborator. If the CROs that RegeneRx hires to perform the pre-clinical testing and clinical trials or collaborators or licensees do not meet deadlines, do not follow proper procedures, or a conflict arises between RegeneRx and their CROs, the pre-clinical testing and clinical trials may take longer than expected, may be delayed or may be terminated. If RegeneRx were forced to find a replacement entity to perform any of the pre-clinical testing or clinical trials, RegeneRx may not be able to find a suitable entity on favorable terms, or at all. Even if it were able to find another company to perform a pre-clinical test or clinical trial, the delay in the test or clinical trial may result in significant expenditures. Events such as these may result in delays in obtaining regulatory approval for drug candidates or commercializing products and could result in increased expenditures that would adversely affect RegeneRxs operating results. 10 In addition, for some of its drug candidates, RegeneRx plans to contract with collaborators or licensees to advance those candidates through later-stage, more expensive clinical trials, rather than invest its own resources to perform these clinical trials. Depending on the terms of the agreements with these collaborators or licensees, RegeneRx may not have any control over the conduct of these clinical trials, and in any event would be subject to the risks associated with depending on collaborators or licensees to develop these drug candidates. RegeneRx Is Exposed To Product Development Risk Although RegeneRx was formed in 1982, it is still in the early stages of the development of its pharmaceutical products. Presently, RegeneRx does not have any products that have received regulatory approval, does not expect to have any such products for several years and may never successfully develop or commercialize any such products. RegeneRxs proposed products are subject to numerous risks associated with the development of medical products. These risks include the possibilities that any of RegeneRxs products could be found to be ineffective or toxic, or could fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals. In addition, RegeneRxs products could face obsolescence if third parties develop superior or equivalent but less expensive products. RegeneRx Is Subject To Government Regulation Products that RegeneRx may develop will require regulatory approvals prior to sale. In particular, therapeutic agents and diagnostic products are subject to stringent approval, prior to commercial marketing, by the FDA in the United States and by comparable agencies in most foreign countries. The process of obtaining FDA and corresponding foreign approvals is costly and time consuming and RegeneRx cannot assure that such approvals will be granted. Any failure to obtain or any delay in obtaining such approvals could decrease the ability of RegeneRx to successfully market any products developed. Also, RegeneRx cannot predict the extent of adverse government regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action. RegeneRx Is Heavily Reliant On Its World-Wide License From The National Institute Of Health (NIH) RegeneRx received an exclusive world-wide license to intellectual property discovered at the NIH pertaining to wound healing and tissue repair. This license terminates upon the last to expire of the patent applications that are filed in connection with the license. This license requires RegeneRx to pay a minimum annual royalty to the NIH plus certain other royalties upon the sale of products created by the intellectual property granted under the license. RegeneRx relies on this license for a significant portion of its business. The loss of this license would adversely affect RegeneRxs ability to conduct its operations, which would have a material adverse affect on its financial conditions and results of operations. RegeneRx Is Developing A Technology Platform Primarily Based On A Single Compound Which Has Yet To Be Proven Effective RegeneRxs current primary business focus is the development of Thymosin beta 4, and its analogues and fragments, for the treatment of non-healing wounds and other conditions. While RegeneRx has in the past explored and may in the future explore the use of other compounds for the treatment of other medical conditions, it presently has no immediate plans to develop products for such purposes. This lack of product diversification would have a material adverse affect on RegeneRx if it is unsuccessful in its efforts to commercialize Thymosin beta 4 in some manner, possibly resulting in the termination of its current line of business. 11 RegeneRx Depends On Third Parties For Supply Of Raw Materials RegeneRx depends on outside vendors for the supply of Thymosin beta 4. While there are numerous vendors that can manufacture Thymosin beta 4 to RegeneRxs specifications, RegeneRxs ability to obtain Thymosin beta 4 at an affordable cost or timely manner could be affected by various factors outside RegeneRxs control, including the availability of certain chemicals necessary for manufacturing Thymosin beta 4. If RegeneRx is unable to obtain sufficient supplies of Thymosin beta 4 in a timely fashion, our clinical development program will be adversely impacted. RegeneRx Relies Upon Dr. Goldstein, Mr. Finkelstein, And Other Key Personnel RegeneRxs success will depend to a large extent on the abilities and continued service of Dr. Goldstein and Mr. Finkelstein. The loss of Dr. Goldstein or Mr. Finkelstein could prevent or significantly delay the achievement of RegeneRxs goals. RegeneRx has employment agreements with Dr. Goldstein and Mr. Finkelstein. RegeneRx does not maintain, however, a key man life insurance policy with respect to Dr. Goldstein or Mr. Finkelstein. As RegeneRx grows, it will need to add additional management and other personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in RegeneRxs industry is intense, and RegeneRxs success will depend on its ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. RegeneRx cannot assure you that its efforts to obtain or retain such personnel will be successful. RegeneRx Is Subject To Competition From Companies With Greater Resources RegeneRx is engaged in a business that is highly competitive. Research and development activities for the development of drugs to treat indications within RegeneRxs focus, are being sponsored or conducted by private and public institutions and by major pharmaceutical companies located in the United States and a number of foreign countries. Most of these companies and institutions have financial and human resources that are substantially greater than those of RegeneRx, and that have extensive experience in conducting research and development activities and clinical testing and in obtaining the regulatory approvals necessary to market pharmaceutical products. With respect to wound healing, Johnson & Johnson is marketing Regranex for this purpose in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. Other companies, such as Novartis, are developing and marketing artificial skins which could compete with RegeneRxs products in certain wound healing areas. Moreover, wound healing is a large and highly fragmented marketplace attracting many companies, large and small, to develop products for treating acute and chronic wounds. Additionally, most large pharmaceutical companies and many smaller biomedical companies are vigorously pursuing therapeutics to treat patients after heart attacks and other cardiovascular indications. RegeneRx May Be Unable To Obtain Adequate Product Liability Insurance RegeneRxs business exposes it to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing, and marketing of drugs. RegeneRxs liability exposure for human clinical trials for Thymosin beta 4 is dependent on its ability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance or to collaborate with corporate partners that have adequate insurance. In addition, the use of RegeneRxs products, when and if developed and sold, will expose RegeneRx to the risk of product liability claims. Although RegeneRx intends to obtain product liability insurance coverage, it cannot guarantee that product liability insurance will continue to be available to it on acceptable terms, or at all, or that its coverage will be sufficient to cover all claims against it. A product liability claim, even 12 one without merit or for which RegeneRx has substantial coverage, could result in significant legal defense costs, thereby potentially exposing RegeneRx to expenses significantly in excess of its revenues. RegeneRx May Be Unable To Obtain Product Reimbursement By Third Parties In addition to obtaining regulatory approval, the successful commercialization of certain of RegeneRxs products may depend on its ability to obtain reimbursement for the cost of the product and treatment. Government authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, such as health maintenance organizations, are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Also, the trend toward managed health care in the United States, the growth of healthcare organizations such as HMOs, and legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs could significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products, resulting in lower prices and reducing demand for RegeneRxs products, if and when developed. The cost containment measures that healthcare providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could affect RegeneRxs ability to sell its products and may have a material adverse effect on its operations. RegeneRx cannot assure that reimbursement in the United States or foreign countries will be available for any of RegeneRxs products, that any reimbursement granted will be maintained, or that limits on reimbursement available from third-party payors will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, its products. The lack or inadequacy of third-party reimbursements for certain of RegeneRxs products decreases the potential profitability of its operations. RegeneRx cannot forecast what additional legislation or regulation relating to the healthcare industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future, or what effect the legislation or regulation would have on its business. Clinical Trials Could Be Delayed Or Fail To Show Efficacy Resulting In Additional Cost Or Failure To Commercialize Our Technology Platform. A number of factors, including unexpected delays in the initiation of clinical sites, slower than projected enrollment, competition with ongoing clinical trials and scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians, regulatory requirements, limits on manufacturing capacity and failure of a product candidate to meet required standards for administration to humans may cause significant delays in the completion of RegeneRxs clinical trials. In addition, it may take longer than RegeneRx projects to achieve study endpoints and complete data analysis for a trial. RegeneRx may not complete its clinical trials when or as projected or commence or complete clinical trials involving any of its other product candidates as projected or may not conduct them successfully. RegeneRx relies on academic institutions, physician practices and clinical research organizations to conduct, supervise, or monitor some or all aspects of clinical trials involving our product candidates. RegeneRx has less control over the timing and other aspects of these clinical trials than if it conducted the monitoring and supervision entirely on its own. Third parties may not perform their responsibilities for our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with a clinical trial protocol or applicable regulations. RegeneRx also relies on clinical research organizations to perform much of its data management and analysis. They may not provide these services as required or in a timely manner. If RegeneRx fails to complete or if it experiences material delays in completing the Phase II trials as currently planned, or it otherwise fails to commence or complete, or experience delays in, any of its other present or planned clinical trials, RegeneRxs ability to conduct its business as currently planned could materially suffer. Development costs will increase if RegeneRx experiences any future delays in its clinical trials or if RegeneRx needs to perform more or larger clinical trials than it currently plans. If the delays or costs are significant, RegeneRxs financial results and its ability to commercialize its product candidates will be adversely affected. 13 Risks Related To RegeneRx Intellectual Property RegeneRx May Be Unable To Obtain And Protect Its Intellectual Property Rights RegeneRxs success also will depend in substantial part on its ability to obtain, defend and enforce patents, maintain trade secrets and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others, both in the United States and abroad. Pursuant to a research agreement with The George Washington University, RegeneRx has rights to two U.S. patents relating to the treatment of septic shock. RegeneRx also owns patents related to the use of Thymosin beta 4 among other thymic peptides, for the stimulation of hair growth. Pursuant to an exclusive world-wide license from the NIH, RegeneRx now has exclusive rights under a patent application filed by the NIH for the use of Thymosin beta 4 in the treatment of non-healing wounds. While this patent has issued in certain countries, RegeneRx cannot guarantee whether or when the patent will be issued or as to the scope of the patent issued in other countries. If no additional patent issues from the NIHs application, RegeneRxs ability to commercialize Thymosin beta 4 as a wound-healing treatment could be substantially limited. RegeneRx cannot assure you that any patent applications filed by RegeneRx, or by others under which RegeneRx has rights, will result in patents being issued in the United States or foreign countries. In addition, RegeneRx cannot guarantee that patents that have been or will be issued will afford meaningful protection for RegeneRxs products. Competitors may develop products similar to RegeneRxs that do not conflict with RegeneRxs patents. Others may challenge RegeneRxs patents and, as a result, RegeneRxs patents could be narrowed or invalidated. RegeneRx cannot assure that it will be able to afford the legal costs associated with defending or enforcing any of its patents. Changes To United States Patent Laws May Devalue RegeneRxs Patent Portfolio The value of RegeneRxs patents depends in part to their duration. A shorter period of patent protection could lesson the value of RegeneRxs rights under any patents that may be obtained and may decrease revenues derived from its patents. The United States patent laws were amended in 1995 to change the term of patent protection 17 years from patent issuance to 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of the application. Because the time from filing to issuance of biotechnology applications may be more than three years depending on the subject matter, a 20-year patent term from the filing date may result in substantially shorter patent protection. This would shorten RegeneRxs period of patent exclusivity and may decrease the revenues that RegeneRx might derive from the patents. International Patent Protection Is Uncertain And Costly Biotechnology and pharmaceutical patent law outside the United States is even more uncertain and costly than in the United States and is currently undergoing review and revision in many countries. Further, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States laws. For example, certain countries do not grant patent claims that are directed to the treatment of humans. RegeneRx may participate in opposition proceedings to determine the validity of its foreign patents or its competitors foreign patents, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of RegeneRxs efforts. 14 Risks Related To Our Securities RegeneRx Common Stock Price And Volume Is Volatile The price of RegeneRxs stock can be volatile, which makes it difficult for stockholders to predict the value of their shares or buy or sell shares at any given time. During the year ended December 31, 2006, RegeneRxs closing stock price has ranged from $1.79 to $3.41. A variety of factors may affect the market price of RegeneRxs common stock including, but not limited to:  results of testing and clinical trials;  commercial success of approved products;  corporate partnerships;  technological innovations by RegeneRx or competitors;  changes in laws and government regulations;  changes in key personnel at the company;  developments concerning proprietary rights, including patents and litigation matters;  public perception relating to the commercial value or safety of any of RegeneRxs products;  future sales of RegeneRx common stock;  future issuance of RegeneRx common stock causing dilution;  variations in RegeneRx financial performance;  general trends related to the biopharmaceutical and biotechnological industries; and  general conditions in the stock market. RegeneRxs common stock is currently traded on the American Stock Exchange. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the average volume of RegeneRx common stock trade was 15,543 shares per day. RegeneRx Has Never Paid Dividends On Its Common Stock Since its inception in 1982, RegeneRx has not paid cash dividends on its common stock and does not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future due to RegeneRxs limited funds for operations. Therefore, any return on your investment would come only from an increase in the value of the stock. RegeneRx Controlled By Management And A Small Number Of Stockholders As of December 31, 2006, RegeneRxs executive officers, directors and 5% or greater stockholders together controlled approximately 49% of the outstanding shares of RegeneRxs common stock, RegeneRxs sole class of outstanding voting securities. These stockholders, acting together, are in a position to influence and possibly control most matters submitted for approval by RegeneRxs stockholders, including the election of directors and the consideration of mergers or other proposed transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. 15 There Is A Potential For Future Dilution To Existing Stockholders Currently, RegeneRx is authorized to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of its common stock, and as of December 31, 2006, there were issued and outstanding 46,096,477 shares of RegeneRxs common stock. The authorized but unissued shares may be issued by RegeneRx in such transactions and at such times as its Board of Directors considers appropriate, whether in public or private offerings, as stock splits or dividends or in connection with mergers and acquisitions or otherwise. Any such issuance that is not made solely to then-existing stockholders proportionate to their interests (as in a stock dividend or stock split) will result in dilution to each stockholder by reducing his or her percentage ownership of the total outstanding shares. RegeneRx May Be Unable To Maintain The Standards For Listing On The American Stock Exchange RegeneRx common stock is currently listed on the American Stock Exchange. There are several requirements that RegeneRx must satisfy in order for its common stock to continue to be listed on the American Stock Exchange. In the future, RegeneRx may not comply with all of these listing requirements, which might result in the delisting of its common stock. Delisting from the American Stock Exchange could adversely affect the liquidity and the price of RegeneRxs common stock and could have a long-term adverse impact on its ability to raise future capital through a sale of shares of its common stock. If it were to be delisted, RegeneRx common stock would be traded on an electronic bulletin board established for securities that are not traded on a national securities exchange, NASDAQ or traded in quotations published by the National Quotation Bureau, Inc., commonly referred to as the pink sheets. If this occurs, it could be difficult to sell RegeneRx securities or obtain the same level of market information as to the price of shares of its common stock as is currently available. The Exercise Of Options And Warrants And Other Issuances Of Shares Of Common Stock Will Likely Have A Dilutive Effect On RegeneRxs Stock Price. As of March 31, 2007, there were outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 3,332,500 shares of RegeneRx common stock at prices ranging from $0.28 per share to $3.82 per share, of which options to purchase approximately 1,647,083 shares were exercisable as of such date. As of March 30, 2007, there were outstanding warrants to purchase 3,522,544 shares of RegeneRx common stock, at a weighted average exercise price of $3.26. The exercise of options and warrants at prices below the market price of RegeneRx common stock could adversely affect the price of shares of RegeneRx common stock. Additional dilution may result from the issuance of shares of RegeneRx capital stock in connection with collaborations or manufacturing arrangements or in connection with other financing efforts. The issuance of additional shares of RegeneRx common stock could be dilutive to stockholders if they do not invest in future offerings. Moreover, to the extent that RegeneRx issues options or warrants to purchase its common stock in the future and those options or warrants are exercised or RegeneRx issues restricted stock, stockholders may experience further dilution. Holders of shares of RegeneRx common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle them to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series. 16 RegeneRxs Certificate Of Incorporation And Delaware Law Contain Provisions That Could Discourage A Takeover And Entrench Management. RegeneRxs certificate of incorporation provides its board of directors the power to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval. This preferred stock could have voting rights, including voting rights that could be superior to that of RegeneRxs common stock. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law contains provisions that impose restrictions on stockholder action to acquire control of RegeneRx. The effect of these provisions of its certificate of incorporation and Delaware law make it more difficult to remove management and could discourage third parties from seeking to obtain control, even though the price at which such third parties seek to acquire RegeneRx common stock is in excess of the market price for its stock.
