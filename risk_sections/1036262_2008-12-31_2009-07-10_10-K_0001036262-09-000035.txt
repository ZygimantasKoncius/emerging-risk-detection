Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) prior to the end of the 180-day period. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the Global Market, our common shares could be delisted from the Global Market in which case our common shares would be traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market ("Capital Market"), if we satisfy it's minimum initial listing requirements, or The OTC Bulletin Board ("OTC"), if we do not satisfy the minimum initial listing requirements of the Capital Market. As of December 31, 2008, we do not currently meet the minimum initial listing requirements of the Capital Market . There can be no assurance that our common shares would be eligible for trading on any such alternative exchange or market. If we are delisted from NASDAQ, it could materially reduce the liquidity of our common shares, impact the price of our common shares, and impair our ability to raise capital. Item 1B.
