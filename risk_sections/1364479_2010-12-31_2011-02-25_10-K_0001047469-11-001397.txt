ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) plans. A sale of a substantial number of our shares or other equity-related securities in the public market pursuant to new issuances (by us or upon the conversion of our Convertible Senior Notes (as defined below)) or by significant stockholders (such as by our Sponsors) could depress the market price of our stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Any such sale or issuance would dilute the ownership interests of the then-existing stockholders, and could have material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock or the value of the Convertible Senior Notes. The price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the Convertible Senior Notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity. In addition, the price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected if the existence of the Convertible Senior Notes encourages short selling by market participants. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
