ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our operations are subject to many risks that could adversely affect our future financial condition and performance and, therefore, the market value of our securities. The risk factors applicable to us are the following: We may not be able to successfully manage our growth or implement our growth strategies, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. A key aspect of our business strategy is our continued growth and expansion. Our ability to continue to grow depends, in part, upon our ability to: · open new financial service centers; · attract deposits to those locations; and · identify attractive loan and investment opportunities. We may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy if we are unable to identify attractive markets, locations or opportunities to expand in the future. Our ability to manage our growth successfully also will depend on whether we can maintain capital levels adequate to support our growth, maintain cost controls and asset quality and successfully integrate any new financial service centers into our organization. As we continue to implement our growth strategy by opening new financial service centers, we expect to incur construction costs and increased personnel, occupancy and other operating expenses. We generally must absorb those higher expenses while we continue to generate new deposits, and there is a further time lag involved in redeploying new deposits into attractively priced loans and other higher yielding earning assets. Thus, our plans to grow could depress our earnings in the short run, even if we efficiently execute this growth. Our future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry. Our banking subsidiary faces vigorous competition from banks and other financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, savings banks, finance companies and credit unions for deposits, loans and other financial services in our market area. A number of these banks and other financial institutions are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater access to capital and other resources, as well as larger lending limits and branch systems, and offer a wider array of banking services. Our non-banking subsidiary faces competition from money managers and investment brokerage firms. To a limited extent, our banking subsidiary also competes with other providers of financial services, such as money market mutual funds, brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, insurance companies and governmental organizations which may offer more favorable financing than we can. Many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern us. As a result, these non-bank competitors have advantages over us in providing certain services. This competition may reduce or limit our margins and our market share and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We may incur losses if we are unable to successfully manage interest rate risk. Our profitability will depend in substantial part upon the spread between the interest rates earned on investments and loans and interest rates paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. 18 Changes in interest rates will affect our operating performance and financial condition in diverse ways including the pricing of securities, loans and deposits, the volume of loan originations in our mortgage banking business and the value we can recognize on the sale of mortgage and home equity loans in the secondary market. We attempt to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk, but we will be unable to eliminate it. Based on our asset/liability position at December 31, 2005, a rise in interest rates would benefit our net interest income in the short term. Our net interest spread will depend on many factors that are partly or entirely outside our control, including competition, federal economic, monetary and fiscal policies, and economic conditions generally. Our concentration in loans secured by real estate may increase our credit losses, which would negatively affect our financial results. We offer a variety of secured loans, including commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, real estate, construction, home equity, consumer and other loans. Many of our loans are secured by real estate (both residential and commercial) in our market area. At December 31, 2005, approximately 33.8% and 40.2% of our $524.8 million total loan portfolio were secured by commercial and residential real estate, respectively. A major change in the real estate market, such as a deterioration in the value of this collateral, or in the local or national economy, could adversely affect our clients ability to pay these loans, which in turn could impact us. While we are in one of the fastest growing real estate markets in the United States, risk of loan defaults and foreclosures are unavoidable in the banking industry, and we try to limit our exposure to this risk by monitoring our extensions of credit carefully. We cannot fully eliminate credit risk, and as a result credit losses may occur in the future. We may be adversely affected by economic conditions in our market area. Our banking operations are located primarily in the Virginia counties of Loudoun, Fairfax and Fauquier. Because our lending is concentrated in this market, we will be affected by the general economic conditions in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Changes in the economy may influence the growth rate of our loans and deposits, the quality of the loan portfolio and loan and deposit pricing. A significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond our control would impact the demand for banking products and services generally, which could negatively affect our financial condition and performance. A loss of our senior officers could impair our relationship with our clients and adversely affect our business. Many community banks attract customers based on the personal relationships that the banks officers and customers establish with each other and the confidence that the customers have in the officers. As a result, we depend on the performance of our senior officers. These officers have many years of experience in the banking industry and have numerous contacts in our market area. We believe that their extent of experience and contacts provide us with an advantage over other community banks in our market, who have senior officers with less experience and fewer contacts. We believe that our business model for financial service centers will minimize our clients reliance on the relationship of any one particular officer. While we continue to develop this model, however, the loss of the services of any of our senior officers, or the failure of any of them to perform management functions in the manner anticipated by our board of directors, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our success will be dependent upon the boards ability to attract and retain quality personnel, including these individuals. 19 If we need additional capital in the future to continue our growth, we may not be able to obtain it on terms that are favorable. This could negatively affect our performance and the value of our common stock. Our business strategy calls for continued growth. We anticipate that we will be able to support this growth through the generation of additional deposits at new branch locations as well as investment opportunities. However, we may need to raise additional capital in the future to support our continued growth and to maintain our capital levels. Our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional securities will depend primarily upon our financial condition and the condition of financial markets at that time. We may not be able to obtain additional capital in the amounts or on terms satisfactory to us. Our growth may be constrained if we are unable to raise additional capital as needed. Our profitability and the value of your investment may suffer because of rapid and unpredictable changes in the highly regulated environment in which we operate. We are subject to extensive supervision by several governmental regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels in the financial services area. Recently enacted, proposed and future legislation and regulations have had, and will continue to have, or may have a significant impact on the financial services industry. These regulations, which are intended to protect depositors and not our shareholders, and the interpretation and application of them by federal and state regulators, are beyond our control, may change rapidly and unpredictably and can be expected to influence our earnings and growth. Our success depends on our continued ability to maintain compliance with these regulations. Some of these regulations may increase our costs and thus place other financial institutions that are not subject to similar regulation in stronger, more favorable competitive positions. Revenue from our mortgage lending investment is sensitive to changes in economic conditions, decreased economic activity, a slowdown in the housing market or higher interest rates and may adversely impact our profits. Maintaining our revenue stream from our investment in STM is dependent upon its ability to originate loans and sell them to investors. Loan production levels are sensitive to changes in economic conditions and can suffer from decreased economic activity, a slowdown in the housing market or higher interest rates. Generally, any sustained period of decreased economic activity or higher interest rates could adversely affect STMs mortgage originations and, consequently, reduce its income from mortgage lending activities. As a result, these conditions may ultimately adversely affect our net income. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
