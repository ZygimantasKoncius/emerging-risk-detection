Business. General. Wolverine World Wide, Inc. (the "Company") is a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of a broad line of quality casual shoes, rugged outdoor and work footwear, and constructed slippers and moccasins. The Company, a Delaware corporation, is the successor of a Michigan corporation of the same name, originally organized in 1906, which in turn was the successor of a footwear business established in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1883. Consumers around the world purchased more than 42.7 million pairs of Company branded footwear during fiscal 2004, making the Company a global leader among footwear companies in the marketing of branded casual, work and outdoor footwear. The Company's products generally feature contemporary styling with proprietary technologies designed to provide maximum comfort and performance. The products are marketed throughout the world under widely recognized brand names, including Bates®, CAT®, Harley-Davidson®, Hush Puppies®, HyTest®, Merrell®, Sebago®, Stanley® and Wolverine®. The Company believes that its primary competitive strengths are its well-recognized brand names, broad range of comfortable footwe ar, patented and proprietary designs and comfort technologies, numerous distribution channels and diversified manufacturing and sourcing base. The Company's footwear is sold under a variety of brand names designed to appeal to most consumers of casual, work and outdoor footwear at numerous price points. The Company's footwear products are currently organized under five operating units: (i) the Wolverine Footwear Group, focusing on the Bates®, HyTest®, Stanley® and Wolverine® product lines of work, outdoor, uniform and lifestyle boots and shoes, (ii) the Outdoor Group, focusing on the Sebago® and Merrell® product lines of performance and lifestyle footwear, (iii) the Heritage Brands Group, focusing on the CAT® product lines of work and lifestyle footwear and the Harley-Davidson® lines of lifestyle and performance footwear, (iv) The Hush Puppies Company, focusing on the Hush Puppies® brand of comfortable casual and dress footwear and slippers, and (v) Other Branded Footwear, focusing on the design and manufacture of private label footwear. The Company also licenses its brands for use on non-footwear products including apparel, eyewear, watches, socks, gloves, handbags and plush toys. The Company's Global Operations Group is responsible for manufacturing, sourcing, distribution and customer support for the various Company brands. The Company's footwear is distributed domestically through 70 Company-owned retail stores and to numerous accounts including department stores, footwear chains, catalogs, specialty retailers, mass merchants and Internet retailers. Many of the retailers to whom Wolverine distributes operate multiple storefront locations. The Company's products are distributed worldwide in over 140 markets through licensees and distributors. The Company, through its Wolverine Leathers Division, operates a tannery which is one of the premier tanners of quality pigskin leather for the shoe and leather goods industries. Pigskin leather tanned by the Company is used in a significant portion of the footwear marketed by the Company, and is also sold to Company licensees and other domestic and foreign manufacturers of footwear. In addition, Wolverine Procurement, Inc., a Company-owned subsidiary, performs skinning operations and purchases 3 raw pigskins which it then cures and sells to outside customers for processing into pigskin leather products. For financial information regarding the Company, see the consolidated financial statements of the Company and the notes thereto, which are attached as Appendix A to this Form 10-K. The Company has one reportable segment, Branded Footwear and Licensing. The Branded Footwear and Licensing segment is engaged in manufacturing, sourcing, licensing, marketing and distributing branded footwear, including casual shoes, slippers, moccasins, dress shoes, boots, uniform shoes, work shoes and performance outdoor footwear. The Company's Other Business units consist of its retail stores, tannery and pigskin procurement operations. Financial information regarding the Company's business segments and financial information about geographic areas is found in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements of the Company that are attached as Appendix A to this Form 10-K. Branded Footwear and Licensing. The Company sources and markets a broad range of footwear styles including shoes, boots, slippers, moccasins and sandals under many recognizable brand names including Bates®, CAT®, Harley-Davidson®, Hush Puppies®, HyTest®, Merrell®, Sebago®, Stanley® and Wolverine®. The Company combines quality materials and skilled workmanship from around the world to produce footwear according to its specifications at both Company-owned and independent manufacturing facilities. The Company also licenses its brands for use on non-footwear products including apparel, eyewear, watches, socks, handbags and plush toys. Current significant licensing programs include Hush Puppies® apparel , eyewear, watches and plush toys, and Wolverine® brand apparel, gloves and eyewear. The Company's five branded footwear and licensing operating units are described below. 1. Wolverine Footwear Group. The Wolverine Footwear Group encompasses footwear primarily under the Wolverine®, Bates®, HyTest® and Stanley® brands and markets footwear designed with performance and comfort features to serve a variety of work, outdoor and lifestyle functions. Wolverine® Work and Industrial Footwear. The Wolverine® brand has built its reputation by offering high quality work boots and shoes that incorporate innovative technologies to deliver comfort and durability. The Wolverine® brand, which has been in existence for 122 years, markets work and outdoor footwear in three categories: (i) work and industrial; (ii) outdoor sport; and (iii) rugged casual. The development of DuraShocks® technology and, in 2004, Wolverine MultiShox™ technology, has allowed the Wolverine® brand to introduce a broad line of work footwear with a focus on comfort. The Wolverine Fusion®, DuraShocks SR™ and Wolverine Compressor™ technologies represent the Company's tradition of comfortable work and industrial footwear, a tradition that is continued and enhanced with the development of the Wolverine MultiShox™ Individual Comfort System. The Wolverine® work product line features work boots and shoes, including steel toe boots and shoes, targeting male and female industrial and farm workers. The Wolverine® rugged casual and outdoor sport product lines incorporate DuraShocks® technology and other comfort features into products designed for casual and outdoor sport use. The rugged casual line targets active lifestyles and includes walking shoes, rugged casuals and outdoor sandals. The outdoor sport line is designed to meet the demands of hunters, fishermen and other active outdoor sportsmen and women. Warmth, waterproofing and comfort are achieved through the use of Gore-Tex® and Thinsulate® brand fabrics, the Company's performance leathers 4 and patented DuraShocks® technologies. In addition, the Wolverine® brand is licensed for use on apparel, eyewear, watches and gloves. Bates® Uniform Footwear. The Bates Uniform Footwear Division is an industry leader in supplying footwear to military and civilian uniform users. The Bates Uniform Footwear Division utilizes DuraShocks®, DuraShocks SR™, CoolTech® and other proprietary comfort technologies in the design of its military-style boots and oxfords including the Bates®, Enforcer Series® and Special Ops™ footwear lines. The Bates Uniform Footwear Division contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and the militaries of several foreign countries to supply military footwear. Civilian uniform uses include police, security, postal, restaurant and other industrial occupations. Bates Uniform Footwear Division's products are also distributed through specialty retailers and catalogs. HyTest® Safety Footwear. The HyTest® product line consists primarily of high-quality work boots and shoes designed to protect male and female industrial workers from foot injuries. HyTest® footwear incorporates various specialty safety features into its product lines, including steel toe, composite toe, metatarsal guards, electrical hazard, static dissipating and conductive footwear to protect against hazards of the workplace. In addition, HyTest® brand footwear incorporates features such as FootRests® comfort technology to provide comfort together with safety for working men and women. HyTest® footwear is distributed primarily through a network of independently-owned Shoemobile® mobile truck retail outlets providing direct sales of the Company 's occupational and work footwear brands to workers at industrial facilities and also through direct sales arrangements with large industrial customers. Stanley® Footgear. Pursuant to a license arrangement with The Stanley Works, the Company has exclusive rights to manufacture, market, distribute and sell footwear under the Stanley® brand. The Stanley® Footgear line is designed primarily for and marketed in the value-priced work footwear market. Stanley® Footgear is currently sold in Payless ShoeSource, Inc. stores throughout the United States. 2. The Outdoor Group. The Outdoor Group consists of Merrell® and Sebago® footwear and includes performance outdoor, hiking and nautical footwear as well as casual and after-sport footwear. Merrell® Footwear. The Merrell® product line consists primarily of technical hiking, rugged outdoor and outdoor-inspired casual footwear designed for backpacking, day hiking and everyday use. The Merrell® product line also includes the "After-Sport" category, incorporating Merrell® footwear's technical hiking and outdoor expertise with Wolverine Performance Leathers™ and other technical materials to create footwear with unique styling, performance and comfort features. In spring of 2005, the Outdoor Group launched its tightly-focused Merrell® Continuum™ product offering, featuring four product categories that are organized by end use (Hiking, Active Speed, Multi-Sport, and Aqua Sport). In addition to footwear, the Outdoor Group markets a line of Merrell® FONT> packs, bags and luggage. Merrell® products are sold primarily through outdoor specialty retailers, department stores and catalogs. Merrell® footwear is marketed in over 120 countries worldwide. Sebago® Footwear. The Sebago® product line consists primarily of performance nautical and American-inspired casual footwear for men and women such as 5 handsewn loafers and boat shoes that have been manufactured and distributed since 1946. Highly recognized Sebago® line extensions include Docksides, Drysides and Campsides. The Sebago® product line is distributed in over 85 countries worldwide. The Sebago® manufacturing and design tradition of quality componentry, durability, comfort and "Americana" heritage is further supported by targeted distribution to better-grade independent, marine and department store retailers throughout the world. 3. The Heritage Brands Group. The Heritage Brands Group was formed in 2004 and consists of Caterpillar® Footwear and Harley-Davidson® Footwear. Previously Caterpillar® Footwear was operated as a separate operating unit and Harley-Davidson® Footwear was part of the Wolverine Footwear Group. Caterpillar® Footwear. Pursuant to a license arrangement with Caterpillar Inc., the Company has exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture, market and distribute footwear under the Caterpillar®, CAT & Design®, Walking Machines® and other trademarks. The Company believes the association with CAT® equipment enhances the reputation of its footwear for quality, ruggedness and durability. CAT® brand footwear products include work boots and shoes, sport boots, rugged casuals and lifestyle footwear, including lines of work and casual footwear featuring CAT® iTechnology™ and Hidden Tracks® comfort features. In addition, the Company also manufactures and markets CAT® Marine Power® footwear, designed for industrial and recreational marine uses. CAT® footwear products target work and industrial users and active lifestyle users. CAT® footwear is marketed in over 130 countries worldwide. Harley-Davidson® Footwear. Pursuant to a license arrangement with the Harley-Davidson Motor Company, the Company has the exclusive right to manufacture, market, distribute and sell Harley-Davidson® brand footwear throughout the world. Harley-Davidson® brand footwear products include motorcycle, casual, fashion, work and western footwear for men, women and children. Harley-Davidson® footwear is sold globally through a network of independent Harley-Davidson® dealerships as well as through department stores and specialty retailers. 4. The Hush Puppies Company. Since 1958, the Hush Puppies® brand has been a leader in the casual footwear market. The brand offers shoes and boots for men, women and children, and is sold in over 110 countries. The modern styling is complemented by a variety of comfort features and proprietary technologies that have earned the brand its reputation for comfort. In addition, the Hush Puppies® brand is licensed for use on apparel, eyewear, handbags and plush toys. 5. Other Branded Footwear. The Company designs and manufactures constructed slippers, aftersport footwear, moccasins and children's footwear on a private label basis according to customer specifications. The styling of the Company's footwear reflects consumer demand for the "rugged indoor" look by using natural leathers such as moosehide, shearling and suede in constructed slipper and indoor and outdoor moccasin designs. In addition to its traditional line of private label products, the Company has developed a College Clogs™ program for the sale of licensed collegiate slipper products. 6 Other Businesses. In addition to manufacturing, sourcing, marketing and distributing the Company's footwear products as reported in the Branded Footwear and Licensing segment, the Company also (i) operates a Company-owned pigskin tannery through its Wolverine Leathers Division, (ii) purchases and cures raw pigskins for sale to various customers through its wholly-owned subsidiary Wolverine Procurement, Inc., and (iii) operates 70 domestic retail footwear stores. 1. The Wolverine Leathers Division. The Wolverine Leathers Division produces pigskin leathers primarily for use in the footwear industry. Wolverine Leathers® brand products are primarily manufactured in the Company's pigskin tannery located in Rockford, Michigan. The Company believes these leathers offer superior performance and advantages over cowhide leathers. The Company's waterproof and stain resistant leathers are featured in many of the Company's domestic footwear lines and many products offered by the Company's international licensees and distributors. Wolverine performance leathers are also featured in certain outside brands of athletic and outdoor footwear. 2. Wolverine Procurement, Inc. Wolverine Procurement, Inc. performs skinning operations and purchases raw pigskins from third parties, which it cures and sells to the Wolverine Leathers Division and to outside customers for processing into pigskin leather products. 3. Wolverine Retail. The Company operates 70 domestic retail shoe stores as of February 2005. These stores are under the Hush Puppies and FamilySM and Track'n Trail® names. The Company expects to open new stores under both formats in 2005. Both retail formats carry a large selection of Company branded footwear featuring such brands as Wolverine®, Merrell®, Hush Puppies®, CAT®, Sebago® and Harley-Davidson®. The Company also operates direct-to-customer retail websites, including www.upfootgear.com, www.trackandtrail.com, www.catfootwear.com and www.hushpuppies.com. Marketing. The Company's overall marketing strategy is to develop brand-specific plans and related promotional materials for the United States and international markets to foster a differentiated and consistent image for each of the Company's core footwear brands. Each footwear brand group has its own marketing personnel who develop the marketing strategy for products within that group. Marketing campaigns and strategies vary by brand and may target accounts and/or end users as they strive to increase overall brand awareness for the Company's branded products. The Company's advertisements typically emphasize fashion, comfort, quality, durability, functionality and other performance and lifestyle aspects of the Company's footwear. Components of the brand-specific plans vary and may include print, radio and television advertising, event sponsorships, in-store point of purchase displays, promotional materials, and sales and technical assistance. The Company's footwear brand groups provide its international licensees and distributors with creative direction and materials to convey consistent messages and brand images. Examples of marketing assistance that may be provided by the Company to its licensees and distributors are (i) direction on the categories of footwear to be promoted, (ii) photography and layouts, (iii) broadcast advertising, including commercials and film footage, (iv) point of purchase presentation specifications, blueprints and packaging, (v) sales materials and (vi) consulting on retail store layout and design. The Company believes its footwear brand names provide a competitive advantage and the Company makes significant 7 expenditures on marketing and promotion to support the position of its products and enhance brand awareness. Domestic Sales and Distribution. The Company uses a wide variety of distribution channels to distribute its branded footwear products. To meet the diverse needs of its broad customer base, the Company uses the following distribution strategies.  Traditional wholesale distribution is used to service department stores, large footwear chains, specialty retailers, catalogs, independent retailers and uniform outlets. A dedicated sales force and customer service team, advertising and point of purchase support, and in-stock inventories are used to service these accounts.  Volume direct programs provide branded and private label footwear at competitive prices with limited marketing support. These programs service major retail, mail order, mass merchant and government customers.  A network of independent Shoemobile® distribution outlets is used to distribute the Company's work and occupational footwear at industrial facilities.  The Company solicits all branches of the United States military and enters bids for contracts to supply specific footwear products. In addition to its wholesale activities, the Company also operates a domestic retail operation as described above. The Company continues to develop various programs, both independently and with its retail customers, for the distribution of its products. A broad distribution base insulates the Company from dependence on any one customer. No customer of the Company accounted for more than 10% of the Company's revenue in fiscal 2004. The Company experiences moderate fluctuations in sales volume during the year as reflected in quarterly revenue (and taking into consideration the 16 weeks or 17 weeks included in the fourth accounting period versus the 12 weeks included in the first three accounting periods). The Company also experiences some fluctuation in its levels of working capital, typically including an increase in working capital requirements near the end of the third quarter. The Company provides working capital for such fluctuations through internal financing and through a revolving credit agreement that the Company has in place. The Company expects current seasonal sales patterns to continue in future years. International Operations and Global Licensing. The Company records revenue from foreign sources through a combination of sales of branded footwear products generated from the Company's owned operations in Canada, the United Kingdom, Austria, Finland, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland and from royalty income through a network of independent licensees and distributors. The Company's owned operations include Hush Puppies (UK) Ltd., Merrell Europe B.V., Merrell (Europe) Limited, Wolverine Europe Limited and Wolverine World Wide Corporation, Inc. (formerly known as Hush Puppies Canada Footwear, Ltd.). In addition, in January 2005, the Company's Canadian subsidiary, Wolverine World Wide Corporation, Inc., purchased selected assets of the Canadian CAT and Wolverine footwear businesses from the Company's former independent distributor, Wolverine Canada, Inc.; and also 8 acquired the assets of the Company's Merrell Canada division to centralize its Canadian operations. The Company also acquired selected assets of its Merrell distributors in Sweden and Finland and began direct distribution of Sebago® brand products to retailers in the U.K. and Germany. The Company's owned operations are located in markets where the Company believes it can gain a strategic advantage. The Company derives royalty income from sales of products (primarily Company footwear) bearing the Hush Puppies®, Wolverine®, Bates®, HyTest®, Merrell®, Sebago® and other trademarks by independent distributors and licensees. The Company also derives royalty income from sales of footwear bearing the CAT®, and Harley-Davidson® trademarks through foreign distributors. License and distribution arrangements enable the Company to develop sales in international markets without the capital commitment required to maintain related foreign operations, employees, inventories or localized marketing programs. The Company continues to develop a global network of licensees and distributors to market its footwear brands. The Company assists in designing products that are appropriate to each foreign market but are consistent with the global brand position. Independent licensees and distributors purchase goods from either the Company or authorized third-party manufacturers pursuant to distribution agreements or manufacture branded products consistent with Company standards pursuant to license agreements. Distributors and licensees are responsible for independently marketing and distributing Company branded products in their respective territories, with product and market support provided by the Company. Manufacturing and Sourcing. The Company controls the sourcing and manufacture of approximately 76% of the pairs of footwear marketed under the Company's brand names globally. The balance is controlled directly by the Company's licensees. Of the pairs controlled by the Company, approximately 88% are purchased or sourced from third parties, with the remainder produced at Company-operated facilities. Footwear produced by the Company is manufactured at Company-operated facilities in several domestic and certain affiliated foreign facilities located in Michigan, Arkansas, and the Dominican Republic. For some of the Company-produced footwear, a "twin plant" concept is utilized whereby a majority of the labor intensive cutting and fitting construction of the "upper" portion of shoes and boots is performed at the Company's facilities in the Dominican Republic and Arkansas, and the technology intensive construction, or "bottoming," is performed primarily at the Company's Michigan facilities. The Company's factories each have the flexibility to produce a variety of footwear, which departs from the industry's historical practice of dedicating a given facility to production of specific footwear products. This flexibility allows the Company to quickly respond to changes in market preference and demand. The Company currently produces slippers, military footwear and work, casual and dress casual footwear in its domestic and/or Dominican Republic facilities. The Company sources a majority of its footwear from a variety of foreign manufacturing facilities in the Asia-Pacific region, Central and South America, India and Europe. The Company maintains technical offices in the Asia-Pacific region to facilitate the sourcing and importation of quality footwear. The Company has established guidelines for each of its third-party manufacturers in order to monitor product quality, labor practices and financial viability. In addition, the Company has adopted "Engagement Criteria for Partners & Sources" to require that its domestic and foreign manufacturers, licensees and distributors use ethical business standards, comply with all applicable health and safety laws and regulations, are committed to environmentally safe practices, treat employees fairly with respect to wages, benefits and working conditions, and do not use child or prison labor. 9 The Company's domestic manufacturing operations allow the Company to (i) reduce its production lead time, enabling it to quickly respond to market demand and reduce inventory risk, (ii) lower freight and shipping costs, and (iii) closely monitor product quality. The Company's foreign manufacturing strategy allows the Company to (i) benefit from lower manufacturing costs and state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, (ii) source the highest quality raw materials from around the world, and (iii) avoid additional capital expenditures necessary for owned factories and equipment. The Company believes that its overall global manufacturing strategy gives the Company maximum flexibility to properly balance the need for timely shipments, high quality products and competitive pricing. The Company owns and operates a pigskin tannery through its Wolverine Leathers Division, which is one of the premier tanners of quality leather for the footwear industry. The Company and its licensees receive virtually all of their pigskin requirements from the tannery. The Company believes the tannery provides a strategic advantage for the Company by producing pigskin leather using proprietary technology at prices below those available from other sources. The Company's principal required raw material is quality leather, which it purchases from a select group of domestic and offshore suppliers, including the Company's tannery. The global availability of common upper materials and specialty leathers eliminates any reliance by the Company upon a sole supplier. The Company currently purchases the vast majority of the raw pigskins used in a significant portion of its tannery operations from one domestic source. This source has been a reliable and consistent supplier for over 30 years. Alternative sources of pigskin are available; however the price, processing and/or product characteristics are less advantageous to the Company. The Company purchases all of its other raw materials and component parts from a variety of sources, none of which is believed by the Company to be a dominant supplier. The Company is subject to the normal risks of doing business abroad due to its international operations, including the risk of expropriation, acts of war or terrorism, political disturbances and similar events, the imposition of trade barriers, quotas and tariffs, loss of most favored nation trading status and currency and exchange rate fluctuations. With respect to international sourcing activities, management believes that over a period of time, it could arrange adequate alternative sources of supply for the products currently obtained from its foreign suppliers. A sustained disruption of such sources of supply could have an adverse impact on the Company's operations and financial condition. Trademarks, Licenses and Patents. The Company holds a significant portfolio of registered and common law trademarks that identify its branded footwear products. The owned trademarks that are most widely used by the Company include Hush Puppies®, Wolverine®, Bates®, Wolverine Fusion®, DuraShocks®, Wolverine MultiShox™, Wolverine Compressor™, Hidden Tracks®, iTechnology™, Bounce®, Comfort Curve®, HyTest®, Merrell®, Continuum™, Sebago®, and Track'n Trail®. The Company has obtained license rights to manufacture, market and distribute footwear throughout the world under the CAT&re g; and Harley-Davidson® trademarks, and the right to manufacture, market and distribute footwear in the United States and other countries under the Stanley® trademark, all pursuant to license arrangements with the respective trademark owners. The CAT®, Harley-Davidson®, and Stanley® licenses are long-term and extend for five or more years with conditional renewal options and are subject to early termination for breach. Pigskin leather produced by the Company's Wolverine Leathers Division is sold under the trademarks Wolverine Leathers®, Weather Tight® and All Season Weather Leathers™. The Company believes that its products are identified by consumers by its trademarks and that its trademarks are valuable assets. The Company is not aware of any infringing uses or any prior claims of 10 ownership of its trademarks that could materially affect its current business. It is the policy of the Company to pursue registration of its primary marks whenever possible and to vigorously defend its trademarks against infringement or other threats to the greatest extent practicable under the laws of the United States and other countries. The Company also holds many design and utility patents, copyrights and various other proprietary rights. The Company protects all of its proprietary rights to the greatest extent practicable under applicable laws. Order Backlog. At March 14, 2005, the Company had an order backlog of approximately $326 million compared with an order backlog of approximately $274 million at March 13, 2004. Substantially all of the backlog relates to demand for products expected to be shipped in 2005. Orders in backlog are subject to cancellation by customers and to changes in planned customer demand or at-once orders. The backlog at a particular time is affected by a number of factors, including seasonality, retail conditions, expected customer demand, product availability and the schedule for the manufacture and shipment of products. Accordingly, a comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of eventual actual shipments. Competition. The Company's footwear lines are manufactured and marketed in a highly competitive environment. The Company competes with numerous domestic and foreign marketers, manufacturers and importers of footwear, some of which are larger and have greater resources than the Company. The Company's major competitors for its brands of footwear are located in the United States and Europe. The Company has at least ten major competitors in connection with the sale of its work shoes and boots, at least ten major competitors in connection with the sale of its sport boots, and at least thirty major competitors in connection with the sale of its casual, work and outdoor shoes. Product performance and quality, including technological improvements, product identity, competitive pricing, and the ability to adapt to style changes are all important elements of competition in the footwear markets served by the Company. The footwear industry in general is subject to changes in consumer preferences . The Company strives to maintain its competitive position through promotion of brand awareness, manufacturing efficiencies, its tannery operations, and the style, comfort and value of its products. Future sales by the Company will be affected by its continued ability to sell its products at competitive prices and to meet shifts in consumer preferences. Because of the lack of reliable published statistics, the Company is unable to state with certainty its position in the footwear industry. Market shares in the non-athletic footwear industry are highly fragmented and no one company has a dominant market position. Research and Development. In addition to normal and recurring product development, design and styling activities, the Company engages in research and development related to the development of new production techniques and to improving the function, performance, reliability and quality of its branded footwear and other products. The Company's continuing relationship with the Biomechanics Evaluation Laboratory at Michigan State University, for example, has led to specific biomechanical design concepts, such as Bounce®, DuraShocks® and Hidden Tracks® comfort technologies, that have been incorporated in the Company's footwear. While the Company continues to be a leading developer of footwear innovations, research and development costs do not represent a material portion of operating expenses. 11 Environmental Matters. Compliance with federal, state and local provisions which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment have not had, nor are they expected to have, any material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company uses and generates certain substances and wastes that are regulated or may be deemed hazardous under certain federal, state and local regulations with respect to the environment. The Company from time to time works with federal, state and local agencies to resolve cleanup issues at various waste sites and other regulatory issues. Employees. As of January 1, 2005, the Company had approximately 5,134 domestic and foreign production, office and sales employees. Approximately 640 employees were covered by three union contracts expiring at various dates through May 1, 2006. The Company presently considers its employee relations to be good.
