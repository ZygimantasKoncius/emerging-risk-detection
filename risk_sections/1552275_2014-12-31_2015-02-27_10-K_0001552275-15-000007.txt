Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our BusinessSusser is our largest customer, and we are dependent on Susser for a significant majority of our revenues. Therefore, we are indirectly subject to the business risks of Susser. If Susser changes its business strategy, is unable to satisfy its obligations under our various commercial agreements for any reason, or significantly reduces the volume of motor fuel it purchases under the Susser Distribution Contract, our revenues will decline and our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our unitholders will be adversely affected.For the year ended December 31, 2014, Susser accounted for approximately 60% of our revenues, 20% of our gross profit and 60% of our motor fuel volumes sold. We are the exclusive distributor of motor fuel to Susser’s existing Stripes® convenience stores and independently operated consignment locations pursuant to our long-term, fee based fuel distribution agreement with Susser (the “Susser Distribution Contract”). We are subject to the risk of nonpayment or nonperformance by Susser under the Susser Distribution Contract. Furthermore, the Susser Distribution Contract does not impose any minimum volume obligations 11on Susser and Susser will have a limited ability to remove Stripes® convenience stores from the Susser Distribution Contract. If Susser changes its business strategy or significantly reduces the volume of motor fuel it purchases for its Stripes® convenience stores and independently operated consignment locations, our cash flows will be adversely impacted. Any event, whether in our areas of operation or otherwise, that materially and adversely affects Susser's financial condition, results of operation or cash flows may adversely affect our ability to sustain or increase cash distributions to our unitholders. Accordingly, we are indirectly subject to the operational and business risks of Susser, some which are related to the following:•competitive pressures from convenience stores, gasoline stations, and non-traditional fuel retailers such as supermarkets, club stores and mass merchants located in Susser's markets;•volatility in prices for motor fuel, which could adversely impact consumer demand for motor fuel;•increasing consumer preferences for alternative motor fuels, or improvements in fuel efficiency;•seasonal trends in the convenience store industry, which significantly impact Susser's motor fuel sales;•the impact of severe or unfavorable weather conditions on Susser's facilities or communications networks, or on consumer behavior, travel and convenience store traffic patterns;•cross-border risks associated with the concentration of Susser's stores in markets bordering Mexico;•Susser’s dependence on information technology systems;•Susser's ability to build or acquire and successfully integrate new stores;•the operation of Susser's retail stores in close proximity to stores of our other customers; and•risks relating to Susser's dependence on us for cash flow generation.Finally, we have no control over Susser, our largest source of revenue and our primary customer. Susser may elect to pursue a business strategy that does not favor us and our business. Our general partner and its affiliates, including Susser and ETP, have conflicts of interest with us and limited fiduciary duties and they may favor their own interests to the detriment of us and our unitholders.We may not have sufficient cash from operations following the establishment of cash reserves and payment of costs and expenses, including cost reimbursements to our general partner, to enable us to pay the minimum quarterly distribution to our unitholders.We may not have sufficient cash each quarter to pay the full amount of our minimum quarterly distribution of $0.4375 per unit, or $1.75 per unit per year, which will require us to have available cash of approximately $15.3 million per quarter, or $61.3 million per year, based on the number of common and subordinated units outstanding as of December 31, 2014. The amount of cash we can distribute on our common and subordinated units principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, among other things:•demand for motor fuel in the markets we serve, including seasonal fluctuations in demand for motor fuel;•competition from other companies that sell motor fuel products or have convenience stores in our market areas;•regulatory action affecting the supply of or demand for motor fuel, our operations, our existing contracts or our operating costs;•prevailing economic conditions; and•volatility of prices for motor fuel.In addition, the actual amount of cash we will have available for distribution will depend on other factors including:•the level and timing of capital expenditures we make;12•the cost of acquisitions, if any;•our debt service requirements and other liabilities;•fluctuations in our general working capital needs;•reimbursements made to our general partner and its affiliates for all direct and indirect expenses they incur on our behalf pursuant to the partnership agreement;•our ability to borrow funds at favorable interest rates and access capital markets;•restrictions contained in debt agreements to which we are a party; and•the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner.Our financial condition and results of operations are influenced by changes in the prices of motor fuel, which may adversely impact our margins, our customers' financial condition and the availability of trade credit.Our operating results are influenced by prices for motor fuel, pricing volatility and the market for such products. General economic and political conditions, acts of war or terrorism and instability in oil producing regions, particularly in the Middle East and South America, could significantly impact crude oil supplies and petroleum costs. Significant increases and volatility in petroleum costs could impact consumer demand for motor fuel and convenience merchandise. This volatility makes it extremely difficult to predict the impact future petroleum costs fluctuations will have on our operating results and financial condition. Our recent acquisition of MACS and Aloha increases our exposure to such volatility due to the inherently greater degree of volatility in retail, versus wholesale, motor fuel margins. Additionally, with the consummation of the MACS and Aloha acquisitions, we are now subject to dealer tank wagon pricing structures at certain locations further contributing to margin volatility. A significant change in any of these factors could materially impact both wholesale and retail fuel margins, the volume of motor fuel we distribute or sell at retail, and overall customer traffic, each of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.In addition, when prices for motor fuel rise, some of our customers may have insufficient credit to purchase motor fuel from us at their historical volumes. Higher prices for motor fuel may also reduce our access to trade credit support or cause it to become more expensive. Significant decreases in wholesale motor fuel prices could also result in lower motor fuel gross margins per gallon due to the reduction in value of discounts from our suppliers.Our fuel storage terminals are subject to operational and business risks which, if occur, may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our unitholders. With the acquisition of Aloha, we now own fuel storage terminals in Hawaii. Our fuel storage terminals are subject to operational and business risks, the most significant of which include the following:•our inability to renew a ground lease for certain of our fuel storage terminals on similar terms or at all;•our dependence on third parties to supply our fuel storage terminals;•outages at our fuel storage terminals or interrupted operations due to weather-related or other natural causes; •the threat that the nation’s terminal infrastructure may be a future target of terrorist organizations;•the volatility in the prices of the products stored at our fuel storage terminals and the resulting fluctuations in demand for our storage services; •the effects of a sustained recession or other adverse economic conditions;•the possibility of federal and/or state regulations that may discourage our customers from storing gasoline, diesel fuel, ethanol and jet fuel at our fuel storage terminals or reduce the demand by consumers for petroleum products; •competition from other fuel storage terminals that are able to supply our customers with comparable storage capacity at lower prices; and13•climate change legislation or regulations that restrict emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating and capital costs and reduced demand for our storage services.The occurrence of any of the above situations, among others, may affect the operations at our fuel storage terminals and consequently may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our unitholders.A significant decrease in demand for motor fuel in the areas we serve would reduce our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.A significant decrease in demand for motor fuel in the areas that we serve could significantly reduce our revenues and, therefore, reduce our ability to make or increase distributions to our unitholders. Our revenues are dependent on various trends, such as trends in commercial truck traffic, travel and tourism in our areas of operation, and these trends can change. Furthermore, seasonal fluctuations or regulatory action, including government imposed fuel efficiency standards, may affect demand for motor fuel. Because certain of our operating costs and expenses are fixed and do not vary with the volumes of motor fuel we distribute, our costs and expenses might not decrease ratably or at all should we experience a reduction in our volumes distributed. As a result, we may experience declines in our profit margin if our fuel distribution volumes decrease.We currently depend on limited suppliers for the majority of our motor fuel. A failure by a principal supplier to renew our supply agreement, a disruption in supply or an unexpected change in our supplier relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business.We currently depend on limited principal suppliers for the majority of our motor fuel in each of our operating areas. If any of our principal suppliers elect not to renew their contracts with us, we may be unable to replace the volume of motor fuel we currently purchase from them on similar terms or at all. Moreover, our supply contracts do not guarantee that we will receive all of the volumes that we need to fulfill the demands of our distribution customers. In times of extreme market demand or supply disruption, we may be unable to acquire enough fuel to satisfy the fuel demand of our customers. Furthermore, foreign political events may generally cause a disruption in the price and/or availability of crude oil. In the event fuel supply becomes scarce or unavailable to us in our markets, we may be unable to meet our customers' demand for motor fuel.We currently depend on a limited number of principal suppliers in each of our operating areas for a substantial portion of our merchandise inventory and our products and ingredients for our food service facilities. A disruption in supply or a change in either relationship could have a material adverse effect on our business.We currently depend on a limited number of principal suppliers in each of our operating areas for a substantial portion of our merchandise inventory and our products and ingredients for our food service facilities. If any of our principal suppliers elect not to renew their contracts with us, we may be unable to replace the volume of merchandise inventory and products and ingredients we currently purchase from them on similar terms or at all in those operating areas. Further, a disruption in supply or a significant change in our relationship with any of these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Increasing consumer preferences for alternative motor fuels, or improvements in fuel efficiency, could adversely impact our business.Any technological advancements, regulatory changes or changes in consumer preferences causing a significant shift toward alternative motor fuels, or non-fuel dependent means of transportation, could reduce demand for conventional petroleum based motor fuels. Additionally, a shift toward electric, hydrogen, natural gas or other alternative or non-fuel-powered vehicles could fundamentally change consumers' spending habits or lead to new forms of fueling destinations or new competitive pressures. Finally, new technologies have been developed and governmental mandates have been implemented to improve fuel efficiency. Any of these outcomes could potentially result in decreased consumer demand for motor fuel, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.The wholesale motor fuel distribution industry is characterized by intense competition and fragmentation, and our failure to effectively compete could result in lower margins.The market for distribution of wholesale motor fuel is highly competitive and fragmented, which results in narrow margins. We have numerous competitors, some of which may have significantly greater resources and name recognition than us. We rely on our ability to provide value-added, reliable services and to control our operating costs in order to maintain our margins and 14competitive position. If we were to fail to maintain the quality of our services, certain of our customers could choose alternative distribution sources and our margins could decrease. While major integrated oil companies have generally continued to divest retail sites and the corresponding wholesale distribution to such sites, such major oil companies could shift from this strategy and decide to distribute their own products in direct competition with us, or large customers could attempt to buy directly from the major oil companies. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.The convenience store industry is highly competitive and impacted by new entrants and our failure to effectively compete could result in lower sales and lower margins. The geographic areas in which we operate are highly competitive and marked by ease of entry and constant change in the number and type of retailers offering products and services of the type we sell in our stores. We compete with other convenience store chains, independently owned convenience stores, motor fuel stations, supermarkets, drugstores, discount stores, dollar stores, club stores, mass merchants and local restaurants. Over the past 15 years, several non-traditional retailers, such as supermarkets, hypermarkets, club stores and mass merchants, have impacted the convenience store industry, particularly in the geographic areas in which we operate, by entering the motor fuel retail business. These non-traditional motor fuel retailers have captured a significant share of the motor fuels market, and we expect their market share will continue to grow. In some of our markets, our competitors have been in existence longer and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond better to changes in the economy and new opportunities within the industry. To remain competitive, we must constantly analyze consumer preferences and competitors’ offerings and prices to ensure that we offer a selection of convenience products and services at competitive prices to meet consumer demand. We must also maintain and upgrade our customer service levels, facilities and locations to remain competitive and attract customer traffic to our stores. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and competitive pressures faced by us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.Severe weather could adversely affect our business by damaging our suppliers or our customers' facilities or communications networks.A substantial portion of our wholesale distribution and retail networks are located in regions susceptible to severe storms, including hurricanes. A severe storm could damage our facilities or communications networks, or those of our suppliers or our customers, as well as interfere with our ability to distribute motor fuel to our customers or our customers' ability to operate their locations. If warmer temperatures, or other climate changes, lead to changes in extreme weather events, including increased frequency, duration or severity, these weather-related risks could become more pronounced. Any weather-related catastrophe or disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, potentially causing losses beyond the limits of the insurance we currently carry.Negative events or developments associated with our branded suppliers could have an adverse impact on our revenues.We believe that the success of our operations is dependent, in part, on the continuing favorable reputation, market value and name recognition associated with the motor fuel brands sold at our convenience stores as well as at stores operated by our independent, branded dealers. Erosion of the value of those brands could have an adverse impact on the volumes of motor fuel we distribute, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions to our unitholders.If we are unable to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms from ETP or third parties, our future growth and ability to increase distributions to unitholders will be limited. A portion of our strategy to grow our business and increase distributions to unitholders is dependent on our ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in cash flow. The acquisition component of our growth strategy is based, in large part, on our expectation of ongoing divestitures of retail and wholesale fuel distribution assets by industry participants, including ETP. ETP has no contractual obligations to contribute any assets to us or accept any offer for its assets that we may choose to make. If we are unable to make acquisitions from ETP or third parties for any reason, including if we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts, we are unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, we are outbid by competitors or we or the seller are unable to obtain any necessary consents, our future growth and ability to increase distributions to unitholders will be limited. In addition, if we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources.15Pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement between the Partnership and Susser, upon the closing of our IPO we were granted a three-year option to purchase up to 75 new or recently constructed Stripes® convenience stores from Susser and lease them back to Susser on specified terms set forth in a lease agreement, including a specified lease rate, for an initial term of 15 years. However, such specified terms may not be economically favorable to us in the future, and we may not choose to continue to exercise this option.In addition, we expect to grow through additional sale and leaseback transactions with Susser beyond the option set forth in the Omnibus Agreement. However, Susser is under no obligation to pursue acquisitions with us, enter into additional sale and leaseback arrangements with us or generally pursue projects that enhance the value of our business. Finally, we may complete acquisitions which at the time of completion we believe will be accretive, but which ultimately may not be accretive. If any of these events were to occur, our future growth would be limited.Any acquisitions, including any future contributions to us of assets by ETP, are subject to substantial risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and reduce our ability to make distributions to unitholders.Any acquisitions, including any future contributions to us of assets by ETP, involve potential risks, including, among other things:•the validity of our assumptions about revenues, capital expenditures and operating costs of the acquired business or assets, as well as assumptions about achieving synergies with our existing business;•the validity of our assessment of environmental and other liabilities, including legacy liabilities;•the costs associated with additional debt or equity capital, which may result in a significant increase in our interest expense and financial leverage resulting from any additional debt incurred to finance the acquisition, or the issuance of additional common units on which we will make distributions, either of which could offset the expected accretion to our unitholders from such acquisition and could be exacerbated by volatility in the equity or debt capital markets;•a failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as increased available cash per unit, enhanced competitive position or new customer relationships;•a decrease in our liquidity by using a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity to finance the acquisition; •the incurrence of other significant charges, such as impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges; and•the risk that our existing financial controls, information systems, management resources and human resources will need to grow to support future growth and we may not be able to react timely.Integration of the assets acquired in past acquisitions, future acquisitions, or future contributions by ETP with our existing business will be a complex, time-consuming and costly process, particularly given that the acquired assets will significantly increase our size and diversify the geographic areas in which we operate. A failure to successfully integrate the acquired assets with our existing business in a timely manner may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash available for distribution to our unitholders.The difficulties of integrating Aloha and MACS, future acquisitions, or future contributions by ETP with our business include, among other things:•difficulties operating in a larger combined organization in new geographic areas and new lines of business;•the inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our growing business and assets;•difficulties in integrating management teams and employees into our operations and establishing effective communication and information exchange with such management teams and employees;•the diversion of management’s attention from our existing business;•difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired assets and operations, including additional regulatory programs;16•loss of customers or key employees;•maintaining an effective system of internal controls and integrating internal controls, compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other regulatory compliance and corporate governance matters; and•difficulties integrating new technology systems for financial reporting.If any of these risks or unanticipated liabilities or costs were to materialize, then any desired benefits from past acquisitions, future acquisitions, or contributions by ETP may not be fully realized, if at all, and our future results of operations could be negatively impacted. In addition, the assets acquired may actually perform at levels below the forecasts we used to evaluate the acquired assets, due to factors that are beyond our control. If the acquired assets perform at levels below the forecasts, then our future results of operations could be negatively impacted.Also, our reviews of businesses or assets proposed to be acquired are inherently imperfect because it generally is not feasible to perform an in-depth review of businesses and assets involved in each acquisition given time constraints imposed by sellers. Even a detailed review of assets and businesses may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the assets or businesses to fully assess their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every asset, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken.Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to environmental protection and operational safety that may require significant expenditures or result in liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our business is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the release or discharge of regulated materials into the air, water and soil, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, the exposure of persons to regulated materials, and the health and safety of our employees. A violation of, liability under or noncompliance with these laws or regulations or any future environmental law or regulation, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. With the acquisition of Aloha, we are subject to a number of additional environmental, health and safety programs. In particular, there are a number of environmental and safety programs applicable to the terminals, including programs to respond to spills and emergencies.Regulations under the Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (the “Clean Water Act”), the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA 90”) and state laws impose regulatory burdens on terminal operations. Spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws and state laws require containment to mitigate or prevent contamination of waters in the event of a refined product overflow, rupture, or leak from above-ground pipelines and storage tanks. The Clean Water Act requires us to maintain spill prevention control and countermeasure plans at our terminal facilities with above-ground storage tanks and pipelines. In addition, OPA 90 requires that most fuel transport and storage companies maintain and update various oil spill prevention and oil spill contingency plans. Facilities that are adjacent to water require the engagement of Federally Certified Oil Spill Response Organizations (“OSROs”) to be available to respond to a spill on water from above ground storage tanks or pipelines. In addition, the transportation and storage of refined products over and adjacent to water involves risk and potentially subjects us to strict, joint, and potentially unlimited liability for removal costs and other consequences of an oil spill where the spill is into navigable waters, along shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. In the event of an oil spill into navigable waters, substantial liabilities could be imposed upon us. The Clean Water Act also imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. The Clean Water Act can impose substantial potential liability for the violation of permits or permitting requirements. For example, we may incur costs of up to $7 million or more to install impervious liners within secondary containment facilities at a terminal in Hawaii to bring the terminal properties into compliance with the federal Claim Water Act, which costs, if realized, may have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. In a related matter, Aloha is in negotiations with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the Department of Justice regarding alleged violations of the Clean Water Act related to a spill from one of the same terminals in 2011. It is possible that the final settlement could be greater than $100,000.In addition, the terminal operations and associated facilities are subject to the Clean Air Act and comparable state and local statutes. Under these laws, permits may be required before construction can commence on a new source of potentially significant air emissions, and operating permits may be required for sources that are already constructed. If regulations become more stringent, additional emission control technologies may be required to be installed at our facilities. Any such future obligations could require us to incur significant additional capital or operating costs. For example, Aloha is in settlement discussions with 17EPA and the Department of Justice regarding alleged violations of the New Source Performance Standards under the Clean Air Act. It is likely that the final settlement will be greater than $100,000.Finally, terminal operations are also subject to additional programs and regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”). A violation of, liability under or compliance with these laws or regulations or any future safety laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Compliance with and liability under existing and future local, state and federal environmental regulation, including those that require investigation and remediation activities, may require significant expenditures or result in liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our business is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to underground storage tanks, the release or discharge of regulated materials into the air, water and soil, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, the exposure of persons to regulated materials, and the health and safety of our employees. A violation of, liability under or compliance with these laws or regulations or any future environmental laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.Certain environmental laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), impose strict, and under certain circumstances, joint and several, liability on the owner and operator as well as former owners and operators of properties for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of contamination and also impose liability for any related damages to natural resources without regard to fault. In addition, under CERCLA and similar state laws, as persons who arrange for the transportation, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances, we also may be subject to similar liability at sites where such hazardous substances come to be located. We may also be subject to third-party claims alleging property damage and/or personal injury in connection with releases of or exposure to hazardous substances at, from or in the vicinity of our current or former properties or off-site waste disposal sites. The costs associated with the investigation and remediation of contamination, as well as any associated third party claims, could be substantial, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness. In addition, the presence of, or failure to, remediate identified or unidentified contamination at our properties could potentially materially adversely affect our ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow money using such property as collateral.We are required to make financial expenditures to comply with regulations governing underground storage tanks adopted by federal, state and local regulatory agencies. Compliance with existing and future environmental laws regulating underground storage tank systems of the kind we use may require significant capital expenditures in the future. For example, on September 23, 2014, the EPA sent a revised rulemaking originally proposed in November 2011 to the federal Office of Management and Budget for final review that, once adopted by the EPA, would amend the existing federal underground storage tank rules in a manner that could require us to incur added costs to comply, which costs may be substantial. The EPA currently projects that the revised rulemaking will be adopted by the end of 2015. Expenditures under existing or future laws and regulations may include upgrades, modifications, and the replacement of underground storage tanks and related piping to comply with current and future regulatory requirements designed to ensure the detection, prevention, investigation and remediation of leaks and spills.In addition, the Clean Air Act and similar state laws impose requirements on emissions to the air from motor fueling activities in certain areas of the country, including those that do not meet state or national ambient air quality standards. These laws may require the installation of vapor recovery systems to control emissions of volatile organic compounds to the air during the motor fueling process. While we believe we are in material compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements with respect to underground storage tank systems of the kind we use, the regulatory requirements may become more stringent or apply to an increased number of underground storage tanks in the future, which would require additional, potentially material, expenditures.We are required to comply with federal and state financial responsibility requirements to demonstrate that we have the ability to pay for cleanups or to compensate third parties for damages incurred as a result of a release of regulated materials from our underground storage tank systems. We seek to comply with these requirements by maintaining insurance that we purchase from private insurers and in certain circumstances, rely on applicable state trust funds, which are funded by underground storage tank registration fees and taxes on wholesale purchase of motor fuels. The coverage afforded by each fund varies and is dependent upon the continued maintenance and solvency of each fund. More specifically, in Texas we met our financial responsibility requirements by state trust fund coverage for claims asserted prior to December 1998 (claims reported after that date are ineligible for reimbursement) and all claims covered by the fund were paid by August 31, 2012 when the fund expired. We meet such requirements for claims asserted after December 1998 through insurance that we have obtained from private insurers through December 14, 2014. We became self-insured up to $1.0 million as of December 15, 2014. We have private insurance coverage 18should claims exceed $1.0 million. In Oklahoma and New Mexico, we meet our financial responsibility requirements by state trust fund coverage for cleanup liability and meet the requirements for third-party liability through private insurance. In Tennessee and Georgia, our financial responsibility requirements are covered under the state trust fund up to the fund limits backed by private insurance for those sites where cleanup costs exceed the coverage of the fund and meet the requirements for third-party liability through private insurance. The sites in Virginia are covered under the state fund for site cleanup, backed by parental guarantees and private insurance at sites where the cleanup costs exceed fund limits and private insurance for third-party claims. Finally, in Maryland, we meet our financial responsibility requirements through private insurance for both cleanup costs and third-party claims.We are currently responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at a number of our current and former properties. We are entitled to reimbursement for certain of these costs under various third-party contractual indemnities, and insurance policies, subject to eligibility requirements, deductibles, per incident, annual and aggregate caps. To the extent third parties (including insurers) do not pay for investigation and remediation as we anticipate, and/or insurance is not available, we will be obligated to make these additional payments, which could materially adversely affect our business, liquidity and results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.We believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental requirements; however, we cannot ensure that violations of these requirements will not occur in the future. Although we have a comprehensive environmental, health and safety program, we may not have identified all of the environmental liabilities at all of our current and former locations; material environmental conditions not known to us may exist; existing and future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material environmental liability or compliance costs on us; or we may be required to make material environmental expenditures for remediation of contamination that has not been discovered at existing locations or locations that we may acquire.Furthermore, new laws, new interpretations of existing laws, increased governmental enforcement of existing laws or other developments could require us to make additional capital expenditures or incur additional liabilities. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern the product quality specifications of the refined petroleum products we purchase, store, transport and sell to our distribution customers.Various federal, state and local government agencies have the authority to prescribe specific product quality specifications for certain commodities, including commodities that we distribute. Changes in product quality specifications, such as reduced sulfur content in refined petroleum products, or other more stringent requirements for fuels, could reduce our ability to procure product, require us to incur additional handling costs and/or require the expenditure of capital. If we are unable to procure product or recover these costs through increased sales, we may not be able to meet our financial obligations. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial penalties.The dangers inherent in the storage of motor fuel could cause disruptions in our operations and could expose us to potentially significant losses, costs or liabilities.We store motor fuel in underground and above ground storage tanks. Our operations are subject to significant hazards and risks inherent in storing motor fuel. These hazards and risks include, but are not limited to, fires, explosions, spills, discharges and other releases, any of which could result in distribution difficulties and disruptions, environmental pollution, governmentally-imposed fines or clean-up obligations, personal injury or wrongful death claims and other damage to our properties and the properties of others. Any such event could significantly disrupt our operations or expose us to significant liabilities, to the extent such liabilities are not covered by insurance. Therefore, the occurrence of such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.We may be subject to adverse publicity resulting from concerns over food quality, product safety, health or other negative events or developments that could cause consumers to avoid our retail locations. We may be the subject of complaints or litigation arising from food-related illness or product safety which could have a negative impact on our business. Negative publicity, regardless of whether the allegations are valid, concerning food quality, food safety or other health concerns, food service facilities, employee relations or other matters related to our operations may materially adversely affect demand for our food and other products and could result in a decrease in customer traffic to our retail stores. It is critical to our reputation that we maintain a consistent level of high quality at our food service facilities and other franchise or fast food offerings. Health concerns, poor food quality or operating issues stemming from one store or a limited 19number of stores could materially and adversely affect the operating results of some or all of our stores and harm our company-owned brands, continuing favorable reputation, market value and name recognition.We are not fully insured against all risks incident to our business.We are not fully insured against all risks incident to our business. We may be unable to obtain or maintain insurance with the coverage that we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, the premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased and could continue to do so. Certain insurance coverage could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions to our unitholders.Future litigation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We are exposed to various litigation claims in the ordinary course of our wholesale business operations, including dealer litigation and industry-wide or class-action claims arising from the equipment or processes we use or employ or industry-specific business practices. If we were to become subject to any such claims in the future, our defense costs and any resulting awards or settlement amounts may not be fully covered by our insurance policies. Additionally, our retail operations are characterized by a high volume of customer traffic and by transactions involving a wide array of product selections. These operations carry a higher exposure to consumer litigation risk when compared to the operations of companies operating in many other industries. Consequently, we are frequently party to individual personal injury, bad fuel, products liability and other legal actions in the ordinary course of our business. While we believe these actions are generally routine in nature, incidental to the operation of our business and immaterial in scope, if our assessment of any action or actions should prove inaccurate our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Additionally, we are occasionally exposed to industry-wide or class-action claims arising from the products we carry, the equipment or processes we use or employ or industry-specific business practices. In recent years several retailers have also experienced data breaches resulting in exposure of sensitive customer data, including payment card information. Any such breach of our systems, or any failure to secure our systems against such a breach, could expose us to customer litigation, as well as sanctions from the payment card industry. Retailers have also increasingly become targets of certain types of patent litigation by “non-practicing entities” who acquire intellectual property rights solely for purposes of instituting mass litigation.While industry-specific or class action litigation of this type is less frequent in occurrence than individual consumer claims, the cost of defense and ultimate disposition may be material to our financial condition, results of operation and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.We rely on our suppliers to provide trade credit terms to adequately fund our ongoing operations.Our business is impacted by the availability of trade credit to fund fuel purchases. An actual or perceived downgrade in our liquidity or operations (including any credit rating downgrade by a rating agency) could cause our suppliers to seek credit support in the form of additional collateral, limit the extension of trade credit, or otherwise materially modify their payment terms. Any material changes in our payments terms, including early payment discounts, or availability of trade credit provided by our principal suppliers could impact our liquidity, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.Because we depend on our senior management's experience and knowledge of our industry, we could be adversely affected were we to lose key members of our senior management team.We are dependent on the expertise and continued efforts of our general partner's senior management team. If, for any reason, our senior executives do not continue to be active in our management, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. We do not maintain key man life insurance for our senior executives or other key employees.Terrorist attacks and threatened or actual war may adversely affect our business.Our business is affected by general economic conditions and fluctuations in consumer confidence and spending, which can decline as a result of numerous factors outside of our control. Terrorist attacks or threats, whether within the United States or abroad, rumors or threats of war, actual conflicts involving the United States or its allies, or military or trade disruptions impacting our suppliers or our customers may adversely impact our operations. Specifically, strategic targets such as energy related assets (which could include refineries that produce the motor fuel we purchase or ports in which crude oil is delivered) may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other targets in the United States. These occurrences could have an adverse impact on energy prices, including prices for motor fuels, and an adverse impact on our operations. Any or a combination of these occurrences could 20have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.We rely on our information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of our business, and a disruption of these systems or an act of cyber-terrorism could adversely affect our business.We depend on our information technology (IT) systems to manage numerous aspects of our business transactions and provide analytical information to management. Our IT systems are an essential component of our business and growth strategies, and a serious disruption to our IT systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently. These systems are vulnerable to, among other things, damage and interruption from power loss or natural disasters, computer system and network failures, loss of telecommunications services, physical and electronic loss of data, cyber-security breaches or cyber-terrorism, and computer viruses. Any disruption could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and cause our operating results to be reduced.Our future debt levels may impair our financial condition.We had $870.5 million of debt outstanding as of December 31, 2014. We have the ability to incur additional debt under our revolving credit facility. The level of our future indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including:•making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility;•limiting our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, the execution of our growth strategy and other activities;•requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest on our debt, which would reduce our cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, execution of our growth strategy and other activities;•making us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic conditions, our industry and government regulations and in our business by limiting our flexibility in planning for, and making it more difficult for us to react quickly to, changing conditions; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have less debt.In addition, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to repay our indebtedness when it becomes due and to meet other cash needs. Our ability to service our debt will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, our ability to service our debt will depend on market interest rates, since we anticipate that the interest rates applicable to our borrowings will fluctuate. If we are not able to pay our debts as they become due, we will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness or selling additional debt or equity securities. We may not be able to refinance our debt or sell additional debt or equity securities or our assets on favorable terms, if at all, and if we must sell our assets, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenues.Increases in interest rates could reduce the amount of cash we have available for distributions as well as the relative value of those distributions to yield-oriented investors, which could cause a decline in the market value of our common units.Approximately $723.6 million of our outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2014 bears interest at variable interest rates. Should those rates rise, the amount of cash we would otherwise have available for distribution would ordinarily be expected to decline, which could impact our ability to maintain or grow our quarterly distributions. Additionally, an increase in interest rates in lower risk investment alternatives--such as United States treasury securities--could cause investors to demand a relatively higher distribution yield on our common units, which, unless we are able to raise our distribution, would imply a lower trading price of our common units. Consequently, rising interest rates could cause a significant decline in the market value of our common units.21Our credit facility has substantial restrictions and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.We are dependent upon the earnings and cash flow generated by our operations in order to meet our debt service obligations and to allow us to make cash distributions to our unitholders. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our credit facility and any future financing agreements may restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, to engage in or expand our business activities or to pay distributions to our unitholders. For example, our credit facility restricts our ability to, among other things:•Incur certain additional indebtedness;•Incur, permit, or assume certain liens to exist on our properties or assets;•Make certain investments or enter into certain restrictive material contracts; and•Merge or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.In addition, our credit agreement contains covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios. See Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional information.Our future ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our operations and other events or circumstances beyond our control. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If we violate any provisions of our new credit facility that are not cured or waived within the appropriate time period provided in the credit facility, a significant portion of our indebtedness may become immediately due and payable, our ability to make distributions to our unitholders will be inhibited and our lenders' commitment to make further loans to us may terminate. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.We depend on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries.We are a holding company with no material assets other than the equity interests in our subsidiaries. We have eight subsidiaries that conduct all of our operations and own all of our assets. These subsidiaries are distinct legal entities and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries and our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to us. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to meet our financial obligations or make distributions to our unitholders.The impact of derivatives legislation by the United States Congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of changes in commodity prices and interest rates and other risks associated with our business.The United States Congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law on July 21, 2010 and requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”), the SEC and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation. The CFTC has issued final regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalent. Certain bona fide hedging transactions or positions would be exempt from these position limits. The financial reform legislation may also require compliance with margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade-execution requirements in connection with certain derivative activities, although the application of those provisions is uncertain at this time. The financial reform legislation may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty.The final rules will be phased in over time according to a specified schedule which is dependent on the finalization of certain other rules to be promulgated jointly by the CFTC and the SEC. The Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of some derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of some derivative contracts, reduce the availability of some derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and potentially 22increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.Risks Related To Our StructureETP owns and controls our general partner, which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations. Our general partner and its affiliates, including ETP, have conflicts of interest with us and limited fiduciary duties and they may favor their own interests to the detriment of us and our unitholders.ETP owns and controls our general partner and appoints all of the officers and directors of our general partner. Although our general partner has a fiduciary duty to manage us in a manner beneficial to us and our unitholders, the executive officers and directors of our general partner have a fiduciary duty to manage our general partner in a manner beneficial to ETP. Therefore, conflicts of interest may arise between ETP and its affiliates, including our general partner, on the one hand, and us and our unitholders, on the other hand. In resolving these conflicts of interest, our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of our common unitholders. These conflicts include the following situations, among others:•Neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires ETP or Susser to pursue a business strategy that favors us. The affiliates of our general partner have fiduciary duties to make decisions in their own best interests and in the best interest of their owners, which may be contrary to our interests. In addition, our general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us or our unitholders, such as ETP or Susser, in resolving conflicts of interest, which has the effect of limiting its fiduciary duty to our unitholders.•Certain officers and directors of our general partner are officers or directors of affiliates of our general partner, and also devote significant time to the business of these entities and are compensated accordingly.•Other than as provided in the Omnibus Agreement, affiliates of our general partner, including ETP, are not limited in their ability to compete with us and may offer business opportunities or sell assets to parties other than us. •Our partnership agreement provides that our general partner may, but is not required, in connection with its resolution of a conflict of interest, to seek “special approval” of such resolution by appointing a conflicts committee of the general partner’s board of directors composed of one or more independent directors to consider such conflicts of interest and to either, itself, take action or recommend action to the board of directors, and any resolution of the conflict of interest by the conflicts committee shall be conclusively deemed to be approved by our unitholders.•Except in limited circumstances, our general partner has the power and authority to conduct our business without unitholder approval.•Our general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, borrowings, repayment of indebtedness and issuances of additional partnership securities and the level of reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders.•Our general partner determines the amount and timing of any capital expenditure and whether a capital expenditure is classified as a maintenance capital expenditure or an expansion capital expenditure. These determinations can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders which, in turn, affects the ability of the subordinated units to convert to common units. •Our general partner may cause us to borrow funds in order to permit the payment of cash distributions, even if the purpose or effect of the borrowing is to make a distribution on the subordinated units, to make incentive distributions or to accelerate the expiration of the subordination period.•Our partnership agreement permits us to distribute up to $25 million as operating surplus, even if it is generated from asset sales, non-working capital borrowings or other sources that would otherwise constitute capital surplus. This cash may be used to fund distributions on our subordinated units or the incentive distribution rights.•Our general partner determines which costs incurred by it and its affiliates are reimbursable by us.23•Our partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with its affiliates on our behalf. There is no limitation on the amounts our general partner can cause us to pay it or its affiliates.•Our general partner has limited its liability regarding our contractual and other obligations.•Our general partner may exercise its right to call and purchase common units if it and its affiliates own more than 80% of the common units.•Our general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by it and its affiliates. In addition, our general partner will decide whether to retain separate counsel or others to perform services for us.•ETP may elect to cause us to issue common units to it in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to ETP's incentive distribution rights without the approval of the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner or our unitholders. This election may result in lower distributions to our common unitholders in certain situations.Our general partner has limited its liability regarding our obligations. Other than with respect to our new credit facilities, our general partner has limited its liability under contractual arrangements so that the counterparties to such arrangements have recourse only against our assets, and not against our general partner or its assets. Our general partner may therefore cause us to incur indebtedness or other obligations that are nonrecourse to our general partner. Our partnership agreement provides that any action taken by our general partner to limit its liability is not a breach of our general partner's fiduciary duties, even if we could have obtained more favorable terms without the limitation on liability. In addition, we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify our general partner to the extent that it incurs obligations on our behalf. Any such reimbursement or indemnification payments would reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders.Our general partner may, in its sole discretion, approve the issuance of partnership securities and specify the terms of such partnership securities.Pursuant to our partnership agreement, our general partner has the ability, in its sole discretion and without the approval of our unitholders, to approve the issuance of securities by the Partnership at any time and to specify the terms and conditions of such securities. The securities authorized to be issued may be issued in one or more classes or series, with such designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties (which may be senior to existing classes and series of partnership securities), as shall be determined by our general partner, including:•the right to share in Partnership’s profits and losses;•the right to share in the Partnership’s distributions;•the rights upon dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership;•whether, and the terms upon which, the Partnership may redeem the securities;•whether the securities will be issued, evidenced by certificates and assigned or transferred; and •the right, if any, of the security to vote on matters relating to the Partnership, including matters relating to the relative rights, preferences and privileges of such security.Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash, which could limit our ability to grow and make acquisitions.Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash to our unitholders, and we will rely primarily upon external financing sources, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund our acquisitions and expansion capital requirements. As a result, to the extent we are unable to finance growth externally, our cash distribution policy will significantly impair our ability to grow.In addition, because we distribute all of our available cash, our growth may not be as fast as that of businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations. To the extent we issue additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level. There are no limitations in our partnership agreement or our credit facility on our ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of bank borrowings or 24other debt to finance our growth strategy will result in increased interest expense, which, in turn, may impact the available cash that we have to distribute to our unitholders.Our partnership agreement limits the liability and duties of our general partner and restricts the remedies available to us and our common unitholders for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. Our partnership agreement limits the liability and duties of our general partner, while also restricting the remedies available to our common unitholders for actions that, without these limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. Delaware partnership law permits such contractual reductions of fiduciary duty. By purchasing common units, common unitholders consent to be bound by the partnership agreement, and pursuant to our partnership agreement, each holder of common units consents to various actions and conflicts of interest contemplated in our partnership agreement that might otherwise constitute a breach of fiduciary or other duties under Delaware law. Our partnership agreement contains provisions that reduce the standards to which our general partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law. For example:•Our partnership agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to its capacity as general partner. This entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires, and it has no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, our common unitholders. Decisions made by our general partner in its individual capacity will be made by ETP, as the owner of our general partner, and not by the board of directors of our general partner. Examples of these decisions include: •Whether to exercise its limited call right; •How to exercise its voting rights with respect to any units it may own; •Whether to exercise its registration rights; and •Whether or not to consent to any merger or consolidation or amendment to our partnership agreement. •Our partnership agreement provides that our general partner will not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as general partner so long as it acted in good faith, meaning it believed that the decisions were not adverse to the interests of our partnership. •Our partnership agreement provides that our general partner and the officers and directors of our general partner will not be liable for monetary damages to us for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that our general partner or those persons acted in bad faith or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that such person's conduct was criminal. •Our partnership agreement provides that our general partner will not be in breach of its obligations under the partnership agreement or its duties to us or our limited partners with respect to any transaction involving an affiliate if the transaction with an affiliate or the resolution of a conflict of interest is: •approved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner, although our general partner is not obligated to seek such approval; or •approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding common units, excluding any common units owned by our general partner and its affiliates; or •the board of directors of our general partner acted in good faith in taking any action or failing to act. If an affiliate transaction or the resolution of a conflict of interest is not approved by our common unitholders or the conflicts committee then it will be presumed that, in making its decision, taking any action or failing to act, the board of directors acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner or the partnership, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption.Cost reimbursements due to our general partner and its affiliates for services provided to us or on our behalf will reduce cash available for distribution to our unitholders. The amount and timing of such reimbursements will be determined by our general partner. Prior to making any distribution on the common units, we will reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all expenses they incur and payments they make on our behalf pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement and our partnership agreement. Neither our partnership agreement nor our Omnibus Agreement will limit the amount of expenses for which our general partner and its affiliates may be reimbursed. Our Omnibus Agreement and partnership agreement provide that our general partner will 25determine in good faith the expenses that are allocable to us. The reimbursement of expenses and payment of fees to our general partner and its affiliates will reduce the amount of cash available to pay cash distributions to our unitholders. Item 1B.
