RISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE COMPANY: WE HAVE THREE CUSTOMERS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR REVENUES. THE LOSS OF ANY OF THESE CUSTOMERS OR A MATERIAL DECREASE IN THE QUANTITY OF SALES TO ANY OF THEM COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND REVENUES. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, three customers represented approximately 44%, 37% and 52%, respectively, of our sales. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 one customer accounted for 24%, 13% and 24%, respectively, of our sales. In June 2006 we were notified by this customer that due to a redesign of its system, it would no longer require the products that it has been purchasing from us over the last years and would therefore cease the purchase of most of our products as of the fourth quarter of 2006. We expect that we will continue to be dependent upon a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues. We do not have long-term purchase contracts with our customers and our sales arrangements with them do not have minimum purchase requirements. 6 We cannot assure that these customers will continue to buy our products at all or in the same volumes or on the same terms as they have in the past. Their failure to do so may significantly reduce our sales. In addition, we cannot assure that we will be able to attract new customers. The loss of any of these customers or a material decrease in the quantity of sales to any of them, or a material adverse change in the terms of such sales, or a material adverse change in the financial conditions of our principal customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and revenues. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE WITH LARGER INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES; AS A SMALLER COMPANY WE MAY LACK THE OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL, MARKETING, HUMAN, AND OTHER RESOURCES NEEDED TO MAINTAIN OR CAPTURE INCREASED MARKET SHARE; OUR REVENUES MAY DECREASE AS OUR COMPETITORS INTRODUCE EQUIVALENT PRODUCTS. The segment of the market in which we compete is characterized by a high degree of fragmentation. Companies concentrate their development and sales efforts on specific small market niches because many customers, especially OEMs, require high levels of support and technical expertise. Competition is primarily on the basis of cost, performance, capabilities, reliability, support, and safety. Many of our competitors are international companies with significantly larger operations and greater financial, marketing, human, and other resources than ours, which may give them competitive advantages, such as the ability to market their products in larger quantities and at lower prices than us. Our sales and our sale prices may decline significantly as our competitors introduce equivalent or superior products. Our overall profitability depends on our ability to continuously introduce new advanced products at competitive prices. We may not be able to introduce new advanced products on a timely basis. In addition, many of our competitors are moving their manufacturing facilities to countries where the cost of production is significantly lower than in Israel and the United States, where we produce most of our products, thus decreasing their cost and thereby the sale price of their products. OUR ABILITY TO STAY COMPETITIVE AND OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS LARGELY ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE ADDITIONAL MOTION CONTROL PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY MANNER. Our ability to stay competitive and future results of operations depend, to a significant degree, upon our ability to successfully develop additional products and achieve increased market penetration. We must develop, test and manufacture products and prove that our products are competitive from both the technological and cost aspects. Our products must meet industry standards in the geographical regions in which we operate. The development and commercialization process of our products is both time-consuming and costly and involves business risks. Our future products, if and when fully developed and tested, may not perform as we expect or compete successfully with products developed by our competitors. Further, there can be no assurance that the cost of our future development efforts will not materially increase due to technological or other advancements. WE DEPEND ON KEY SUPPLIERS FOR THE SUPPLY OF ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS FOR OUR PRODUCTS. IF ANY OF OUR KEY SUPPLIERS WILL SUPPLY US COMPONENTS ON LESS FAVORABLE TERMS, OR WILL STOP SUPPLYING SUCH COMPONENTS TO US AT ALL, OUR PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. We depend on the supply of essential components in our motion control systems by suppliers who are the single source of supply of such items. Among such components are processors, servo processors, and other motion controller components. As we have no supply agreements with these companies, we cannot guarantee that such suppliers will continue to make such components, will continue to supply us with such components on favorable terms, or will supply such components to us at all, in the future. The lack of guaranteed supply arrangements can result in delays in obtaining components from time to time. In any such event, our production capabilities could be materially adversely affected. 7 THE DOLLAR COST OF OUR OPERATIONS IN ISRAEL WILL INCREASE TO THE EXTENT INCREASES IN THE RATE OF INFLATION IN ISRAEL ARE NOT OFFSET BY A DEVALUATION OF THE NIS IN RELATION TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, WHICH WOULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Since a considerable portion of our expenses such as employees' salaries are linked to an extent to rate of inflation in Israel, the dollar cost of our operations is influenced by the extent any increase in the rate of inflation in Israel is or is not offset by the devaluation of the NIS in relation to the dollar. As a result, we are exposed to the risk that the NIS, after adjustment for inflation in Israel, will appreciate in relation to the dollar. In that event, the dollar cost of our operations in Israel will increase and our dollar-measured results of operations will be adversely affected. In 2006 the inflation adjusted NIS appreciated against the dollar, which raised the dollar cost of our Israeli operations. We cannot predict whether in the future the NIS will appreciate against the dollar or vice versa. Any increase in the rate of inflation in Israel, unless the increase is offset on a timely basis by a devaluation of the NIS in relation to the dollar, will increase labor and other costs, which will increase the dollar cost of our operations in Israel and harm our results of operations. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CURRENCY FLUCTUATION. The U.S. Dollar cost of our operations in Israel is influenced by the differential between the rate of inflation in Israel and any change in the value of the NIS in relation to the U.S. Dollar. Our U.S. Dollar costs will increase if this "gap" widens and the devaluation rate fails to keep pace with the rate of inflation in Israel, and conversely, we may benefit if the rate at which Israeli currency devalues against the U.S. Dollar exceeds the rate of inflation in Israel. In the years ending December 31, 2006, 2005 2004, 2003 and 2002, the annual inflation rate in Israel as adjusted for the devaluation of the Israeli currency in relation to the U.S. Dollar was 6.9%, (4.5)%, 2.8%, 5.7% and (0.8)%, respectively. The closing representative exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar at the end of each such period, as reported by the Bank of Israel, was NIS 4.225, NIS 4.603, NIS 4.308, NIS 4.379 and NIS 4.737, respectively. As a result, we experienced increases in the U.S. Dollar costs of operations in Israel in 2006, 2004 and 2003, and decreases in 2005 and 2002. We cannot assure you that we will not be materially adversely affected if inflation in Israel exceeds the devaluation of the NIS against the U.S. Dollar or if the timing of such devaluation lags behind increases in inflation in Israel. We do not currently, and have no plans to, utilize currency hedging instruments, and we do not hold or issue derivative securities. OWNERSHIP OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES IS CONCENTRATED WHICH MAY DELAY, IMPEDE OR DISCOURAGE A TRANSACTION BENEFICIAL TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. As of February 28, 2006, Ze'ev Kirshenboim, our Chairman of the Board of the Directors and Chief Financial Officer, beneficially owned approximately 23% of our outstanding ordinary shares, and Jacob Engel, one of our directors and a brother-in-law to Mr. Kirshenboim, beneficially owned approximately 18% of our ordinary shares. The concentration of our share ownership may: o delay or prevent a change in control of the company; o impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other transaction involving the company; or o discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the company. 8 OUR TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGNS ARE NOT PROTECTED BY PATENTS; THE SUCCESS OF OUR PRODUCTS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY DEFEND OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; OUR TECHNOLOGY MAY BE FOUND TO INFRINGE UPON THE PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS, WHICH COULD CAUSE US TO LOSE MARKET SHARE, LIMIT OUR GROWTH, REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY, AND INCREASE OUR OPERATING EXPENSES. Our ability to compete effectively depends, and will depend, in large part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our products and technologies. We currently do not hold, have not filed for, and have no intention of filing for, patent protection in any country with respect to our proprietary technology. We depend on trade secret laws, copyright law, unfair competition law and upon the execution by our officers, directors, employees, consultants, and subcontractors of confidentiality agreements relating to the proprietary nature of our technology to protect our intellectual property. Confidentiality agreements do not, however, provide complete protection, and to the extent that these intellectual property and other laws do not adequately protect our technology, others may independently develop our know-how and information or otherwise design around the confidentiality agreements entered with us. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in deterring others from developing or marketing, legally or otherwise, competitive products utilizing our proprietary designs and technologies, which could cause us to lose market share, limit our growth, reduce our profitability, and increase our operating expenses. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our technology will not be found to infringe upon the patents or other intellectual property rights of others. If we should be found to infringe upon the patents or otherwise impermissibly utilize the intellectual property of others, our ability to utilize our technology could be materially restricted or prohibited. In such event we may be required to obtain licenses from such third parties or otherwise redesign our products so as not to utilize such intellectual property, each of which may be uneconomical or otherwise impossible. We cannot assure you that any license required under any such patents or proprietary rights could be obtained on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The trend toward litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the technology industry exposes us to litigation by third parties. Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks. REAL OR PERCEIVED FUTURE SALES OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES IN THE PUBLIC MARKET AND LOW TRADING VOLUME COULD CAUSE OUR SHARE PRICE TO SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINE, OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS. As of the date of this annual report we have approximately 3.3 million ordinary shares outstanding. Approximately 41% of these shares are "restricted securities" available for resale, subject, however, to volume limitations under Rule 144. Future sales of these restricted shares, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares. In addition, we have experienced a low trading volume of our ordinary shares, and if one or a small number of parties buys or sells a large number of our ordinary shares, we may experience volatility in our share price and our share price may significantly decline. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our ordinary shares or other securities. OUR SHARE PRICE HAS FLUCTUATED IN THE PAST AND MAY CONTINUE TO FLUCTUATE IN THE FUTURE. The market price of our ordinary shares has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly. The market price of our ordinary shares may be significantly affected by factors such as the announcements of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors, technological innovations by us or our competitors or quarterly variations in our results of operations. 9 In addition, any statements or changes in estimates by analysts covering our shares or relating to the motion control systems industry could result in an immediate effect that may be adverse on the market price of our shares. Trading in shares of companies listed on the Nasdaq Capital in general, and trading in shares of technology companies in particular, has been subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations that have been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance. These factors may depress the market price of our ordinary shares, regardless of our actual operating performance. Securities litigation has also often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. In the future, we may be the target of similar litigation that could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management's attention and resources. OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN PROFESSIONAL PERSONNEL. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN PERSONNEL WITH NECESSARY SKILLS WHEN NEEDED, OUR BUSINESS AND EXPANSION PLANS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. Our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel is critical to our operations and expansion, especially our research and development and marketing capabilities. We face competition for such personnel from other companies and organizations, many of which have significantly larger operations and greater financial, marketing, human, and other resources than we do. Due to the high level of mobility in our industry, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to retain key personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain personnel with necessary skills when needed, our business and expansion plans could be materially adversely affected. RISKS FACTORS RELATED TO THE INDUSTRY: ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS AND CYCLICAL NATURE OF SPECIFIC MARKET SEGMENTS THAT WE TARGET COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN SALES. Our products are designed especially for segments within the industrial sector for systems such as advanced medical scanners, printing machinery, electronic manufacturing and inspection, LCD monitors, and semi-conductor manufacturing and inspection equipment. A slowdown in certain geographical regions such as Western Europe, the Far East and the United States, or in certain industries, such as the electronic and semiconductors industries, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. The manufacturing of motion control systems for the semiconductor and electronic industry is our most significant field of activity, amounting to approximately 61% of our sales. Approximately 23% of our revenues are derived from the medical scanning industry, 10% from the printing industry, and another 6% to others, such as the general automation industry. The semiconductor and electronics industry, which comprised approximately 61% of our revenues, is highly volatile and unpredictable, and we are subject to the industry's business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which are difficult to predict. We must effectively manage our resources and production capacity to meet changing demand. During periods of decreasing demand for motion control products, we must be able to appropriately align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions and effectively manage our supply chain. During periods of increasing demand, we must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand and must be able to effectively manage our supply chain. If we are not able to timely and appropriately align our cost structure with business conditions and/or to effectively manage our resources and production capacity, including our supply chain during changes in demand, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 10 TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES MAY HINDER OUR GROWTH AND RESULT IN DECREASED SALES. The motion control industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological change. Our ability to compete successfully depends, and will continue to depend, in large part, on our ability to maintain a technically competent staff, to maintain rigorous quality control procedures, and to adapt to technological changes and advances in the motion control industry. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain such staff or keep pace with the technological demands of the marketplace. In the event that we are unable to maintain such staff or otherwise keep pace with the technological demands of the marketplace, we might lose market share, and our prospects and sales could be materially adversely affected. BECAUSE WE OPERATE IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL RISKS. We currently sell our products in a number of countries and we are considering entering additional geographic markets, such as the Chinese market. Our business is subject to risks, which often characterize international markets, including: o potentially weak protection of intellectual property rights; o economic and political instability; o import or export licensing requirements; o trade restrictions; o difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; o longer payment cycles; o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs; o seasonal reductions in business activities in some parts of the world, such as during the summer months in Europe; o fluctuations in exchange rates; and o potentially adverse tax consequences. RISKS FACTORS RELATED TO OUR LOCATION: WE RECEIVE TAX BENEFITS FROM THE STATE OF ISRAEL THAT MAY BE REDUCED OR ELIMINATED IN THE FUTURE. THE TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF THE TAX BENEFITS, PARTICULARLY BENEFITS AVAILABLE TO US AS A RESULT OF THE APPROVED ENTERPRISE STATUS OF OUR FACILITY IN ISRAEL, WOULD INCREASE OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. Our investment program at our manufacturing facility in Migdal Ha'emek, Israel has been granted approved enterprise status by the State of Israel and we are therefore eligible for tax benefits under the Israeli Law for Encouragement of Capital Investments. By virtue of our approved enterprise status, a portion of our income is tax-exempt. From time to time, the government of Israel has discussed reducing or eliminating the tax benefits available to approved enterprise programs such as ours. We cannot assure you that these tax benefits will be continued in the future at their current levels or at all. If these tax benefits were reduced or eliminated, particularly benefits available to us as a result of the Approved Enterprise status of some of our facility in Israel, the amount of taxes that we pay would likely increase, which in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our net income. In addition, our approved enterprise status imposes certain requirements on us, such as the location of our manufacturing facility and the location of certain subcontractors. If we do not meet these requirements, the law permits the authorities to cancel the tax benefits retroactively. See Item 10 "Additional Information Taxation." 11 THE GOVERNMENT GRANTS WE HAVE RECEIVED FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS AND TRANSFER TECHNOLOGIES OUTSIDE OF ISRAEL AND REQUIRE US TO SATISFY SPECIFIED CONDITIONS. IF WE FAIL TO SATISFY THESE CONDITIONS, WE MAY REQUIRED TO REFUND GRANTS PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED TOGETHER WITH INTEREST AND PENALTIES. From 1988 to 2006, we received grants totaling approximately $4.17 million from the government of Israel through the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Ministry of Industry and Trade for the financing of portion of our research and development expenditures. The terms of the Chief Scientist grants prohibit us from manufacturing products or transferring technologies developed using these grants outside of Israel without special approvals. Even if we receive approval to manufacture the Chief Scientist supported products outside of Israel, we would be required to pay an increased total amount of royalties, which may be up to 300% of the grant amount plus interest, depending on the manufacturing volume that is performed outside of Israel. This restriction may impair our ability to outsource manufacturing or engage in similar arrangement for those products or technologies. In addition, we are prohibited from transferring to third parties in Israel the technology developed with these grants without the prior approval of a governmental committee. On March 29, 2005, the Israeli parliament approved an amendment to Israeli Law for Encouragement of Industrial Research and Development, which permits under certain conditions the transfer of such technology outside of Israel, including the payment of a redemption price to be determined under regulations that have not yet been promulgated. If we fail to comply with any of the conditions imposed by the Office of the Chief Scientist, we may be required to refund any grants previously received together with interest and penalties. In recent years, the government of Israel has accelerated the rate of repayment of Chief Scientist grants from 3% to 3.5% and may further accelerate them in the future. THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF SCIENTIST HAS REQUESTED FROM US ADDITIONAL PAYMENT OF ROYALTIES IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY U.S. $850 THOUSAND. IF WE WILL HAVE TO MAKE SUCH PAYMENT IT WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR PROFITABILITY. The OCS claims that the royalties we owe in respect of past OCS funding of part of our Research and Development activities should be computed on sales of all of our products, and not only on sales of products that we claim were developed with the OCS support. Accordingly, the OCS has asked for additional royalties in the amount of approximately U.S. $850 thousand. We believe, based on the opinion of our legal advisors, that we do not owe any additional royalties to the OCS. We believe that our computations are correct and discussions are held with the OCS in order to settle the matter. We have not recorded a provision in respect of the above amount in our financial statements. PROVISIONS OF ISRAELI LAW COULD DELAY, PREVENT OR MAKE DIFFICULT A CHANGE OF CONTROL, AND THEREFORE DEPRESS THE PRICE OF OUR SHARES. Provisions of Israeli law may delay, prevent or make an acquisition of all or a significant portion of our shares or assets undesirable. Israeli corporate law regulates acquisitions of shares through tender offers and mergers, requires special approvals for transactions involving significant shareholders and regulates other matters that may be relevant to these types of transactions. These provisions of Israeli law could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for our ordinary shares. See "Item 10. Additional Information - 10B. Memorandum and Articles of Association - Approval of Certain Transactions" and "-Change of Control". Furthermore, Israeli tax law treats some acquisitions, such as stock-for-stock exchanges between an Israeli company and a foreign company, less favorably than U.S. tax laws. For example, Israeli tax law may, under certain circumstances, subject a shareholder who exchanges his ordinary shares for shares in another corporation to taxation prior to the sale of the shares received in such stock-for-stock swap. 12 SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS ON OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE. We are incorporated in Israel. The majority of our executive officers and directors are not residents of the United States, and the majority of our assets and the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. Therefore, it may be difficult for an investor, or any other person or entity, to enforce a U.S. court judgment based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws in an Israeli court against us or any of these persons or to effect service of process upon these persons in the United States. Additionally, it may difficult for an investor, or any other person or entity, to assert U.S. securities law claims in original actions instituted in Israel. Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on a violation of U.S. securities laws because Israel is not the most appropriate forum to bring such a claim. In addition, even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Israeli law and not U.S. law is applicable to the claim. Even if U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a matter of fact which can be a time-consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Israeli law. There is little binding case law in Israel addressing the matters described above. OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE SENSITIVE TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN ISRAEL. Inflation in Israel and devaluations of the NIS impact our financial results. Although Israel has substantially reduced the rates of inflation and devaluation in recent years we could experience losses due to inflation or devaluation. If inflation rates in Israel increase again and hurt Israel's economy as a whole, our operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. WE MAY BE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY LESS THAN STABLE POLITICAL AND MILITARY CONDITIONS IN ISRAEL. ANY HOSTILITIES INVOLVING ISRAEL OR THREATENING ISRAEL, OR THE INTERRUPTION OR CURTAILMENT OF TRADE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND ITS PRESENT TRADING PARTNERS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS. We are incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel and our principal offices and manufacturing and research and development facilities are located in Israel. As such, we are directly influenced by political, economic and military conditions affecting Israel. Any major hostilities involving Israel, a substantial decline in the prevailing regional security situation or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 13 OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE OBLIGATIONS OF OUR PERSONNEL TO PERFORM MILITARY SERVICE All male adult citizens under the age of approximately 48, unless exempt, are obligated to perform military service duty annually for a period of up to approximately 36 days. Additionally, they can be called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances. Should the hostilities in the region continue to escalate, some of our officers and employees could be called to substantial active military duty, possibly resulting in delays in shipments to customers and other adverse impacts on our business and operations which we can not currently assess.
