ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our confidence in our prospects and strategies and our expectations about growth of existing markets and our ability to expand into new markets, to identify and acquire complementary businesses and to attract new sources of financing, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. In addition to statements which are forward-looking by reason of context, the words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "designed," "goal," "objective," "optimistic," "will" and other similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. In light of the risks and uncertainties inherent in all future projections, the inclusion of the forward-looking statements should not be regarded as guarantees of performance. Although we believe that our plans, objectives, intentions and expenditures reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that our plans objectives, intentions and expenditures will be achieved. Our forward-looking statements are made based on expectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting us and are subject to uncertainties, risks and factors relating to our operations and business environments, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. These risks and other factors include those listed under Item 1A "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this report. When considering these risk factors, you should keep in mind the cautionary statements elsewhere in this report and the documents incorporated by reference. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and we cannot predict those events or how they may affect us. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or risk factor after the date of this report as a result of new information, future events or developments, except as required by the federal securities laws. We have incurred losses from continuing operations in the past and may incur losses in future years. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we reported a net loss from continuing operations of $2.0 million compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and a net loss from continuing operations of $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Of the 2006 net loss, $4.5 million resulted from a pre-tax charge related to a non-cash goodwill impairment charge based on an assessment of the performance racing segment’s present and future operations. If we incur additional losses in the future or do not increase net income, then our growth potential and our ability to execute our business strategy may be constrained. In addition, our ability to service our debt, may be harmed because we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to pay principal or interest when due. We continue to experience manufacturing inefficiencies at our Oklahoma friction products facility We have relocated one of our friction products manufacturing facilities from Brook Park, Ohio to a new facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma. We began production in the new facility at the beginning of 2005. Our Brook Park facility ceased operations at the end of the third quarter of 2005. In connection with the relocation, we incurred costs at levels higher than we originally anticipated, and we continue to incur additional costs. Expenses related to the relocation and employee severance costs associated with the closure of our Brook Park, facility were $5.5 million in 2005 (of which $0.5 million was included in Cost of sales). We incurred significant additional expenses as of result of manufacturing inefficiencies related to the move of that facility to Oklahoma. We incurred additional expenses during the first half of 2006, as we continued to experience manufacturing inefficiencies at the Oklahoma facility. Future success at the Oklahoma facility depends on our ability to: · hire, train and retain a qualified workforce, · manufacture friction products without causing customer delays or dissatisfaction, and · achieve the cost savings projected at the time of the plant relocation. Failure to successfully complete the transition of our business to the new facility may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We have broad discretion over the use of proceeds from the sale of our precision components segment. In February 2007, we completed the sale of our precision components segment. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture relating to our 8¾% senior notes due November 1, 2014, we have until July 31, 2006 to apply the net proceeds of the sale to repay indebtedness, make open market purchases of the senior notes, acquire property, plant and equipment, make an acquisition or enter into any combination of any of the above. On August 1, 2007, or earlier at the election of management, we are required to make an offer to purchase, on a pro rata basis, the maximum principal amount of the senior notes with any remaining net cash proceeds, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. To the extent the offer is not accepted by our senior note holders, we may invest or distribute any remaining net cash proceeds in our discretion, provided we comply with the terms of our senior notes and bank facility. We are currently in the process of identifying the manner in which we will use the proceeds from the sale. As such, the terms of any investment or transaction have not yet been determined, and no assurances can be made as to the structure, price or other terms of such investment or transaction or the impact of such investment or transaction on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we fail to apply these funds effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Our gross margins are subject to fluctuation becuase of product mix. Certain of our friction products have lower gross margins than our other friction products, and in general. For the year ended December 31, 2006, our friction products segment gross profit was 22.8% of net sales. Our consolidated gross margin was 22.3% for the year ended 2006 compared to 20.2% for the year ended 2005. Our margins in 2006 were positively impacted by pricing actions taken during the last half of 2006 and operating improvements in our Tulsa facility compared to 2005. We cannot guarantee that, in the future, our product mix will continue to be made up of higher gross margin product sales. We operate in a highly competitive industry, which may prevent us from growing and may decrease our business. We operate in an industry that is highly competitive and fragmented. There are many small manufacturers in our industry and only a few generate annual sales in excess of $50.0 million. Our larger competitors have greater financial resources to devote to manufacturing, promotion and sales, which could adversely affect our customer relationships or product mix. We compete for new business primarily when our existing customers develop new applications or redesign existing applications, which may involve lengthy periods of development and testing. For example, developing new aircraft braking systems typically begins two to five years before full-scale production. Although we have successfully obtained this business from our customers in the past, we may be unable to obtain this business in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Our success will depend on our ability to continue to meet our customers’ changing specifications with respect to reliability and timeliness of delivery, technical expertise, product design capability, manufacturing expertise, operational flexibility, customer service and overall management. Some of our competitors use different technologies, such as carbon composite friction material for aircraft braking system components. Our competitors’ use of different technology may adversely affect our ability to compete and negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Work stoppages by union employees may negatively impact our business. As of December 31, 2006, 14.0% of our employees were represented by unions. The majority of our union employees are located in our Orzinuovi, Italy facility. If it is necessary to negotiate new agreements or extensions with the unions, we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so on favorable terms or without experiencing work stoppages. Any work stoppage may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Our debt could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations. As of December 31, 2006, we had $105.0 million of net debt (total debt less cash) outstanding compared to $109.9 million as of December 31, 2005. We had no outstanding balance owed under our Bank Facility as of December 31, 2006 compared to $5.0 as of December 31, 2005. Our high level of debt could have important consequences, including the following: · it may make it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt and contractual and commercial commitments, · we must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest on our debt, which reduces funds available to us for other purposes, · all of the debt outstanding under our Bank Facility is secured by certain of our assets, · our Bank Facility has a variable rate of interest, which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates, · our ability to obtain additional debt financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be limited, · our high level of debt could limit our flexibility in reacting to changes in the industry and make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in our business or economic conditions in general, · our high level of debt could place us at a competitive disadvantage to those of our competitors who operate on a less leveraged basis, and · if we fail to comply with the covenants in the instruments governing our other debt, such failure could have material adverse effect on our business and our ability to repay our debt. Our ability to make payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance and our ability to refinance our debt, which could be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, certain of which are beyond our control. We may require significant ongoing and recurring additional capital expenditures and investment in research and development, manufacturing and other areas to remain competitive. We cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve the technological advances or introduce new products that may be necessary to remain competitive within our business. In addition, we cannot assure you that any technology development by us can be adequately protected such that we can maintain a sustainable competitive advantage. We are subject to governmental regulations that may affect our ability to implement our business objectives. Our net sales to manufacturers of aircraft braking systems represented 15.3% of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006. Every aircraft braking system, including those containing components supplied by us, must satisfy FAA criteria and testing requirements. If we fail to meet these requirements or any new or changed requirements, then our results of operations may be adversely affected or we may not be able to meet our business objectives. There can be no assurance that FAA review of an aircraft braking system containing components supplied by us will result in a favorable determination or that we or our customers will continue to meet FAA criteria and testing requirements, which are subject to change in the discretion of the FAA. Environmental and health and safety liabilities and requirements could require us to incur material costs. We are subject to various U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety, including those governing: · discharges of pollutants into the air and water, · the management and disposal of hazardous substances, and · the cleanup of contaminated properties. The nature of our operations exposes us to the risk of liabilities or claims with respect to environmental matters, including on-site and off-site disposal matters. Future events could require us to make additional expenditures to modify or curtail our operations, install pollution control equipment or investigate and cleanup contaminated sites, such as: · the discovery of new information concerning past releases of hazardous substances, · the discovery or occurrence of compliance problems relating to our operations, and · changes in existing environmental laws or their interpretation. We are also subject to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and similar foreign and state laws. The nature of our operations, the extensive uses of our existing and former facilities, and the operations of prior owners and operators expose us to the risk of liabilities or claims concerning environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. We are not aware of any instance in which we have contravened federal, state, or local provisions enacted for or relating to protection of the environment or in which we otherwise may be subject under environmental laws to liability for environmental conditions that could materially affect operations We are dependent upon the availability of raw materials, and we may not be able to receive favorable prices for, or continued supplies of, raw materials, which may affect our ability to obtain enough supplies to conduct our business. We require substantial amounts of raw materials, including copper powders, steel and custom-fabricated cellulose sheet and substantially all of the raw materials we require are purchased from third party suppliers and are generally in adequate supply. However, the availability and costs of raw materials may be subject to change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, suppliers’ allocation to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers and changes in exchange rates and worldwide price and demand levels. We are not currently party to any long-term supply agreements. Our inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for our products at favorable prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results or operations by decreasing our profit margins and by hindering our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis. Recently, we have experienced an increase in the costs of our copper and iron powders and steel. Although we may determine that it is necessary to pass on the raw material price increases to our customers, in certain circumstances, it may not be possible or practicable for us to pass on these increases and even if we are able to pass on some or all of these increases, there may be a delay between when we have to pay for the increases and when out customers pay us based on the increased prices. If we are not able to reduce or eliminate the effect of these cost increases through lowering other costs of production or successfully implementing price increases to our customers, such raw material cost increases could have a negative effect on our financial results. We are subject to risks associated with international operations. We conduct business outside the United States which subjects us to the risks inherent in international operations. Risks inherent in international operations include the following: · foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income, impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including exchange controls, · fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided by us in foreign markets where payment for our products is made in local currency, · unexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements may occur, · compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may be difficult, and · overlap of different tax laws may subject us to additional taxes. Our international net sales represented $64.5 million, or 30.4% of our consolidated net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2006. We depend on our key personnel. Our performance depends on our ability to retain and motivate officers and key employees. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Hawk has employment agreements with Ronald E. Weinberg, its Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President, B. Christopher Disantis, President of its friction products and performance racing segments and Joseph J. Levanduski, its Vice President - Chief financial Officer. Hawk maintains a “key person” life insurance policy on the life of Mr. Weinberg in the face amount of $1.0 million. Our future success also depends on identifying, attracting, hiring, training, retaining and motivating other highly skilled technical, managerial and marketing personnel. Competition for these employees is intense, and we may be unable to successfully attract, integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. Our existing preferred shareholders have the ability to exert voting control with respect to the election of directors. Ronald E. Weinberg, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President, Norman C. Harbert, Chairman Emeritus and Founder, and Byron S. Krantz, Secretary and Director, beneficially own 45%, 45% and 10%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of our Series D preferred stock as well as 14%, 13% and 3%, respectively, of our Class A common stock. The holders of our Series D preferred stock are entitled to elect a majority of the members of our board of directors. Accordingly, if any two of these shareholders vote their shares of Series D preferred stock in the same manner, they will have sufficient voting power (without the consent of our holders of Class A common stock) to elect a majority of the board of directors and to thereby control and direct the policies of the board of directors.
