Risk Factors--Reserves Estimates". The term "proven reserves" means ore reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes, and grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling, and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. The term "probable reserves" means ore reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. The following table lists the proven and probable ore reserves at December 31, 2006 for each mining operation in which we have at least a 50 percent interest as well as the average grade of such ore, calculated on the basis of 100 percent of each mine's reserves and US$446 per ounce of gold and US$8.50 per ounce of silver. 83 Proven and Probable Ore Reserves at December 31, 2006(1)(2) Julcani Uchucchacua Orcopampa Recuperada Colquijirca Ishihuinca Antapite Shila-Paula(3) Total/Average ------- ----------- --------- ---------- ----------- ---------- -------- -------------- ------------- Ore Reserves (ST) .. 221,775 5,124,693 1,195,030 298,095 14,099,000 18,150 466,135 82,073 21,504,951 Grade: Gold (oz./t) ....... -- -- 0.683 -- -- 0.513 0.343 0.386 0.047 Silver (oz./t) ..... 21.80 14.50 0.30 7.60 2.14 -- -- 2.40 5.21 Copper (%) ......... -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Zinc (%) ........... 0.30 2.54 -- 5.00 5.91 -- -- -- 4.55 Lead (%) ........... 1.80 1.77 -- 4.40 1.87 -- -- -- 1.73 Gold (oz.) ......... -- -- 816,205 -- -- 9,311 159,884 31,680 1,017,080 Silver (oz.) ....... 4,834,695 74,301,451 358,509 2,265,522 30,171,860 -- -- 196,975 112,129,012 Copper (ST) ........ -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Zinc (ST) .......... 665 130,104 -- 14,905 833,251 -- -- -- 978,925 Lead (ST) .......... 3,992 90,744 -- 13,116 263,651 -- -- -- 371,503 - ---------- (1) Reserves as stated are diluted and mineable. (2) Incorporates losses for mining dilution and recovery. (3) Reflects the consolidation as of January 1, 2005 of the operating data of Paula with that of Shila. Seven underground mines and one open pit mine, Colquijirca, comprise our mining operations. Since establishing a significant amount of reserves in underground mines requires costly and extensive exploration programs, we have, in order to control costs, traditionally pursued an exploration and development program in our mines designed to establish an amount of reserves sufficient to permit the steady production of minerals over an extended period of time. The following table sets forth the aggregate amount of production of ore, gold and silver and the average grade of gold and silver for each of our eight mines for the ten-year period ended December 31, 2006, calculated in each case on the basis of 100 percent of the relevant mine's production.

Carachugo Carachugo is a 90-hectare gold deposit with a leach pad that covers approximately 332 hectares. Carachugo, Yanacocha's first mine, commenced operations in August 1993. Mining is conducted by the open-pit method. Carachugo has one ore processing facility. Maqui Maqui Maqui Maqui is a 75-hectare gold deposit with a leach pad covering 67 hectares, located five kilometers northeast of the Carachugo pit. Mining operations at Maqui Maqui began in October 1994 and used the open-pit mining method. Although mining operations at Maqui Maqui ceased in September 2000, gold recovery from the leach pad continues. San Jose San Jose is a 100-hectare gold deposit, located 1.5 kilometers southwest of the Carachugo pit, that shares the leach pad located at Carachugo. Mining operations at San Jose began in January 1996 using the open-pit mining method. Mining operations at San Jose temporarily ceased during the fourth quarter of 2002 and reopened in 2005 to complete San Jose East. San Jose West is scheduled to commence operations in 2010. Cerro Yanacocha Cerro Yanacocha is a 247-hectare gold deposit (ultimate pit) with a leach pad covering approximately 315 hectares. The Cerro Yanacocha pit is located two kilometers northwest of the Carachugo pit. Operations began in the fourth quarter of 1997 using the open-pit mining method. Cerro Yanacocha includes a carbon column gold recovery plant and a Merrill-Crowe-type processing facility. La Quinua La Quinua is a 376-hectare gold deposit (ultimate pit) with a leach pad covering 336 hectares. The La Quinua pit is located three kilometers southwest of the Cerro Yanacocha pit. Operations began in the fourth quarter of 2001 using the open-pit mining method. All solution processing occurs at the Cerro Yanacocha plant following treatment at the La Quinua leach pad and carbon column facility. The La Quinua mining operation included Cerro Negro, a 15-hectare gold deposit (ultimate pit) which is located six kilometers southwest of the La Quinua pit. Cerro Negro utilized the La Quinua leach pad. Operations began in April 2004 using the open-pit mining method and all solution processing occurred at the Cerro Yanacocha plant following treatment at the La Quinua leach pad and carbon column facility. Mining operations at Cerro Negro ceased in March 2005. 85 China Linda In October 1999, we commenced lime production at the China Linda plant, which is located 12 kilometers to the northeast of the Yanacocha installations, in Cajamarca. Access to the plant from Yanacocha is by a ten kilometer private, unpaved road. We had 100 percent ownership of China Linda until December 19, 2000, at which date the plant became Yanacocha's property pursuant to the unitization of our and Newmont Mining's properties in Northern Peru. In January 2002, Yanacocha took over the operation of the China Linda plant. See "Item
