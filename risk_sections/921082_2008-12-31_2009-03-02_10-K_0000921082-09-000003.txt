ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in our securities involves various risks. All investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this Annual Report before trading in our securities. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition could be harmed. Our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investment. We derive most of our income from the ownership and operation of our real estate properties. There are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our properties generate, including the following:  Economic Downturns. Downturns in the national economy and rising unemployment, particularly in the Southeast, generally will negatively impact the demand and rental rates for our properties.  Oversupply of Space. An oversupply of space in our markets would typically cause rental rates and occupancies to decline, making it more difficult for us to lease space at attractive rental rates, if at all.  Competitive Properties. If our properties are not as attractive to tenants (in terms of rent, services, condition or location) as properties owned by our competitors, we could lose tenants to those properties or suffer lower rental rates.  Renovation Costs. In order to maintain the quality of our properties and successfully compete against other properties, we periodically must spend money to maintain, repair and renovate our properties.  Customer Risk. Our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from our customers. Our financial condition could be adversely affected by financial difficulties experienced by a major customer, or by a number of smaller customers, including bankruptcies, insolvencies or general downturns in business.  Reletting Costs. As leases expire, we try to either relet the space to the existing customer or attract a new customer to occupy the space. In either case, we may incur significant costs in the process, including potentially substantial tenant improvement expense or lease incentives. In addition, if market rents have declined since the time the expiring lease was executed, the terms of any new lease likely will not be as favorable to us as the terms of the expiring lease, thereby reducing the rental revenue earned from that space.  Regulatory Costs. There are a number of government regulations, including zoning, tax and accessibility laws, that apply to the ownership and operation of our properties. Compliance with existing and newly adopted regulations may require us to incur significant costs on our properties.  Rising Operating Costs. Costs of operating our properties, such as real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, maintenance and other costs, can rise faster than our ability to increase rental income. While we do receive some additional rent from our tenants that is based on recovering a portion of operating expenses, increased operating expenses will negatively impact our net operating income. Our revenues and expense recoveries are subject to longer term leases and may not be quickly increased sufficient to recover an increase in operating costs and expenses. 7 Table of Contents  Fixed Nature of Costs. Most of the costs associated with owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in rental revenues from the property. Increases in fixed operating expenses, such as increased real estate taxes or insurance costs, would reduce our net income.  Environmental Problems. Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real property to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property. The clean up can be costly. The presence of or failure to clean up contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property or to borrow funds using a property as collateral.  Competition. A number of other major real estate investors with significant capital resources compete with us. These competitors include publicly-traded REITs, private REITs, private real estate investors and private institutional investment funds. Recent and future acquisitions and development properties may fail to perform in accordance with our expectations and may require renovation and development costs exceeding our estimates. In the normal course of business, we typically evaluate potential acquisitions, enter into non-binding letters of intent, and may, at any time, enter into contracts to acquire additional properties. Acquired properties may fail to perform in accordance with our expectations due to lease-up risk, renovation cost risks and other factors. In addition, the renovation and improvement costs we incur in bringing an acquired property up to market standards may exceed our estimates. We may not have the financial resources to make suitable acquisitions or renovations on favorable terms or at all. In addition to acquisitions, we periodically consider developing and constructing properties. Risks associated with development and construction activities include:  the unavailability of favorable financing;  construction costs exceeding original estimates;  construction and lease-up delays resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs; and  lower than anticipated occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property causing a property to be unprofitable or less profitable than originally estimated. If new developments are financed through construction loans, there is a risk that, upon completion of construction, permanent financing for newly developed properties will not be available or will be available only on disadvantageous terms. Development activities are also subject to risks relating to our ability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental and utility company authorizations. Illiquidity of real estate investments and the tax effect of dispositions could significantly impede our ability to sell assets or respond to favorable or adverse changes in the performance of our properties. Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions is limited. In addition, we have a significant amount of mortgage debt under which we would incur significant prepayment penalties if such loans were paid off in connection with the sale of the underlying real estate assets. We intend to continue to sell some of our properties in the future. However, we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us, or whether the price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. Certain of our properties have low tax bases relative to their estimated current fair values, and accordingly, the sale of such assets would generate significant taxable gains unless we sold such properties in a tax-free exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code or another tax-free or tax-deferred transaction. For an exchange to qualify for tax-deferred treatment under Section 1031, the net proceeds from the sale of a property must be held by an escrow agent until applied toward the purchase of real estate qualifying for gain deferral. Given the competition 8 Table of Contents for properties meeting our investment criteria, there could be a delay in reinvesting such proceeds. Any delay in using the reinvestment proceeds to acquire additional income producing assets would reduce our income from operations. Because holders of our Common Units, including some of our officers and directors, may suffer adverse tax consequences upon the sale of some of our properties, they may seek to influence us not to sell certain properties even if such a sale would otherwise be in our best interest. Holders of Common Units may suffer adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain properties. Therefore, holders of Common Units, including certain of our officers and directors, may have different objectives than the Companys stockholders regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of a propertys sale. Although the Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and has the exclusive authority to sell all of our individual Wholly Owned Properties, officers and directors who hold Common Units may seek to influence the Company not to sell certain properties even if such sale might be financially advantageous to stockholders, creditors, bondholders or our business as a whole or influence the Company to enter into tax deferred exchanges with the proceeds of such sales when such a reinvestment might not otherwise be in our best interest. The success of our joint venture activity depends upon our ability to work effectively with financially sound partners. Instead of owning properties directly, we have in some cases invested, and may continue to invest, as a partner or a co-venturer with one or more third parties. Under certain circumstances, this type of investment may involve risks not otherwise present, including the possibility that a partner or co-venturer might be unable to fund its obligations or that a partner or co-venturer might have business interests or goals inconsistent with ours. Also, such a partner or co-venturer may take action contrary to our requests or contrary to provisions in our joint venture agreements that could harm us. In addition, some of our joint ventures are managed on a day to day basis by our partners, and we have only limited influence on their operating decisions. The success of our investments in those joint ventures is heavily dependent on the operating and financial expertise of our partners. If we want to sell our interests in any of our joint ventures or believe that the properties in the joint venture should be sold, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner or at all, and our partner(s) may not cooperate with our desires, which could harm us. Our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate. We carry insurance on all of our properties, including insurance for liability, fire, windstorms, flood, earthquakes and business interruption. Insurance companies, however, limit coverage against certain types of losses, such as losses due to terrorist acts, named windstorms, earthquakes and toxic mold. Thus, we may not have insurance coverage, or sufficient insurance coverage, against certain types of losses and/or there may be decreases in the insurance coverage available. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property or properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property or properties. If any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. Such events could adversely affect our financial condition. Our use of debt to finance our operations could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and ability to make distributions. We are subject to risks associated with debt financing, such as the sufficiency of cash flow to meet required payment obligations, ability to comply with financial ratios and other covenants and the availability of capital to refinance existing indebtedness or fund important business initiatives. Increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt would increase our interest expense. If we fail to comply with the financial ratios and other covenants under our credit facilities, we would likely not be able to borrow any further amounts under such facilities, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations, and our lenders could accelerate outstanding debt. We generally do not intend to reserve funds to retire existing secured or unsecured debt upon maturity. We may not be able to repay, refinance or extend any or all of our debt at maturity or upon any acceleration. If any refinancing is done at higher interest rates, the increased interest expense could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to pay dividends. Any such refinancing could also impose tighter financial ratios and other covenants that restrict our ability to take actions that could otherwise be in our best interest, such as funding new development activity, making opportunistic acquisitions, repurchasing our securities or paying dividends. If we do not meet our mortgage financing obligations, any properties securing such indebtedness could be foreclosed on, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and ability to pay dividends. 9 Table of Contents We depend on our unsecured revolving credit facility, which is currently scheduled to expire in May 2009, for working capital purposes and for the short-term funding of our development and acquisition activity and, in certain instances, the repayment of other debt upon maturity. We have submitted our notice to extend the maturity date of the credit facility by one year to May 2010, and upon payment of the extension fee and assuming no default exists at that time, the facility will be extended. Continuing ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility allows us to quickly capitalize on accretive opportunities at short-term interest rates. If our lenders default under their obligations under the revolving credit facility or we become unable to borrow additional funds under the facility for any reason, we would be required to seek alternative equity or debt capital, which could be more costly and adversely impact our financial condition. If such alternative capital were unavailable, we would not be able to make new investments and could have difficulty repaying other debt. The Company may be subject to taxation as a regular corporation if it fails to maintain its REIT status, which could also have a material adverse effect on the Companys stockholders and on the Operating Partnership. The Company is subject to adverse consequences if it fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. While the Company intends to operate in a manner that will allow it to continue to qualify as a REIT, we cannot provide any assurances that it will remain qualified as such in the future, which would have serious particularly adverse consequences to the Companys stockholders. Many of the requirements for taxation as a REIT are highly technical and complex and depend upon various factual matters and circumstances that may not be entirely within our control. For example, to qualify as a REIT, at least 95.0% of the Companys gross income must come from certain sources that are itemized in the REIT tax laws. The fact that the Company holds virtually all of the assets through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the REIT requirements. Even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize the Companys REIT status. Furthermore, Congress and the IRS might change the tax laws and regulations and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult, or impossible, for the Company to remain qualified as a REIT. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT, it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates and would, therefore, have less cash available for investments or payment of principal and interest to our creditors or bondholders. This would likely have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition. Cash distributions reduce the amount of cash that would otherwise be available for other business purposes, including funding debt maturities or future growth initiatives. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income, excluding net capital gains. In addition, although capital gains are not required to be distributed to maintain REIT status, capital gains, if any, that are generated as part of our capital recycling activity are subject to federal and state income tax unless such gains are distributed to stockholders. Cash distributions made to our stockholders to maintain our REIT status or to distribute otherwise taxable capital gains limit our ability to accumulate capital for use for other business purposes, including funding debt maturities or growth initiatives. Under temporary IRS regulations, for 2009, distributions can be paid partially using a REITs freely-tradable stock so long as stockholders have the option of receiving at least 10% of the total distribution in cash. Because provisions contained in Maryland law, the Companys charter and its bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect, the Companys stockholders may be prevented from receiving a control premium for the Common Stock. Provisions contained in the Companys charter and bylaws as well as Maryland general corporation law may have anti-takeover effects that delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt, and thereby prevent stockholders of the Company from receiving a control premium for their shares. For example, these provisions may defer or prevent tender offers for the Common Stock or purchases of large blocks of the Common Stock, thus limiting the opportunities for the Companys stockholders to receive a premium for their Common Stock over then-prevailing market prices. These provisions include the following:  Ownership limit. The Companys charter prohibits direct, indirect or constructive ownership by any person or entity of more than 9.8% of the Companys outstanding capital stock. Any attempt to own or transfer shares of the Companys capital stock in excess of the ownership limit without the consent of the Companys Board of Directors will be void.  Preferred Stock. The Companys charter authorizes its Board of Directors to issue Preferred Stock in one or more classes and to establish the preferences and rights of any class of Preferred Stock issued. These actions can be taken without stockholder approval. The issuance of Preferred Stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of the Company, even if a change in control were in our best interest. 10 Table of Contents  Staggered board. Until the Companys 2011 annual meeting of stockholders, the Companys directors will continue to serve staggered terms. The staggering of the Companys Board may discourage offers for the Company or make an acquisition of the Company more difficult, even when an acquisition is in the best interest of its stockholders.  Maryland control share acquisition statute. Marylands control share acquisition statute applies to the Company, which means that persons, entities or related groups that acquire more than 20% of the Common Stock may not be able to vote such excess shares under certain circumstances if such shares were acquired in one or more transactions not approved by at least two-thirds of the outstanding Common Stock held by disinterested stockholders.  Maryland unsolicited takeover statute. Under Maryland law, the Companys Board of Directors could adopt various anti-takeover provisions without the consent of stockholders. The adoption of such measures could discourage offers for the Company or make an acquisition of the Company more difficult, even when an acquisition is in the best interest of its stockholders.  Anti-takeover protections of Operating Partnership agreement. Upon a change in control of the Company, the limited partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership requires certain acquirers to maintain an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust (UPREIT) structure with terms at least as favorable to the limited partners as are currently in place. For instance, the acquirer would be required to preserve the limited partners right to continue to hold tax-deferred partnership interests that are redeemable for capital stock of the acquirer. Exceptions would require the approval of two-thirds of the limited partners of the Operating Partnership (other than the Company). These provisions may make a change of control transaction involving the Company more complicated and therefore might decrease the likelihood of such a transaction occurring, even if such a transaction would be in the best interest of the Companys stockholders.
