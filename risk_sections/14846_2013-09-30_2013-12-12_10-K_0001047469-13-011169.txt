Item 1A. Risk Factors. Set forth below is a discussion of certain risks affecting our business. The categorization of risks set forth below is meant to help you better understand the risks facing our business and is not intended to limit your consideration of the possible effects of these risks to the listed categories. Any adverse effects arising from the realization of any of the risks discussed, including our financial condition and results of operation, may, and likely will, adversely affect many aspects of our business. Risks Related to our Business Our property acquisition, loan origination, and Newark Joint Venture development activities are limited by available funds. At November 29, 2013, we had approximately $31 million of cash and cash equivalents available for the acquisition of multi-family properties, loan originations, capital contributions to the multi-family and Newark joint ventures and general operations. If we pursue the acquisition of additional multi-family properties or demand for our mortgage loans increases, as to which no assurance can be given, or if we are required to contribute capital to the Newark Joint Venture or our multi-family properties, our ability to engage in these activities or make these contributions will be limited by the funds available to us. Our ability to use our credit facility is limited by the obligation to pledge collateral acceptable to the lender (and its ability to make such decisions on a timely basis) and covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios, including net worth and debt service coverage ratios. At November 29, 2013, the maximum amount that we can borrow under our credit facility is $10 million and such amount can only be borrowed for 90 days, and may only be used for loan originations and other permitted general corporate purposes. Our loan origination, multi-family property acquisition and Newark Joint Venture development activities may be limited by the lack of available funds which will limit our revenues and operating results. It is unlikely that we will declare any dividends in the next few years. We have not declared or paid any dividends since fiscal 2010. In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute 90% of our taxable income. At December 31, 2012, we had a tax loss carry-forward of approximately $58.3 million. Under current tax laws, we can offset our future taxable income against our tax loss carry-forward until 2028 or until the tax loss carry-forward has been fully used, whichever occurs first. As a result, we do not expect to pay a dividend in 2014 and it is unlikely that we will be required to pay a dividend for many years thereafter in order to maintain our REIT status. The non-payment of cash dividends may negatively impact the price of our common shares. We may not be able to compete with competitors many of which have greater financial and other resources than we possess. We compete with many third parties engaged in the ownership and operation of multi-family properties and real estate lending, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, public and private investors and lenders, investment and pension funds and other entities. The Newark Joint Venture also competes (i) with real estate developers for tax credit allocations and financing provided by governmental and quasi-governmental authorities, and (ii) for tenants, with landlords and developers with, or interested in developing, properties in Newark, New Jersey and the surrounding area. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Larger and more established competitors enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, enhanced operating efficiencies and more extensive networks providing greater and more favorable access to capital, financing and tax credit allocations and more favorable lending and acquisition opportunities. Larger multi-family property operators have the ability to acquire a greater number of higher quality properties at more favorable locations and on more favorable terms and conditions. 16 Larger competitors engaged in real estate lending are better able to diversify their loan portfolios thereby reducing the risk of loss from any single property or loan and are better equipped to fund larger loan requests, enhancing their appeal to prospective borrowers. We may incur impairment charges and loan loss provisions in 2014. We evaluate on a quarterly basis our real estate and loan portfolios for indicators of impairment or loan losses. Impairment charges and loan loss provisions reflect management's judgment of the probability and severity of the decline in the value of real estate assets we own and real estate assets collateralizing a loan. These charges and provisions may be required in the future as a result of factors beyond our control, including, among other things, changes in the economic environment and market conditions affecting the value of real property assets and loan collateral. If we are required to take impairment charges or loan loss provisions, our results of operations will be adversely impacted. Our revenues and the value of our portfolio may be negatively affected by casualty events occurring on our properties or on properties securing our loans. We require our borrowers to obtain, for our benefit, all risk property insurance covering the property and any improvements to the property collateralizing our loan in an amount intended to be sufficient to provide for the cost of replacement in the event of casualty. In addition, joint ventures in which we are an equity participant carry all risk property insurance covering the property and any improvements to the property owned by the joint venture for the cost of replacement in the event of a casualty. Further, we carry insurance for such purpose on properties owned by us. However, the amount of insurance coverage maintained for any property may not be sufficient to pay the full replacement cost following a casualty event. In addition, the rent loss coverage under a policy may not extend for the full period of time that a tenant may be entitled to a rent abatement that is a result of, or that may be required to complete restoration following a casualty event. In addition, there are certain types of losses, such as those arising from earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and terrorist attacks, that may be uninsurable or that may not be economically feasible to insure. Changes in zoning, building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors may make it impossible for our borrower, a joint venture or us, as the case may be, to use insurance proceeds to replace damaged or destroyed improvements at a property. If any of these or similar events occur, the amount of coverage may not be sufficient to replace a damaged or destroyed property and/or to repay in full the amount due on loans collateralized by such property. As a result, our returns and the value of our investment may be reduced. In order for real estate properties to generate positive cash flow or to make real estate properties suitable for sale, we may need to make significant capital improvements and incur deferred maintenance costs with respect to these properties. Some of our properties, and in particular, our multi-family properties may face competition from newer, more updated properties. At November 29, 2013, the approximate weighted average age (based on the number of units) of our multi-family properties is approximately 28 years. To remain competitive and increase occupancy at these properties and/or make them attractive to potential tenants or purchasers, we may have to make significant capital improvements and/or incur deferred maintenance costs with respect to these properties. The cost of these improvements and deferred maintenance items may impair our financial condition and liquidity. Our transactions with affiliated entities involve conflicts of interest. Entities affiliated with us and with certain of our executive officers provide services to us and on our behalf. Although our policy is to obtain terms in transactions with affiliates that are at least as favorable as those that we would receive if the transactions were entered into with unaffiliated entities, 17 these transactions raise the potential that we may not receive terms as favorable as those that we would receive if the transactions were entered into with unaffiliated entities. Liability relating to environmental matters may impact the value of properties that we may acquire or the properties securing our loans. We may be subject to environmental liabilities arising from the ownership of properties we acquire. Under various federal, state and local laws, an owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal of certain hazardous substances released on its property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. If we acquire properties, including properties acquired through foreclosure proceedings, the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to finance or sell the property and we may incur substantial remediation costs. The discovery of material environmental liabilities attached to such properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The presence of hazardous substances may adversely affect an owner's ability to sell real estate or borrow using real estate as collateral. To the extent that an owner of a property underlying one of our loans becomes liable for removal costs, the ability of the owner to make payments to us may be reduced, which in turn may adversely affect the value of the relevant mortgage asset held by us. Senior management and other key personnel are critical to our business and our future success may depend on our ability to retain them. We depend on the services of Jeffrey A. Gould, our president and chief executive officer, and other members of senior management to carry out our business and investment strategies. Although Jeffrey A. Gould devotes substantially all of his business time to our affairs, he devotes a limited amount of his business time to entities affiliated with us. In addition to Jeffrey A. Gould, only two other executive officers, Mitchell Gould, our executive vice president, and George Zweier, a vice president and our chief financial officer, devote all or substantially all of their business time to us. The remainder of our executive management personnel share their services on a part-time basis with entities affiliated with us and located in the same executive offices pursuant to a shared services agreement. We rely on part-time executive officers to provide certain services to us, including legal, accounting and computer services, since we do not employ full-time executive officers to handle these services. If the shared services agreement is terminated, we will have to obtain such services or hire employees to perform them. We may not be able to replace these services or hire such employees in a timely manner or on terms, including cost and level of expertise, that are as favorable as those we receive under the shared services agreement. In addition, in the future we may need to attract and retain qualified senior management and other key personnel, both on a full-time and part-time basis. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could impair our ability to carry out our business and our investment strategies. We do not carry key man life insurance on members of our senior management. 18 Risks Related to our Multi-Family Activities Unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy, rental rates, operating expenses, and the overall market value of multi-family properties we acquire. Conditions in markets in which we acquire multi-family properties may significantly affect occupancy, rental rates and the operating performance of such assets. The risks that may adversely affect conditions in those markets include the following: industry slowdowns, plant closings and other factors that adversely affect the local economy; an oversupply of, or a reduced demand for, multi-family units; a decline in household formation or employment or lack of employment growth; the inability or unwillingness of residents to pay rent increases; rent control or rent stabilization laws, or other laws regulating housing, that could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs; and economic conditions that could cause an increase in our operating expenses, such as increases in property taxes, utilities, and routine maintenance. We could be negatively impacted by the condition of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and by changes in government support for multi-family housing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been a major source of financing for multi-family real estate in the United States and we have used loan programs sponsored by one or more of these entities to finance certain acquisitions. Should these entities have their mandates changed or reduced, lose key personnel, be disbanded or reorganized by the government or otherwise discontinue providing liquidity for the multi-family sector, it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and/or increase borrowing costs and could significantly limit our ability to acquire properties on acceptable terms and reduce the values realized upon property sales. Most of our multi-family properties are located in a limited number of markets, which makes us susceptible to adverse economic developments in such markets. In addition to general, regional and national economic conditions, the operating performance of our multi-family residential properties is impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which our properties are concentrated. Approximately 26%, 26%, 19% and 18% of our estimated 2014 revenues from multi-family properties is attributable to properties located in Texas, Georgia, Florida and Tennessee, respectively. Accordingly, adverse economic developments in such markets could adversely impact the operations of these properties and therefore our operating results and cash flow. The concentration of properties in a limited number of markets exposes us to risks of adverse economic developments which are greater than the risks of owning properties with a more geographically diverse portfolio. Increased competition and increased affordability of residential homes could limit our ability to retain our tenants or increase or maintain rents. Our multi-family properties compete with numerous housing alternatives, including other multi-family and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single and multi-family homes. Our ability to retain tenants and increase or maintain rents could be adversely affected by the alternative housing in a particular area and, due to declining housing prices, mortgage interest rates and government programs to promote home ownership, the increasing affordability of owner occupied single and multi-family homes. 19 Risks involved in conducting real estate activity through joint ventures. We have in the past and may in the future acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe that circumstances warrant the use of such structure. Joint venture investments involve risks, including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise refuse to make capital contributions or distributions when due; that we may be responsible to our partner for indemnifiable losses; that our partner might at any time have business goals which are inconsistent with ours; and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests. Frequently, we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partner's interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. In some instances, joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. Further, our joint venture partners may experience financial distress, including bankruptcy, and to the extent they do not meet their obligations to us or our joint ventures with them, we may be adversely affected. Six of our 19 multi-family property joint ventures are owned with one venture partner or its affiliates. We may be adversely effected if we are unable to maintain a satisfactory working relationship with this joint venture partner or if this partner becomes financially distressed. Risks Related to our Real Estate Lending Activities Increased competition, decreased demand for our loans and our increase in emphasis on our multi-family property activities may result in decreased loan originations adversely affecting our business. As a result of increased competition, decreased demand and our increase in emphasis on our multi-family properties activities, our loan originations decreased by 29% from $98.6 million in 2012 to $70.3 million in 2013. If loan originations decline further or continue at a reduced level, our revenues, net income and cash flow would be negatively affected. The geographic concentration of our loans may make our revenues and the value of the related mortgages vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the New York metropolitan and Florida regions. At September 30, 2013, 73% and 16% of principal amount of our outstanding loans are secured by properties located in New York City and Florida, respectively. A lack of geographical diversification makes our mortgage portfolio more sensitive to local or regional economic conditions. A significant decline in the economy of either of these regions could result in a greater risk of default compared with the default rate for loans secured by properties in other geographic locations. This could result in a reduction of our revenues and provision for loan loss allowances which might not be as acute if our loan portfolio were more geographically diverse. Defaults on our loans may cause declines in revenues and net income. Defaults by our borrowers on their loans result in a decrease in interest income and may require the establishment of, or an increase in, loan loss reserves. The decrease in interest income resulting from loan defaults may be for a prolonged period of time as we seek to recover, primarily through legal proceedings, the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest due on a defaulted loan, plus the legal costs incurred in pursuing our legal remedies. Legal proceedings, which may include foreclosure actions and bankruptcy proceedings, are expensive and time consuming. The decrease in interest income, and the costs involved in pursuing our legal remedies will reduce the amount of cash available to meet our expenses. In addition, the decrease in interest income, the costs incurred by us in a defaulted loan situation and increases in loan loss reserves will have an adverse impact on our net income, taxable income and cash flow. 20 Financing with high loan-to-value ratios involves increased risk of loss and may adversely affect us. Our primary source of recovery in the event of a loan default is the real estate underlying a defaulted loan. Therefore, the value of a loan depends upon the value of the underlying real estate. The value of the underlying property is dependent on numerous factors outside of our control, including national, regional and local business and economic conditions, inflation, government economic policies and the availability of credit. A loan-to-value ratio is the ratio of the amount of our loan to the estimated market value of the property underlying a loan, as determined by our internal valuation process. The higher the loan to value ratio, the greater the risk that the amount obtainable from sale of a property will be insufficient to repay the loan in full upon default. Risks Related to the Newark Joint Venture and Real Estate Operations. The Newark Joint Venture may have an operating loss for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that the Newark Joint Venture will operate at a loss in 2014 and for several years thereafter. If the Newark Joint Venture operates at a loss, we and our partners in the venture may be required to fund the operating losses and capital requirements by making additional capital contributions. No assurance can be given that we or our venture partners will have the resources or be willing to make such contribution and the failure to make the required contribution may have an adverse impact on us. If we are unable to pay debt service as it become due, we may be forced to sell properties at disadvantageous terms or relinquish our rights to such properties, which would result in the loss of revenues and in a decline in the value of our real property portfolio. At September 30, 2013, approximately $5.4 million of debt service relating to the Newark Joint Venture is payable prior to the end of 2014 and $13.2 million of debt service is payable from 2015 through 2016. The cash flow from the properties securing the mortgage debt may be insufficient to meet required debt service payments. In particular, the rental revenues from the current tenants at Teachers Village are insufficient to cover all of the Newark Joint Ventures debt service obligations payable from 2014 through 2016. If efforts to generate additional rental revenues from the Teachers Village site are unsuccessful (due to, among other things, the failure to complete the three buildings under construction or to fully rent the residential and retail space at the five buildings currently comprising Teachers Village), the Newark Joint Venture may be unable to meet its debt service obligation with respect to the Teachers Village properties and such properties would require additional capital from the members of the venture or may be foreclosed on by the lenders. The Newark Joint Venture will be adversely effected if it is limited from using the Teachers Village facilities for purposes other than as contemplated by the applicable financing and tax credit transactions. The terms and conditions of the financings and tax credits provided to the Newark Joint Venture limit the venture's ability to use the Teachers Village facilities in a manner other than as permitted to be used by the governing transaction documents. Among other things, the New Markets Tax Credits and related contractual obligations provide that if prior to the seven year recapture period, the facilities are used in a manner prohibited by such tax credit program, the credits may be disallowed. The qualified school construction bonds in principal amount of approximately $22.7 million at September 30, 2013 requires that the facilities (or certain portions thereof) be used for at least 19 years as public school facilities and the annual $1 million interest reimbursement provided by the US Treasury (after giving effect to the impact of the sequester which is currently reducing such payment by approximately $100,000 annually) is subject to recapture if the facilities or portions thereof are not used for educational purposes for specified periods. The New Jersey Urban Transit Hub tax credits program requires that certain portions of the facilities must be used for residential purposes for at least ten 21 years and that at least 20% of the residential units be allocated for lower/middle income housing. If as a result of market or other conditions, it is determined that the contemplated uses of the facilities are not financially viable, the Newark Joint Venture will be limited in its ability to use these facilities in an alternative manner which may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. We have limited experience in developing and operating development sites. The principal assets of our Newark Joint Venture are several development sites and additional properties located in downtown Newark, NJ. Since we have limited experience in the real estate development business, we are subject to risks that differ from those to which we have been subject to historically. Although the principal of the managing member of the Newark Joint Venture (who is formerly the principal of our borrowers) is knowledgeable with respect to the local real estate market, he has limited experience in development projects. As a result, to redevelop these sites, the Newark Joint Venture may have to hire personnel knowledgeable in real estate development to assist in its development, become involved with a development partner, or sell some or all of the sites to developers or potential users. There can be no assurance that the Newark Joint Venture will be successful in hiring experienced personnel, finding a development partner with skills needed to develop and/or manage the redevelopment of the sites, or that we will be able to sell some or all of the properties to developers or potential users. The success of our Newark Joint Venture depends, to a large extent, on the principal of the Newark Joint Venture's manager. The principal of the manager of the Newark Joint Venture was responsible for acquiring all the properties owned by the Newark Joint Venture and is responsible for, among other things, overseeing the construction activities at Teachers Village and development activities with respect to Market Street and the other properties owned by the venture. We believe that the principal's continued involvement is important to the success of the Newark Joint Venture. The diminution or loss of his services due to disability, death or for any other reasons could have a material adverse effect on the Newark Joint Venture's business, which would result in a material adverse effect on our business. The Newark Joint Venture carries key man life insurance on the principal of the manager of the Newark Joint Venture in the amount of $40 million. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from such life insurance would be sufficient to compensate the Newark Joint Venture for the loss of his services, and these policies do not provide any benefits if he becomes disabled or is otherwise unable to render services to the Newark Joint Venture. Our Newark Joint Venture is subject to risks particular to real estate development activities. Our Newark Joint Venture is subject to the risks associated with development activities. These risks include: The inability to complete the second phase of the Teachers Village project because the funds available from the financing and New Markets Tax Credits transactions, due to cost overruns or under estimating the funds needed, may be insufficient for such purpose. The inability to obtain the approximately $33 million or more of financing needed to fund the third phase of the Teachers Village development project; The failure to obtain governmental and other approvals on a timely basis; Construction, financing and other costs of developing the properties owned by the Newark Joint Venture and in particular, Teachers Village, may not be obtained or if obtained may exceed original estimates, possibly making such activities unprofitable; 22 The time required to complete the construction of Teachers Village or to lease up the completed project may be greater than originally anticipated, thereby adversely affecting the Newark Joint Venture's cash flow and liquidity; Occupancy rates and rents of a completed project may be insufficient to make such project profitable; The inability to acquire all the properties needed to develop the project to its full potential; and The inability to complete a development. Failure of the Newark Joint Venture to comply with the requirements of the New Markets Tax Credit program may result in significant losses and impair our financial condition. The Newark Joint Venture entered into various arrangements to obtain funding under the New Markets Tax Credit program for the Teachers Village project and in connection therewith received approximately $25.8 million of net tax credit proceeds. New Markets Tax Credits are subject to recapture for a period of seven years as provided in the Internal Revenue Code. The Newark Joint Venture is required to comply with various regulations and contractual provisions that apply to the these credits and has indemnified the beneficiaries thereof for any loss or recapture of the benefits of such credits until the obligation to deliver tax benefits is relieved. We estimate that such indemnity obligation would not exceed approximately $40 million (exclusive of interest and penalties) and is subject to reduction to the extent the credits are not disallowed. Non-compliance with applicable requirements could result in the tax benefits not being realized by the beneficiaries which would have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Risks Related to our Industry Compliance with REIT requirements may hinder our ability to maximize profits. In order to qualify as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things, our sources of income, the amounts we distribute to our shareholders and the ownership of securities. We may also be required to make distributions to shareholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. Accordingly, compliance with REIT requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits. In order to qualify as a REIT, we must also ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets. The remainder of our investment in securities cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of such issuer. In addition, no more than 5% of the value of our assets can consist of the securities of any one issuer, other than a qualified REIT security. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we must dispose of the portion of our assets in excess of such amounts within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter in order to avoid losing our REIT status and suffering adverse tax consequences. This requirement could cause us to dispose of assets for consideration of less than their true value and could lead to a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Because Real Estate Investments Are Illiquid, We May Not Be Able to Sell Properties When Appropriate. Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. We may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions. This inability to reallocate our capital promptly could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 23 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None.
