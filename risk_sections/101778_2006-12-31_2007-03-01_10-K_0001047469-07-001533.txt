Item 1A. Risk Factors Marathon is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of its business. The following summarizes some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. A substantial or extended decline in oil or natural gas prices, as well as refined product gross margins, would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets. Prices for oil and natural gas and refined product gross margins fluctuate widely. Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our oil, natural gas and refined products. Historically, the markets for oil, natural gas and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Many of the factors influencing prices of oil, natural gas and refined products are beyond our control. These factors include: worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for oil, natural gas and refined products; the cost of exploring for, developing and producing oil, natural gas and refined products; the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain production controls; political instability or armed conflict in oil-producing regions; changes in weather patterns and climatic changes; natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados; the price and availability of alternative and competing fuels; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and general economic conditions worldwide. The long-term effects of these and other factors on the prices of oil and natural gas, as well as on refined product gross margins, are uncertain. Lower oil and natural gas prices, as well as lower refined product gross margins, may reduce the amount of these commodities that we produce, which may reduce our revenues, operating income and cash flows. Significant reductions in oil and natural gas prices or refined product gross margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures and impair the carrying value of our assets. Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates. Any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our oil and natural gas reserves. The proved oil and natural gas reserves information related to Marathon included in this report has been derived from engineering estimates. Those estimates were prepared by our in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and reviewed, on a selected basis, by our Corporate Reserves Group and/or third-party consultants we have retained. The estimates were calculated using oil and natural gas prices in effect as of December 31, 2006, as well as other conditions in existence as of that date. Any significant future price changes will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation and severance and other production taxes. Reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be directly measured. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including: location, size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid, rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation; historical production from the area, compared with production from other comparable producing areas; the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies; assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices; and 22 assumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and workover and repair costs. As a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data. Because of the subjective nature of oil and natural gas reserve estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated: the amount and timing of oil and natural gas production; the revenues and costs associated with that production; and the amount and timing of future development expenditures. The discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves reflected in this report should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties. As required by SEC Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. In addition, the 10 percent discount factor required by the applicable rules of the SEC to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general. If we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future oil and natural gas production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition. The rate of production from oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, optimize production performance, identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as oil and natural gas is produced. Accordingly, to the extent we are not successful in replacing the oil and natural gas we produce, our future revenues will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors, including: obtaining rights to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in promising areas; drilling success; the ability to complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and on budget; and the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs. Increases in crude oil prices and environmental regulations may reduce our refined product gross margins. The profitability of our refining, marketing and transportation operations depends largely on the margin between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks that we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products. We are a net purchaser of crude oil. A significant portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies, including suppliers from the Middle East. These purchases are subject to political, geographic and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in that area of the world. Our overall RM&T profitability could be adversely affected by the availability of supply and rising crude oil and other feedstock prices which we do not recover in the marketplace. Refined product gross margins historically have been volatile and vary with the level of economic activity in the various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, logistical capabilities and the available supply of refined products. In addition, environmental regulations, particularly the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act, have imposed, and are expected to continue to impose, increasingly stringent and costly requirements on our refining, marketing and transportation operations, which may reduce our refined product gross margins. If we do not compete successfully with our competitors, our future operating performance and profitability could materially decline. We compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. We compete with these companies for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. In addition, in implementing our integrated gas strategy, we compete with major integrated energy companies in 23 bidding for and developing liquefied natural gas projects, which are very capital intensive. Many of our competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to us. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring additional properties and bidding for and developing additional projects, such as LNG production facilities. Many of our larger competitors in the LNG market can complete more projects than we have the capacity to complete, which could lead those competitors to realize economies of scale that we are unable to realize. In addition, many of our larger competitors may be better able to respond to factors that affect the demand for oil and natural gas, such as changes in worldwide prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. We will continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and changes in environmental laws and regulations, and, as a result, our profitability could be materially reduced. Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. The specific impact of these laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. We may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site cleanups or curtail operations. We may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination. In addition, any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws could result in civil or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us. Our operations and those of our predecessors could expose us to civil claims by third parties for alleged liability resulting from contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances. Environmental laws are subject to frequent change and many of them have become more stringent. In some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party, without regard to negligence or fault, and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. Worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. Local political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us. Approximately 56 percent of our oil and natural gas production in 2006 was derived from production outside the United States and approximately 72 percent of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2006, were located outside the United States. There are many risks associated with operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas or refined product pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations. These risks include: political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism and civil disturbances; the possibility that a foreign government may seize our property with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens; and fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls. Continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the United States and other developed countries. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. These risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. In addition, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. Actions of the U.S. government through tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability both in the United States and abroad. The U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. These restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the 24 past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries. Actions by both the United States and host governments have affected operations significantly in the past and will continue to do so in the future. Our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses, and we do not insure against all potential losses and, therefore, we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities. Our exploration and production operations are subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse weather, labor disputes and accidents. In addition, our refining, marketing and transportation operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and unplanned events such as explosions, fires, pipeline ruptures or other interruptions, crude oil or refined product spills, inclement weather and labor disputes. Our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks, as well as hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision and damage or loss from severe weather conditions. These hazards could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. Certain hazards have adversely affected us in the past, and litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from these operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent. Uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for exploration, drilling and production and could materially reduce our profitability. Historically, we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities. Due to hurricane activity in recent years, the availability of insurance coverage for our offshore facilities for windstorms in the Gulf of Mexico region has been reduced or, in many instances, it is prohibitively expensive. As a result, our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity in the Gulf of Mexico region has increased. If Ashland fails to pay its taxes, we could be responsible for satisfying various tax obligations of Ashland. As a result of the transactions in which we acquired the minority interest in MPC from Ashland in 2005, Marathon is severally liable for federal income taxes (and in some cases for certain state taxes) of Ashland for tax years still open as of the date we completed the transactions. We have entered into a tax matters agreement with Ashland, which provides that: we will be responsible for the tax liabilities of the Marathon group of companies, including the tax liabilities of MPC and the other companies and businesses we acquired in the transactions (for periods after the completion of the transactions); and Ashland will generally be responsible for the tax liabilities of the Ashland group of companies before the completion of the transactions, and the income taxes attributable to Ashland's interest in MPC before the completion of the transactions. However, under certain circumstances we will have several liability for those tax liabilities owed by Ashland to various taxing authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service. If Ashland fails to pay any tax obligation for which we are severally liable, we may be required to satisfy this tax obligation. That would leave us in the position of having to seek indemnification from Ashland. In that event, our indemnification claims against Ashland would constitute general unsecured claims, which would be effectively subordinate to the claims of secured creditors of Ashland, and we would be subject to collection risk associated with collecting unsecured debt from Ashland. Marathon is required to pay Ashland for deductions relating to various contingent liabilities of Ashland, which could be material. We are required to claim tax deductions for certain contingent liabilities that will be paid by Ashland after completion of the transactions. Under the tax matters agreement, we are required to pay the benefit of those deductions to Ashland, with the computation and payment terms for such tax benefit payments divided into two "baskets," as described below: Basket One  This applies to the first $30 million of contingent liability deductions (increased by inflation each year up to a maximum of $60 million) that we may claim in each year for the first 20 years following the acquisition. The benefit of Basket One deductions is determined by multiplying the amount of the deduction by 32% (or, if different, by a percentage equal to three percentage points less than the highest federal income tax rate during the applicable tax year). We are obligated to pay this amount to Ashland. The computation and payment of Basket One amounts does not depend on our ability to generate actual tax savings from the use of the contingent liability deductions in Basket One. Upon specified events related to Ashland (or after 20 years), the contingent liability deductions that would 25 otherwise have been compensated under Basket One will be taken into account in Basket Two. In addition, Basket One applies only for federal income tax purposes; state, local or foreign tax benefits attributable to specified liability deductions will be compensated only under Basket Two. Because we are required to make payments to Ashland whether or not we generate any actual tax savings from the Basket One contingent liability deductions, the amount of our tax benefit payments to Ashland with respect to Basket One contingent liability deductions may exceed the aggregate tax benefits that we derive from these deductions. We are obligated to make these payments to Ashland even if we do not have sufficient taxable income to realize any benefit for the deductions. Basket Two  All contingent liability deductions relating to Ashland's pre-transactions operations that are not subject to Basket One are considered and compensated under Basket Two. The benefit of Basket Two deductions is determined on a "with and without" basis; that is, the contingent liability deductions are treated as the last deductions used by the Marathon group. Thus, if the Marathon group has deductions, tax credits or other tax benefits of its own, it will be deemed to use them to the maximum extent possible before it will be deemed to use the contingent liability deductions. To the extent that we have the capacity to use the contingent liability deductions based on this methodology, the actual amount of tax saved by the Marathon group through the use of the contingent liability deductions will be calculated and paid to Ashland. Because Basket Two amounts are calculated based on the actual tax saved by the Marathon group from the use of Basket Two deductions, those amounts are subject to recalculation in the event there is a change in the Marathon group's tax liability for a particular year. This could occur because of audit adjustments or carrybacks of losses or credits from other years, for example. To the extent that such a recalculation results in a smaller Basket Two benefit with respect to a contingent liability deduction for which Ashland has already received compensation, Ashland is required to repay such compensation to Marathon. In the event we become entitled to any repayment, we would be subject to collection risks associated with collecting an unsecured claim from Ashland. If the transactions resulting in our acquisition of the minority interest in MPC that was previously owned by Ashland were found to constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we could be required to provide additional consideration to Ashland or to return a portion of the interest in MPC, and either of those results could have a material adverse effect on us. In a bankruptcy case or lawsuit initiated by one or more creditors or a representative of creditors of Ashland, a court may review our 2005 transactions with Ashland under state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws. Under those laws, the transactions would be deemed fraudulent if the court determined that the transactions were undertaken for the purpose of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or that the transactions were constructively fraudulent. If the transactions were found to be a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we might be required to provide additional consideration to Ashland or to return all or a portion of the interest in MPC and the other assets we acquired from Ashland. Under the laws of most states, a transaction could be held to be constructively fraudulent if a court determined that: the transferor received less than "reasonably equivalent value" or, in some jurisdictions, less than "fair consideration" or "valuable consideration;" and the transferor: was insolvent at the time of the transfer or was rendered insolvent by the transfer; was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business or transaction for which its remaining property constituted unreasonably small capital; or intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as those debts matured. In connection with our transactions with Ashland completed in 2005, we delivered part of the overall consideration (specifically, shares of our common stock having a value of $915 million) to Ashland's shareholders. In order to help establish that Ashland received reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration from us in the transactions, we obtained a written opinion from a nationally recognized appraisal firm to the effect that Ashland received amounts that were reasonably equivalent to the combined value of Ashland's interest in MPC and the other assets we acquired. We also obtained a favorable opinion from that appraisal firm relating to various financial tests that supported our conclusion and Ashland's representation to us that Ashland was not insolvent either before or after giving effect to the closing of the transactions. Those opinions were based on specific information provided to the appraisal firm and were subject to various assumptions, including assumptions relating to Ashland's existing and contingent liabilities and insurance coverages. Although we are confident in our conclusions regarding (1) Ashland's receipt of reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and (2) Ashland's solvency, it should be noted that the 26 valuation of any business and a determination of the solvency of any entity involve numerous assumptions and uncertainties, and it is possible that a court could disagree with our conclusions. If United States Steel fails to perform any of its material obligations to which we have financial exposure, we could be required to pay those obligations, and any such payment could materially reduce our cash flows and profitability and impair our financial condition. In connection with the separation of United States Steel from Marathon, United States Steel agreed to hold Marathon harmless from and against various liabilities. While we cannot estimate some of these liabilities, the portion of these liabilities that we can estimate amounts to $564 million as of December 31, 2006, including accrued interest of $11 million. If United States Steel fails to satisfy any of those obligations, we would be required to satisfy them and seek indemnification from United States Steel. In that event, our indemnification claims against United States Steel would constitute general unsecured claims, effectively subordinate to the claims of secured creditors of United States Steel. Under applicable law and regulations, we also may be liable for any defaults by United States Steel in the performance of its obligations to fund its ERISA pension plans and pay other obligations related to periods prior to the effective date of the separation. United States Steel's senior unsecured debt is rated non-investment grade by two major credit rating agencies. The steel business is highly competitive and a large number of industry participants have sought protection under bankruptcy laws in the past. The enforceability of our claims against United States Steel could become subject to the effect of any bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance or transfer or other law affecting creditors' rights generally, or of general principles of equity, which might become applicable to those claims or other claims arising from the facts and circumstances in which the separation was effected. If the transfer of ownership of various assets and operations by Marathon's former parent entity to Marathon was held to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer, United States Steel's creditors may be able to obtain recovery from us or other relief detrimental to the holders of our common stock. In July 2001, USX Corporation ("Old USX") effected a reorganization of the ownership of its businesses in which it created Marathon as its publicly owned parent holding company and transferred ownership of various assets and operations to Marathon, and it merged into a newly formed subsidiary which survived as United States Steel. If a court in a bankruptcy case regarding United States Steel or a lawsuit brought by its creditors or their representative were to find that, under the applicable fraudulent conveyance or transfer law: the transfer by Old USX to Marathon or related transactions were undertaken by Old USX with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding its existing or future creditors; or Old USX received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration, or no value or consideration, in connection with those transactions, and either it or United States Steel was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of those transactions, was engaged or about to engage in a business or transaction for which its assets constituted unreasonably small capital, or intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature, then that court could determine those transactions entitled one or more classes of creditors of United States Steel to equitable relief from us. Such a determination could permit the unpaid creditors to obtain recovery from us or could result in other actions detrimental to the holders of our common stock. The measure of insolvency for purposes of these considerations would vary depending on the law of the jurisdiction being applied. We may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. 27 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments As of the date of this filing, we have no unresolved comments from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
