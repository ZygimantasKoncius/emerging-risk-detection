ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The risks described below, and risks described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Form 10-K. The risk factors described below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may also be materially adversely affected by factors that are not currently known to us, by factors that we currently consider immaterial or by factors that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions. If any of the following risks are actually realized, our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements under Special Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements. All forward-looking statements made by us are qualified by the risk factors described below. 16 Table of Contents Changes to Medicaid, Medicaid waiver or other state and local medical and social programs could adversely affect our net service revenues and profitability. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we derived 81% of our net service revenues from agreements that are directly or indirectly paid for by state and local governmental agencies, such as Medicaid funded programs and Medicaid waiver programs. Governmental agencies generally condition their agreements with us upon a sufficient budgetary appropriation. If a governmental agency does not receive an appropriation sufficient to cover its contractual obligations with us, it may terminate an agreement or defer or reduce the amount of the reimbursement we receive. Almost all the states in which we operate are facing budgetary shortfalls due to the current economic downturn and the rising costs of health care, and as a result, have made, are considering or may consider making changes in their Medicaid, Medicaid waiver or other state and local medical and social programs. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 permits states to make benefit cuts to their Medicaid programs, which could affect the services for which states contract with us. Changes that states have made or may consider making to address their budget deficits include:  limiting increases in, or decreasing, reimbursement rates;  redefining eligibility standards or coverage criteria for social and medical programs or the receipt of homecare services under those programs;  increasing the consumers share of costs or co-payment requirements;  decreasing the number of authorized hours for recipients;  slowing payments to providers;  increasing utilization of self-directed care alternatives or all inclusive programs; or  shifting beneficiaries to managed care programs. Certain of these measures have been implemented by, or are proposed in, states in which we operate. For example, effective July 1, 2009, Washington passed restrictions that limit agencies from employing family caregivers and imposed a 3% reduction in authorized hours to its social service clients, and is currently considering a vendor rate cut for this fiscal year, California has considered a number of proposals, including potential changes in eligibility standards, Illinois has delayed payments to providers and is also considering making changes to eligibility standards and authorized consumer hours. In July 2009 Nevada implemented a reduction in reimbursement rates. New Jersey, North Carolina and Idaho are also considering proposals to reduce rates and/or utilization of services in the next fiscal year. In 2009, we derived approximately 49% of our total net service revenues from services provided in Illinois, 16% of our total net service revenues from services provided in California, 9% of our total net service revenues from services provided in Washington and 7% of our total net service revenues from services provided in Nevada. Because a substantial portion of our business is concentrated in these states, any significant reduction in expenditures that pay for our services in these states and other states in which we do business may have a disproportionately negative impact on our future operating results. Provisions in the Health Reform Law increase eligibility for Medicaid, which may cause a reallocation of Medicaid funding. It is difficult to predict at this time what the effect of these changes would be on our business. If changes in Medicaid policy result in a reduction in available funds for the services we offer, our net service revenues could be negatively impacted. All states currently benefit from increased federal matching percentage rates (FMAP) granted under the ARRA, which increases the share of federal dollars paid to states for services to Medicaid beneficiaries. The enhanced percentages are set to expire as of December 31, 2010 which would occur in the middle of most states 2011 fiscal year (July 2010 to June 2011) and for which budgets are now being prepared. The Senate has passed a bill granting an extension of the enhanced rates to the states through June 30, 2011, however the House of Representatives has yet to take action on the bill. Although the President has indicated his support for this extension, if the enhanced percentages are not extended, the loss of federal funding would have significant impact on state budgets and possibly funding of Medicaid, Medicaid waiver or other state and local medical and 17 Table of Contents social programs. Because a substantial portion of our business is concentrated in these programs, any significant reduction in expenditures that pay for our services may have a disproportionately negative impact on our future operating results. Delays in reimbursement due to state budget deficits or otherwise have decreased, and may in the future further decrease, our liquidity. There is generally a delay between the time that we provide services and the time that we receive reimbursement or payment for these services. Over 45 states are facing budget deficits. Of the 16 states in which we operate, 15 are operating with budget deficits for their current fiscal year. These and other states may in the future delay reimbursement, which would adversely affect our liquidity. Specifically, the State of Illinois is currently reimbursing us on a delayed basis, including with respect to our agreements with the Illinois Department on Aging, our largest payor, and as a result, our open receivable balance derived from these agreements increased by $17.8 million in 2009. Our reimbursements from the State of Illinois could be further delayed. In addition, from time to time, procedural issues require us to resubmit claims before payment is remitted, which contributes to our aged receivables. Additionally, unanticipated delays in receiving reimbursement from state programs due to changes in their policies or billing or audit procedures may adversely impact our liquidity and working capital. Because we fund our operations primarily through the collection of accounts receivable, any delays in reimbursement would result in the need to increase borrowings under our credit facility. The implementation or expansion of self-directed care programs in states in which we operate may limit our ability to increase our market share and could adversely affect our revenue. Self-directed care programs are funded by Medicaid and state and local agencies and allow the consumer to exercise discretion in selecting home & community service providers. Consumers may hire family members, friends or neighbors to provide services that might otherwise be provided by a home & community service agency provider, such as our company. Most states and the District of Columbia have implemented self-directed care programs, to varying degrees and for different types of consumers. States are under pressure from the federal government and certain advocacy groups to expand these programs. CMS has provided states with specific Medicaid waiver options for programs that offer person-centered planning, individual budgeting or self-directed services and support as part of the CMS Independence Plus initiative introduced in 2002 under an Executive Order of the President. Certain private foundations have also granted resources to states to develop and study programs that provide financial accounts to consumers for their long-term care needs, and counseling services to help prepare a plan of care that will help meet those needs. Expansion of these self-directed programs may erode our Medicaid consumer base and could adversely affect our net service revenues. Failure to renew a significant agreement or group of related agreements may materially impact our revenue. In 2009, we derived approximately 34.3% of our net service revenues under agreements with the Illinois Department on Aging, 6.5% of our net service revenues under an agreement with Nevada Medicaid and 5.4% of our net service revenues under an agreement with the Riverside County (California) Department of Public Social Services. Each of our agreements is generally in effect for a specific term. For example, the services we provide to the Illinois Department on Aging are provided under a number of agreements that expire at various times through 2013, while our agreement with the Riverside County Department of Public Social Services is reevaluated and subject to renewal annually. Even though our agreements are stated to be for a specific term, they are generally terminable by the counterparty upon 60 days notice. Our ability to renew or retain our agreements depends on our quality of service and reputation, as well as other factors over which we have little or no control, such as state appropriations and changes in provider eligibility requirements. Additionally, failure to satisfy any of the numerous technical renewal requirements in connection with our proposals for agreements could result in a proposal being rejected even if it contains favorable pricing terms. Failure to obtain, renew or retain agreements with major payors may negatively impact our results of operations and revenue. We can give no assurance these agreements will be renewed on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 18 Table of Contents Our industry is highly competitive, fragmented and market-specific, with limited barriers to entry. We compete with home health providers, private caregivers, larger publicly held companies, privately held homecare companies, privately held single-site agencies, hospital-based agencies, not-for-profit organizations, community-based organizations and self-directed care programs. Our primary competition is from local service providers in the markets in which we operate. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, political and marketing resources, name recognition or a larger number of consumers and payors than we do. In addition, some of these organizations offer more services than we do in the markets in which we operate. Consumers or referral sources may perceive that local service providers and not-for-profit agencies deliver higher quality services or are more responsive. These competitive advantages may limit our ability to attract and retain referrals in local markets and to increase our overall market share. There are limited barriers to entry in providing home-based social and medical services, and the trend has been for states to eliminate many of the barriers that historically existed. For example, Illinois changed the way in which it procures home & community service providers in 2009, allowing all providers that are willing and capable to obtain state approval and provide services. This may increase competition in that state, and because we derived approximately 52% of our home & community net service revenues from services provided in Illinois in 2009, this increased competition could negatively impact our business. Local competitors may develop strategic relationships with referral sources and payors. This could result in pricing pressures, loss of or failure to gain market share or loss of consumers or payors, any of which could harm our business. In addition, existing competitors may offer new or enhanced services that we do not provide, or be viewed by consumers as a more desirable local alternative. The introduction of new and enhanced service offerings, in combination with the development of strategic relationships by our competitors, could cause a decline in revenue, a loss of market acceptance of our services and a negative impact on our results of operations. Our profitability could be negatively affected by a reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other payors. For the year ended December 31, 2009 we received approximately 12%, of our net service revenues from Medicare. We generally receive fixed payments from Medicare for our services based on a projection of the services required by our consumers, which is generally based on acuity. For our Medicare consumers, we typically receive a 60-day episodic-based payment. Although Medicare currently provides for an annual adjustment of payment rates based on the increase or decrease of the medical care expenditure category of the Consumer Price Index, these rate increases may be less than actual inflation or costs, and could be eliminated or reduced in any given year. The base episode rate for home health services is also subject to an annual market basket adjustment. A market basket is a fixed-weight index that measures the cost of a specified mix of goods and services as compared to a base period. The home health market basket, which is used to adjust annually the Medicare base episodic rate for home health services, measures inflation or deflation in the prices of a mix of home health goods and services. This annual adjustment could also be eliminated or reduced in any given year. The Health Reform Law mandates a 1% reduction in the market basket update for 2011 and 2012 and a market basket productivity adjustment for 2015 and subsequent years. The market basket reductions may result in a negative adjustment. Medicare has in the past reclassified home health resource groups. As a result of reclassifications, we could receive lower reimbursement rates depending on the consumers case mix and services provided. Medicare reimbursement rates could also decline due to the imposition of co-payments or other mechanisms that shift responsibility for a portion of the amount payable to beneficiaries. Rates could also decline due to adjustments to the wage index. Our profitability for Medicare reimbursed services largely depends upon our ability to manage the cost of providing these services. If we receive lower reimbursement rates, or if our cost of providing services increases by more than the annual Medicare price adjustment, our profitability could be adversely impacted. On October 30, 2009, CMS published final regulations for home health agencies for calendar year 2010. As first finalized in the calendar year 2008 final rule, CMS imposed a 2.75% reduction of the 60-day episode rate for 19 Table of Contents 2010 and noted that the 2.71% reduction slated for 2011 has not changed. This reduction in the reimbursement formula will result in a decrease in the amount of reimbursements we receive. The 2010 final rule also provided for a 2.0% full home health market basket increase for calendar year 2010. A 2.0% full home health market basket increase indicates an increase in the cost of home health goods and services and will produce a corresponding increase to the payment and cost limits for home health services in the CMS payment system. A home health market basket reduction would occur in the event of deflation or if otherwise mandated by Congress. An overall market basket reduction would result in a decrease in the amount of reimbursements we receive. In addition, the amount of reimbursement based on the home health market basket may be reduced with respect to an agency seeking reimbursement if certain requirements are not met. Reduction in the payments and cost limits for the identified basket of goods based on deflation or failure to meet certain requirements is referred to in the industry as a market basket reduction. Under the 2010 final regulations, the home health market basket increase will be reduced by 2 percentage points to zero if an agency fails to submit certain required quality data. The required quality data consists of a set of data elements that are used to assess outcomes for adult homecare patients, which include, among other things, improvements in ambulation, bathing and surgical wound status. In its March 2010 report to Congress, MedPAC made several recommendations that could adversely affect the home health industry and potentially our business, including recommendations that Congress rebase the payment system to reflect the average costs of providing services. The Health Reform Law requires CMS to rebase payments for home health services, reducing payments beginning in 2013 with a four-year phase-in and full implementation in 2016. Any reduction in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements would adversely affect our profitability. Private payors, including commercial insurance companies, could also reduce reimbursement. Any reduction in reimbursement from private payors would adversely affect our profitability. We are subject to extensive government regulation. Changes to the laws and regulations governing our business could negatively impact our profitability and any failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business. The federal government and the states in which we operate regulate our industry extensively. The laws and regulations governing our operations, along with the terms of participation in various government programs, impose certain requirements on the way in which we do business, the services we offer, and our interactions with consumers and the public. These requirements relate to:  licensure and certification;  adequacy and quality of health care services;  qualifications and training of health care and support personnel;  confidentiality, maintenance and security issues associated with medical records and claims processing;  relationships with physicians and other referral sources;  operating policies and procedures;  addition of facilities and services; and  billing for services. These laws and regulations, and their interpretations, are subject to frequent change. These changes could reduce our profitability by increasing our liability, increasing our administrative and other costs, increasing or decreasing mandated services, forcing us to restructure our relationships with referral sources and providers or requiring us to implement additional or different programs and systems. Failure to comply could lead to the termination of rights to participate in federal and state-sponsored programs, the suspension or revocation of licenses and other civil and criminal penalties and a delay in our ability to bill and collect for services provided. 20 Table of Contents On March 23, 2010, the President signed into law the Health Reform Law. The Health Reform Law includes several provisions that may affect reimbursement for home health agencies. Congress directed the Secretary of DHHS to develop a program for value-based purchasing program for payments to home health agencies. The Health Reform Law also creates CMMI, to test payment and service delivery systems to reduce program expenditures. Among the issues that are to be addressed by CMMI are establishing pilot programs that bundle acute care hospital services with physician services and post-acute care services, including home health services for patients with certain selected conditions. We may have difficulty negotiating for a fair share of the bundled payment. In addition, we may be unfairly penalized if a consumer is readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge for reasons beyond our control. The Health Reform Law also requires CMS to rebase payments for home health services, reducing payments beginning 2013 with a four-year phase-in and full implementation in 2016. Reductions may not exceed 3.5% of the reimbursement in effect on March 23, 2010. The Health Reform Law mandates a 1% reduction in the market basket update for 2011 and 2012 and a market basket productivity adjustment for 2015 and subsequent years. The market basket reductions may result in a negative adjustment. The Health Reform Law reduces total payments for all home health agencies for outliers from 5% to 2.5%, and, in addition, beginning 2011 caps payments to any one home health agency to no more than 10% of the payments received by the home health agency in a year. The Health Reform Law provides for the appointment of an IMAB that will have authority to recommend cost cutting measures to Congress to control the growth of Medicare spending, reducing expenditures to certain targeted amounts and other changes to the Medicare program. The IMAB would be appointed by the President. Congress will be severely limited in its ability to debate or modify recommendations of the IMAB, giving the IMAB broad powers to reduce Medicare spending and modify the program. The Health Reform Law is broad, sweeping reform, and is subject to change, including through the adoption of related regulations, the way in which its provisions are interpreted and the manner in which it is enforced. We cannot assure you that the provisions described above, or that any other provisions of the Health Reform Law, will not adversely impact our business, results of operations or financial results. We may be unable to mitigate any adverse effects resulting from the Health Reform Act. The HITECH Act established certain health information security breach notification requirements. A covered entity must notify any individual whose protected health information is breached. While we believe that we protect individuals health information, if our information systems are breached, we may experience reputational harm that could adversely affect our business. In addition, failure to comply with the HITECH Act could result in fines and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on us. In its March 2010 report to Congress, in connection with its recommendation that Congress rebase the home health payment system, MedPAC recommended that Congress direct the DHHS to identify categories of patients who are likely to receive the greatest clinical benefit from home health and develop measures that evaluate the quality of care for each category of patient. In addition, MedPAC recommended that Congress direct the DHHS to review home health agencies that have unusual claims patterns, and delegate to DHHS the authority to implement safeguards, such as a moratorium on new providers, prior authorization, or suspension of prompt payment requirements where it appears there is high risk. Many of the recommendations made by MedPAC in its March 2010 report to Congress could adversely affect the home health industry and potentially our business. We are subject to federal and state laws that govern our employment practices. Failure to comply with these laws, or changes to these laws that increase our employment-related expenses, could adversely impact our operations. We are required to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to employment, including occupational safety and health requirements, wage and hour requirements, employment insurance and equal employment opportunity laws. These laws can vary significantly among states and can be highly technical. Costs and expenses related to these requirements are a significant operating expense and may increase as a result of, among other things, changes in federal or state laws or regulations requiring employers to provide specified benefits to employees, increases in the minimum wage and local living wage ordinances, increases in the level of existing benefits or the lengthening of periods for which unemployment benefits are available. We may not be 21 Table of Contents able to offset any increased costs and expenses. Furthermore, any failure to comply with these laws, including even a seemingly minor infraction, can result in significant penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, certain individuals and entities, known as excluded persons, are prohibited from receiving payment for their services rendered to Medicaid or Medicare beneficiaries. If we inadvertently hire or contract with an excluded person, or if any of our current employees or contractors becomes an excluded person in the future without our knowledge, we may be subject to substantial civil penalties, including up to $10,000 for each item or service furnished by the excluded individual to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary, an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed and exclusion from the program. Under the Health Reform Law, beginning in 2014, if we continue to provide a medical plan, we will be required to provide a minimum level of coverage for all full-time employees. Should any full-time employee receive subsidized coverage through an exchange, we could be liable for an annual penalty equal to the lesser of $3,000 for each full-time employee receiving subsidized coverage or $2,000 for each of our full-time employees. The impact of these penalties may have a significant impact on our profitability. We are subject to reviews, compliance audits and investigations that could result in adverse findings that negatively affect our net service revenues and profitability. As a result of our participation in Medicaid, Medicaid waiver and Medicare programs and other state and local governmental programs, and pursuant to certain of our contractual relationships, we are subject to various reviews, audits and investigations by governmental authorities and other third parties to verify our compliance with these programs and agreements as well as applicable laws, regulations and conditions of participation. If we fail to meet any of the conditions of participation or coverage, we may receive a notice of deficiency from the applicable surveyor or authority. Failure to institute a plan of action to correct the deficiency within the period provided by the surveyor or authority could result in civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of fines or other sanctions, damage to our reputation, cancellation of our agreements, suspension or revocation of our licenses or disqualification from federal and state reimbursement programs. These actions may adversely affect our ability to provide certain services, to receive payments from other payors and to continue to operate. Additionally, actions taken against one of our locations may subject our other locations to adverse consequences. We may also fail to discover all instances of noncompliance by our acquisition targets, which could subject us to adverse remedies once those acquisitions are complete. Any termination of one or more of our locations from the Medicare program or another state or local program for failure to satisfy such programs conditions of participation could adversely affect our net service revenues and profitability. Payments we receive in respect of Medicaid and Medicare can be retroactively adjusted after a new examination during the claims settlement process or as a result of pre- or post-payment audits. Federal, state and local government payors may disallow our requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain costs are not reimbursable because proper documentation was not provided or because certain services were not covered or deemed necessary. In addition, other third-party payors may reserve rights to conduct audits and make reimbursement adjustments in connection with or exclusive of audit activities. Significant adjustments as a result of these audits could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. In 2006, the federal government launched a national pilot program utilizing independent contractors known as recovery audit contractors, or RACs, to identify and recoup Medicare overpayments. RACs are paid a contingent fee based on amounts recouped. An initial demonstration project implemented in several states resulted in the return of over $900 million in overpayments to Medicare between 2005 and 2008 from various provider types. California was the only state in which we operate that participated in the initial pilot program. The RAC program is now permanently implemented in all 50 states. This expansion may lead to an increase in the number of overpayment reviews, more aggressive audits and more claims for recoupment. If future Medicare RAC reviews result in significant refund payments, it would have an adverse effect on our financial results. 22 Table of Contents Negative publicity or changes in public perception of our services may adversely affect our ability to receive referrals, obtain new agreements and renew existing agreements. Our success in receiving referrals, obtaining new agreements and renewing our existing agreements depends upon maintaining our reputation as a quality service provider among governmental authorities, physicians, hospitals, discharge planning departments, case managers, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, advocacy groups, consumers and their families, other referral sources and the public. While we believe that the services that we provide are of high quality, if studies mandated by Congress in the Health Reform Law to make public quality measures are implemented and if our quality measures are deemed to be not of the highest value, our reputation could be negatively affected. Negative publicity, changes in public perceptions of our services or government investigations of our operations could damage our reputation and hinder our ability to receive referrals, retain agreements or obtain new agreements. Increased government scrutiny may also contribute to an increase in compliance costs and could discourage consumers from using our services. Any of these events could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Our growth strategy depends on our ability to manage growing and changing operations and we may not be successful in managing this growth. Our business plan calls for significant growth in business over the next several years through the expansion of our services in existing markets and the establishment of a presence in new markets. This growth will place significant demands on our management team, systems, internal controls and financial and professional resources. In addition, we will need to further develop our financial controls and reporting systems to accommodate future growth. This could require us to incur expenses for hiring additional qualified personnel, retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems and expanding our information technology infrastructure. Our inability to effectively manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, our growth strategy calls for further development of our consumer-oriented, integrated service delivery model. We may not be successful in implementing this strategy in each of the markets in which we operate. Additionally, even if this strategy is successfully implemented, integration of services may not lead to growth as anticipated. Furthermore, this strategy could lead to changes that may adversely affect our business, such as altering our mix of payors, increasing our exposure to liabilities, increasing the regulations to which we are subject and increasing our overhead. Future acquisitions or start-ups may be unsuccessful and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities. Our growth strategy includes geographical expansion into new markets and the addition of new services in existing markets through the acquisition of local homecare service providers. These acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including difficulties assimilating acquired personnel and other corporate cultures into our business, the potential loss of key employees or consumers of acquired providers, and the assumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired providers. In the past, we have made acquisitions that have not performed as expected or that we have been unable to successfully integrate with our existing operations. In addition, our due diligence review of acquired businesses may not successfully identify all potential issues. For example, we were unable to fully integrate one acquired business because we were unable to procure a necessary government endorsement. The failure to effectively integrate future acquisitions could have an adverse impact on our operations. In the last three years, in addition to acquisitions, we have grown our business through thirteen start-up, or de novo, locations, and we may in the future start up new locations in existing and new markets. Start-ups involve significant risks, including those relating to licensure, accreditation, hiring new personnel, establishing relationships with referral sources and delayed or difficulty in installing our operating and information systems. We may not be successful in establishing start-up locations in a timely manner due to generating insufficient business activity and incurring higher than projected operating cost that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 23 Table of Contents Effective January 1, 2010, CMS implemented a prohibition of the sale or transfer of the Medicare Provider Agreement for any Medicare-certified home health agency that has been in existence for less than 36 months or that has undergone a change of ownership in the last 36 months. This limitation may reduce the number of home health agencies that otherwise would have been available for acquisition and may limit our ability to successfully pursue our acquisition strategy. We may be unable to pursue acquisitions or expand into new geographic regions without obtaining additional capital or consent from our lenders. At December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, we had cash balances of $0.5 million and $6.1 million, respectively. On November 2, 2009, in conjunction with our initial public offering, we entered into a new senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $50 million revolving line of credit, of which we immediately drew down approximately $29.5 million. As of December 31, 2009 we had $38.5 million of borrowing outstanding on the new credit facility. After giving effect to the $38.5 million drawn on our $50.0 million new credit facility as of December 31, 2009 and approximately $7.2 million of outstanding letters of credit, we had $4.3 million available for borrowing under the new credit facility as of December 31, 2009. On March 18, 2010, we entered into an amendment to this credit facility which increased the maximum borrowing commitment available to us by $5.0 million to $55.0 million. Since our new credit facility, as amended, provides for borrowings based on a multiple of an EBITDA ratio, any declines experienced in our EBITDA would result in a decrease in our available borrowings under the new credit facility. We cannot predict the timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts, our efforts to expand into new geographic regions or the associated capital commitments. If we do not have sufficient cash resources or availability under our new credit facility, our growth could be limited unless we obtain additional equity or debt financing. In the future, we may elect to issue additional equity securities in conjunction with raising capital, completing an acquisition or expanding into a new geographic region. Such issuances would be dilutive to existing shareholders. In addition, our credit facility prohibits us from consummating more than three acquisitions in any calendar year, and, in any event, does not permit the purchase price for any one acquisition to exceed $500,000, in each case without the consent of the lenders. The consideration we paid in connection with eight of the 11 acquisitions we completed in the past three years exceeded $500,000. In addition, our credit facility requires, among other things, that we are in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants set forth therein and that no event of default exists before and after giving effect to any proposed acquisition. Our ability to expand in a manner consistent with historic practices may be limited if we are unable to obtain such consent from our lenders. Access to additional capital and credit markets, at a reasonable cost, may be necessary for us to fund our operations, including potential acquisitions and working capital requirements. We currently rely on one financial institution for funding under our new credit facility, as amended, and any instability in the financial markets or the negative impact of local, national and worldwide economic conditions on that financial institution could impact our short and long-term liquidity needs to meet our business requirements. Our business may be harmed by labor relations matters. We are subject to a risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters because our hourly workforce is highly unionized. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 64% of our hourly workforce was represented by two national unions, including the Service Employees International Union, which is our largest union. Our local labor agreements will be negotiated as they expire, which will occur at various times through 2011. Upon expiration of these collective bargaining agreements, we may not be able to negotiate labor agreements on satisfactory terms with these labor unions. A strike, work stoppage or other slowdown could result in a disruption of our operations and/or higher ongoing labor costs, which could adversely affect our business. Labor costs are the most significant component of our total expenditures and, therefore, an increase in the cost of labor could significantly harm our business. 24 Table of Contents Migration of our consumers to Medicare managed care providers could negatively impact our operating results. Historically, we have generated a substantial portion of our net service revenues from Medicare and certain other payors on an episodic, prospective basis. Under the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, the United States Congress allocated significant additional funds and other incentives to Medicare managed care providers in order to promote greater participation in those plans by Medicare beneficiaries. These managed care providers typically reimburse us after services are provided, and then on a fee-for-service or per visit basis. Our margins on services provided to managed care providers are lower than our margins on services provided on an episodic basis and paid for on a prospective basis. If these allocations of funds have the intended result, our margins could decline, which could cause our operating results to suffer. We are subject to federal and state laws that govern our financial relationships with physicians and other health care providers, including potential or current referral sources. We are required to comply with federal and state laws, generally referred to as anti-kickback laws, that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or other financial arrangements that are designed to encourage the referral of patients to a particular medical services provider. In addition, certain financial relationships, including ownership interests and compensation arrangements, between physicians and providers of designated health services, such as our company, to whom those physicians refer patients, are prohibited by the Stark Law and similar state laws. Under both the anti-kickback laws and the Stark Law, there are a number of safe harbors and exceptions that permit certain carefully constrained relationships. For example, we currently utilize the personal services exception to the Stark Law for our contractual relationships with certain physicians who provide medical director services to our company and who are current or potential referral sources. Courts or regulatory agencies may interpret state and federal Anti-Kickback laws, the Stark Law and similar state laws regulating relationships between health care providers and physicians in ways that will implicate our business. Provisions in the Health Reform Law make it easier to prosecute an Anti-Kickback Law violation as it is no longer necessary for the government to prove that a person had the specific intent to violate the statute. The Health Reform Law permits the government or a whistleblower to file an action under the False Claims Act if there an arrangement that violates the Anti-Kickback Law or the Stark Law. In addition, the DHHS may withhold payments if it believes in its discretion that there is credible evidence of fraud. Violations of these laws could lead to fines or sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are required to comply with laws governing the transmission of privacy of health information. HIPAA requires us to comply with standards for the exchange of health information within our company and with third parties, such as payors, business associates and consumers. These include standards for common health care transactions, such as claims information, plan eligibility, payment information, the use of electronic signatures, unique identifiers for providers, employers, health plans and individuals and security, privacy and enforcement. New standards and regulations may be adopted governing the use, disclosure and transmission of health information with which we may be required to comply. We could be subject to criminal penalties and civil sanctions if we fail to comply with these standards. Our operations subject us to risk of litigation. Operating in the homecare industry exposes us to an inherent risk of wrongful death, personal injury, professional malpractice and other potential claims or litigation brought by our consumers and employees. Because we operate in this industry, from time to time, we are subject to claims alleging that we did not properly treat or care for a consumer that we failed to follow internal or external procedures that resulted in death or harm to a consumer or that our employees mistreated our consumers, resulting in death or harm. We are also subject to claims arising out of accidents involving vehicle collisions brought by consumers whom we are transporting or from employees driving to or from home visits. We operate four adult day centers, three of which provide transportation for our elderly and disabled consumers. We currently operate 14 vehicles each of which transports 25 Table of Contents seven to 14 passengers to and from our locations. The concentration of consumers in one vehicle increases the risk of larger claims being brought against us in the event of an accident. In addition, regulatory agencies may initiate administrative proceedings alleging violations of statutes and regulations arising from our services and seek to impose monetary penalties on us. We could be required to pay substantial amounts to respond to regulatory investigations or, if we do not prevail, damages or penalties arising from these legal proceedings. We also are subject to potential lawsuits under the False Claims Act or other federal and state whistleblower statutes designed to combat fraud and abuse in our industry. These lawsuits can involve significant monetary awards or penalties which may not be covered by our insurance. If our third-party insurance coverage and self-insurance reserves are not adequate to cover these claims, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if we are successful in our defense, civil lawsuits or regulatory proceedings could distract management from running our business or irreparably damage our reputation. Our insurance liability coverage may not be sufficient for our business needs. Although we maintain insurance consistent with industry practice, the insurance we maintain may not be sufficient to satisfy all claims made against us. For example, we have a $350,000 deductible per person/per occurrence under our workers compensation insurance program. We cannot assure you that claims will not be made in the future in excess of the limits of our insurance, and any such claims, if successful and in excess of such limits, may have a material adverse effect on our business or assets. We utilize historical data to estimate our reserves for our insurance programs. If losses on asserted claims exceed the current insurance coverage and accrued reserves, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Changes in our annual insurance costs and self-insured retention limits depend in large part on the insurance market, and insurance coverage may not continue to be available to us at commercially reasonable rates, in adequate amounts or on satisfactory terms. Inclement weather or natural disasters may impact our ability to provide services. Inclement weather may prevent our employees from providing authorized services. We are not paid for authorized services that are not delivered due to these weather events. Furthermore, prolonged inclement weather or the occurrence of natural disasters in the markets in which we operate could disrupt our relationships with consumers, employees and referral sources located in affected areas and, in the case of our corporate office, our ability to provide administrative support services, including billing and collection services. For example, our corporate headquarters and a number of our agencies are located in the Midwestern United States and California, increasing our exposure to blizzards and other major snowstorms, ice storms, tornados, flooding and earthquakes. Future inclement weather or natural disasters may adversely affect our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our business depends on our information systems. Our operations may be disrupted if we are unable to effectively integrate, manage and maintain the security of our information systems. Our business depends on effective and secure information systems that assist us in, among other things, gathering information to improve the quality of consumer care, optimizing financial performance, adjusting consumer mix, monitoring regulatory compliance and enhancing staff efficiency. We rely on an external service provider, McKesson, to provide continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement of our primary information systems used for our operational needs. The software we license from McKesson supports intake, personnel scheduling, office clinical and centralized billing and receivables management in an integrated database, enabling us to standardize the care delivered across our network of locations and monitor our performance and consumer outcomes. To the extent that McKesson becomes insolvent or fails to support the software or systems, or if we lose our license with McKesson, our operations could be negatively affected. We also depend upon a proprietary payroll management system that includes a feature for general ledger population, tax reporting, managing wage assignments and garnishments, on-site check printing, direct-deposit paychecks and customizable heuristic analytical controls. If we experience a reduction or interruption in the performance, reliability or availability of 26 Table of Contents our information systems, or fail to restore our information systems after such a reduction or interruption, our operations and ability to produce timely and accurate reports could be adversely affected. Because of the confidential health information and consumer records we store and transmit, loss of electronically-stored information for any reason could expose us to a risk of regulatory action, litigation and liability. The agreements that govern our credit facility contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business. Our credit facility agreement requires us to comply with customary financial and non-financial covenants. The financial covenants require us to maintain a maximum fixed charge ratio and a maximum leverage ratio, and limit our capital expenditures. Our credit facility also includes non-financial covenants including restrictions on our ability to:  transfer assets, enter into mergers, make acquisitions or experience fundamental changes;  make investments, loans and advances;  incur additional indebtedness and guarantee obligations;  create liens on assets;  enter into affiliate transactions;  enter into transactions other than in the ordinary course of business;  incur capital lease obligations; and  make capital expenditures. The restrictions in our credit facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on our ability to take actions that may be in our best interests. Our current principal stockholders have significant influence over us, and they could delay, deter or prevent a change of control or other business combination or otherwise cause us to take action with which you might not agree. Eos Capital Partners III, L.P. and Eos Partners SBIC III, L.P., or the Eos Funds, together beneficially own approximately 38.3% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, the Eos Funds have the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including:  changes to the composition of our board of directors, which has the authority to direct our business and appoint and remove our officers;  proposed mergers, consolidations or other business combinations; and  amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which govern the rights attached to our shares of common stock. In addition, two of our directors are affiliated with the Eos Funds. This concentration of ownership of shares of our common stock could delay or prevent proxy contests, mergers, tender offers, open-market purchase programs or other purchases of shares of our common stock that might otherwise give you the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common stock. The interests of the Eos Funds may not always coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock. This concentration of ownership may also adversely affect our stock price. We may not be able to attract, train and retain qualified personnel. We must attract and retain qualified personnel in the markets in which we operate in order to provide our services. We compete for personnel with other providers of social and medical services as well as companies in 27 Table of Contents other service-based industries. Competition may be greater for skilled personnel, such as therapists and registered nurses. Our ability to attract and retain personnel depends on several factors, including our ability to provide employees with attractive assignments and competitive benefits and salaries. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, we may be unable to provide our services, the quality of our services may decline, and we could lose consumers and referral sources. We may be more vulnerable to the effects of a public health catastrophe than other businesses due to the nature of our consumers. The majority of our consumers are older individuals with complex medical challenges, many of whom may be more vulnerable than the general public during a pandemic or in a public health catastrophe. Our employees are also at greater risk of contracting contagious diseases due to their increased exposure to vulnerable consumers. For example, if a flu pandemic were to occur, we could suffer significant losses to our consumer population or a reduction in the availability of our employees and, at a high cost, be required to hire replacements for affected workers. Accordingly, certain public health catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We depend on the services of our executive officers and other key employees. Our success depends upon the continued employment of certain members of our senior management team. We also depend upon the continued employment of the individuals that manage several of our key functional areas, including operations, business development, accounting, finance, human resources, marketing, information systems, contracting and compliance. The departure of any member of our senior management team may materially adversely affect our operations. If an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets were to occur, our earnings would be negatively impacted. Goodwill and intangible assets with finite lives represent a significant portion of our assets as a result of our acquisition of Addus HealthCare in September 2006 and certain other acquisitions. At December 31, 2009 goodwill and intangible assets with finite lives amounted to $59.5 million and $13.1 million, respectively. As described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, these assigned values are reviewed on an annual basis or at the time events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Should business conditions or other factors deteriorate and negatively impact the estimated realizable value of future cash flows of our business segments, we could be required to write off a substantial portion of our assets. Depending upon the magnitude of the write off, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The market price of our common stock may be volatile and this may adversely affect our stockholders. The price at which our common stock trades may be volatile. The stock market has recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of securities, including securities of health care companies. The market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:  our operating and financial performance;  variances in our quarterly financial results compared to expectations;  the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;  future sales of common stock or the perception that sales could occur;  investor perception of our business and our prospects;  developments relating to litigation or governmental investigations;  changes or proposed changes in health care laws or regulations or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters; or  general economic and stock market conditions. 28 Table of Contents In addition, the stock market in general has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of homecare companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, securities class-action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their respective securities. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type is often expensive to defend and may divert our management teams attention as well as resources from the operation of our business. We do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend solely on appreciation in the price of our common stock. We do not pay dividends on our shares of common stock and intend to retain all future earnings to finance the continued growth and development of our business and for general corporate purposes. In addition, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, capital requirements, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. If securities or industry analysts fail to publish research or reports about our business or publish negative research or reports, or our results are below analysts estimates, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock may depend in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If analysts fail to publish reports on us regularly or at all, we could fail to gain visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. If one or more analysts do cover us and downgrade their evaluations of our stock or our results are below analysts estimates, our stock price would likely decline. Provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited change in control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock. These provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management without the consent of the board of directors. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws that could delay or prevent an unsolicited change in control include:  a staggered board of directors;  limitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders; and  the authorization of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval. As a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. This section generally prohibits us from engaging in mergers and other business combinations with stockholders that beneficially own 15% or more of our voting stock, or with their affiliates, unless our directors or stockholders approve the business combination in the prescribed manner. However, because the Eos Funds acquired their shares prior to our initial public offering completed on November 2, 2009, Section 203 is currently inapplicable to any business combination with the Eos Funds or their affiliates. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws require that any stockholder proposals or nominations for election to our board of directors must meet specific advance notice requirements and procedures, which make it more difficult for our stockholders to make proposals or director nominations. 29 Table of Contents If we fail to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our business and stock price could be adversely impacted. We are in the process of documenting, reviewing and, where appropriate, improving our internal controls and procedures in preparation for compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires annual management and independent auditor assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors addressing these assessments. These requirements will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and may also place strain on our personnel, systems and resources. Compliance with public reporting and Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements will require us to build out our compliance, accounting and finance staff. In connection with the implementation of the necessary procedures and practices related to internal control over financial reporting, we may identify deficiencies or material weaknesses that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. Implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training of our directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs to modify our existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. Moreover, if we fail to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 on a timely basis, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and sanctions, our ability to raise capital could be impaired, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and our stock price could be adversely affected.
