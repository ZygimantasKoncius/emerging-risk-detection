ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  (Continued) A failure of the Companys internal controls could adversely affect the Companys ability to report its financial condition and results of operations accurately and on a timely basis. As a result, the Companys business, operating results and liquidity could be harmed. Because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud, even an effective system of internal control may not prevent or detect all misstatements. In the event of an internal control failure, the Companys ability to report its financial results on a timely and accurate basis could be adversely impacted, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in its financial reports or have a material adverse affect on the Companys ability to operate its business or access sources of liquidity.
