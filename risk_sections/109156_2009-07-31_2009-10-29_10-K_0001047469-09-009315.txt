ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We make forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in other reports we file with the SEC and in presentations to investors and others. In addition, members of our senior management make forward-looking statements orally in presentations to analysts, investors, the media and others. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding our objectives and expectations with respect to our financial plan, sales and earnings, merchandising and marketing strategies, acquisitions and dispositions, share repurchases, store opening, renovation, remodeling and expansion, inventory management and performance, liquidity and cash flows, capital structure, capital expenditures, development of our information technology and telecommunications plans and related management information systems, e-commerce initiatives, human resource initiatives and other statements regarding our plans and objectives. In addition, the words "plans to," "anticipate," "estimate," "project," "intend," "expect," "believe," "forecast," "can," "could," "should," "will," "may," or similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but some of these statements may use other phrasing. These forward-looking statements are intended to relay our expectations about the future, and speak only as of the date they are made. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise publicly or otherwise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events, new information or future circumstances, except as required by law. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and a variety of factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the anticipated or expected results expressed in or suggested by these forward-looking statements. If the general economy performs poorly, discretionary spending on goods that are, or are perceived to be, "luxuries" may not grow and may decrease. Jewelry purchases are discretionary and may be affected by adverse trends in the general economy (and consumer perceptions of those trends). In addition, a number of other factors affecting consumers such as employment, wages and salaries, business conditions, energy costs, credit availability and taxation policies, for the economy as a whole and in regional and local markets where we operate, can impact sales and earnings. The economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 has significantly impacted our sales and the continuation of this downturn, and particularly its worsening, would have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition. The concentration of a substantial portion of our sales in three relatively brief selling periods means that our performance is more susceptible to disruptions. A substantial portion of our sales are derived from three selling periodsÂ—Holiday (Christmas), Valentine's Day and Mother's Day. Because of the briefness of these three selling periods, the opportunity for sales to recover in the event of a disruption or other difficulty is limited, and the impact of disruptions and difficulties can be significant. For instance, adverse weather (such as a blizzard or hurricane), a significant interruption in the receipt of products (whether because of vendor or other product problems), or a sharp decline in mall traffic occurring during one of these selling periods could materially impact sales for the affected period and, because of the importance of each of these selling periods, commensurately impact overall sales and earnings. Most of our sales are of products that include diamonds, precious metals and other commodities. A substantial portion of our purchases and sales occur outside the United States. Fluctuations in the availability and pricing of commodities or exchange rates could impact our ability to obtain, produce and sell products at favorable prices. The supply and price of diamonds in the principal world market are significantly influenced by a single entity, which has traditionally controlled the marketing of a substantial majority of the world's supply of diamonds and sells rough diamonds to worldwide diamond cutters at prices determined in its sole discretion. The availability of diamonds also is somewhat dependent on the political conditions in 9 diamond-producing countries and on the continuing supply of raw diamonds. Any sustained interruption in this supply could have an adverse affect on our business. We also are affected by fluctuations in the price of diamonds, gold and other commodities. A significant change in prices of key commodities could adversely affect our business by reducing operating margins or decreasing consumer demand if retail prices are increased significantly. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations impact costs and cash flows associated with our Canadian operations and the acquisition of inventory from international vendors. In addition, a substantial portion of our raw materials and finished goods are sourced in countries generally described as having developing economies. Any instability in these economies could result in an interruption of our supplies, increases in costs, legal challenges and other difficulties. Our sales are dependent upon mall traffic. Our stores and kiosks are located primarily in shopping malls throughout the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Our success is in part dependent upon the continued popularity of malls as a shopping destination and the ability of malls, their tenants and other mall attractions to generate customer traffic. Accordingly, a significant decline in this popularity, especially if it is sustained, would substantially harm our sales and earnings. In addition, even assuming this popularity continues, mall traffic can be negatively impacted by weather, gas prices and similar factors. We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry. The retail jewelry business is highly competitive and fragmented, and we compete with nationally recognized jewelry chains as well as a large number of independent regional and local jewelry retailers and other types of retailers who sell jewelry and gift items, such as department stores and mass merchandisers. We also compete with internet sellers of jewelry. Because of the breadth and depth of this competition, we are constantly under competitive pressure that both constrains pricing and requires extensive merchandising efforts in order for us to remain competitive. Any failure by us to manage our inventory effectively will negatively impact sales and earnings. We purchase much of our inventory well in advance of each selling period. In the event we misjudge consumer preferences or demand, we will experience lower sales than expected and will have excessive inventory that may need to be written down in value or sold at prices that are less than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition. Any failure of our pricing and promotional strategies to be as effective as desired will negatively impact our sales and earnings. We set the prices for our products and establish product specific and store-wide promotions in order to generate store traffic and sales. While these decisions are intended to maximize our sales and earnings, in some instances they do not. For instance, promotions, which can require substantial lead time, may not be as effective as desired or may prove unnecessary in certain economic circumstances. Where we have implemented a pricing or promotional strategy that does not work as expected, our sales and earnings will be adversely impacted. Because of our dependence upon a small concentrated number of landlords for a substantial number of our locations, any significant erosion of our relationships with those landlords or their financial condition would negatively impact our ability to obtain and retain store locations. We are significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs that allow us to earn a reasonable return on our locations. We depend on the leasing market and our landlords to determine supply, demand, lease cost and operating costs and conditions. We cannot be certain as to when or whether desirable store locations will become or remain available to us at reasonable lease and operating costs. Several large landlords dominate the ownership of 10 prime malls, and we are dependent upon maintaining good relations with those landlords in order to obtain and retain store locations on optimal terms. From time to time, we do have disagreements with our landlords and a significant disagreement, if not resolved, could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, any financial weakness on the part of our landlords could adversely impact us in a number of ways, including decreased marketing by the landlords and the loss of other tenants that generate mall traffic. Changes in regulatory requirements relating to the extension of credit may increase the cost of or adversely affect our operations. Our operations are affected by numerous U.S. and Canadian federal and state or provincial laws that impose disclosure and other requirements upon the origination, servicing and enforcement of credit accounts and limitations on the maximum aggregate amount of finance charges that may be charged by a credit provider. Any change in the regulation of credit (including changes in the application of current laws) which would materially limit the availability of credit to our customer base could adversely affect our sales and earnings. Any disruption in, or changes to, our private label credit card arrangement with Citibank, N.A. may adversely affect our ability to provide consumer credit and write credit insurance. Under arrangements with Citibank, N.A. and one of its subsidiaries (collectively, "Citibank"), Citibank provides financing for our customers to purchase merchandise through private label credit cards. The arrangement also enables us to write credit insurance. Customers use our Citibank arrangements to pay for approximately 40 percent of purchases in the U.S. and approximately 30 percent of purchases in Canada. Under the agreements governing our arrangement, our Canadian and U.S. subsidiaries must satisfy various financial and other covenants. We recently amended these arrangements in order to obtain relief from certain covenants that we did not meet. Any disruption in our arrangement with Citibank, particularly in the current credit market in which replacing Citibank might be difficult, would have an adverse effect on our business, especially to the extent that it materially limits credit availability to our customer base. See Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for more detailed information related to the Citibank agreement. We are dependent upon our revolving credit agreement for our liquidity needs. We have a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Bank of America that contains various financial and other covenants. See Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Should we be unable to fulfill the covenants contained in the facility, or should the facility not be renewed or replaced when it matures in August 2011, we would be unable to fund our operations without a significant restructuring of our business. If the credit markets continue to deteriorate, our ability to obtain the financing needed to operate our business could be adversely impacted. We utilize a revolving credit facility to finance our working capital requirements, including the purchase of inventory, among other things. If our ability to obtain the financing needed to meet these requirements was adversely impacted as a result of continued deterioration in the credit markets, our business could be significantly impacted. In addition, the amount of available borrowings under our credit facility is based, in part, on the appraised liquidation value of our inventory. Any declines in the appraised value of our inventory could impact our ability to obtain the financing necessary to operate our business. Acquisitions and dispositions involve special risk, including the risk that we may not be able to complete proposed acquisitions or dispositions or that such transactions may not be beneficial to us. We have made significant acquisitions and dispositions in the past and may in the future make additional acquisitions and dispositions. Difficulty integrating an acquisition into our existing infrastructure and operations may cause us to fail to realize expected return on investment through revenue increases, 11 cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence and customer reach, and/or other projected benefits from the acquisition. In addition, we may not achieve anticipated cost savings or may be unable to find attractive investment opportunities for funds received in connection with a disposition. Additionally, attractive acquisition or disposition opportunities may not be available at the time or pursuant to terms acceptable to us and we may be unable to complete acquisitions or dispositions. Ineffective accounting controls can have adverse impacts on the Company. We recently identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. See "Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting." While we are in the process of remediating these weaknesses, and while we concluded that the financial statements contained in this report fairly presented in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows under generally accepted accounting principles, material weaknesses can result in a range of adverse impacts to us, including increased audit and compliance costs and the loss of investor confidence in our financial reports. Changes in estimates, assumptions and judgments made by management related to our evaluation of goodwill and store impairments could significantly affect our financial results. Evaluating the need for goodwill and store impairments is highly complex and involves many subjective estimates, assumptions and judgments by our management. For instance, management makes estimates and assumptions with respect to future cash flow projections, terminal growth rates, discount rates and long-term business plans. If our actual results are not consistent with our estimates, assumptions and judgments by our management, we may be required to recognize additional impairments. Additional factors that may adversely affect our financial performance. Increases in expenses that are beyond our control including items such as increases in interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in foreign currency rates, higher tax rates and changes in laws and regulations, may negatively impact our operating results.
