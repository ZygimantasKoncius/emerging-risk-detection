ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business is subject to a number of risks, including those described below. OUR DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES HAVE NOT GENERATED SIGNIFICANT REVENUES At present, our development activities are focused on water resource development at our San Bernardino County properties. We have not received significant revenues from our development activities to date and we do not know when, if ever, we will receive operating revenues from our development activities. As a result, we continue to incur a net loss from operations. WE MAY NEVER GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES OR BECOME PROFITABLE UNLESS WE ARE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS TO DEVELOP OUR LAND ASSETS AND RELATED WATER RESOURCES We do not know the terms, if any, upon which we may be able to proceed with our water development programs. Regardless of the form of our water development programs, the circumstances under which transfers or storage of water can be made and the profitability of any transfers or storage are subject to significant uncertainties, including hydrologic risks of variable water supplies, risks presented by allocations of water under existing and prospective priorities, and risks of adverse changes to or interpretations of U.S. federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies. Additional risks attendant to such programs include our ability to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and permits, possible litigation by environmental or other groups, unforeseen technical difficulties, general market conditions for water supplies, and the time gap needed to generate significant operating revenues from such programs after operations commence. OUR FAILURE TO MAKE TIMELY PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON OUR INDEBTEDNESS MAY RESULT IN A FORECLOSURE ON OUR ASSETS As of December 31, 2005, we had indebtedness outstanding to our senior secured lender of approximately $25.9 million. Our assets have been put up as collateral to secure the payment of this debt. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow to make timely payments of principal and interest on this indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the terms of agreements governing our indebtedness, we may default on our obligations. If we default on our obligations, our lenders may sell off the assets that we have put up as collateral. This, in turn, would result in a cessation or sale of our operations. THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES UNDER OUR MANAGEMENT EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN WILL IMPACT EARNINGS Under applicable accounting rules, the issuance of shares and options under our Management Incentive Equity Plan will result in a charge to earnings based on the value of our common stock at the time of issue and the valuation of options at the time of their award and will be recorded over the vesting period in proportion to the quantities vested. Our Management Equity Incentive Plan provides for the issuance of up to 1,472,051 shares of common stock. Subsequent to January 1, 2005 we have issued stock or options to purchase stock representing 1,459,712 of the shares authorized for issuance under this Management Equity Incentive Plan. Page 8 Based on the trading price of our common stock at the time of such issuances, such issuances resulted in a charge to our earnings of $16.7 million for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 and will result in a further significant charge to our earnings for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. The cost of approximately 93% of the shares and options issued in our fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 was an expense during 2005. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE FINANCING WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT OUR ASSET DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS We will require additional capital to finance our operations until such time as our asset development operations produce revenues. We cannot assure you that our current lenders, or any other lenders, will give us additional credit should we seek it. If we are unable to obtain additional credit, we may engage in further equity financings. Our ability to obtain equity financing will depend, among other things, on the status of our asset development programs and general conditions in the capital markets at the time funding is sought. Any further equity financings would result in the dilution of ownership interests of our current stockholders. WE ARE RESTRICTED BY CONTRACT FROM PAYING DIVIDENDS AND WE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY DIVIDENDS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE Any return on investment on our common stock will depend primarily upon the appreciation in the price of our common stock. To date, we have never paid a cash dividend on our common stock. The loan documents governing our credit facilities with our senior secured lender prohibit the payment of dividends while such facilities are outstanding. As we have a history of operating losses, we have been unable to date to pay dividends. Even if we post a profit in future years, we currently intend to retain all future earnings for the operation of our business. As a result, we do not anticipate that we will declare any dividends in the foreseeable future. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable at this time.
