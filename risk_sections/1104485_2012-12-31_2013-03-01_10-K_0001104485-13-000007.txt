Item 1A. Risk Factors – Our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.” Ryder Scott prepared our reserve report valuing our proved reserves at December 31, 2012. The report values only our proved reserves and does not value our probable reserves or our possible reserves. The following table sets forth our estimated proved reserves based on the SEC rules as defined in Rule 4.10(a) of Regulation S-X and Item 1200 of Regulation S-K (“SEC Pricing Proved Reserves”). SEC Pricing Proved Reserves(1) Oil (MBbl) Natural Gas (MMcf) Total (MBoe)(2) Pre-Tax PV10% Value $M(3) PDP Properties 23,679 15,014 26,181 $ 795,669 PDNP Properties 3,667 2,336 4,056 42,833 PUD Properties 33,368 23,928 37,356 448,904 Total Proved Properties: 60,714 41,278 67,594 $ 1,287,406 _____________________ (1) The SEC Pricing Proved Reserves table above values oil and natural gas reserve quantities and related discounted future net cash flows as of December 31, 2012 assuming constant realized prices of $84.92 per barrel of oil and $4.78 per Mcf of natural gas, which includes an uplift factor of 1.7 to reflect liquids and condensates (natural gas liquids are included with natural gas). Under SEC guidelines, these prices represent the average prices per barrel of oil and per Mcf of natural gas at the beginning of each month in the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, which averages are then adjusted to reflect applicable transportation and quality differentials. (2) Boe are computed based on a conversion ratio of one Boe for each barrel of oil and one Boe for every 6,000 cubic feet (i.e., 6 Mcf) of natural gas. (3) Pre-tax PV10% may be considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC and is derived from the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Pre-tax PV10% is computed on the same basis as the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows but without deducting future income taxes. We believe Pre-tax PV10% is a useful measure for investors for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties. We further believe investors may utilize our Pre-tax PV10% as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes to be paid. Our management uses this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas properties and acquisitions. However, Pre-tax PV10% is not a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. Our Pre-tax PV10% and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows do not purport to present the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves. The table above assumes prices and costs discounted using an annual discount rate of 10% without future escalation, without giving effect to non-property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses, debt service and depreciation, depletion and amortization, or federal income taxes. 28 The “Pre-tax PV10%” values of our proved reserves presented in the foregoing table may be considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC. The following table reconciles the pre-tax PV10% value of our SEC Pricing Proved Reserves to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. SEC Pricing Proved Reserves (in thousands) Standardized Measure Reconciliation Pre-tax Present Value of estimated future net revenues (Pre-tax PV10%) $ 1,287,406 Future income taxes, discounted at 10% 246,051 Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows $ 1,041,355 Uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves, including many risk factors beyond our control. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating subsurface accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. As a result, estimates of proved reserves may vary depending upon the engineer valuing the reserves. Further, our actual realized price for our oil and natural gas is not likely to average the pricing parameters used to calculate our proved reserves. As such, the oil and natural gas quantities and the value of those commodities ultimately recovered from our properties will vary from reserve estimates. Additional discussion of our proved reserves is set forth under the heading “Supplemental Oil and Gas Information” to our financial statements included later in this report.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the “Selected Financial Data” in Item 6 and the Financial Statements and Accompanying Notes appearing elsewhere in this report. Overview of 2012 Results During 2012, we achieved the following financial and operating results: · Increased total production by 95% compared to 2011; · Increased total estimated proved reserves to 67.6 million Boe as of December 31, 2012, an increase of 44% compared to 2011 year-end; · Participated in the completion of 563 gross (48.3 net) wells, with a 100% success rate in the Bakken and Three Forks plays; · Continued to high-grade and grow our leasehold position to 179,131 net acres with approximately 64% of our total acreage position either developed, held by production, held by operations or permitted as of December 31, 2012; and · Ended the year with $13 million in cash and, including availability under our revolving credit facility, liquidity of approximately $240 million. Operationally, our 2012 performance reflects another year of successfully executing our strategy of developing our acreage position and building a long-life reserve base. Our success enabled us to increase proved reserves by 20.8 million Boe, which is approximately 5.5 times our 2012 production. During 2012, production increased 95% to 3.8 million Boe as compared to 2011 production of 1.9 million Boe. The increase in 2012 production was driven by an 83% increase in producing net wells from 57.9 net wells at December 31, 2011 to 106.2 net wells at December 31, 2012. Total revenues increased 109% in 2012 compared to 2011. This increase was due to higher production and a $15.1 million non-cash gain from mark-to-market of derivative instruments. Average realized prices on a Boe basis (including all realized derivative settlements) were 4% higher in 2012 compared to 2011. As discussed elsewhere in this report, significant changes in oil and natural gas prices can have a material impact on our results of operations and our balance sheet, including the fair value of our derivatives. Source of Our Revenues We derive our revenues from the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from our properties. Revenues are a function of the volume produced, the prevailing market price at the time of sale, oil quality, Btu content and transportation costs to market. We use derivative instruments to hedge future sales prices on a substantial, but varying, portion of our oil production. We expect our derivative activities will help us achieve more predictable cash flows and reduce our exposure to downward price fluctuations. The use of derivative instruments has in the past, and may in the future, prevent us from realizing the full benefit of upward price movements but also mitigates the effects of declining price movements. Our average realized price calculations include the effects of the settlement of all derivative contracts regardless of the accounting treatment. 34 Principal Components of Our Cost Structure · Oil price differentials. The price differential between our Williston Basin well head price and the NYMEX WTI benchmark price is driven by the additional cost to transport oil from the Williston Basin via train, barge, pipeline or truck to refineries. · Unrealized gain (loss) on derivative instruments. We utilize commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of oil. This account activity represents the recognition of gains and losses associated with our outstanding derivative contracts as commodity prices and commodity derivative contracts change on contracts that have not been designated for hedge accounting. · Realized gain (loss) on derivative instruments. This account activity represents our realized gains and losses on the settlement of commodity derivative instruments. · Production expenses. Production expenses are daily costs incurred to bring oil and natural gas out of the ground and to the market, together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties. Such costs also include field personnel compensation, salt water disposal, utilities, maintenance, repairs and servicing expenses related to our oil and natural gas properties. · Production taxes. Production taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas based on a percentage of revenues from products sold at market prices (not hedged prices) or at fixed rates established by federal, state or local taxing authorities. We seek to take full advantage of all credits and exemptions in our various taxing jurisdictions. In general, the production taxes we pay correlate to the changes in oil and natural gas revenues. · Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization includes the systematic expensing of the capitalized costs incurred to acquire, explore and develop oil and natural gas properties. As a full cost company, we capitalize all costs associated with our development and acquisition efforts and allocate these costs to each unit of production using the units-of-production method. · General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses include overhead, including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, costs of maintaining our headquarters, costs of managing our acquisition and development operations, franchise taxes, audit and other professional fees and legal compliance. · Interest expense. We finance a portion of our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and acquisitions with borrowings. As a result, we incur interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions. We capitalize a portion of the interest paid on applicable borrowings into our full cost pool. We include interest expense that is not capitalized into the full cost pool, the amortization of deferred financing costs (including origination and amendment fees), commitment fees and annual agency fees as interest expense. · Income tax expense. Our provision for taxes includes both federal and state taxes. We record our federal income taxes in accordance with accounting for income taxes under GAAP which results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized. 35 Selected Factors That Affect Our Operating Results Our revenues, cash flows from operations and future growth depend substantially upon: · the timing and success of drilling and production activities by our operating partners; · the prices and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs; · the quantity of oil and natural gas production from the wells in which we participate; · changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments we use to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of oil; · our ability to continue to identify and acquire high-quality acreage; and · the level of our operating expenses. In addition to the factors that affect companies in our industry generally, the location of our acreage and wells in the Williston Basin subjects our operating results to factors specific to this region. These factors include the potential adverse impact of weather on drilling, production and transportation activities, particularly during the winter months, and the limitations of the developing infrastructure and transportation capacity in this region. The price of oil in the Williston Basin can vary depending on the market in which it is sold and the means of transportation used to transport the oil to market. Light sweet crude from the Williston Basin has a higher value at many major refining centers because of its higher quality relative to heavier and sour grades of oil; however, because of North Dakota’s location relative to traditional oil transport centers, this higher value is generally offset to some extent by higher transportation costs. While rail transportation has historically been more expensive than pipeline transportation, Williston Basin prices have been high enough to justify shipment by rail to markets as far as St. James, Louisiana, which offers prices benchmarked to Brent/LLS. Although pipeline, truck and rail capacity in the Williston Basin has historically lagged production in growth, we believe that additional planned infrastructure growth will help keep price discounts from significantly eroding wellhead values in the region. The price at which our oil production is sold typically reflects a discount to the NYMEX WTI benchmark price. Thus, our operating results are also affected by changes in the oil price differentials between the NYMEX WTI and the sales prices we receive for our oil production. Higher oil price differentials lowered our oil and gas sales during the first nine months of 2012. Relatively mild weather in North Dakota allowed production throughout the winter (increasing supply) while some refineries were down for routine maintenance (decreasing demand). This caused oil price differentials to increase for a short period during the first half of 2012, which have subsequently declined due to various rail projects coming online, refineries completing their seasonal maintenance and the reversal of the Seaway pipeline from Cushing, Oklahoma to the Gulf Coast. As the rail capacity continues to increase and planned Seaway pipeline expansions are completed, we believe the oil price differentials will return to historical levels. Our oil price differential to the NYMEX WTI benchmark price during 2012 was $9.79 per barrel, as compared to $6.30 per barrel in 2011. Another significant factor affecting our operating results is drilling costs. The cost of drilling wells has increased significantly over the past few years as rising oil prices have triggered increased drilling activity in the Williston Basin. Although individual components of the cost can vary depending on numerous factors such as the length of the horizontal lateral, the number of fracture stimulation stages, and the choice of proppant (sand or ceramic), the total cost of drilling and completing an oil well has increased. This increase is largely due to longer horizontal laterals and more fracture stimulation stages, but also higher demand for rigs and completion services throughout the region. In addition, because of the rapid growth in drilling, the availability of well completion services has at times been constrained, resulting at times in a backlog of wells awaiting completion. 36 Market Conditions Prices for various quantities of oil, natural gas, and NGLs that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. Commodity prices have been volatile in recent years. The following tables list average NYMEX prices for oil and natural gas for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

In 2012, oil, natural gas and NGL sales increased 86% from 2011, driven primarily by a 95% increase in production and partially aided by a 4% increase in realized prices taking into account the effect of settled derivatives. In 2011, oil and natural gas sales increased 168% from 2010 due to a 117% increase in production and partially aided by a 14% increase in realized pricing taking into account the effect of settled derivatives. Our production continues to grow through drilling success as we place new wells into production and through additions from acquisitions, partially offset by the natural decline of our oil and natural gas sales from existing wells. For 2012, our production volumes increased 95% as compared to 2011. For 2011, our production volumes increased 117% as compared to 2010. The production primarily increased due to the addition of 48.3 and 32.3 net productive wells in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our production for each of the last three years is set forth in the following table: Year Ended 2012 2011 2010 Production(1) Oil (Bbl) 3,465,311 1,791,979 849,845 Natural Gas and NGL (Mcf) 1,768,872 800,207 234,411 Total (Boe)(2) 3,760,123 1,925,347 888,914 Average Daily Production(1) Oil (Bbl) 9,468 4,910 2,328 Natural Gas and NGL (Mcf) 4,833 2,192 642 Total (Boe)(2) 10,274 5,275 2,435 __________________________________ (1) Represents volumes sold. (2) Natural gas and NGLs are converted to Boe at the rate of one barrel equals six Mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil and natural gas, which is not necessarily indicative of the relationship of oil and natural gas prices. Derivative Instruments We enter into derivative instruments to manage the price risk attributable to future oil production. For 2012, we incurred a loss on settled derivatives of $0.4 million, compared to $13.4 million in 2011 and $0.5 million in 2010. Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements) received during 2012 was $78.79 per Boe compared to $75.85 per Boe in 2011 and $66.39 per Boe in 2010. Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements) calculation includes all cash settlements for derivatives. Mark-to-market derivative gains and losses were gains of $15.1 million in 2012 compared to a $3.1 million gain in 2011 and a $14.5 million loss in 2010. Our derivatives are not designated for hedge accounting and are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method whereby gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognized immediately into earnings. Mark-to-market accounting treatment creates volatility in our revenues as unrealized gains and losses from derivatives are included in total revenues and are not included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying balance sheets. As commodity prices increase or decrease, such changes will have an opposite effect on the mark-to-market value of our derivatives. Any gains on our derivatives will be offset by lower wellhead revenues in the future or any losses will be offset by higher future wellhead revenues based on the value at the settlement date. At December 31, 2012, all of our derivative contracts are recorded at their fair value, which was a net asset of $3.3 million, an increase of $15.2 million from the $11.9 million net liability recorded as of December 31, 2011. Our open oil derivative contracts are summarized in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Commodity Price Risk.” 38 Production Expenses Production expenses were $32.4 million in 2012 compared to $13.0 million in 2011 and $3.3 million in 2010. We experience increases in operating expenses as we add new wells and maintain production from existing properties. On an absolute dollar basis, our spending for production expenses for 2012 was 148% higher when compared to 2011 due to production levels increasing 95%, as well as higher water hauling and disposal costs and higher servicing expenses. Production expenses are generally higher during a well’s first year of operations due to higher levels of servicing activities associated with managing production levels during a well’s steepest period of decline. Since 44% of our net wells have produced for less than twelve months, we believe the high level of servicing activities will decline as our property base matures. On an absolute dollar basis, our spending for production expenses for 2011 was 297% higher when compared to 2010 due to production levels increasing 117% and higher water hauling and disposal costs and servicing expenses. On a per unit basis, production expenses per Boe increased from $6.77 per barrel sold in 2011 to $8.61 in 2012. On a per unit basis, production expenses per Boe increased from $3.70 per barrel sold in 2010 to $6.77 in 2011. Production Taxes We pay production taxes based on realized oil and natural gas sales. These costs were $28.5 million in 2012 compared to $14.3 million in 2011 and $5.5 million in 2010. Our average production tax rates were 9.6%, 9.0% and 9.2% in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The 2012 average production tax rate was higher than the 2011 average due to well additions that qualified for reduced rates/or tax exemptions during 2011. Certain portions of our production occurs in Montana and North Dakota jurisdictions that have lower initial tax rates for an established period of time or until an established threshold of production is exceeded, after which the tax rates are increased to the standard tax rate. The 2011 average production tax rate was lower than the 2010 average due to the well additions that qualified for reduced rates for tax exemptions during 2011. The majority of our production is located in North Dakota which imposes a standard 11.5% tax on our production revenues except for where properties qualify for reduced rates. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense was $22.6 million for 2012 compared to $13.6 million for 2011 and $7.2 million in 2010. The 2012 increase of $9.0 million when compared to 2011 is due to higher base salaries, cash bonuses and benefits ($1.7 million), increased share based compensation expense ($1.9 million), increased travel expenses ($0.2 million) and partially offset by lower office and other administrative expenses ($0.3 million). Additionally, 2012 general and administrative expenses include $5.5 million of severance charges in connection with the departures of our former president and former chief operating officer. Our personnel costs continue to increase as we invest in our technical teams and other staffing to support our growth. Share based compensation expense represents the amortization of restricted stock grants granted to our employees and directors as part of compensation as well as fully vested share grants to employees and directors throughout the year. The 2011 increase of $6.4 million when compared to 2010 is due to higher base salaries and benefits ($0.9 million), increased share based compensation expense ($2.6 million), higher legal and professional expenses ($1.3 million), increased travel expenses ($0.5 million) and higher office and other administrative expenses due to the addition of more employees ($1.1 million). Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization Depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) was $98.9 million in 2012 compared to $41.2 million in 2011 and $17.1 million in 2010. Depletion expense, the largest component of DD&A, was $26.18 per Boe in 2012 compared to $21.20 per Boe in 2011 and $18.99 per Boe in 2010. We have historically adjusted our depletion rates in the fourth quarter of each year based on the year end reserve report and other times during the year when circumstances indicate there has been a significant change in reserves or costs. The aggregate increase in depletion expense for 2012 compared to 2011 was driven by a 95% increase in production. Additionally, depletion rates rose in 2012 due to an increase in our future development cost estimates to reflect the changes in well completion methodologies (e.g. more stimulation costs per well due to longer lateral extensions) and increased production expenses. Depletion rates in new plays tend to be higher in the beginning as increased initial outlays are amortized over proved reserves based on early stages of evaluations. As these plays mature, new technologies, well completion methodologies and additional historical operating information impact the reserve evaluations. The increase in depletion expense for 2011 compared to 2010 was driven by a 117% increase in production. Depreciation, amortization and accretion was $0.5 million in 2012 compared to $0.4 million in 2011 and $0.2 million in 2010. The following table summarizes DD&A expense per Boe for 2012, 2011 and 2010: 39 Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Change Change 2011 2010 Change Change Depletion $ 26.18 $ 21.20 $ 4.98 23 % $ 21.20 $ 18.99 $ 2.21 12 % Depreciation, amortization, and accretion 0.13 0.18 (0.05 ) (28 )% 0.18 0.23 (0.05 ) (22 )% Total DD&A expense $ 26.31 $ 21.38 $ 4.93 23 % $ 21.38 $ 19.22 $ 2.16 11 % Interest Expense Interest expense was $13.9 million for 2012 compared to $0.6 million in 2011. Interest expense was $0.6 million for 2011 compared to $0.6 million in 2010. In May 2012, we issued $300 million of 8% senior unsecured notes. The increase in interest expense for 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to different weighted average debt amounts outstanding between years, as well as the higher interest rate applicable to the senior notes. Interest Income Interest income was $1,000 for 2012 compared to $0.6 million in 2011. Interest income for 2012 decreased $0.6 million as compared to 2011 because of lower levels of cash and short term investments. In 2011, the higher amount of cash and short term investments resulted from the sale of common stock in November 2010. Interest income was $0.6 million for 2011 compared to $0.5 million in 2010. Interest income for 2011 increased $0.1 million as compared to 2010 due to higher levels of cash and short term investments that resulted from the sale of common stock. Income Tax Provision The provision for income taxes was $43.0 million in 2012 compared to $26.8 million in 2011 and $4.4 million in 2010. The effective tax rate in 2012 was 37.3% compared to an effective tax rate of 39.8% in 2011. The effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state tax rates. The 2011 effective tax rate was 39.8% compared to an effective tax rate in 2010 of 39.0%. Due to higher pre-tax income levels, we increased our federal statutory rate from 34% to 35% in 2011. The effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state tax rates. Net Income Net income was $72.3 million in 2012 compared to $40.6 million in 2011 and $6.9 million in 2010. The increases in net income were driven by higher production levels and higher average sales prices received during each successive period. Partially offsetting the higher oil and gas revenues were increased production expense, production taxes, general and administrative expenses, depletion expenses, and interest expense in each of the respective periods as described above. Higher net income levels increased diluted net income per common share to $1.15, $0.65 and $0.14 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We define Adjusted Net Income as net income excluding (i) unrealized gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net of tax and (ii) severance expenses in connection with the departures of our former president and former chief operating officer, net of tax. Our Adjusted Net Income for the year ended December 31, 2012, was $66.2 million (representing approximately $1.05 per diluted share), as compared to $38.8 million (representing approximately $0.62 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2011, and $15.8 million (representing approximately $0.31 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2010. These increases in Adjusted Net Income are primarily due to our continued addition of oil and natural gas production from new wells and higher realized commodity prices in 2012 compared to 2011 and in 2011 compared to 2010. 40 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before (i) interest expense, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation, depletion, amortization, and accretion, (iv) unrealized gain (loss) on derivative instruments and (v) non-cash share based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $225.3 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $112.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and $47.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. These increases in Adjusted EBITDA are primarily due to our continued addition of oil and natural gas production from new wells and higher realized commodity prices in 2012 compared to 2011 and in 2011 compared to 2010. We believe the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors to gain an overall understanding of our current financial performance. Specifically, we believe the non-GAAP financial measures included herein provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses and unrealized commodity gains and losses that our management believes are not indicative of our core operating results. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used by management for budgeting and forecasting as well as subsequently measuring our performance, and we believe that we are providing investors with financial measures that most closely align to our internal measurement processes. We consider these non-GAAP measures to be useful in evaluating our core operating results as they more closely reflect our essential revenue generating activities and direct operating expenses (resulting in cash expenditures) needed to perform these revenue generating activities. Our management also believes, based on feedback provided by the investment community, that the non-GAAP financial measures are necessary to allow the investment community to construct its valuation models to better compare our results with our competitors and market sector. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measures. Adjusted Net income and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures to GAAP is included below: 41 NORTHERN OIL AND GAS, INC.

Our 2013 budget anticipates we will participate in the drilling and completion of approximately 44 net wells targeting the Bakken and Three Forks formations. Drilling capital expenditures on a per well basis are expected to have an average completed cost of $8.4 million to $8.8 million per well, which assumes a 10% decrease in drilling costs for 2013 compared to 2012. Based on evolving conditions in the field, we expect to spend approximately $20 million on acreage capital expenditures during 2013. In addition, we estimate that we will spend approximately $30 million on other capital expenditure activities, primarily capitalized workover expenses. We have the ability to adjust capital expenditures by reducing the number of projects we elect to participate in. We currently expect to fund all 2013 commitments using a combination of cash-on-hand, cash flow generated by operations, bank borrowings and potential debt financings. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Historically, our main sources of liquidity and capital resources have been internally generated cash flow from operations, credit facility borrowings and issuances of equity. We generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use cash from operations to fund our development activities or reduce our bank debt. We continue to take steps to ensure adequate capital resources and liquidity to fund our capital expenditure program. In February 2012, we amended and restated the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) to increase the maximum facility size to $750 million, subject to a borrowing base that is currently $350 million. In May 2012, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 8.000% senior unsecured notes (the “Notes”) due June 1, 2020. The issuance of these Notes resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately $291.2 million, which are in use to fund our exploration, development and acquisition program and for general corporate purposes (including repayment of borrowings that were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at the time the Notes were issued). With our Revolving Credit Facility and our anticipated cash reserves and cash from operations, we believe that we will have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to fund our budgeted capital expenditures and operating expenses for at least the next twelve months. Any significant acquisition of additional properties or significant increase in drilling activity may require us to seek additional capital. We may also choose to seek additional financing from the capital markets rather than utilize our Revolving Credit Facility to fund such activities. We cannot assure you, however, that any additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms or at all. 43 At December 31, 2012, our debt to total capitalization ratio was 42%, we had $424 million of total debt outstanding, $586.2 million of stockholders’ equity, and $13.4 million of cash on hand. Additionally, at December 31, 2012, there was $226 million of availability under our Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2011, we had $69.9 million of debt outstanding, $496.6 million of stockholders’ equity, and $6.3 million of cash on hand. Cash Flows Cash flows from operations are primarily affected by production volumes and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivatives. Our cash flows from operations also are impacted by changes in working capital. We generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use available funds to fund our development activities or reduce our bank debt. Short-term liquidity needs are satisfied by borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We generally use derivatives to economically hedge a significant, but varying portion of our anticipated future oil production for the next 12 to 36 months. Any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts are funded by proceeds received from the sale of our production. Production receipts, however, lag payments to the counterparties. Any interim cash needs are funded by cash from operations or borrowings under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2012, we had entered into derivative agreements covering 3.1 million barrels for 2013 and 2.4 million barrels for 2014, with average floor prices of $90.58 and $91.49, respectively. For additional information on the impact of changing prices on our financial position, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.” Our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 are presented below: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 198,527 $ 85,150 $ 73,307 Net cash used in investing activities (532,172 ) (300,868 ) (207,894 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 340,754 69,887 280,464 Net change in cash $ 7,108 $ (145,831 ) $ 145,877 Cash flows provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $198.5 million, $85.1 million and $73.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily the result of an increase in oil and natural gas production of 95%. Cash flows provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily as a result of an increase in oil and natural gas production of 117%. Cash flows used in investing activities We had cash flows used in investing activities of $532.2 million, $300.9 million and $207.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, primarily as a result of our capital expenditures for drilling, development and acquisition costs. Oil and gas expenditure spending increased from $341.4 million in 2011 to $532.0 million in 2012, a 56% increase that was driven by a 50% increase in the number of net producing well additions in 2012 as compared to 2011. In 2012, our net producing well additions totaled 48.3 as compared to 32.3 in 2011. The 2012 oil and gas expenditures include approximately $190.4 million for wells spud prior to 2012. The spending on wells spud prior to 2012 related to wells awaiting completion at December 31, 2011, as well as completion spending for wells placed into production prior to 2012. The $93.0 million increase in cash used in investing activities for 2011 compared to 2010 was attributable to our acquisitions of properties in the Williston Basin, as well as increased levels of development of our properties. Oil and gas expenditure spending increased from $180.4 million in 2010 to $341.4 million in 2011, an 89% increase that was driven by a 90% increase in the number of net producing well additions in 2012 as compared to 2011. In 2011, our net producing well additions totaled 32.3 as compared to 16.8 in 2010. As a result of the increased development activities, in 2011 we sold $40.2 million of short-term investments to fund the 2011 drilling, development and acquisition costs. 44 Cash flows provided by financing activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $340.8 million, $69.9 million and $280.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2012, we received $354.1 million in net advances under our revolving credit facility and senior notes that were used to fund drilling, development and acquisition costs. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, cash increased through financing activities was primarily provided by net proceeds from the sale of common stock. Revolving Credit Facility In February 2012, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement governing our Revolving Credit Facility, which replaced our previous revolving credit facility. The new facility, secured by substantially all of our assets, provides for an initial commitment equal to the lesser of the facility amount or the borrowing base. At December 31, 2012, the maximum facility amount was $750 million and the borrowing base was $350 million. Our bank group is comprised of a group of commercial banks, with no single bank holding more than 12% of the total facility. Under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, we are limited to $500 million of permitted additional indebtedness, as defined in the credit agreement. The borrowing base is reduced by 25% of the stated amount of the permitted additional indebtedness. The $300 million in Notes (as described below) is “permitted additional indebtedness” as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for a borrowing base subject to redetermination semi-annually each April and October and for event-driven unscheduled redeterminations. As of December 31, 2012, we had $124 million in outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, leaving $226 million of borrowing capacity available to us. The Revolving Credit Facility will expire and all outstanding borrowings under it will mature on January 1, 2017. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility can either be at the Alternate Base Rate (as defined) plus a spread ranging from 0.75% to 1.75% or LIBOR borrowings at the Adjusted LIBOR Rate (as defined) plus a spread ranging from 1.75% to 2.75%. The applicable spread is dependent upon borrowings relative to the borrowing base. We may elect, from time to time, to convert all or any part of our LIBOR loans to base rate loans or to convert all or any of the base rate loans to LIBOR loans. A commitment fee is paid on the undrawn balance based on an annual rate of either 0.375% or 0.50%, depending on outstanding borrowings relative to the borrowing base. The Revolving Credit Facility is subject to negative covenants that limit our ability, among other things, to pay cash dividends, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets, enter into certain hedging contracts, change the nature of our business or operations, merge, consolidate, or make certain types of investments. In addition, we are required to maintain a ratio of debt to EBITDAX (as defined in the credit agreement) of no greater than 4.0 to 1.0, a current ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of no less than 1.0 to 1.0 and a ratio of EBITDAX to interest expense of no less than 3.0 to 1.0. We were in compliance with our covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 2012. 8.000% Senior Notes due 2020 On May 18, 2012, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 8.000% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2020 (the “Notes”). Interest is payable on the Notes semi-annually in arrears on each June 1 and December 1, commencing December 1, 2012. The issuance of these Notes resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately $291.2 million, which are in use to fund our exploration, development and acquisition program and for general corporate purposes (including repayment of borrowings that were outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility at the time the Notes were issued). At any time prior to June 1, 2015, we may redeem up to 35% of the Notes at a redemption price of 108% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, with the proceeds of certain equity offerings so long as the redemption occurs within 180 days of completing such equity offering and at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding after such redemption. Prior to June 1, 2016, we may redeem some or all of the Notes for cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus an applicable make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. On and after June 1, 2016, we may redeem some or all of the Notes at redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) equal to 104% for the twelve-month period beginning on June 1, 2016, 102% for the twelve-month period beginning June 1, 2017 and 100% beginning on June1, 2018, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. 45 On May 18, 2012, in connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into an Indenture (the “Indenture”), with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Indenture restricts our ability to: (i) incur additional debt or enter into sale and leaseback transactions; (ii) pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase, equity interests; (iii) make certain investments; (iv) incur liens; (v) enter into transactions with affiliates; (vi) merge or consolidate with another company; and (vii) transfer and sell assets. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. If at any time when the Notes are rated investment grade by both Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and no Default (as defined in the Indenture) has occurred and is continuing, many of such covenants will terminate and we and any of our subsidiaries will cease to be subject to such covenants. The Indenture contains customary events of default, including: · default in any payment of interest on any Note when due, continued for 30 days; · default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, on any Note when due; · failure by us to comply with our other obligations under the Indenture, in certain cases subject to notice and grace periods; · payment defaults and accelerations with respect to our other indebtedness and certain of our subsidiaries, if any, in the aggregate principal amount of $25 million or more; · certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of our company or a significant subsidiary or group of restricted subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a significant subsidiary; · failure by us or any significant subsidiary or group of restricted subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a significant subsidiary to pay certain final judgments aggregating in excess of $25 million within 60 days; and · any guarantee of the Notes by a guarantor ceases to be in full force and effect, is declared null and void in a judicial proceeding or is denied or disaffirmed by its maker. Capital Requirements Our primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties and payment of interest on outstanding indebtedness. During 2012, our acquisition and development expenditures included approximately $485 million of drilling, completion and capitalized workover costs, $8.5 million of capitalized internal costs and $5.9 million of capitalized interest. Also in 2012, approximately $37 million was expended on acreage acquisitions and other acreage related costs located in the Williston Basin. Our 2012 capital program was funded by cash on hand, net cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes. Our capital expenditure budget for 2013 is discussed above under the heading “2013 Operation Plan.” Development and acquisition activities are highly discretionary, and, for the near term, we expect such activities to be maintained at levels we can fund through internal cash flow and borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility. To the extent capital requirements exceed internal cash flow and borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, debt may be issued to fund these requirements. We monitor our capital expenditures on a regular basis, adjusting the amount up or down and also between our projects, depending on commodity prices, cash flow and projected returns. Also, our obligations may change due to acquisitions, divestitures and continued growth. Our future success in growing proved reserves and production may be dependent on our ability to access outside sources of capital. If internally generated cash flow and borrowing capacity is not available under our Revolving Credit Facility, we may issue additional shares of stock, subordinated notes or other debt securities to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, extend maturities or to repay debt. 46 Satisfaction of Our Cash Obligations for the Next 12 Months With our Revolving Credit Facility and our cash flows from operations, we believe we have sufficient capital to meet our drilling commitments and expected general and administrative expenses for the next twelve months. Nonetheless, any strategic acquisition of assets or increase in drilling activity may require us to seek additional capital. We may also choose to seek additional capital rather than utilize our credit facility or other debt instruments to fund accelerated or continued drilling at the discretion of management and depending on prevailing market conditions. We will evaluate any potential opportunities for acquisitions as they arise. However, there can be no assurance that any additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms or at all. Over the next 24 months it is possible that our existing capital, our Revolving Credit Facility and anticipated funds from operations may not be sufficient to sustain continued acreage acquisitions and drilling activities. Consequently, we may seek additional capital in the future to fund growth and expansion through additional debt or equity financing or credit facilities. No assurance can be made that such financing would be available, and if available it may take either the form of debt or equity. In either case, the financing could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our shareholders. Effects of Inflation and Pricing The oil and natural gas industry is very cyclical and the demand for goods and services of oil field companies, suppliers and others associated with the industry put extreme pressure on the economic stability and pricing structure within the industry. Typically, as prices for oil and natural gas increase, so do all associated costs. Conversely, in a period of declining prices, associated cost declines are likely to lag and may not adjust downward in proportion. Material changes in prices also impact our current revenue stream, estimates of future reserves, borrowing base calculations of bank loans, impairment assessments of oil and natural gas properties, and values of properties in purchase and sale transactions. Material changes in prices can impact the value of oil and natural gas companies and their ability to raise capital, borrow money and retain personnel. While we do not currently expect business costs to materially increase, higher prices for oil and natural gas could result in increases in the costs of materials, services and personnel.

While there are rarely alternative methods or rules from which to select in establishing accounting and financial reporting policies, proper application often involves significant judgment regarding a given set of facts and circumstances and a complex series of decisions. 47 Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements under GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves, future development costs, estimates relating to certain oil and natural gas revenues and expenses and fair value of derivative instruments are the most critical to our financial statements. Oil and Natural Gas Reserves The determination of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense as well as impairments that are recognized on our oil and natural gas properties are highly dependent on the estimates of the proved oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties. Our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in the future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretation, and judgment. For example, we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs, production taxes and development costs, all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results. In addition, as the prices of oil and natural gas and cost levels change from year to year, the economics of producing our reserves may change and therefore the estimate of proved reserves may also change. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves. The information regarding present value of the future net cash flows attributable to our proved oil and natural gas reserves are estimates only and should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties. Thus, such information includes revisions of certain reserve estimates attributable to our properties included in the prior year’s estimates. These revisions reflect additional information from subsequent activities, production history of the properties involved and any adjustments in the projected economic life of such properties resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices. Any future downward revisions could adversely affect our financial condition, our borrowing ability, our future prospects and the value of our common stock. The estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves used in the preparation of our financial statements were prepared by Ryder Scott Company, our registered independent petroleum consultants, and were prepared in accordance with the rules promulgated by the SEC. Oil and Natural Gas Properties The method of accounting we use to account for our oil and natural gas investments determines what costs are capitalized and how these costs are ultimately matched with revenues and expensed. We utilize the full cost method of accounting to account for our oil and natural gas investments instead of the successful efforts method because we believe it more accurately reflects the underlying economics of our programs to explore and develop oil and natural gas reserves. The full cost method embraces the concept that dry holes and other expenditures that fail to add reserves are intrinsic to the oil and natural gas exploration business. Thus, under the full cost method, all costs incurred in connection with the acquisition, development and exploration of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized. These capitalized amounts include the costs of unproved properties, internal costs directly related to acquisitions, development and exploration activities, asset retirement costs, geological and geophysical costs that are directly attributable to the properties and capitalized interest. Although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves, they are part of a program from which we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones. The full cost method differs from the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas investments. The primary difference between these two methods is the treatment of exploratory dry hole costs. These costs are generally expensed under the successful efforts method when it is determined that measurable reserves do not exist. Geological and geophysical costs are also expensed under the successful efforts method. Under the full cost method, both dry hole costs and geological and geophysical costs are initially capitalized and classified as unproved properties pending determination of proved reserves. If no proved reserves are discovered, these costs are then amortized with all the costs in the full cost pool. 48 Capitalized amounts except unproved costs are depleted using the units of production method. The depletion expense per unit of production is the ratio of the sum of our unamortized historical costs and estimated future development costs to our proved reserve volumes. Estimation of hydrocarbon reserves relies on professional judgment and use of factors that cannot be precisely determined. Subsequent reserve estimates materially different from those reported would change the depletion expense recognized during the future reporting periods. For the year ended December 31, 2012, our average depletion expense per unit of production was $26.18 per Boe. A 10% decrease in our estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2012 would result in a $2.88 per Boe increase in our per unit depletion. To the extent the capitalized costs in our full cost pool (net of depreciation, depletion and amortization and related deferred taxes) exceed the sum of the present value (using a 10% discount rate and based on period-end oil and natural gas prices) of the estimated future net cash flows from our proved oil and natural gas reserves and the capitalized cost associated with our unproved properties, we would have a capitalized ceiling impairment. Such costs would be charged to operations as a reduction of the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties. The risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are depressed, even if the low prices are temporary. In addition, capitalized ceiling impairment charges may occur if we experience poor drilling results or estimations of our proved reserves are substantially reduced. A capitalized ceiling impairment is a reduction in earnings that does not impact cash flows, but does impact operating income and shareholders’ equity. Once recognized, a capitalized ceiling impairment charge to oil and natural gas properties cannot be reversed at a later date. The risk that we will experience a ceiling test writedown increases when oil and natural gas prices are depressed or if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves. As of December 31, 2012 we have not incurred a capitalized ceiling impairment charge. However, no assurance can be given that we will not experience a capitalized ceiling impairment charge in future periods. In addition, capitalized ceiling impairment charges may occur if estimates of proved hydrocarbon reserves are substantially reduced or estimates of future development costs increase significantly.
