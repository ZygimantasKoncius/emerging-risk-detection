Item 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company faces risks other than those listed here, including those that are unknown to the Company and others of which the Company may be aware but, at present, considers immaterial. Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting the Companys operating results, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Certain recurring trends generally result in a decrease in the demand for the Companys products and services Demand for the Companys products and services generally decreases as the number of real estate transactions in which the Companys products and services are purchased decreases. The Company has found that the number of real estate transactions in which the Companys products and services are purchased decreases in the following situations:  when mortgage interest rates are high; 14 Table of Contents  when the mortgage fund supply is limited; and  when the United States economy is weak. The Company believes that this trend will recur. Changes in government regulation could prohibit or limit the Companys operations or make it more burdensome for us to conduct such operations The Companys title insurance, property and casualty insurance, home warranty, thrift, trust and investment businesses are regulated by various federal, state and local governmental agencies. Many of the Companys other businesses operate within statutory guidelines. Changes in the applicable regulatory environment or statutory guidelines or changes in interpretations of existing regulations or statutes could prohibit or limit the Companys existing or future operations or make it more burdensome to conduct such operations. These changes may compel the Company to reduce its prices, may restrict the Companys ability to implement price increases, may restrict the Companys ability to acquire assets or businesses, may limit the manner in which the Company conducts its business or otherwise may have a negative impact on the Companys ability to generate revenues and earnings. The Company may find it difficult to acquire necessary data Certain data used and supplied by the Company are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Compliance with existing federal, state and local laws and regulations with respect to such data has not had a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations or financial condition to date. Nonetheless, federal, state and local laws and regulations in the United States designed to protect the public from the misuse of personal information in the marketplace and adverse publicity or potential litigation concerning the commercial use of such information may affect the Companys operations and could result in substantial regulatory compliance expense, litigation expense and a loss of revenue. The suppliers of data to the Company face similar burdens and, consequently, the Company may find it financially burdensome to acquire necessary data. Systems interruptions and intrusions may impair the delivery of the Companys products and services System interruptions and intrusions may impair the delivery of the Companys products and services, result in a loss of customers and a corresponding loss in revenue. The Company depends heavily upon computer systems located in its data centers in Santa Ana, California and Dallas, Texas. Certain events beyond the Companys control, including acts of God, telecommunications failures and intrusions into the Companys systems by third parties could temporarily or permanently interrupt the delivery of products and services. These interruptions also may interfere with suppliers ability to provide necessary data and employees ability to attend work and perform their responsibilities. The Company may not be able to realize the benefits of its offshore strategy Over the last few years the Company has reduced its costs by utilizing lower cost labor in foreign countries such as India and the Philippines. These countries are subject to relatively higher degrees of political and social instability and may lack the infrastructure to withstand natural disasters. These disruptions decrease efficiency or increase the Companys costs in these countries. Furthermore, the practice of utilizing labor based in foreign countries has come under increased scrutiny in the United States and, as a result, some of the Companys customers may require it to use labor based in the United States. The Company may not be able to pass on the increased costs of higher priced United States-based labor to its customers. Product migration may result in decreased revenue Consumers of many of the Companys real estate settlement services increasingly require these services to be delivered faster, cheaper and more efficiently. Many of the Companys traditional products are labor and time 15 Table of Contents intensive. As these consumer pressures increase, the Company may be forced to replace its traditional products with automated products that can be delivered electronically and with limited human processing. Because many of the Companys traditional products have higher prices than its automated products, the Companys revenues may decline. Increases in the size of the Companys customers enhance their negotiating position with respect to pricing and terms and may decrease their need for the services offered by the Company Many of the Companys customers are increasing in size as a result of consolidation and growth. As a result, the Company may derive a higher percentage of its revenues from a smaller base of customers, which would enhance the ability of these customers to negotiate more favorable pricing and more favorable terms for the Companys products and services. Moreover, these larger customers may prove more capable of performing in-house some or all of the services we provide and, consequently, their demand for the Companys products and services may decrease. These circumstances could adversely affect the Companys revenues and profitability. The integration of Company acquisitions may be difficult and may result in a failure to realize some of the anticipated potential benefits of acquisitions When companies are acquired, the Company may not be able to integrate or manage these businesses so as to produce returns that justify the investment. Any difficulty in successfully integrating or managing the operations of the businesses could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could lead to a failure to realize any anticipated synergies. The Companys management also will continue to be required to dedicate substantial time and effort to the integration of its acquisitions. These efforts could divert managements focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and operational matters. The Companys future earnings may be reduced if acquisition projections are inaccurate The Companys earnings have improved in part because of the Companys acquisition and integration of businesses. The success or failure of the Companys acquisitions has depended in large measure upon the accuracy of the Companys projections. These projections are not always accurate. Inaccurate projections have historically led to lower than expected earnings. As a holding company, the Company depends on distributions from the Companys subsidiaries, and if distributions from the Companys subsidiaries are materially impaired, the Companys ability to declare and pay dividends may be adversely affected; in addition, insurance and other regulations may limit the amount of dividends, loans and advances available from the Companys insurance subsidiaries First American is a holding company whose primary assets are the securities of its operating subsidiaries. The Companys ability to pay dividends is dependent on the ability of the Companys subsidiaries to pay dividends or repay funds. If the Companys operating subsidiaries are not able to pay dividends or repay funds, the Company may not be able to declare and pay dividends to its shareholders. Moreover, pursuant to insurance and other regulations under which the Companys insurance subsidiaries operate, the amount of dividends, loans and advances available is limited. Under such regulations, the maximum amount of dividends, loans and advances available from the Companys insurance subsidiaries in 2007 is $285.7 million. Certain provisions of the Companys charter and rights plan may make a takeover of our company difficult even if such takeover could be beneficial to some of the Companys shareholders The Companys restated articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Companys Board of Directors. Accordingly, the Companys board is empowered, without further shareholder action, to issue 16 Table of Contents shares or series of preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights, including the ability to receive dividends, of the Companys common shareholders. The issuance of such preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control. In conjunction with the rights plan discussed in the paragraph immediately below, the Company has authorized the issuance of the Companys Series A Junior Participating Preferred Shares. Although the Company has no present intention of issuing any additional shares or series of preferred stock, the Company cannot guarantee that it will not make such an issuance in the future. The Company has adopted a rights plan which could, alone or in combination with the Companys restated articles of incorporation, discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to the Companys shareholders for their common shares. Scrutiny of the Company and the industries in which it operates by governmental entities and others could adversely affect its operations and financial condition The real estate settlement services industryan industry in which the Company generates a substantial portion of its revenue and earningshas become subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators, legislators, the media and plaintiffs attorneys. Though often directed at the industry generally, these groups may also focus their attention directly on the Company. In either case, this scrutiny may result in changes which could adversely affect the Companys operations and, therefore, its financial condition. Several states, for example, have either begun, or indicated that they will begin, an examination of title insurance rates. These states include California, which, on a revenue basis, is the largest state in which the Companys title insurance services segment operates. In states where rates are promulgated or otherwise highly regulated, such examinations may ultimately result in a reduction in the rates the Company can charge for title insurance policies. In other states, pressure exerted by governmental entities, competitors, consumers and the media may compel the Company to reduce its rates. A reduction in rates, if not offset by a corresponding reduction in expenses or an increase in market share, may result in decreased profitability. Governmental entities have inquired into certain practices in the real estate settlement services industry to determine whether the Company or its competitors have violated applicable law, which include, among others, the insurance codes of the various jurisdictions in which we operate and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and similar state laws. Generally, these groups seek monetary damages or other types of recompense. Departments of insurance in the various states also periodically conduct inquiries, generally referred to as market conduct exams, into the practices of title insurance companies in their respective jurisdictions. From time to time plaintiffs lawyers target the Company and other members of the Companys industry with lawsuits claiming legal violations or other wrongful conduct. These lawsuits may involve large groups of plaintiffs and claims for substantial damages. All of these types of inquiries may uncover violations of the law or other wrongful conduct and may result in the payment of fines or damages or the imposition of restrictions on the Companys conduct which could impact its operations and financial condition. Moreover, these laws and standards of conduct often are ambiguous and, thus, it may be difficult to ensure compliance. This ambiguity may force the Company to mitigate its risk by settling claims or by ending practices that generate revenues and earnings. The staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an informal inquiry concerning the Companys prior stock option practices and this inquiry could require the Company to expend significant resources and result in an unfavorable outcome Following the Companys announcement on August 9, 2006, that a special subcommittee of the Companys audit committee was conducting a review of the Companys historical stock option granting practices, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) notified the Company that it is conducting an informal inquiry 17 Table of Contents concerning these practices. It is not known when this inquiry will be resolved or what, if any, actions the SEC may take as a result of this inquiry. Response to this inquiry could divert management time and attention away from day-to-day operations and require the expenditure of significant financial resources. An unfavorable outcome could require the Company to pay damages or penalties, or result in other remedies against the Company, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Pending civil litigation relating to the Companys prior stock option granting practices could have a material adverse effect on the Company The Company, its directors and certain of its officers have been named in shareholder derivative actions relating to the Companys prior stock option granting practices. These actions are in their preliminary stages. These actions, and others that could arise from the Companys prior stock option granting practices, could divert management time and attention from day-to-day operations, result in significant legal expenses and result in an outcome that could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual claims experience could materially vary from the expected claims experience that is reflected in the Companys reserve for incurred but not reported (IBNR) title claims Title insurance policies are long-duration contracts with the majority of the claims reported to the Company within the first few years following the issuance of the policy. Generally, 70 to 75 percent of claims become known in the five first years of the policy life. Therefore, the majority of IBNR reserves relate to the five most recent policy years. A material change in expected ultimate losses and corresponding loss rates for policy years older than five years is not considered reasonably likely by the Company. However, changes in expected ultimate losses and corresponding loss rates for recent policy years is considered likely and could result in a material adjustment to the IBNR reserves. Based on historical experience, the Company believes that a 50 basis point change to the loss rates for the most recent policy years, positive or negative, is reasonably likely given the long duration nature of a title insurance policy. For example, if the expected ultimate losses for each of the last five policy years increased or decreased by 50 basis points, the resulting impact on the IBNR reserve would be an increase or decrease, as the case may be, of $121.2 million. The estimates made by management in determining the appropriate level of IBNR reserves could ultimately prove to be inaccurate and actual claims experience may vary from the expected claims experience.
