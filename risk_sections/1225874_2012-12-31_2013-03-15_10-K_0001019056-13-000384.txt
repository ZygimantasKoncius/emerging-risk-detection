Risk Factors Bank lending is an inherently risky business. A substantial portion of our assets are invested in loans, and loans necessarily present many risks. We must first rely on our borrowers to repay their loans, and if they are unable to do so, we must rely on the value of the collateral, if any, for the loan. Changing business conditions, increases in unemployment, personal problems that a borrower may experience, changes in the regulations that apply to a borrower’s business, changes in the political climate or in public policy, and many other factors outside our control, could adversely affect the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans or the value of the collateral we have received. Although we seek to reduce these risks through underwriting procedures that we believe are prudent, it is impossible for us to completely eliminate the risks which arise from making loans except by eliminating our lending operations. The current turmoil in the economy in general and among financial institutions in particular could adversely affect our customers and thus have an indirect adverse effect on us. The economy in the United States, including the economy in Staten Island, was and may still be in a recession. Although some analysts report that the economy is recovering, the extent and speed of the recovery is far from clear and some analysts predict a darker road ahead. There is substantial stress on many financial institutions and financial products. The federal government has intervened by making hundreds of billions of dollars in capital contributions to the banking industry. We draw a substantial portion of our customer base from local businesses, especially those in the building trades and related industries, and we believe that there continue to be substantial weaknesses in the business economy in our market area. Our customers have been adversely affected by the economic downturn, and if adverse conditions in the local economy continue, it will become more difficult for us to conduct prudent and profitable business in our community. 4 Making permanent residential mortgage loans is not a material part of our business, and our investments in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations have been made with a view towards avoiding the types of securities that are backed by low quality mortgage-related assets. However, one of the primary focuses of our local business is receiving deposits from, and making loans to, businesses involved in the construction and building trades industry on Staten Island. Construction loans represented a significant component of our loan portfolio, reaching 39.8% of total loans at year end 2005. As we monitored the economy and the strength of the local construction industry, we elected to reduce our portfolio of construction loans. By December 31, 2012, the percentage had declined to 3.7%. However, developers and builders provide not only a source of loans, but they also provide us with deposits and other business. The weakness in the economy has had an adverse effect on some of our customers and potential customers, making it more difficult for us to find satisfactory loan opportunities. This compelled us to invest in lower yielding securities instead of higher-yielding loans. This has and may continue to reduce our net income. Fluctuations in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our profitability. Our principal source of income is the difference between the interest income we earn on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and our cost of funds, principally interest paid on deposits. These rates of interest change from time to time, depending upon a number of factors, including general market interest rates. However, the frequency of the changes varies among different types of assets and liabilities. For example, for a five-year loan with an interest rate based upon the prime rate, the interest rate may change every time the prime rate changes. In contrast, the rate of interest we pay on a five-year certificate of deposit adjusts only every five years, based upon changes in market interest rates. In general, the interest rates we pay on deposits adjust more slowly than the interest rates we earn on loans because our loan portfolio consists primarily of loans with interest rates that fluctuate based upon the prime rate. In contrast, although many of our deposit categories have interest rates that could adjust immediately, such as interest checking accounts and savings accounts, changes in the interest rates on those accounts are at our discretion. Thus, the rates on those accounts, as well as the rates we pay on certificates of deposit, tend to adjust more slowly. As a result, the declines in market interest rates that occurred through the end of 2008 initially had an adverse effect on our net income because the yields we earn on our loans declined more rapidly than our cost of funds. However, many of our prime-based loans have minimum interest rates, or floors, below which the interest rate does not decline despite further decreases in the prime rate. As our loans reached their interest rate floors, our loan yields stabilized while our deposit costs continued to decline. This had a positive effect on our net interest income. When market interest rates begin increasing, which we expect will occur at some point in the future, we anticipate an initial adverse effect on our net income. We anticipate that this will occur because our deposit rates should begin to rise, while loan yields remain relatively steady until the prime rate increases sufficiently that our loans begin to reprice above their interest rate floors. For most of our prime-rate based loans, this will not occur until the prime rate increases above 6%. Once our loan rates exceed the interest rate floors, increases in market interest rates should increase our net interest income because our cost of deposits should probably increase more slowly than the yields on our loans. However, customer preferences and competitive pressures may negate this positive effect because customers may choose to move funds into higher-earning deposit types as higher interest rates make them more attractive, or competitors offer premium rates to attract deposits. We also have a substantial portfolio of investment securities with fixed rates of interest, most of which are mortgage-backed securities with an estimated average life of not more than 7 years. The limited trading market for our common stock may make it difficult for stockholders to sell their stock for full value. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market, which listing was effective on August 4, 2008. We continue to trade under the symbol “VSBN.” We listed on the Global Market in the hope that it would increase the trading market in our stock and make it easier for individuals to buy and sell our stock. However, our stock does not trade every day and the average daily trading volume is limited. During the twelve months ended February 28, 2013, there were trades reported on only 64 out of 250 trading days, or barely more than one out of every four trading days. Our average daily trading volume during that period was 328 shares for all trading days and 1,280 shares per day for the 64 days on which trades occurred. During the twelve months ended February 28, 2013, 26.9% of all reported trading volume represented our repurchase of 22,000 shares pursuant to our announced stock repurchase programs. We currently have approximately 140 stockholders of record and we believe based upon reports we have received from broker/dealers, that there are approximately an additional 245 stockholders who own their shares in street name. 5 The geographic concentration of our loans increases the risk that adverse economic conditions could affect our net income. Substantially all of our loans are mortgage loans on property located in Staten Island, New York, or loans to residents of or businesses on Staten Island. Staten Island has experienced an economic down turn in recent years. In addition, due to the importance of the home building trade on Staten Island, the recent adverse conditions in the residential real estate market has had an additional negative impact on many local businesses that make up our core customer base. A continued economic slow-down or decline in the local economy could have an adverse effect on us for a number of reasons. Adverse economic conditions could hurt the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. If real estate values decline, reductions in the value of real estate collateral could make it more difficult for us to recover the full amount due on loans which go into default. Furthermore, economic difficulties can also increase deposit outflows as customers must use savings to pay bills. This could increase our cost of funds because of the need to replace the deposit outflow. All of these factors might combine to reduce significantly our net income. Adverse financial results of other financial institutions could adversely affect our net income or our reputation. The Bank is a member of the FDIC. As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, FDIC-insured institutions. It also may prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the FDIC. In the past four years, there have been many failures and near-failures among financial institutions. The number of FDIC-insured banks that have failed has declined, with 51 banks having failed during 2012, compared to 92 in 2011, 157 in 2010 and 140 in 2009. The FDIC insurance fund reserve ratio, representing the ratio of the fund to the level of insured deposits, initially declined dramatically due to losses caused by the bank failures. As a result, the FDIC increased its deposit insurance premiums on remaining institutions, including well-capitalized institutions like Victory State Bank, in order to replenish the insurance fund. If bank failures continue to occur, and more so if the level of failures increases, the FDIC insurance fund may further decline, and the FDIC would be required to continue to impose higher premiums on healthy banks. Thus, despite the prudent steps we may take to avoid the mistakes made by other banks, our costs of operations may increase as a result of those mistakes by others. As required by The Dodd –Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Law (the “Dodd-Frank” Act), the FDIC has recently revised its deposit insurance premium assessment rates. Our Bank, even though we are in the lowest regulatory risk category, is subject to an assessment rate between five (5) and nine (9) basis points per annum. In general, the rates are applied to our bank’s total assets less tangible capital, in contrast to the former rule which applied the assessment rate to our level of deposits. The deposit insurance premium change and the special assessment have begun to replenish the fund created to pay the cost of resolving failed banks and the fund no longer has a negative balance. The Dodd-Frank Act requires that the FDIC must increase the ratio of the FDIC insurance fund to estimated total insured deposits to 1.35% by September 30, 2020. The FDIC believes that most banks will pay a lower total assessment under the new system than under the former system. However, if bank failures in the future exceed FDIC estimates, or other estimates that the FDIC makes turn out to be incorrect, and the losses to the insurance fund increase, the FDIC could be forced to increase insurance premiums. Such an increase would increase our non-interest expense. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, non-interest bearing demand deposits, together with certain attorney trust account deposits commonly known in New York as IOLA accounts, had the benefit of unlimited federal deposit insurance until December 31, 2012. The expiration of the unlimited federal deposit insurance for non-interest bearing checking accounts and IOLAs at the end of 2012 may cause a reduction in our deposit base as customers seek to redistribute their deposits to maintain FDIC insurance above the $250,000 general FDIC insurance limit. The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including the Bank, if it determines, after a hearing, that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. Management is aware of no existing circumstances that would result in termination of the Bank’s deposit insurance. Changes in the federal or state regulation of financial institutions could have an adverse effect on future operations. Federal and New York State banking laws and regulations have a substantial, regular and every-day effect on our business. Federal and state regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervision of Victory State Bank, such as the right to impose restrictions on operations and the insistence that we increase our allowance for loan losses. Any change in the regulatory structure or statutes or regulations applicable to banks, bank holding companies, or their competitors, whether by the Congress, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve System, the New York State legislature, the New York State Department of Financial Services or any other regulator, could have a material impact on our operations and profitability. The substantial decline in the national housing market and the advent of the increase in bank failures over the past few years has spawned many statutes and regulations affecting Banks, including the 2,000+ pages of the Dodd-Frank Act and the hundreds of regulations adopted or to be adopted to implement its provisions. There are constantly new proposals to further change the laws that affect our business. Notably, the Dodd-Frank Act creates a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that has broad authority to restrict our flexibility in dealing with consumer transactions and our ability to charge fees for bank services. The final implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act through regulatory enactments and the actions of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau could have a significant negative effect on our income and our expenses in a manner and a level that we cannot predict. 6 There have recently been changes at both the state and the federal level in the laws and regulations applicable to residential mortgage lenders and other entities in the residential real estate business. We are not a residential mortgage lender and we do not expect that new regulations and future expected proposals in the area, if adopted, will have a direct negative effect on us. However, the proposals could reduce residential development, increase the cost of housing, and restrict the ability of small local businesses in that sector to compete with larger companies with greater resources. That could have an adverse effect on our customer base. Furthermore, from time to time, proposals are made to permit what are commonly known as “cram downs” in bankruptcies involving residential mortgage loans. If adopted, such proposals could have a direct adverse effect on the value of the collateral for existing residential mortgage loans, and thus an indirect effect on mortgage-backed securities in which we invest. Delays in foreclosure proceedings may adversely affect our ability to realize upon the value of collateral. The length of time it takes to prosecute a foreclosure action and be able to sell real estate collateral in New York has substantially lengthened. It is not unusual for it to take more than two years from the date a foreclosure action is commenced until the property is sold even in uncontested cases, and some uncontested cases can take longer. This problem, if it continues or gets worse, could have a substantial adverse effect on the value of our collateral for loans in default. Especially in the case of construction loans, where property value deterioration during a lengthy foreclosure is more likely, the inability to realize upon collateral increases our loss in the event of a default. We operate in an extremely competitive environment. We operate in one of the most competitive environments for financial products in the world. Many of the world’s largest financial institutions have offices in our local communities, and they have far greater financial resources than we have. Furthermore, in 2010, federal law was changed to allow any bank, regardless of where it is headquartered, to open a branch throughout most of the United States, and now Staten Island is open to unrestricted branching. This could increase competition. Furthermore, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, banks are now allowed to pay interest on commercial demand deposits. This has put greater competitive pressure on us as some large banks with greater financial resources are advertising aggressively to obtain interest-bearing checking account deposits. The loss of key personnel could impair our future success. Our future success depends in part on the service of our executive officer, other key management officers, as well as our staff, and our ability to continue to attract, motivate, and retain additional highly qualified employees. The loss of one or more of our key personnel or our inability to timely recruit replacements for such personnel, or otherwise attract, motivate, or retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Possible effects of Hurricane Sandy. Hurricane Sandy has had a devastating effect on the homes and businesses of New York City, especially Staten Island. We opened four of five locations (all located in Richmond County) the day after the Hurricane and they are in full operation. We re-opened the fifth location in February 2013 and all retail banking services are fully operational. While Hurricane Sandy did not have a significant effect on our operations, we incurred expenses of approximately $300,000 to remediate and reconstruct one of our branches that suffered sewer backup, water and wind driven rain damage. We also waived deposit service charges and late fees to those customers affected by Hurricane Sandy. This resulted in a reduction in non-interest income of an estimated $50,000. After Hurricane Sandy, we immediately embarked an outreach program to determine the extent that our borrowers were affected by Hurricane Sandy. We contacted 58 customers that we identified as being located in areas affected by the hurricane who sustained some of, or a combination of, the following issues: substantial water and sewage damage to the business’ physical plant, machinery and equipment; extended power loss causing business interruptions; displaced tenants due to the flood and sewage backup; employees unable to report to work due to the loss/damage of their personal homes or cars and the loss of mass transit. We individually assessed their condition and access to resources. The majority of our customers were able to restart their business with little assistance from us. As we are primarily a commercial lender, we did not have residential loans that were negatively affected. We received 12 requests for either one or two month payment deferrals on commercial loans, which we granted. All twelve resumed their payments but two loans, in the aggregate amount of $732,121 (of which one loan in the amount of in excess of $700,000 was real estate secured) , remain slow and are over 30 days past due. 7 We operate primarily in Richmond County (Staten Island) and that is where we had the highest impact. We had one loan in Kings County that was affected but has since been current on payments. We had sufficient liquidity and resources to handle the effects of Hurricane Sandy. Our operations center was up and running the day Hurricane Sandy left the region and had full access to all of our resources. We are still assessing the full impact of Hurricane Sandy, including the effects on the allowance for loan loss and the loan portfolio, and we will address any of the associated issues as they arise. Lending Activities Loan Portfolio Composition. Our loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial mortgage loans and unsecured commercial loans. Unsecured commercial loans include loans with personal guaranties or personal obligations in all cases, and, in some cases, may also include loans with illiquid personal property collateral. At December 31, 2012, we had total unsecured commercial loans outstanding of $16,502,920, or 20.1% of total loans, and commercial real estate loans of $56,698,844, or 69.0% of total loans. There was $3,112,477 of construction loans secured by real estate or 3.8% of total loans. Other loans in our portfolio principally included commercial loans secured by assets other than real estate totaling $2,050,728 or 2.5% of total loans at December 31, 2012; residential mortgage loans of $2,498,603, or 3.0% of total loans and consumer non-mortgage loans of $565,573 or 0.7% of total loans. Although we generally do not make traditional permanent residential mortgage loans, we occasionally make residential mortgage loans to the principals of commercial customers. For the year ended December 31, 2012, approximately $57,359,893, or 69.8% of total loans had adjustable interest rates based on the prime rate of interest. The following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio in dollar amounts and in percentages at the dates indicated. None of these loans are loans to or in foreign countries.

We did not purchase or sell any loans in 2012, 2011 or 2010.

The following table shows the contractual maturity of our loans at December 31, 2012. As we have decreased construction loans as a percentage of our loan portfolio and increased other real estate mortgage loans, we have increased the average contractual maturity of our loan portfolio. However, to limit interest rate risk, we have continued to concentrate our efforts principally on the origination of loans with adjustable interest rates and minimum interest rate floors. This table shows a loan as being due in the period in which the final principal payment is due under the loan promissory note or agreement, without regard to prior principal payments or interest rate adjustments. At December 31, 2012 Commercial Commercial Other Unsecured Secured Construction Real Estate Loans Total Amounts due: Within one year $10,644,251 $1,697,090 $1,267,477 $6,115,194 $849,735 $20,573,747 After one year: One to five years 5,058,460 353,638 1,845,000 12,608,589 460,628 20,326,315 After five years 800,209 — — 40,473,664 24,000 41,297,873 Total amount due 16,502,920 2,050,728 3,112,477 59,197,447 1,334,363 82,197,935 Less: Unearned fees — 112 21,341 204,911 — 226,364 Allowance for loan losses 425,495 18,790 16,282 1,251,727 41,227 1,753,521 Loans, net $16,077,425 $2,031,826 $3,074,854 $57,740,809 $1,293,136 $80,218,050 The following table sets forth at December 31, 2012, the dollar amount of all loans, due after December 31, 2013, and whether such loans have fixed or variable interest rates. Due After December 31, 2013 Fixed Variable Total Commercial Business Loans: Unsecured $694,191 $5,164,478 $5,858,669 Secured 353,638 — 353,638 Real Estate Commercial 8,801,334 44,176,771 52,978,105 Residential 104,148 — 104,148 Construction 400,000 1,445,000 1,845,000 Other loans 484,628 — 484,628 Total loans $10,837,939 $50,786,249 $61,624,188 Commercial Business Lending. We originate commercial business loans directly to the professional and business community in our market area. We target small to medium sized businesses and professionals such as lawyers, doctors and accountants. Applications for commercial business loans are obtained primarily from the efforts of our directors and senior management, who have extensive contacts in the local business community, or from branch referrals. As of December 31, 2012, commercial business loans totaled $18,553,648 or 22.6% of total loans. Commercial business loans we originate generally have terms of five years or less and have adjustable interest rates tied to the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus a margin. A majority of our commercial business loans have terms of less than one year and one of the challenges facing management is the constant effort to originate commercial business loans as existing loans are repaid. Such loans may be secured or unsecured. Secured commercial business loans can be collateralized by receivables, inventory and other assets. All these loans are either loans to individuals for which they have personal liability or loans to entities backed by the personal guarantee of principals of the borrower. The loans generally have shorter maturities and higher yields than real estate mortgage loans. Management has extensive experience in originating commercial business loans within our marketplace. Commercial business loans generally carry the greatest credit risks of the loans in our portfolio because repayment is more dependent on the success of the business operations of the borrower. Some of these loans are unsecured and those that are secured frequently have collateral that rapidly depreciates or is difficult to control in the event of a default. Commercial Real Estate Lending. We originate commercial real estate loans that are generally secured by properties used for business purposes such as retail stores, other mixed-use (business and residential) properties, restaurants, light industrial buildings and small office buildings located in our primary market area. Our commercial real estate loans are generally made in amounts up to 70% of the appraised value of the property. These loans are most commonly made with terms up to five years with interest rates that adjust to 100 or 150 basis points above the floating prime rate, but we have recently changed our guidelines to include 20 year fully amortizing loans. A significant portion of these loans are subject to an interest rate floor ranging between 7.00% and 8.00%. Our underwriting standards consider the collateral of the borrower, the net operating income of the property and the borrower’s expertise, credit history and profitability. We require personal guarantees from the borrower or the principals of the borrowing entity. At December 31, 2012, our commercial real estate loans totaled $59,197,447, or 72.0% of total loans. 10 Loans secured by commercial real estate are generally larger and have traditionally been considered to involve greater risks than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, but generally lesser risks than commercial business loans. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation and management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy, to a greater extent than other types of loans. We seek to minimize these risks through our lending policies and underwriting standards, which restrict new originations of such loans to our primary lending area and qualify such loans on the basis of the property’s income stream, collateral value and debt service ratio. Construction Lending. Our construction loans primarily have been made to builders and developers to finance the construction of one- to four-family residential properties and, to a lesser extent, multi-family residential and commercial use real estate properties. Our policies provide that construction loans may be made in amounts up to the lesser of 80% of the total hard and soft costs of the project. We generally require personal guarantees. Construction loans generally are made with prime-based interest rates with terms up to 18 months. Loan proceeds are disbursed in increments as construction progresses and as inspections warrant. At December 31, 2012, our construction loans totaled $3,112,477 or 3.8% of total loans. This represents a reduction of our construction loan portfolio over the past four years as economic conditions in the construction industry caused us to be more cautious in originating these loans while also reducing the number of satisfactory loan opportunities available to us. Construction loans on non-owner occupied real estate generally carry greater credit risks than permanent mortgage loans on comparable completed properties because their repayment is more dependent on the borrower’s ability to sell or rent units under construction and the general as well as local economic conditions. Because payments on construction loans are often dependent on the successful completion of construction project and the management of the project, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy, to a greater extent than other types of loans. In addition, in the event of a default, buildings under construction may deteriorate rapidly and it may be more difficult to realize upon the value of the building compared to an existing building that is ready for occupancy or already rented to third party tenants. Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. All unsecured loans in excess of $250,000 and all secured loans over $400,000 are reviewed and approved by the Loan Committee, which consists of seven directors of Victory State Bank, prior to commitment. Smaller loans may be approved by underwriters designated by the Bank’s Chief Executive Officer. Consumer loans not secured by real estate and unsecured consumer loans, depending on the amount of the loan and the loan to value ratio, where applicable, require the approval of the Bank’s Chief Lending Officer and/or Chief Executive Officer. Upon receipt of a completed loan application from a prospective borrower, we order a credit report and we verify other information. If necessary, we request additional financial information. An independent appraiser we designate performs an appraisal of the real estate intended to secure the proposed loan. The Board of Victory State Bank annually approves the independent appraisers and approves the Bank’s appraisal policy. It is our policy to obtain title insurance on all real estate first mortgage loans and on substantially all subordinate mortgage loans. Borrowers must also obtain hazard insurance prior to closing. Some borrowers are required to make monthly escrow deposits which we then use to pay items such as real estate taxes. Delinquencies and Classified Assets Delinquent Loans. Our collection procedures for mortgage loans include sending a past due notice at 15 days and a late notice after payment is 30 days past due. In the event that payment is not received after the late notice, letters are sent or phone calls are made to the borrower. We attempt to obtain full payment or work out a repayment schedule with the borrower to avoid foreclosure. Generally, we authorize foreclosure proceedings when a loan is over 90 days delinquent. We record property acquired in foreclosure as real estate owned at the lower of its appraised value less costs to dispose, or cost. We cease to accrue interest on all loans 90 days past due and reverse all accrued but unpaid interest when the loan becomes non-accrual. We continue to accrue interest on construction loans that are 90 days past the maturity date of the loan if we expect the loan to be paid in full in the next 60 days and all interest is paid up to date. The collection procedures for non-mortgage other loans generally include telephone calls to the borrower after ten days of the delinquency and late notices at 15 and 25 days past due. Letters and telephone calls generally continue until the matter is referred to a collection attorney or resolved. After the loan is 90 days past due, the loan is referred to counsel and is written-off. 11 Classified Assets. Federal regulations and our Loan Review and Risk Rating Policy provide for the classification of loans and other assets we consider to be of lesser quality as “Substandard”, “Doubtful” or “Loss” assets. An asset is considered “Substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “Doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “Substandard” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “Loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose us to sufficient risk to warrant classification but which possess weaknesses are designated “Special Mention” by management. At December 31, 2012, we had eighteen (18) loans, in the aggregate amount of $5,978,673, designated as special mention. We had twenty three (23) loans, in the aggregate amount of $9,212,926, and two (2) real estate owned (“REO”) properties, in the aggregate amount of $342,867, classified as substandard. All twenty three (23) loans classified as substandard are secured by real estate. At December 31, 2011, special mention loans totaled $2,157,308 and substandard loans totaled $11,687,760. The Bank actively monitors all special mention loans to seek to avoid deterioration in the quality of the loan. The Bank is actively collecting the substandard loans and expects to collect substantially all the principal amounts due. We had no loans classified as doubtful or loss at December 31, 2012 and 2011. Victory State Bank’s Loan Review Officer and Board of Directors regularly review problem loans and review all classified assets on a quarterly basis. In certain cases, our loan workout committee will meet to discuss collection strategy on the larger, more complex loans. We believe our policies are consistent with the regulatory requirements regarding classified assets. Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by the New York State Department of Financial Services and the FDIC, which can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances. 12 The following table sets forth delinquencies in our loan portfolio at the dates indicated: At December 31, 2012 60-89 Days 90 Days or more Number Principal Number Principal Commercial real estate 1 $150,000 17 $5,923,090 Commercial construction — — 2 467,500 Commercial secured 1 91,649 — — Other 1 2,903 — — Total 3 $244,552 19 $6,390,590 Delinquent loans to total loans 0.30% 7.77% At December 31, 2011 60-89 Days 90 Days or more Number Principal Number Principal Commercial real estate 1 $359,620 20 $8,265,397 Commercial construction — — 1 397,500 Commercial unsecured 1 16,260 — — Real Estate - Residential — — 2 2,200,000 Total 2 $375,880 23 $10,862,897 Delinquent loans to total loans 0.46% 13.23% At December 31, 2010 60-89 Days 90 Days or more Number Principal Number Principal Commercial real estate 2 $277,960 12 $4,064,281 Commercial unsecured 2 42,708 2 37,706 Real Estate - Residential — — 3 2,276,306 Total 4 $320,668 17 $6,378,293 Delinquent loans to total loans 0.39% 7.80% At December 31, 2009 60-89 Days 90 Days or more Number Principal Number Principal Commercial real estate 9 $3,848,990 7 $1,176,114 Commercial construction — — 2 480,000 Commercial unsecured 4 61,907 1 41,037 Real Estate - Residential 3 2,299,322 — — Total 16 $6,210,219 10 $1,697,151 Delinquent loans to total loans 7.86% 2.15% At December 31, 2008 60-89 Days 90 Days or more Number Principal Number Principal Commercial real estate 2 $207,047 5 $1,453,846 Commercial construction — — 2 480,000 Commercial unsecured — — 7 345,221 Total 2 $207,047 14 $2,279,067 Delinquent loans to total loans 0.31% 3.43% Loans 90 days or more past due represent non-accrual loans and loans that are contractually past due maturity but are still accruing interest.

The following table sets forth information about our non-performing assets at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. At December 31, At December 31, At December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Non-performing assets: Commercial loans: Unsecured $— $— $37,706 Commercial real estate 5,923,090 8,265,397 4,064,281 Residential real estate — 2,200,000 2,276,306 Construction 467,500 397,500 — Real estate owned 342,867 267,246 — Total non-performing assets $6,733,457 $11,130,143 $6,378,293 Non-performing loans to total loans 7.77% 13.23% 7.80% Non-performing loans to total assets 2.37% 4.49% 2.71% Non-performing assets to total assets 2.50% 4.60% 2.71% The gross interest income that would have been recorded in 2012 if the non-accrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms was $478,556. The amount of interest income on those loans that was included in net income for 2012 was $1,554. In 2011, gross interest that would have been recorded if non-accrual loans had been current was $595,946, of which $165,515 was actually received and included in net income.

Non-Performing Loans Management closely monitors non-performing loans and other assets with potential problems on a regular basis. We had nineteen non-performing loans, totaling $6,390,590 at December 31, 2012, compared to twenty three non-performing loans, totaling $10,862,897 at December 31, 2011. Non-performing loans totaled 7.77% of total loans at December 31, 2012 compared to 13.23% at December 31, 2011. We have always followed a hands-on approach to dealing with our past due borrowers that we believe is sufficiently aggressive to maximize recovery. 14 As noted in the discussion below regarding specific loans, many of our non-performing loans are secured by real estate, and thus we expect substantial if not complete recovery of the loan amount. However, it is inevitable that we will experience some charge-offs of non-performing loans. All of the loans discussed individually below were evaluated separately for impairment under ASC 310 and we have included a component of our allowance for loan and lease losses representing our measurement of the impairment on those loans. However, the process by which we estimate the potential loss on those loans is necessarily imprecise and subject to changing future events, facts that may be unknown to us, and other uncertainties. Thus, although we believe that our allowance for loan losses is appropriate to address the weaknesses in those loans, we may be required to increase our provision for loan losses in the future if actual impairment exceeds our expectations. The following is information about the seven largest non-performing loans and the associated relationships, totaling $4,992,559, or 78.1% of our non-performing loans, by outstanding principal balance at December 31, 2012. Management believes it has taken appropriate steps with a view towards maximizing recovery and minimizing loss, if any, on these loans. ·$1,362,648 in two commercial real estate loans. One of these loans, in the principal amount of $827,250, is secured by a first mortgage on property in Queens. We have commenced a foreclosure action and we are at the stage of the finalization of a referee’s report on the amount due so we can sell the property. However, a guarantor of the loan, who is a party to the foreclosure action, has filed a bankruptcy petition, which automatically stays the foreclosure. The other loan was secured by a second mortgage on property in Staten Island but the holder of the first mortgage has completed a foreclosure action so our second mortgage has been eliminated and we subsequently charged off $535,398 in January 2013. We had previously commenced a separate action seeking a money judgment against the borrower and the guarantors because of the foreclosure action by the first mortgagee. We were granted summary judgment in the money judgment action for $764,226.65, including principal, interest and costs, and have been aggressively pursuing collection but collection proceedings against the principal individual guarantor have been stayed due to the same bankruptcy filing. ·$1,224,198 in two commercial real estate loans. The loans, made to two individuals, are secured by a first mortgage and second mortgage on two pieces of real estate in Staten Island. The borrowers signed a modified repayment agreement in July, 2012. In accordance with the modified repayment arrangement, we received a principal payment of $150,000 in July 2012, and we agreed to allow the borrower six months to sell the property and repay our loan. When that did not occur, we commenced foreclosure proceedings. ·$861,204 in a commercial real estate loan. The loan is secured by a first mortgage on the property in Staten Island. The loan is guaranteed personally by the principals of the borrower. The borrower signed a forbearance agreement during the fourth quarter of 2012 which includes a modified payment arrangement. We received a $145,000 upfront payment and the borrower agreed to make monthly payments. We agreed to hold the previously commenced foreclosure proceedings in abeyance as long as there is performance under the forbearance agreement. The borrower has been making payments according to the forbearance agreement since October, 2012. ·$578,009 in a commercial real estate loan. The loan is secured by a second mortgage on the property in Staten Island. The loan is guaranteed personally by the principals of the borrower. The borrower signed a modified repayment agreement in April, 2012 and we are holding the previously commenced foreclosure action in abeyance as long as it performs under the terms of the modified repayment arrangement. We received a $125,000 upfront payment and the borrower has been making payments under the terms of the modified agreement since May 2012. ·$499,000 in a commercial real estate loan on property in Staten Island that is leased to a restaurant. The loan is secured by a first mortgage on the property and a second mortgage on other commercial real estate collateral. The loan is guaranteed personally by the principals of the borrower and we have a security interest in the business. We have commenced foreclosure proceedings. ·$467,500 in two construction loans. The loans are secured by a first and second mortgage on property in Staten Island. The loans are guaranteed personally by the principals of the borrower. The borrower signed a forbearance agreement in October, 2012 and has received a certificate of occupancy on the property. Payments are current under the terms of the forbearance agreement. From time to time, the Bank will enter into agreements with borrowers to modify the terms of their loans when we believe that a modification will maximize our recovery. In most cases, we do not agree to reduce the rate of interest or forgive the repayment of principal when we agree to the loan modification, and we did not do so in any of the modifications described above. Instead, we seek to modify terms on an interim basis to allow the borrower to reduce payments for a short duration and thus give the borrower an opportunity to get back on its feet. We prefer to develop repayment plans for our borrowers that provide them with cash flow relief while requiring that they ultimately pay all amounts that they owe. However, we are not averse to commencing legal action to foreclose on mortgages or obtain personal judgments against obligors when we perceive that as the appropriate strategy. Unfortunately, in recent years, many courts have taken a very pro-borrower stance in foreclosure actions, which has resulted in delays in our ability to realize upon real estate collateral. 15 If loans with modifications are on non-accrual status when they are modified, we do not immediately restore them to accruing status. For those loans, as well as other loans on non-accrual status when the borrower makes payments, we initially record payments received either as a reduction of principal or as interest received on a cash basis. The choice between those alternatives depends upon the magnitude of the concessions, if any, we have given to the borrower, the nature of the collateral and the related loan to value ratio, and other factors affecting the likelihood that we will continue to receive regular payments. Once a loan is categorized as a non-accrual loan, the loan may be restored to accruing status after a period of consistent on-time performance. The length of on-time performance required to restore a loan to accruing status varies from a minimum of six months on loans with minor modifications or less-severe weaknesses to as long as a year or more on loans for which we have granted more significant concessions to the borrower or which otherwise have more significant weaknesses. Allowance for Loan Losses It is our policy to provide a valuation allowance for probable incurred losses on loans based on our past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio, adverse situations which may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions in our lending area. The allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses charged to earnings and is reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries. While management uses available information to estimate losses on loans, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based upon any changes in economic conditions or if our loan portfolio increases. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank’s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on judgments different from those of management. Management believes, based upon all relevant and available information, that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate. When analyzing whether the level of the allowance for loan losses is appropriate, management considers performing loans in our loan portfolio that have no material identified weaknesses. Management establishes an amount equal to a fixed percentage of the performing loans in each of our five principal loan categories to be included in the allowance to cover inherent weaknesses in the broad category of loans. The fixed percentages are based upon historical loss experience in each category, the state of the economy, special risks in that particular category, and other factors that management deems relevant. One important data point in evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance as it relates to impaired real estate loans is the value of the real estate collateral. A loan is considered an impaired loan when we believe it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Those loans generally include non-accrual loans and loans categorized as troubled debt restructurings. For impaired real estate loans over $100,000, we obtain a new appraisal of the real estate at least annually. For smaller loans, we take the original appraisal and adjust the valuation based upon changing conditions, if any. We then adjust the value for costs of sale and carrying costs to measure the weakness in the loan as part of our overall evaluation of the appropriateness of our allowance for loan losses. For loans impaired loans [over $100,000], we prepare a loan by loan analysis and measure the amount of the impairment on the loan, which then becomes a component of our Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (“ALLL”). This analysis considers both the general factors which are considered in assessing performing loans as well as specific facts pertinent to each loan, such as collateral value, borrower’s income and ability to repay, payment history, the reasons for and length of the delinquency, and the value of any credit support. For Substandard loans that are not impaired, we provide, as part of our general allowance for loan losses, an amount management deems prudent to recognize the risks pertaining to the asset. A general allowance represents a loss allowance which has been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike a specific allowance, has not been allocated to particular problem assets. When we classify an asset as “Loss,” we either establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of the amount of the asset or charge off that amount. Although loans may be analyzed individually or in groups to determine the allowance, the entire allowance is available for any losses that occur. In order to assist in determining the appropriate allowance, an independent loan review firm, senior management and the Bank’s Board of Directors review the allowance for loan losses quarterly. If they determine that the allowance is inappropriate, then management increases or decreases the provision for loan losses to bring the allowance to the appropriate level. 16 As of December 31, 2012, our allowance for loan losses was $1,753,521 or 2.13% of total loans. Based upon all relevant and presently available information, management believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate. We continue to monitor and modify the level of the allowance for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at a level which management considers appropriate. The following table sets forth the activity in our allowance for loan losses: For the Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 Allowance for Loan Losses: Balance at beginning of period $1,343,020 $1,277,220 $1,063,454 $987,876 $927,161 Charge-offs: Real estate loans: Commercial (16,675) (74,512) — (110,241) — Residential — (57,715) — — — Commercial loans: Unsecured (100,757) (532,957) (15,765) (412,112) (483,326) Consumer loan — — (4,863) (18,606) (7,959) Other loans (10,917) (3,811) (2,084) (15,679) (3,503) Total charge-offs (128,349) (668,995) (22,712) (556,638) (494,788) Recoveries 183,850 139,795 96,478 72,216 270,503 Net (charge-offs) / recoveries 55,501 (529,200) 73,766 (484,422) (224,285) Provision charged to income 355,000 595,000 140,000 560,000 285,000 Balance at end of period $1,753,521 $1,343,020 $1,277,220 $1,063,454 $987,876 Ratio of net charge-offs / (recoveries) during the period to average loans outstanding during the period -0.07% 0.65% -0.09% 0.68% 0.35% Ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans at the end of period 2.13% 1.64% 1.56% 1.35% 1.49% Ratio of allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans at the end of the period 27.44% 12.36% 20.02% 62.66% 43.35% Ratio of allowance for loan losses to non-performing assets at the end of the period 26.04% 12.07% 20.02% 62.66% 43.35% The following table sets forth the allocation of our allowance for loan losses among each of the categories listed.

Additionally, it is appropriate for us to maintain investments for ongoing liquidity needs and we have maintained liquid assets at a level believed to be adequate to meet our normal daily activities. 17 Our investment policy, established by the Board of Directors of Victory State Bank and implemented by its Asset/Liability Committee, attempts to provide and maintain liquidity, generate a favorable return on investments without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk, and complement our lending activities. Although we classify most of our securities portfolio as available for sale, it is our practice to retain most of our securities until they mature. Our policies generally limit investments to government and federal agency securities or AAA rated securities, including corporate debt obligations, which are investment grade with weighted average lives of seven years or less. Our policies provide that all investment purchases be ratified by the Bank’s Board and may only be initiated by the President or Chief Financial Officer of the Bank. Investment securities consist of collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMO”) with estimated average lives, based upon prepayment assumptions that management believes are reasonable, of 4.5 years or less, mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) with maturities of seven years or less , U.S. Agency notes with a maturity of less than 15 years, collateralized loan obligations (“CLO”) and asset backed securities. These CMOs and MBSs are backed by federal agencies such as Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”) or are “AAA” rated whole loan securities. No investment securities in our portfolio have experienced ratings down grades. At December 31, 2012, we had investment securities with a cost basis of $104,144,167 and a fair value of $106,825,570. All investment securities at December 31, 2012, consisted of CMOs, MBSs, CLOs or asset backed securities. The entire investment portfolio at December 31, 2012 was classified as available for sale and is accounted on a fair value basis with changes in fair value included as other comprehensive income. The following table sets forth certain information regarding the amortized cost and fair values of the investment securities, available for sale portfolio at the dates indicated. The excess of fair value over amortized cost at year end 2012 is the result of the effect of recent low market interest rates on the value of previously-purchased investment securities. If market interest rates were to increase, we anticipate that this excess would decrease and, under certain circumstances depending upon the timing of securities purchases and the rate of increase in interest rates, amortized cost may exceed fair value.

Deposits are the primary source of our funds for use in lending, investing and for other general purposes. In addition to deposits, we obtain funds from principal repayments and prepayments on loans and securities. Loan and securities repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows as well as unscheduled prepayments are influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. Deposits. We offer a variety of deposit accounts having a range of interest rates and terms. Our deposits consist of non-interest bearing checking accounts, money market accounts, time deposit (“certificate”) accounts, statement savings and NOW accounts. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market rates, prevailing interest rates and competition. Our deposits are obtained primarily from the areas in which our offices are located. We do not actively solicit certificate accounts in excess of $100,000, nor do we use brokers to obtain deposits. However, in connection with our efforts in establishing banking development districts in Staten Island, we accept large balance municipal deposits as part of the New York State and New York City banking development district programs. These municipal deposits total $35 million, are at a subsidized rate, and mature on a quarterly or an annual basis. There can be no assurance that the Bank will be able to retain these municipal deposits or be able to renew them at subsidized rates as compared to current market rates at that time. Management constantly monitors our deposit accounts and, based on historical experience, management believes it will retain a large portion of such accounts upon maturity. Deposit account terms we offer vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods that the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rates, among other factors. In determining the characteristics of the deposit account programs we offer, we consider potential profitability, matching terms of the deposits with loan products, the attractiveness to the customers and the rates offered by our competitors. 19 Our focus on customer service, primarily for the business and professional community in our marketplace, has facilitated our retention of non-interest bearing checking accounts and low costing NOW and savings accounts, which generally have interest rates substantially less than certificate of deposits. At December 31, 2012, these types of low cost deposit accounts amounted to $136,147,551, or 56.6% of total deposits. The following table presents deposit activity for the periods indicated.

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had no outstanding borrowings. Personnel As of December 31, 2012, we had 43 full-time employees and 12 part-time employees. These employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 20 REGULATION AND SUPERVISION Regulation of VSB Bancorp, Inc. VSB Bancorp, Inc., is a New York corporation and is subject to and governed by the New York Business Corporation Law. It is a bank holding company and thus is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve. Bank Holding Company Regulation . As a bank holding company, we are required to file periodic reports and other information with the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve may conduct examinations of us. We are subject to capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve. The guidelines apply on a consolidated basis and require bank holding companies to maintain a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets of 4.0%. The minimum ratio is 3.0% for the most highly rated bank holding companies. The Federal Reserve’s capital adequacy guidelines also require bank holding companies to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, and a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.0%. As of December 31, 2012, the ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets was 9.97%, the ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 27.05%, and the ratio of qualifying total capital to risk-weighted assets was 28.30%. Our ability to pay dividends can be restricted if overall capital falls below levels established by the Federal Reserve’s guidelines. Federal Reserve approval is required if we seek to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of 5% or more of the voting shares of a bank or bank holding company. We must obtain Federal Reserve approval before we acquire all or substantially all the assets of a bank or merge or consolidate with another bank holding company. These provisions also would apply to a bank holding company that sought to acquire 5% or more of the common stock of or to merge or consolidate with us. Bank holding companies like us may not engage in activities other than banking and activities so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Federal Reserve regulations contain a list of permissible non-banking activities that are closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks and the Federal Reserve has identified a limited number of additional activities by order. These activities include lending activities, certain data processing activities, and securities brokerage and investment advisory services, trust activities and leasing activities. A bank holding company must file an application or a notice with the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring more than 5% of the voting shares of a company engaged in such activities. A bank holding company that is well capitalized and well managed and meets other conditions may provide notice after making the acquisition. We have the right to elect to be treated as a financial holding company if the Bank is well capitalized and well managed and has at least a satisfactory record of performance under the Community Reinvestment Act. Financial holding companies that meet certain conditions may engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to financial activities, or activities that are complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. Federal law identifies certain activities that are deemed to be financial in nature, including non-banking activities currently permissible for bank holding companies to engage in both within and outside the United States, as well as insurance and securities underwriting and merchant banking activities. The Federal Reserve may identify additional activities that are permissible financial activities. No prior notice to the Federal Reserve is required for a financial holding company to acquire a company engaged in these activities or to commence these activities directly or indirectly through a subsidiary. We have not elected to be treated as a financial holding company since we have no current plans to use the authority to engage in expanded activities. However, we may elect to do so in the future. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Law On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Law was adopted. It has been described as the greatest legislative change in the supervision of financial institutions since the 1930s. Its effect on Victory State Bank and VSB Bancorp, Inc. cannot now be judged with certainty because the interpretation and implementation of the law, as well as the numerous regulations and studies required or permitted by it, are still evolving. However, we believe that the following areas, among others, will be or may be significant to our future operations: 21 1.The law exempts smaller reporting companies filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as our company, from the internal controls attestation rules of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Thus far, we have incurred expenses to prepare for compliance but we have not been governed by Section 404(b) due to temporary SEC extensions of the compliance deadline. The permanent exemption means that we will not be required to incur the expense of actual compliance as long as we continue to qualify as a smaller reporting company. 2.Securities brokers may not vote shares held in “street name” unless they receive instructions from their customers on the election of directors, executive compensation or any other significant matter, as determined by the SEC. This may increase our costs of holding annual stockholder meetings if it becomes necessary for us to retain the services of a proxy solicitor to increase shareholder participation in our meetings or to obtain approval of matters that the Board presents to stockholders. However, we did not experience any difficulties or additional expense related to this issue in connection with our 2011 annual meeting of stockholders. 3.At least every three years, we must submit our executive compensation to our stockholders for a non-binding advisory vote. We will be having our first such advisory vote at our annual meeting in 2013. 4.The law includes a number of changes to expand FDIC insurance coverage, as well as changes to the premiums banks must pay for insurance coverage, and the requirements applicable to the reserve ratio (the ratio of the deposit insurance fund to the amount of insured deposits). One important change is that, in the future, deposit insurance premiums we pay will be based upon total assets minus tangible capital, rather than based upon deposits. Since we do not use material borrowings to provide funds for asset growth, and we do not have material intangible assets that are excluded from capital such as goodwill, our share of the total deposit premiums paid by all banks appears to have declined. However, other factors, such as required replenishment of the current reserve fund, which must be increased to 1.35% of total insured deposits by September 30, 2020, as well as future failures of banks that may further deplete the fund, may result in an increase in our future deposit insurance premium. The FDIC must provide an offset for smaller banks negating the adverse effect of requiring a reserve ratio in excess of 1.15%, but reaching even the 1.15% ratio may require additional burdens on smaller banks. The FDIC approved final regulations implementing these changes on February 25, 2011, effective April 1, 2011. According to the FDIC, the substantial majority of banks will see reduced deposit insurance premiums as a result of the new rules. We believe that will be the case for us as long as all other relevant factors remain unchanged. Our FDIC regular insurance premium was $188,285 in 2012 compared to $238,823 in 2011, a decrease of 21.2%. The decrease was principally the result of the change from a deposit-based premium calculation to an assets-based premium calculation. 5.The law increases the amount of each customer’s deposits that are subject to FDIC insurance. The general limit has been permanently increased from $100,000 to $250,000. 6.The law repeals the prohibition on paying interest on demand deposit accounts, effective in July 2011. Interest-free demand deposits represent a substantial portion of our deposit base. We are not currently offering a demand deposit product that pays interest. Other banks in our community are now offering interest-bearing demand deposits and that competitive pressure may require that we offer interest checking accounts to businesses in order to retain deposits. That could have a direct adverse effect on our cost of funds. Although current market interest rates are very low, and such deposits are unlikely to carry high rates of interest, an increase in market interest rates could result in significant additional costs in order to maintain the level of such deposits. 7.The law makes interstate branching by banks much easier than in the past. We have no plans to branch outside New York State, but the law facilitates out of state banks branching into our market area, thus potentially increasing competition. 8.The law creates a new federal agency – the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“Bureau”) – which has substantial authority to regulate consumer financial transactions, effective July 21, 2011. Our loans are primarily made to businesses rather than individual consumers, so the Bureau will not have a direct effect on many of our loan transactions. However, the Bureau also has authority to regulate other non-loan consumer transactions, such as deposits and electronic banking transactions. The implementation of new consumer regulations may increase our operating costs in a manner we cannot predict until regulations are adopted. 22 Statutory Restrictions on Acquisition of VSB Bancorp, Inc., and Victory State Bank Applicable provisions of the New York Banking Law, the federal Bank Holding Company Act, and other federal statutes, restrict the ability of persons or entities to acquire control of a bank holding company. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, persons who intend to acquire control of a bank holding company, either directly or indirectly or through or in concert with one or more persons must give 60 days’ prior written notice to the Federal Reserve. “Control” would exist when an acquiring party directly or indirectly has voting control of at least 25% of our voting securities or the power to direct our management or policies. Under Federal Reserve regulations, a rebuttable presumption of control would arise with respect to an acquisition where, after the transaction, the acquiring party has ownership control, or the power to vote at least 10% (but less than 25%) of our common stock. The New York Banking Law requires prior approval of the New York Superintendent of Financial Services before any action is taken that causes any company to acquire direct or indirect control of a banking institution that is organized in the State of New York. The term “control” is defined generally to mean the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the banking institution and is presumed to exist if the company owns, controls or holds with power to vote 10% or more of the voting stock of the banking institution. Section 912 of the New York Business Corporation Law, known as the New York Anti-Takeover Law, restricts the ability of interested stockholders to engage in business combinations with a New York corporation. In general terms, Section 912 prohibits any New York corporation covered by the statute from merging with an interested shareholder (i.e., one who owns 20% or more of the outstanding voting stock) for five years following the date on which the interested shareholder first acquired 20% of the stock, unless before that date the Board of Directors of the corporation had approved either the merger or the interested shareholder’s stock purchase. Section 912 defines an interested stockholder as the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 20% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation; and certain other entities that have owned 20% or more of a corporation’s stock during the past five years. A business combination is defined as a merger, consolidation, sale of 10% or more of the assets, or similar transaction. Unless an interested stockholder waits five years after becoming an interested stockholder to engage in a business combination, the business combination is prohibited unless our Board of Directors has approved either (a) the business combination or (b) the acquisition of stock by the interested stockholder, before the interested stockholder acquired its 20% interest. Even though the interested stockholder waits five years, the business combination is prohibited unless either: (i) the business combination or the acquisition of stock by the interested stockholder was approved by the Board of Directors before the interested stockholder acquired its 20% interest; (ii) the business combination is approved by a majority vote of all outstanding shares of stock not beneficially owned by the interested stockholder or its affiliates or associates at a meeting held at least five years after the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder; or (iii) the price paid for common stock acquired in the business combination is, in general terms, at least as much as the greater of (a) highest price paid by the interested stockholder for any stock since the interested stockholder first owned 5% of the stock of the corporation, or (b) the market value of the stock as of the date of announcement of the business combination; and the price paid for stock other than common stock is subject to comparable minimum standards. Regulation of Victory State Bank The Bank is subject to extensive regulation and examination by the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYSDFS”), as its chartering authority, and by the FDIC, as the insurer of its deposits. The federal and state laws and regulations which are applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds and the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans. The Bank must file reports with the NYSDFS and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition, in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as establishing branches and mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions. There are periodic examinations by the NYSDFS and the FDIC to test the Bank’s compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulation, whether by the NYSDFS, the FDIC or as a result of the enactment of legislation, could have a material adverse impact on the Bank and its operations. 23 Capital Requirements The FDIC imposes capital adequacy standards on state-chartered banks, which, like the Bank, are not members of the Federal Reserve System. The FDIC’s capital regulations establish a minimum 3.0% Tier I leverage capital requirement for the most highly-rated state-chartered, non-member banks, with an additional cushion of at least 100 basis points for all other state-chartered, non-member banks, which effectively will increase the minimum Tier I leverage ratio for such other banks to 4.0%. Under the FDIC’s regulation, the highest-rated banks are those that the FDIC determines are not anticipating or experiencing significant growth and have well diversified risk, including no undue interest rate risk exposure, excellent asset quality, high liquidity, good earnings and, in general, which are considered a strong banking organization and are rated composite 1 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System. Tier I or core capital is defined as the sum of common stockholders’ equity (including retained earnings), non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus, and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries, minus all intangible assets other than certain qualifying supervisory goodwill and certain mortgage servicing rights. The FDIC also requires that banks meet a risk-based capital standard. The risk-based capital standard for banks requires the maintenance of a ratio of total capital (which is defined as Tier I capital and supplementary capital) to risk-weighted assets of 8.0% and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets of 4%. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets, plus certain off-balance sheet assets, are multiplied by a risk-weight of 0% to 100%, based on the risks the FDIC believes are inherent in the type of asset or item. The components of Tier I capital are the same as for the leverage capital standard. The components of supplementary capital include certain perpetual preferred stock, certain mandatory convertible securities, certain subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock and general allowances for loan and lease losses. Allowance for loan and lease losses includable in supplementary capital is limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. Overall, the amount of capital counted toward supplementary capital cannot exceed 100% of core capital. The FDIC has an additional, higher capital level, known as well-capitalized. In order to be classified as well-capitalized, a bank must have a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%. Furthermore, anecdotal evidence indicates that in recent regulatory examinations and in informal discussions with regulators the FDIC has been urging banks to maintain even higher levels of capital during the current period of economic difficulty. At December 31, 2012, the Bank exceeded all of the capital ratio standards for a well-capitalized bank. The following table shows the Bank’s actual capital amounts and ratios. For capital adequacy purposes To be well-capitalized under prompt corrective action provisions Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio As of December 31, 2012 Tier 1 Capital (to Average Assets) $25,455,000 9.65% $10,155,155 4.00% $13,193,943 5.00% Tier 1 Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) 25,455,000 26.03% 3,911,960 4.00% 5,867,940 6.00% Total Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) 26,684,000 27.28% 7,823,920 8.00% 9,779,900 10.00% The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, consisting of bank regulators from 27 countries, has developed a revised capital framework for banks throughout the world, known as the “Basel III Accord,” which was to have been implemented beginning in 2013. The Federal Reserve has delayed the implementation of the Basel III Accord in the United States and is currently evaluating how and to what extent the new rules should be implemented. Although we cannot know with certainty what the Federal Reserve and other United States bank regulators will finally decide, we believe that the implementation of the Basel III Accord will not have a material effect on our ability to satisfy the regulatory standards for remaining well-capitalized. Our current capital ratios are more than sufficient to satisfy any reasonably anticipated increase. However, the Basel III Accord increases the complexity of the calculation of risk based capital and may increase our operating expenses associated with calculating and monitoring capital compliance. Furthermore, an increase in capital requirements would reduce the amount of leverage that our capital could support. This might adversely affect our ability to increase substantially our level of interest-earning assets. 24 Activities and Investments of New York-Chartered Banks. The Bank derives its lending, investment and other authority primarily from the applicable provisions of New York State Banking Law and the regulations of the New York Superintendent of Financial Services (“Superintendent”) , as limited by FDIC regulations and other federal laws and regulations. See “Activities and Investments of FDIC Insured State-Chartered Banks” below. These New York laws and regulations authorize the Bank to invest in real estate mortgages, consumer and commercial loans, certain types of debt securities, including certain corporate debt securities and obligations of federal, State and local governments and agencies, and certain other assets. A bank’s aggregate lending powers are not subject to percentage of asset limitations, although there are limits applicable to single borrowers. A New York-chartered bank may also exercise trust powers upon approval of the New York Superintendent of Financial Services. The Bank does not have trust powers. The New York Superintendent of Financial Services has the power to adopt regulations that enable state chartered banks to exercise the rights, powers and privileges permitted for a national bank. The Bank has not engaged in material activities authorized by such regulations. With certain limited exceptions, the Bank may not make loans or extend credit for commercial, corporate or business purposes (including lease financing) to a single borrower, the aggregate amount of which would be in excess of 15% of the Bank’s capital (as adjusted pursuant to the New York Banking Law), on an unsecured basis, and 25% of the adjusted capital if the excess is collateralized by readily marketable collateral or collateral otherwise having a value equal to the amount by which the loan exceeds 15% of the Bank’s net worth. These limits do not apply to loans made by VSB Bancorp, Inc. directly at the holding company level. The Bank currently complies with all applicable loans-to-one-borrower limitations and VSB Bancorp, Inc. has not made any loans in its own name except for its loan to its Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Activities and Investments of FDIC-Insured State-Chartered Banks. The activities and equity investments of FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks are generally limited to those that are permissible for national banks. Under regulations dealing with equity investments, an insured state bank generally may not directly or indirectly acquire or retain any equity investment of a type, or in an amount, that is not permissible for a national bank. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things, (i) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary, (ii) investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank’s total assets, (iii) acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors’, trustees’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage or bankers’ blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions, and (iv) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met. In addition, an FDIC-insured state-chartered bank may not directly, or indirectly through a subsidiary, engage as “principal” in any activity that is not permissible for a national bank unless the FDIC has determined that such activities would pose no risk to the insurance fund of which it is a member and the bank is in compliance with applicable regulatory capital requirements. Regulatory Enforcement Authority Applicable banking laws include substantial enforcement powers available to federal banking regulators. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease-and-desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties, as defined. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities. Under the New York State Banking Law, the Superintendent may issue an order to a New York-chartered banking institution to appear and explain an apparent violation of law, to discontinue unauthorized or unsafe practices and to keep prescribed books and accounts. Upon a finding by the Superintendent that any director, trustee or officer of any banking organization has violated any law, or has continued unauthorized or unsafe practices in conducting the business of the banking organization after having been notified by the NYSDFS to discontinue such practices, such director, trustee or officer may be removed from office by the Superintendent after notice and an opportunity to be heard. The Bank does not know of any past or current practice, condition or violation that might lead to any proceeding by the Superintendent against the Bank or any of its directors or officers. The Superintendent also may take possession of a banking organization under specified statutory criteria. 25 Prompt Corrective Action. Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”) provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take “prompt corrective action” to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The extent of the regulators’ powers depends on whether the institution in question is “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” A bank is deemed to be (i) “well capitalized” if it has total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or more, has a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or more, has a Tier I leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or more and is not subject to specified requirements to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure, (ii) “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 4.0% or more and a Tier I leverage capital ratio of 4.0% or more (3.0% under certain circumstances) and does not meet the definition of “well capitalized,” (iii) “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4.0% or a Tier I leverage capital ratio that is less than 4.0% (3.0% under certain circumstances), (iv) “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0%, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio that is less than 3.0% or a Tier I leverage capital ratio that is less than 3.0%, and (v) “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. The regulations also provide that a federal banking regulator may, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, reclassify a “well capitalized” institution as “adequately capitalized” and may require an “adequately capitalized” institution or an “undercapitalized” institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category if the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice. The federal banking regulator may not, however, reclassify a “significantly undercapitalized” institution as “critically undercapitalized.” An institution generally must file a written capital restoration plan which meets specified requirements, as well as a performance guaranty by each company that controls the institution, with an appropriate federal banking regulator within 45 days of the date that the institution receives notice or is deemed to have notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Immediately upon becoming undercapitalized, an institution becomes subject to statutory provisions, which, among other things, set forth various mandatory and discretionary restrictions on the operations of such an institution. At December 31, 2012, the Company and the Bank had capital levels which qualified them as “well-capitalized” institutions. FDIC Insurance The Bank is a member of the FDIC and its deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC up to $250,000. As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, FDIC-insured institutions. It also may prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the FDIC. In the past four years, there have been many failures and near-failures among financial institutions. As the number of FDIC-insured banks that failed increased, the FDIC insurance fund reserve ratio, representing the ratio of the fund to the level of insured deposits, declined dramatically due to losses caused by bank failures. As a result, the FDIC increased its deposit insurance premiums on remaining institutions, including well-capitalized institutions like Victory State Bank, in order to replenish the insurance fund. If bank failures continue to occur, and more so if the level of failures increases, the FDIC insurance fund may further decline, and the FDIC would be required to continue to impose higher premiums on healthy banks. Thus, despite the prudent steps we may take to avoid the mistakes made by other banks, our costs of operations may increase as a result of those mistakes by others. Our FDIC insurance premium was $188,285 in 2012 compared to $238,823 in 2011, a decrease of 21.2%, principally due to a reduction in the Bank’s non-performing loans and a corresponding reduction in the Bank’s risk profile, which is one of the factors used to calculate its FDIC insurance premium. As required by The Dodd –Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Law (the “Dodd-Frank” Act), the FDIC has recently revised its deposit insurance premium assessment rates. Our Bank, even though we are in the lowest regulatory risk category, is subject to an assessment rate between five (5) and nine (9) basis points per annum. In general, the rates are applied to our bank’s total assets less tangible capital, in contrast to the former rule which applied the assessment rate to our level of deposits. The deposit insurance premium change and the special assessment have begun to replenish the fund created to pay the cost of resolving failed banks and the fund no longer has a negative balance. The Dodd-Frank Act requires that the FDIC must increase the ratio of the FDIC insurance fund to estimated total insured deposits to 1.35% by September 30, 2020. The FDIC believes that most banks will pay a lower total assessment under the new system than under the former system, and Victory State Bank has paid lower premiums under the new system than under the former system. However, if bank failures in the future exceed FDIC estimates, or other estimates that the FDIC makes turn out to be incorrect, and the losses to the insurance fund increase, the FDIC could be forced to increase insurance premiums. Such an increase would increase our non-interest expense. 26 The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including the Bank, if it determines, after a hearing, that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. Management is aware of no existing circumstances that would result in termination of the Bank’s deposit insurance. Brokered Deposits Under federal law and applicable regulations, (i) a well capitalized bank may solicit and accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit without restriction, (ii) an adequately capitalized bank may not accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless it has applied for and been granted a waiver of this prohibition by the FDIC and (iii) an undercapitalized bank may not (x) accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit or (y) solicit deposits by offering an effective yield that exceeds by more than 75 basis points the prevailing effective yields on insured deposits of comparable maturity in such institution’s normal market area or in the market area in which such deposits are being solicited. The term “undercapitalized insured depository institution” is defined to mean any insured depository institution that fails to meet the minimum regulatory capital requirement prescribed by its appropriate federal banking agency. The FDIC may, on a case-by-case basis and upon application by an adequately capitalized insured depository institution, waive the restriction on brokered deposits upon a finding that the acceptance of brokered deposits does not constitute an unsafe or unsound practice with respect to such institution. The Bank had no brokered deposits outstanding at December 31, 2012. Community Reinvestment and Consumer Protection Laws In connection with its lending activities, the Bank is subject to a variety of federal laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. Included among these are the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Truth-in-Lending Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act and Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”). The CRA requires FDIC insured banks to define the assessment areas that they serve, identify the credit needs of those assessment areas and take actions that respond to the credit needs of the community. The FDIC must conduct regular CRA examinations of the Bank and assign it a CRA rating of “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs improvement” or “unsatisfactory.” The Bank is also subject to provisions of the New York State Banking Law which impose similar obligations to serve the credit needs of its assessment areas. The New York State Department of Financial Services makes a biennial written assessment of a bank’s compliance, and makes the assessment available to the public. Federal and New York State laws both require consideration of these ratings when reviewing a bank’s application to engage in certain transactions, including mergers, asset purchases and the establishment of branch offices. A negative assessment may serve as a basis for the denial of any such application. The Bank has received “Outstanding” rating from the New York State Department of Financial Services and “Satisfactory” from the FDIC. The Dodd-Frank Act created a new federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“Bureau”) with broad authority to regulate and enforce consumer protection laws. The Bureau assumed those responsibilities on July 21, 2011. The Bureau has the authority to participate in regulatory examinations and to adopt regulations under numerous existing federal consumer protection statutes. The Bureau may also decide that a particular consumer financial product or service, or the manner in which it is offered, is an unfair, deceptive, or abusive act or practice. If the Bureau so decides, it has the authority to outlaw such act or practice. Since the Bureau is just in its formative stages and has not yet exercised any of its authority to regulate, examine or enforce consumer laws, it is impossible to predict its effect on our company. Limitations on Dividends The payment of dividends by the Bank to our Company as its sole stockholder is subject to various regulatory requirements. Under New York State Banking Law, a New York-chartered stock bank may declare and pay dividends out of its net profits, unless there is an impairment of capital, but approval of the Superintendent is required if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years, subject to certain adjustments. 27 Miscellaneous The Bank is subject to restrictions on loans to its non-bank subsidiaries, on investments in the stock or securities thereof, on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower, and on the issuance of a guarantee or letter of credit on behalf of the Bank or its non-bank subsidiaries. The Bank also is subject to restrictions on most types of transactions with our Company or our non-bank subsidiaries, requiring that the terms of such transactions be substantially equivalent to terms of similar transactions with non-affiliated firms. Assessments Banking institutions are required to pay assessments to both the FDIC and the NYSDFS to fund their operations. The assessments are based upon the amount of the Bank’s total assets. The Bank must also pay an examination fee to the NYSDFS when they conduct an examination. The Bank paid federal and state assessments and examination fees of $219,455 in 2012. Transactions with Related Parties The Bank’s authority to engage in transactions with related parties or “affiliates” (i.e., any entity that controls or is under common control with an institution, including the Bank) or to make loans to certain insiders is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. Section 23A limits the aggregate amount of transactions with any individual affiliate to 10% of the capital and surplus of the institution and also limits the aggregate amount of transactions with all affiliates to 20% of the institution’s capital and surplus. Loans to affiliates must be secured by collateral with a value that depends on the nature of the collateral. The purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. Loans and asset purchases with affiliates must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. In the absence of comparable transactions, such transactions may only occur under terms and circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies. The Bank’s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders, as well as entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Regulation O generally requires such loans to be made on terms substantially similar to those offered to unaffiliated individuals (except for preferential loans made in accordance with broad based employee benefit plans), places limits on the amount of loans the Bank may make to such persons based, in part, on the Bank’s capital position, and requires certain approval procedures to be followed. Standards for Safety and Soundness FDIC regulations require that Victory State Bank adopt procedures and systems designed to foster safe and sound operations in the areas of internal controls, information systems, internal and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. Among other things, these regulations prohibit compensation and benefits and arrangements that are excessive or that could lead to a material financial loss. If Victory State Bank fails to meet any of these standards, it will be required to submit to the FDIC a plan specifying the steps that will be taken to cure the deficiency. If it fails to submit an acceptable plan or fails to implement the plan, FDIC the will require it or VSB Bancorp, Inc. to correct the deficiency and until corrected, may impose restrictions on them. The FDIC has also adopted regulations that require Victory State Bank to adopt written loan policies and procedures that are consistent with safe and sound operation, are appropriate for the size of the Bank, and must be reviewed by the Bank’s Board of Directors annually. Victory State Bank has adopted such policies and procedures, which are discussed above as part of the discussion of our lending operations. 28 Federal Reserve System The Federal Reserve Board regulations require banks to maintain non-interest earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily regular checking accounts and interest-bearing checking accounts). The first $12.4 million of otherwise reservable deposits are exempted from the reserve requirements. For the next $67.1 million of reservable deposits, the reserve requirement is 3%. For amounts above that level, the reserve requirement 10%. These levels are subject t annual adjustment based upon the rate of increase in total reservable deposits of all financial institutions. The Bank is in compliance with these requirements. The Federal Reserve now permits the payment of interest on reserve deposits so such deposits are now classified as interest-earning assets. However, due to the extremely low target federal funds rate in 2012 as established by the Federal Reserve, the amount of interest we earned on reserve deposits was negligible. This reserve requirement could reduce the amount of our interest-earning assets that we can invest in higher yielding assets, such as loans. However, our level of overnight investments substantially exceeded our reserve requirement, so the reserve requirement did not cause us to forgo material income. TAXATION Federal Taxation General We are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to us. Our federal income tax returns have not been audited or closed without audit by the Internal Revenue Service. Method of Accounting We report our income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and use a tax year ending December 31 for filing our consolidated federal income tax returns. The Company files consolidated tax returns with the Bank. Bad Debt Reserves We use the experience method in computing bad debt deductions for federal tax purposes. Minimum Tax The Internal Revenue Code imposes an alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences (“alternative minimum taxable income” or “AMTI”). The AMT is payable to the extent such AMT is in excess of the Company’s regular tax liability. Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of AMT. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. We have not been subject to the alternative minimum tax and have no such amounts available as credits. State and Local Taxation New York State and New York City Taxation. New York State Franchise Tax on corporations is imposed in an amount equal to the greater of (a) 7.1% of “entire net income” allocable to New York State (b) 3% of “alternative entire net income” allocable to New York State (c) 0.01% of the average value of assets allocable to New York State or (d) a nominal minimum tax. Entire net income is based on federal taxable income, subject to certain modifications. Alternative entire net income is equal to entire net income without certain modifications. The New York City Corporation Tax is imposed using similar alternative taxable income methods and rates. A temporary Metropolitan Transportation Business Tax Surcharge on banking corporations doing business in the Metropolitan District has been applied since 1982. We transact a significant portion of our business within this District and thus we are subject to this surcharge. The current surcharge rate is 17% of the State franchise tax liability. New York City does not impose comparable surcharges. For New York State and City tax purposes, the bad debt deduction conforms to the federal deduction. 29
