ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSLimited partner interests are inherently different from capital stock of a corporation, although many of the business risks to which we are subject are similar to those that would be faced by a corporation engaged in the frac sand or refined products businesses. You should consider carefully the following risk factors together with all of the other information included in this report in evaluating an investment in our common units.If any of the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, we may be unable to make distributions on our common units, the trading price of our common units could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.Risks Related to Our BusinessWe may not have sufficient available cash to pay any quarterly distribution on our common units.We may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to enable us to pay any distributions to our unitholders. Furthermore, our partnership agreement does not require us to pay distributions on a quarterly basis or otherwise. The amount of cash we can distribute to our unitholders principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which fluctuates from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:•the level of production of, demand for, and price of frac sand and oil, natural gas, gasoline, diesel, biodiesel and other refined products, particularly in the markets we serve;•the fees we charge, and the margins we realize, from our frac sand and fuel products sales and the other services we provide;•changes in laws and regulations (or the interpretation thereof) related to the mining and oil and natural gas industries, silica dust exposure or the environment;•the level of competition from other companies;•the cost and time required to execute organic growth opportunities;•difficulty collecting receivables; and•prevailing global and regional economic and regulatory conditions, and their impact on our suppliers and customers.In addition, the actual amount of cash we have available for distribution depends on other factors, including:•the levels of our maintenance capital expenditures and growth capital expenditures;•the level of our operating costs and expenses;•our debt service requirements and other liabilities;•fluctuations in our working capital needs;•restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements to which we are a party;•the cost of acquisitions, if any;•fluctuations in interest rates;•our ability to borrow funds and access capital markets; and•the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner.Our partnership agreement does not require us to pay a minimum quarterly distribution. The amount of distributions that we pay, if any, and the decision to pay any distribution at all, are determined by the board of directors of our general partner. Our quarterly distributions, if any, are subject to significant fluctuations based on the above factors.The amount of cash we have available for distribution to unitholders depends primarily on our cash flow and not solely on profitability.You should be aware that the amount of cash we have available for distribution depends primarily upon our cash flow, including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings, and not solely on profitability, which is affected by non-cash items. As a result, we may not be able to make cash distributions during periods in which we record net income.22Table of ContentsThe amount of our quarterly cash distributions, if any, may vary significantly both quarterly and annually and will be directly dependent on the performance of our business. Unlike most publicly traded partnerships, we do not have a minimum quarterly distribution or employ structures intended to consistently maintain or increase distributions over time.Investors who are looking for an investment that will pay regular and predictable quarterly distributions should not invest in our common units. We expect our business performance may be more volatile, and our cash flows may be less stable, than the business performance and cash flows of most publicly traded partnerships. As a result, our quarterly cash distributions may be volatile and may vary quarterly and annually. Unlike most publicly traded partnerships, we do not have a minimum quarterly distribution or employ structures intended to consistently maintain or increase distributions over time. The amount of our quarterly cash distributions are directly dependent on the performance of our business. Because our quarterly distributions will significantly correlate to the cash we generate each quarter after payment of our fixed and variable expenses, quarterly distributions paid to our unitholders may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and may be zero.The board of directors of our general partner may modify or revoke our cash distribution policy at any time at its discretion. Our partnership agreement does not require us to make any distributions at all.The board of directors of our general partner adopted a cash distribution policy pursuant to which we distribute all of the available cash we generate each quarter to unitholders of record on a pro rata basis. However, the board may change such policy at any time at its discretion and could elect not to make distributions for one or more quarters. Our partnership agreement does not require us to make any distributions at all. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the permanence of such a policy in making an investment decision. Any modification or revocation of our cash distribution policy could substantially reduce or eliminate the amounts of distributions to our unitholders.Our operations are subject to the cyclical nature of our customers' businesses and depend upon the continued demand for crude oil and natural gas.Our frac sand sales are to customers in the oil and natural gas industry, a historically cyclical industry. This industry was adversely affected by the uncertain global economic climate in the second half of 2008 and in 2009. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing into 2015, the prices of crude oil and related products have dropped substantially. Natural gas prices have generally remained below $4.50 per mcf for the past six years. Worldwide economic, political and military events, including war, terrorist activity, events in the Middle East and initiatives by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have contributed, and are likely to continue to contribute, to commodity price volatility. Additionally, warmer than normal winters in North America and other weather patterns may adversely impact the short-term demand for oil and natural gas and, therefore, demand for our products.During periods of economic slowdown and long-term reductions in oil and natural gas prices, oil and natural gas exploration and production companies often reduce their oil and natural gas production rates and also reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects, which results in decreased demand for our frac sand. Such developments occur even among companies that are not experiencing financial difficulties. Similarly, demand for our refined fuel products is lower during times of economic slowdown. A continued or renewed economic downturn in one or more of the industries or geographic regions that we serve, or in the worldwide economy, could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, any future decreases in the rate at which oil and natural gas reserves are discovered or developed, whether due to increased governmental regulation, limitations on exploration and drilling activity, a sustained decline in oil and natural gas prices, or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, even in a stronger natural gas and oil price environment.Our Sand operations are subject to operating risks that are often beyond our control and could adversely affect production levels and costs.Our mining, processing and production facilities are subject to risks normally encountered in the frac sand industry. These risks include:•changes in the price and availability of transportation;•inability to obtain necessary production equipment or replacement parts;•inclement or hazardous weather conditions, including flooding, and the physical impacts of climate change;•unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressures;•unanticipated ground, grade or water conditions;•inability to acquire or maintain necessary permits or mining or water rights;•labor disputes and disputes with our excavation contractors;•late delivery of supplies;23Table of Contents•changes in the price and availability of natural gas or electricity that we use as fuel sources for our frac sand plants and equipment;•technical difficulties or failures;•cave-ins or similar pit wall failures;•environmental hazards, such as unauthorized spills, releases and discharges of wastes, tank ruptures and emissions of unpermitted levels of pollutants;•industrial accidents;•changes in laws and regulations (or the interpretation thereof) related to the mining and oil and natural gas industries, silica dust exposure or the environment;•inability of our customers or distribution partners to take delivery;•reduction in the amount of water available for processing;•fires, explosions or other accidents; and•facility shutdowns in response to environmental regulatory actions.Any of these risks could result in damage to, or destruction of, our mining properties or production facilities, personal injury, environmental damage, delays in mining or processing, losses or possible legal liability. Any prolonged downtime or shutdowns at our mining properties or production facilities could have a material adverse effect on us.Not all of these risks are reasonably insurable, and our insurance coverage contains limits, deductibles, exclusions and endorsements. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to meet our needs in the event of loss, and any such loss may have a material adverse effect on us.A large portion of our sales in each of our Sand segment and our Fuel segment is generated by a few large customers, and the loss of our largest customers or a significant reduction in purchases by those customers could adversely affect our operations.During 2014, our top five Sand customers represented 65% of sales from our Sand operations. During 2014, our top five Fuel customers represented 42% of sales from our Fuel operations. In our Fuel segment, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales to contract customers and the terms of our contracts are typically for one year or less. Our customers who are not subject to firm contractual commitments may not continue to purchase the same levels of our products in the future due to a variety of reasons. For example, some of our top customers could go out of business or, alternatively, be acquired by other companies that purchase the same products and services provided by us from other third-party providers. Our Sand customers could also seek to capture and develop their own sources of frac sand. In addition, some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks. If any of our major customers substantially reduces or altogether ceases purchasing our products, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. In addition, upon the expiration or termination of our existing contracts, we may not be able to enter into new contracts at all or on terms as favorable as our existing contracts. We may also choose to renegotiate our existing contracts on less favorable terms (including with respect to price and volumes) in order to preserve relationships with our customers.In addition, the long-term sales agreements we have for our frac sand may negatively impact our results of operations. Certain of our long-term agreements are for sales at fixed prices that are adjusted only for certain cost increases. As a result, in periods with increasing frac sand prices, our contract prices may be lower than prevailing industry spot prices. Our long-term sales agreements also contain provisions that allow prices to be adjusted downwards in the event of falling industry prices.Any material nonpayment or nonperformance by any of our key customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.Any material nonpayment or nonperformance by any of our key customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and cash flows and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. Our long-term take-or-pay sales agreements with select customers contain provisions designed to compensate us, in part, for our lost margins on any unpurchased volumes; accordingly, in such circumstances, we would be paid less than the price per ton we would receive if our customers purchased the contractual tonnage amounts. Certain of our other long-term frac sand sales agreements provide for minimum tonnage orders by our customers but do not contain pre-determined liquidated damage penalties in the event the customers fail to purchase designated volumes. Instead, we would seek legal remedies against the non-performing customer or seek new customers to replace our lost sales volumes. Certain of our other long-term frac sand supply contracts are efforts-based and therefore do not require the customer to purchase minimum volumes of frac sand from us or contain take-or-pay provisions.Our different types of contracts with our frac sand customers provide for different potential remedies to us in the event a customer fails to purchase the minimum contracted amount of frac sand in a given period. If we were to pursue legal remedies in the event 24Table of Contentsa customer failed to purchase the minimum contracted amount of sand under a fixed-volume contract or failed to satisfy the take-or-pay commitment under a take-or-pay contract, we may receive significantly less in a judgment or settlement of any claimed breach than we would have received had the customer fully performed under the contract. In the event of any customer's breach, we may also choose to renegotiate any disputed contract on less favorable terms (including with respect to price and volumes) to us to preserve the relationship with that customer. Accordingly, any material nonpayment or performance by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and cash flows and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.Certain of our contracts contain provisions requiring us to meet minimum obligations to our customers and suppliers. If we are unable to meet our minimum requirements under these contracts, we may be required to pay penalties or the contract counterparty may be able to terminate the agreement.In certain instances, we commit to deliver products to our customers prior to production, under penalty of nonperformance. Depending on the contract, our inability to deliver the requisite tonnage of frac sand may permit our customers to terminate the agreement or require us to pay our customers a fee, the amount of which would be based on the difference between the amount of tonnage contracted for and the amount delivered. We have significant long-term operating leases for railcars, both currently in service and yet to be delivered, under which we would still be obligated to pay despite any future decrease in the number of railcars needed to conduct our operations. Further, our agreement with Canadian National requires us to provide minimum volumes of frac sand for shipping on the Canadian National line. If we do not provide the minimum volume of frac sand for shipping, we will be required to pay a per-ton shortfall penalty, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, under our agreements with sand suppliers, we are obligated to order a minimum amount of wet sand per year or pay fees on the difference between the minimum and the amount we actually order. Similarly, we would be required to make minimum payments to mineral rights owners at certain of our mines in the event we purchase less than the minimum volumes of sand specified under the particular royalty agreement in place. If we are unable to meet our obligations under any of these agreements, we may have to pay substantial penalties or the agreements may become subject to termination, as applicable. In such events, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.We may be adversely affected by a reduction in horizontal drilling activity or the development of either effective alternative proppants or new processes to replace hydraulic fracturing.Frac sand is a proppant used in the completion and re-completion of natural gas and oil wells through the process of hydraulic fracturing. Frac sand is the most commonly used proppant and is less expensive than ceramic and resin coated proppants, which are also used in the hydraulic fracturing process to stimulate and maintain oil and natural gas production. A significant shift in demand from frac sand to other proppants, such as resin coated sand and ceramic alternatives, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, demand for frac sand is substantially higher in the case of horizontally drilled wells, which allow for multiple hydraulic fractures within the same well bore but are more expensive to develop than vertically drilled wells. The development and use of a cheaper, more effective alternative proppant, a reduction in horizontal drilling activity or the development of new processes to replace hydraulic fracturing altogether, could also cause a decline in demand for the frac sand we produce and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A reduction in demand for the frac sand we produce may cause our contractual arrangements to become economically unattractive and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Fuel prices and costs are volatile, and we have unhedged commodity price exposure between the time we purchase fuel supplies and the time we sell our product that may reduce our profit margins.Our financial results from our Fuel segment are strongly affected by the relationship, or margin, between the prices we charge our customers for fuel and the prices we pay for transmix, wholesale fuel and other feedstocks. We purchase our transmix, wholesale fuel and other feedstocks based on several different regional refined product price indices, the most important of which are the Platts Gulf Coast gasoline and diesel price postings. The costs of our purchases are generally set on the day that we purchase the products. We typically sell our fuel products within 7 to 10 days of our supply purchases at then prevailing market prices; however, the length of time that we hold inventory may increase due to events beyond our control, such as adverse economic conditions or a slowdown in pipeline transit times. During the period we have title to products that are held in inventory for processing and/or resale, we will be exposed to commodity price risk. Furthermore, the longer our fuel products remain in our inventory, the greater our exposure to commodity price risk. If the market price for our fuel products declines during this period or generally does not increase commensurate with any increases in our supply and processing costs, our margins will fall and the amount of cash we will have available for distribution will decrease. In addition, because our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value, if the market value of our inventory were to decline to an amount less than our cost, we would record a write-down of inventory and a non-cash charge to cost of sales. In a period of decreasing transmix or refined product prices, our inventory valuation methodology may result in decreases in our reported net income and cash available for distribution to unitholders.We also follow a financial hedging program whereby we hedge a portion of our gasoline and diesel inventory, which is intended to reduce our commodity price exposure on some of our activities in our Fuel segment. Even though we enter into hedging 25Table of Contentsarrangements to reduce our commodity price exposure, we cannot guarantee that such arrangements will provide sufficient price protection or that our counterparties will be able to perform under them, such as in the case of a counterparty's insolvency.Failure to maintain effective quality control systems at our mining, processing and production facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.The performance, quality and safety of our products are critical to the success of our business. For instance, our frac sand must meet stringent International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, and API technical specifications, including sphericity, grain size, crush resistance, acid solubility, purity and turbidity, as well as customer specifications, in order to be suitable for hydraulic fracturing purposes. If our frac sand fails to meet such specifications or our customers' expectations, we could be subject to significant contractual damages or contract terminations and face serious harm to our reputation, and our sales could be negatively affected. The performance, quality and safety of our products depend significantly on the effectiveness of our quality control systems, which, in turn, depends on a number of factors, including the design of our quality control systems, our quality-training program and our ability to ensure that our employees adhere to our quality control policies and guidelines. Any significant failure or deterioration of our quality control systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.Increasing costs or a lack of dependability or availability of transportation services or infrastructure could have an adverse effect on our ability to deliver our frac sand products at competitive prices.Because of the relatively low cost of producing frac sand, transportation and handling costs tend to be a significant component of the total delivered cost of sales. The bulk of our currently contracted sales involve our customers also contracting with truck and rail services to haul our frac sand to end users. If there are increased costs under those contracts, and our customers are not able to pass those increases along to end users, our customers may find alternative providers. We have provided fee-based transportation and logistics (including railcar procurement, freight management and product storage) services for both our spot market and contract customers. Should we fail to properly manage the customer's logistics needs under those instances where we have agreed to provide them, we may face increased costs and our customers may choose to purchase sand from other suppliers. Labor disputes, derailments, adverse weather conditions or other environmental events, tight railcar leasing markets and changes to rail freight systems could interrupt or limit available transportation services. A significant increase in transportation service rates, a reduction in the dependability or availability of transportation services or relocation of our customers' businesses to areas that are not served by the rail systems accessible from our production facilities could impair our customers' ability to access our products and our ability to expand our markets.We face significant competition that may cause us to lose market share and reduce our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.The frac sand and refined products industries are highly competitive. The frac sand market is characterized by a small number of large, national producers and a larger number of small, regional or local producers. Competition in this industry is based on price, consistency and quality of product, site location, distribution capability, customer service, reliability of supply, breadth of product offering and technical support.Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. In addition, our larger competitors may develop technology superior to ours or may have production facilities that offer lower-cost transportation to certain specific customer locations than we do. In recent years there has been an increase in the number of small, regional producers servicing the frac sand market due to an increased demand for hydraulic fracturing services and to the growing number of unconventional resource formations being developed in the United States. Should the demand for hydraulic fracturing services decrease or the supply of frac sand available in the market increase, prices in the frac sand market could materially decrease as less-efficient producers exit the market, selling frac sand at below market prices. Furthermore, oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and other providers of hydraulic fracturing services have acquired and in the future may acquire their own frac sand reserves to fulfill their proppant requirements, and these other market participants may expand their existing frac sand production capacity, all of which would negatively impact demand for our frac sand products. In addition, increased competition in the frac sand industry could have an adverse impact on our ability to enter into long-term contracts or to enter into contracts on favorable terms.Our competitors in the refined products industry include large, integrated, major or independent oil companies that, because of their more diverse operations and stronger capitalization, may be better positioned than we are to withstand volatile industry conditions, including shortages or excesses of crude oil, transmix or refined products or intense price competition at the wholesale level. Additionally, the two largest processors of transmix have substantial financial and operational resources. These processors may choose to invest in additional transmix processing capacity and compete with us directly in our core markets.Our cash flows fluctuate on a seasonal basis and severe weather conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business.Because raw sand cannot be wet-processed during extremely cold temperatures, frac sand is typically washed only eight months out of the year at our Wisconsin operations. Our inability to wash frac sand year round in Wisconsin results in a seasonal build-26Table of Contentsup of inventory as we excavate excess sand to build a stockpile that will feed the dry plant during the winter months. This seasonal build-up of inventory causes our average inventory balance to fluctuate from a few weeks in early spring to more than 100 days in early winter. As a result, the cash flows of our Sand operations fluctuate on a seasonal basis based on the length of time Wisconsin wet plant operations must remain shut down due to harsh winter weather conditions. We may also be selling frac sand for use in oil and gas-producing basins where severe weather conditions may curtail drilling activities and, as a result, our sales volumes to customers in those areas may be adversely affected. For example, we could experience a decline in volumes sold for the second quarter relative to the first quarter each year due to seasonality of frac sand sales to customers in western Canada as sales volumes are generally lower during the months of April and May due to limited drilling activity as a result of that region's annual thaw. Unexpected winter conditions (if winter comes earlier than expected or lasts longer than expected) may lead to us not having a sufficient sand stockpile to supply feedstock for our dry plant during winter months and result in us being unable to meet our contracted sand deliveries during such time, or may drive frac sand sales volumes down by affecting drilling activity among our customers, each of which could lead to a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and reputation. The inability of our logistics partners, including rail companies, to manage their own operations efficiently during inclement weather could have an effect on our ability to serve our customers where we are relying on our logistics partners to provide certain transportation services.Diminished access to water may adversely affect our operations and the operations of our customers.While much of our process water is recycled and recirculated, the mining and processing activities in which we engage at our wet plant facilities require significant amounts of water. During extreme drought conditions, some of our facilities are located in areas that can become water-constrained. We have obtained water rights and have installed high capacity wells on our properties that we currently use to service the activities on our properties, and we plan to obtain all required water rights to service other properties we may develop or acquire in the future. However, the amount of water that we are entitled to use pursuant to our water rights must be determined by the appropriate regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulatory authorities may amend the regulations regarding such water rights, increase the cost of maintaining such water rights or eliminate our current water rights, and we may be unable to retain all or a portion of such water rights. Such changes in laws, regulations or government policy and related interpretations pertaining to water rights may alter the environment in which we do business, which may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.Similarly, our customers' performance of hydraulic fracturing activities may require the use of large amounts of water. The ability of our customers' to obtain the necessary amounts of water sufficient to perform hydraulic fracturing activities may well depend on those customers ability to acquire water by means of contract, permitting, or spot purchase. The ability of our customers to obtain and maintain sufficient levels of water for these fracturing activities are similarly subject to regulatory authority approvals, changes in applicable laws or regulations, potentially differing interpretations of contract terms, increases in costs to provide such water, and even changes in weather that could make such water resources more scarce.We depend on certain transmix and wholesale fuels suppliers for a significant portion of our transmix and wholesale fuels, and the loss of any of these key suppliers or a material decrease in the supply of transmix or wholesale fuels generally available to us could materially reduce our ability to make distributions to unitholders.We purchase transmix from major oil companies, brokers and local retailers in Texas and Alabama. We currently purchase approximately 69% of our supply of transmix pursuant to contracts with terms ranging from 12 to 48 months and a volume-weighted average remaining duration of approximately 22 months as of December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our three largest suppliers of transmix accounted for 25%, 19% and 12% of our total transmix purchases. The contract with our largest supplier for the year ended December 31, 2014 expires in September 2017; purchases from our second largest supplier are made pursuant to a month-to-month contract; and the contract with our third largest supplier expires in December 2015. To the extent that our suppliers reduce the volumes of transmix and wholesale fuels that they supply us as a result of declining production, other changes in refinery output or refining transportation and marketing strategies, competition or otherwise, or if our suppliers decide not to renew our supply contracts, our revenues, net income and cash available for distribution could decline unless we were able to acquire comparable supplies of transmix and wholesale fuels on comparable terms from other suppliers. In addition, our earnings would be adversely affected if a significant supply of transmix was no longer available due to refinery or pipeline closings or interruptions or other force majeure events.We are dependent on certain third-party pipelines for transportation of our wholesale products, and if these pipelines become unavailable to us, our revenues and cash available for distribution could decline.Our processing facilities in Texas and Alabama are each interconnected to two pipelines that supply all of our wholesale products. Additionally, we periodically receive transmix at our Texas facility on an additional pipeline. Since we do not own or operate any of these pipelines, their continuing operation is not within our control. If any of these third-party pipelines were to become partially or fully unavailable to transport products because of accidents, extreme weather conditions, government regulation, terrorism or other events, or if the rates or terms and conditions of service of any of these third-party pipelines were to change materially, our revenues, net income and cash available for distribution could decline.27Table of ContentsIncreases in the price of diesel fuel may adversely affect our results of operations.Diesel fuel costs generally fluctuate with increasing and decreasing world crude oil prices, and accordingly are subject to political, economic and market factors that are outside of our control. Our operations are dependent on earthmoving equipment, railcars and tractor-trailers, and diesel fuel costs are a significant component of the operating expense of these vehicles. We contract with a third party industrial mining expert to excavate raw frac sand from our New Auburn mine, deliver the raw frac sand to our processing facility and move the sand from our wet plant to our dry plant, and pay a fixed price per ton of sand delivered to our wet plant, subject to a fuel surcharge based on the price of diesel fuel. Accordingly, increased diesel fuel costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.We may be unable to grow our cash flows if we are unable to expand our business, which could limit our ability to increase distributions to our unitholders.A principal focus of our strategy is to continue to grow the per unit distribution on our units by expanding our businesses, particularly our frac sand business. Our future growth will depend upon a number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These factors include our ability to:•develop new business and enter into contracts with new customers;•retain our existing customers and maintain or expand the level of services we provide them;•identify and obtain additional frac sand reserves;•recruit and train qualified personnel and retain valued employees;•expand our geographic presence;•effectively manage our costs and expenses, including costs and expenses related to growth;•consummate accretive acquisitions;•obtain required debt or equity financing for our existing and new operations;•meet customer-specific contract requirements or pre-qualifications;•obtain permits from federal, state and local regulatory authorities; and•make assumptions about mineral reserves, future production, sales, capital expenditures, operating expenses and costs, including synergies.If we do not achieve our expected growth, we may not be able to achieve our estimated results and, as a result, we would not be able to pay the estimated annual distribution, in which event the market price of our common units will likely decline materially.We may be unable to grow successfully through future acquisitions, and we may not be able to integrate effectively the businesses we may acquire, which may impact our operations and limit our ability to increase distributions to our unitholders.From time to time, we may choose to make business acquisitions to pursue market opportunities, increase our existing capabilities and expand into new areas of operations. While we have reviewed acquisition opportunities in the past and will continue to do so in the future, we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities or successfully acquire identified targets. In addition, we may not be successful in integrating any future acquisitions into our existing operations, which may result in unforeseen operational difficulties or diminished financial performance or require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention. Even if we are successful in integrating future acquisitions into our existing operations, we may not derive the benefits, such as operational or administrative synergies, that we expected from such acquisitions, which may result in the commitment of our capital resources without the expected returns on such capital. Furthermore, competition for acquisition opportunities may escalate, increasing our cost of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making acquisitions. Our inability to make acquisitions, or to integrate successfully future acquisitions into our existing operations, may adversely impact our operations and limit our ability to increase distributions to our unitholders.Growing our business by constructing new plants and facilities subjects us to construction risks as well as market risks relating to insufficient demand for the services of such plants and facilities upon completion thereof.One of the ways we intend to grow our business is through the construction of new dry plants, wet plants and transload facilities in our Sand segment. The construction of such facilities requires the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, which may exceed our resources, and involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties. If we undertake these projects, we may not be able to complete them on schedule or at all or at the budgeted cost. Moreover, our revenues may not increase upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, if we build a new plant or facility, the construction will occur over an extended period of time, and we will not receive any material increases in revenues until at least after completion of the project, if at all. Moreover, we may construct new plants or facilities to capture anticipated future demand in a region in 28Table of Contentswhich anticipated market conditions do not materialize or for which we are unable to acquire new customers. As a result, new plants or facilities may not be able to attract enough demand to achieve our expected investment return, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our ability to grow in the future is dependent on our ability to access external growth capital.We will distribute all of our available cash after expenses and prudent operating reserves to our unitholders. We expect that we will rely primarily upon external financing sources, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to maintain our asset base and fund growth capital expenditures. However, we may not be able to obtain equity or debt financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. To the extent we are unable to efficiently finance growth externally, our cash distribution policy will significantly impair our ability to grow. In addition, because we distribute all of our available cash, we may not grow as quickly as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations. To the extent we issue additional units in connection with other growth capital expenditures, such issuances may result in significant dilution to our existing unitholders and the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level. There are no limitations in our partnership agreement on our ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of borrowings or other debt by us to finance our growth strategy would result in interest expense, which in turn would affect the available cash that we have to distribute to our unitholders.Our debt levels may limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing, pursuing other business opportunities and paying distributions.We have a $350 million revolving credit facility with outstanding borrowings of $221.9 million million as of December 31, 2014. Our facility also has an accordion feature for an additional $150 million. Our ability to incur additional debt is subject to limitations under our revolving credit facility. Our level of debt has important consequences to us, including the following:•our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for operating working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired by our debt level, or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;•we need a portion of our cash flow to make payments on our indebtedness, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions; and•our debt level makes us more vulnerable than our competitors with less debt to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally.Our ability to service our debt depends upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which is affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, our ability to service our debt under our revolving credit facility depends on market interest rates, since we the interest rates applicable to our borrowings fluctuate with movements in interest rate markets. If our operating results are not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt, or seeking additional equity capital. We may be unable to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms, or at all.Restrictions in our revolving credit facility limit our ability to capitalize on acquisition and other business opportunities.The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our revolving credit facility and any future financing agreements could restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to expand or pursue our business activities. For example, our revolving credit facility restricts or limits our ability to:•grant liens;•incur additional indebtedness;•engage in a merger, consolidation or dissolution;•enter into transactions with affiliates;•sell or otherwise dispose of assets, businesses and operations;•materially alter the character of our business as conducted at the closing of this offering; and•make acquisitions, investments and capital expenditures.Furthermore, our revolving credit facility contains certain operating and financial covenants. Our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the revolving credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If we violate any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests a significant portion of our 29Table of Contentsindebtedness may become immediately due and payable, our lenders' commitment to make further loans to us may terminate, and we will be prohibited from making distributions to our unitholders. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. Any subsequent replacement of our revolving credit facility or any new indebtedness could have similar or greater restrictions.Our ability to manage and grow our business effectively may be adversely affected if we lose management or operational personnel.We depend on the continuing efforts of our executive officers. The departure of any of our executive officers could have a significant negative effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and on our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace.Additionally, our ability to hire, train and retain qualified personnel will continue to be important and will become more challenging as we grow and if energy industry market conditions continue to be positive. When general industry conditions are good, the competition for experienced operational and field technicians increases as other energy and manufacturing companies' needs for the same personnel increase. Our ability to grow or even to continue our current level of service to our current customers will be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully hire, train and retain these important personnel.Inaccuracies in our estimates of mineral reserves could result in lower than expected sales and higher than expected costs.We base our mineral reserve estimates on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our engineers and geologists, which are reviewed by outside firms. However, sand reserve estimates are necessarily imprecise and depend to some extent on statistical inferences drawn from available drilling data, which may prove unreliable. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of mineral reserves and in estimating costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control. Estimates of recoverable mineral reserves necessarily depend on a number of factors and assumptions, all of which may vary considerably from actual results, such as:•geological and mining conditions and/or effects from prior mining that may not be fully identified by available data or that may differ from experience;•assumptions concerning future prices of frac sand products, operating costs, mining technology improvements, development costs and reclamation costs; and•assumptions concerning future effects of regulation, including our ability to obtain required permits and the imposition of taxes by governmental agencies.Any inaccuracy in our estimates related to our mineral reserves could result in lower than expected sales and higher than expected costs and have an adverse effect on our cash available for distribution.Our Sand operations are dependent on our rights and ability to mine our properties and on our having renewed or received the required permits and approvals from governmental authorities and other third parties.We hold numerous governmental, environmental, mining and other permits, water rights and approvals authorizing operations at each of our Sand facilities. A decision by a governmental agency or other third party to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit, water right or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit, water right or approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility. Expansion of our existing operations is also predicated on securing the necessary environmental or other permits, water rights or approvals, which we may not receive in a timely manner or at all.We are subject to compliance with stringent environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to substantial costs and liabilities.Our processing, terminal and mining operations are subject to increasingly stringent and complex federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and standards governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws, regulations and standards impose numerous obligations that are applicable to our operations, including the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities; the incurrence of significant capital expenditures to limit or prevent releases of materials from our processors, terminals, and related facilities; and the imposition of remedial actions or other liabilities for pollution conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operations. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the EPA, and similar state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws, regulations and standards and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly actions.Failure to comply with environmental laws, regulations, standards, permits and orders may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations. Certain environmental laws impose strict liability for the remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances that could subject us to liability without regard to whether we were negligent or at fault. In addition, changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any such changes that result in more stringent and costly waste 30Table of Contentshandling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements with respect to our operations or more stringent or costly well drilling, construction, completion or water management activities with respect to our customers' operations could adversely affect our operations, financial results and cash available for distribution.There is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the operation of our facilities due to our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons, biodiesel, ethanol and wastes, air emissions and water discharges related to our operations, and historical operations and waste disposal practices by prior owners and operators. We currently own or operate properties that for many years have been used for industrial activities, including processing or terminal storage operations. Petroleum hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or wastes have been released on or under the properties owned or operated by us. Joint and several strict liability may be incurred in connection with such releases of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes on, under or from our properties and facilities. Private parties, including the owners or operators of properties adjacent to our operations and facilities where our petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance or other sources of indemnity.Increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations, unanticipated remediation obligations or emissions control expenditures and claims for penalties or damages could result in substantial costs and liabilities, and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders could suffer as a result. Neither the owners of our general partner nor their affiliates will indemnify us for any environmental liabilities, including those arising from non-compliance or pollution, that may be discovered at, on or under, or arise from, our operations or assets. As such, we can expect no economic assistance from any of them in the event that we are required to make expenditures to investigate, correct or remediate any petroleum hydrocarbons, hazardous substances, wastes or other materials.The effect of the renewable fuel standard program in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is uncertain.The domestic market for biodiesel is largely dictated by federal mandates for blending renewable fuels with gasoline and diesel. The EPA has proposed a level for biomass-based diesel for 2014 of 1.28 billion gallons under the RFS in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, but has not yet finalized that level. Future demand will be largely dependent upon the capacity available to meet the RFS, and the economic incentives to blend based upon the relative value of traditional diesel versus biomass-based diesel. Any significant increase in production capacity beyond the RFS level could have a negative impact on biodiesel prices. An administrative or court-ordered reduction or waiver of the RFS mandate could also negatively affect biodiesel prices and our future performance.We may be unable to sell some of our transmix-derived diesel fuel in the off-road markets because it may contain sulfur concentrations above levels allowed by EPA regulations.In mid-2006, the EPA promulgated regulations requiring a reduction in the sulfur content of diesel fuel. Using a phased-in approach through 2014, these regulations require that the maximum allowable sulfur content of diesel fuels used in a variety of off-road applications, excluding locomotive and marine uses, be reduced to 15 ppm (referred to as “ultra-low sulfur diesel”). The diesel fuel produced from our transmix operations is sold for use in off-road applications and is subject to these phased-in regulations, except for diesel fuel used in locomotive and marine applications outside of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. Because a portion of our transmix consists of jet fuel, which currently is not subject to EPA regulations limiting its maximum sulfur content, the diesel fuel produced from such transmix may exceed the 15 ppm level. In the event that diesel fuel produced from transmix exceeds the 15 ppm level, we would be prohibited from marketing this fuel for any uses other than locomotive or marine outside of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. If this were to occur, we would have to find new customers for our transmix diesel, find economic means of reducing sulfur levels or stop sourcing higher sulfur transmix that is mixed with jet fuel. Further, changes in emissions regulations for locomotives will likely mean only marine customers will be able to use fuel that exceeds the 15 ppm level at some time between 2015 and 2020. A number of our rail customers have indicated to us that they are planning to accept only diesel fuel with less than 15 ppm as they phase in a new generation of locomotives. There can be no assurance that we would be able to find sufficient marine customers or economic means for reducing sulfur levels without an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or ability to make distributions to our unitholders.Our sales of petroleum products, and any related hedging activities, expose us to potential regulatory risks.The Federal Trade Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission hold statutory authority to regulate conduct in certain physical energy commodities markets and in markets for energy commodities futures, options on futures and swaps that may be relevant to our business. These agencies have imposed broad regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation in the markets over which they have statutory authority. With regard to our physical sales of fuel products, and any related hedging activities, we may be required to observe the market-related regulations enforced by these agencies, which hold substantial enforcement authority. Failure to comply with such regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.31Table of ContentsGovernment action on climate change could result in increased compliance costs for us and our customers.Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of natural gas, are examples of greenhouse gases, or GHGs. At the federal level, regulatory actions are already underway to reduce GHGs from the oil and gas sector, and further administrative actions are likely to continue. While in recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, it presently appears unlikely that comprehensive climate legislation will be passed by either house of Congress in the near future. In addition, almost half of the states have begun to address GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Depending on the particular program, we could be required to control GHG emissions or to purchase and surrender allowances for GHG emissions resulting from our operations.Independent of Congress, the EPA has adopted regulations controlling GHG emissions under its existing authority under the federal Clean Air Act, as amended, or the CAA. In 2009, the EPA officially published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to human health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings by the EPA allow the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. For example, in 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the reporting of GHG emissions in the United States beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010 from specified large GHG emission sources. In 2010, the EPA published a final rule expanding its existing GHG emissions reporting rule for certain petroleum and natural gas facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. The rule requires reporting of GHG emissions by such regulated facilities to the EPA annually. In 2010, the EPA also issued a final rule, known as the “Tailoring Rule,” that makes certain large stationary sources and modification projects subject to permitting requirements for GHG emissions under the CAA.Although it is not currently possible to predict how any such proposed or future GHG legislation or regulation by Congress, the states or multi-state regions will impact our business, any legislation or regulation of GHG emissions that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions or reduced demand for our services, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Mine closures entail substantial costs, and if we close one or more of our mines sooner than anticipated, our results of operations may be adversely affected.We base our assumptions regarding the life of our mines on detailed studies that we perform from time to time, but our studies and assumptions do not always prove to be accurate. If we close any of our mines sooner than expected, sales will decline unless we are able to increase production at any of our other mines, which may not be possible.Applicable statutes and regulations require that mining property be reclaimed following a mine closure in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan. The plan addresses matters such as decommissioning and removal of facilities and equipment, re-grading, prevention of erosion and other forms of water pollution, re-vegetation and post-mining monitoring and land use. We may be required to post a surety bond or other form of financial assurance equal to the cost of reclamation as set forth in the approved reclamation plan. The establishment of the final mine closure reclamation liability is based on permit requirements and requires various estimates and assumptions, principally associated with reclamation costs and production levels. If our accruals for expected reclamation and other costs associated with mine closures for which we will be responsible were later determined to be insufficient, or if we were required to expedite the timing for performance of mine closure activities as compared to estimated timelines, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.Federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and the potential for related regulatory action or litigation could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays for our customers, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.A significant portion of our business supplies frac sand to oil and natural gas industry customers performing hydraulic fracturing activities. Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.The federal Safe Drinking Water Act, or the SDWA, regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control Program, or the UIC Program. Currently, with the exception of certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel, hydraulic fracturing is exempt from federal regulation under the UIC Program, and the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state or local governmental authorities. Although we do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing activities, our oil and natural gas industry customers purchase our frac sand for use in their hydraulic fracturing operations. The EPA has taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel is subject to regulation under the UIC Program, specifically as “Class II” UIC wells and, in 2012, the EPA issued draft guidance for federal SDWA permits issued to oil and natural gas exploration and production operators using diesel during hydraulic fracturing activities. Also in 2012, the EPA published final rules that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. The final rule requires new standards on certain hydraulically-fractured wells constructed or re-fractured after January 1, 2015. At the same 32Table of Contentstime, the EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities and released initial results in December 2012 and a subcommittee of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board (the “SEAB”) of the U.S. Department of Energy was tasked with recommending steps to improve the safety and environmental performance of hydraulic fracturing. As part of these studies, the EPA and the SEAB subcommittee have requested that certain companies provide them with information concerning the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. In other investigatory activities, the EPA has announced plans to propose standards for the treatment and discharge of waste water resulting from hydraulic fracturing in 2015 and the DOI, announced draft proposed rules on May 4, 2012 that, if adopted, would require disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing activities upon federal and Indian lands and also would strengthen standards for well-bore integrity and the management of fluids that return to the surface during and after fracturing operations on federal and Indian lands. The DOI published a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking on May 24, 2013 which replaced the proposed rulemaking issued by the agency in May 2012. These studies and initiatives, depending on their results, could spur proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise. The SEAB subcommittee issued a final report in November 2011 recommending, among other things, measures to improve and protect air and water quality, improvements in communication among state and federal regulators, reduction of diesel fuel in shale gas production, disclosure of fracturing fluid composition and the creation of a publicly accessible database organizing all publicly disclosed information with respect to hydraulic fracturing operations. Congress previously considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. If this or similar legislation becomes law, the legislation could establish an additional level of regulation that may lead to additional permitting requirements or other operating restrictions, making it more difficult to complete natural gas wells in shale formations. This could increase our customers' costs of compliance and doing business or otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services they perform, which may negatively impact demand for our frac sand products.In addition, various state, local and foreign governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permitting requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain areas, such as environmentally sensitive watersheds. For example, many states - including the major oil and gas producing states of North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, and West Virginia - have imposed disclosure requirements on hydraulic fracturing well owners and operators. The availability of public information regarding the constituents of hydraulic fracturing fluids could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate individual or class action legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater and drinking water supplies or otherwise cause harm to human health or the environment. Moreover, disclosure to third parties or to the public, even if inadvertent, of our customers' proprietary chemical formulas could diminish the value of those formulas and result in competitive harm to our customers, which could indirectly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The adoption of new laws or regulations at the federal, state, local or foreign levels imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting or delaying, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete natural gas wells in shale formations, increase our customers' costs of compliance and doing business and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services they perform, which could negatively impact demand for our frac sand products. In addition, heightened political, regulatory and public scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing practices could potentially expose us or our customers to increased legal and regulatory proceedings, and any such proceedings could be time-consuming, costly or result in substantial legal liability or significant reputational harm. Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, whether directly or indirectly. For example, we could be directly by affected adverse litigation involving us, or indirectly affected if the cost of compliance limits the ability of our customers to operate in the geographic areas we serve.We are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, which imposes stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of our operations.Our operations are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended by the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, which imposes stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of mineral extraction and processing operations, including the training of personnel, operating procedures and operating equipment. We are also subject to standards imposed by MSHA and other federal and state agencies relating to workplace exposure to crystalline silica. Our failure to comply with such standards, or changes in such standards or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition or otherwise impose significant restrictions on our ability to conduct mineral extraction and processing operations.We and our customers are subject to other extensive regulations, including licensing, protection of plant and wildlife endangered and threatened species, and reclamation regulation, that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities. In addition, future regulations, or more stringent enforcement of existing regulations, could increase those costs and liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.In addition to the regulatory matters described above, we and our customers are subject to extensive governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife threatened and endangered species protection, jurisdictional wetlands protection, reclamation and restoration activities at mining properties after mining is completed, the 33Table of Contentsdischarge of materials into the environment and the effects that mining and hydraulic fracturing have on groundwater quality and availability. Our future success depends, among other things, on the quantity of our frac sand and other mineral deposits and our ability to extract these deposits profitably, and our customers being able to operate their businesses as they currently do.In order to obtain permits and renewals of permits in the future, we may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the potential adverse impact that any proposed mining and processing activities may have on the environment, individually or in the aggregate, including on public lands. Certain approval procedures may require preparation of archaeological surveys, endangered species studies and other studies to assess the environmental impact of new sites or the expansion of existing sites. Compliance with these regulatory requirements is expensive and significantly lengthens the time needed to develop a site. Finally, obtaining or renewing required permits is sometimes delayed or prevented due to community opposition and other factors beyond our control. The denial of a permit essential to our operations or the imposition of conditions with which it is not practicable or feasible to comply could impair or prevent our ability to develop or expand a site. Significant opposition to a permit by neighboring property owners, members of the public or non-governmental organizations, or other third parties or delay in the environmental review and permitting process also could impair or delay our ability to develop or expand a site. New legal requirements, including those related to the protection of the environment, could be adopted that could materially adversely affect our mining operations (including our ability to extract or the pace of extraction of mineral deposits), our cost structure or our customers' ability to use our frac sand products. Such current or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and we may not be able to obtain or renew permits in the future.Terrorist attacks, the threat of terrorist attacks, hostilities in the Middle East, or other sustained military campaigns may adversely impact our results of operations.The long-term impact of terrorist attacks, such as the attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, and the magnitude of the threat of future terrorist attacks on the energy industry in general and on us in particular are not known at this time. Uncertainty surrounding hostilities in the Middle East or other sustained military campaigns may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of markets for frac sand and refined products and the possibility that infrastructure facilities and pipelines could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror. Changes in the insurance markets attributable to terrorist attacks may make certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain. Moreover, the insurance that may be available to us may be significantly more expensive than our existing insurance coverage. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war could also affect our ability to raise capital.Risks Inherent in an Investment in UsHolders of our common units have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our general partner or its directors.Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management's decisions regarding our business. Unitholders have no right on an annual or ongoing basis to elect our general partner or its board of directors. Insight Equity is the majority owner of our general partner and has the right to appoint our general partner's entire board of directors, including our independent directors. If the unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner, they have little ability to remove our general partner. As a result of these limitations, the price at which the common units trade may be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. Our partnership agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as well as other provisions limiting the unitholders' ability to influence the manner or direction of management.Insight Equity owns the majority of and controls our general partner, which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations. Our general partner and its affiliates, including Insight Equity, have conflicts of interest with us and limited duties, and they may favor their own interests to the detriment of us and our common unitholders.Insight Equity owns the majority of and controls our general partner and appoints all of the officers and directors of our general partner, some of whom are officers and directors of Insight Equity. Although our general partner has a duty to manage us in a manner that is beneficial to us and our unitholders, the directors and officers of our general partner have a fiduciary duty to manage our general partner in a manner that is beneficial to its owners. Conflicts of interest may arise between Insight Equity and our general partner, on the one hand, and us and our unitholders, on the other hand. In resolving these conflicts of interest, our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of Insight Equity and the other owners of our general partner over our interests and the interests of our common unitholders. These conflicts include the following situations, among others:•neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires Insight Equity to pursue a business strategy that favors us or utilizes our assets or dictates what markets to pursue or grow;•our general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us, such as Insight Equity, in resolving conflicts of interest;34Table of Contents•our partnership agreement replaces the fiduciary duties that would otherwise be owed by our general partner with contractual standards governing its duties, limits our general partner's liabilities and restricts the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that, without these limitations, might constitute breaches of its fiduciary duty;•our partnership agreement provides that whenever our general partner makes a determination or takes, or declines to take, any other action in its capacity as our general partner, our general partner is required to make such determination, or take or decline to take such other action, in good faith, meaning that it subjectively believed that the decision was in the best interests of our partnership, and, except as specifically provided by our partnership agreement, will not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by our partnership agreement, Delaware law, or any other law, rule or regulation, or at equity;•except in limited circumstances, our general partner has the power and authority to conduct our business without unitholder approval;•our general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, capital expenditures, borrowings, issuances of additional partnership securities and the creation, reduction or increase of reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders;•our general partner determines which of the costs it incurs on our behalf are reimbursable by us;•our partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered to us or from entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf;•our general partner intends to limit its liability regarding our obligations;•our general partner may exercise its right to call and purchase all of the common units not owned by it and its affiliates if they own more than 80% of the common units;•our general partner controls the enforcement of its and its affiliates' obligations to us; and•our general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us.Our general partner limits its liability regarding our obligations.Our general partner limits its liability under contractual arrangements so that the counterparties to such arrangements have recourse only against our assets, and not against our general partner or its assets. Our general partner may therefore cause us to incur indebtedness or other obligations that are nonrecourse to our general partner. Our partnership agreement provides that any action taken by our general partner to limit its liability is not a breach of our general partner's duties, even if we could have obtained more favorable terms without the limitation on liability. In addition, we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify our general partner to the extent that it incurs obligations on our behalf. Any such reimbursement or indemnification payments would reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders.Our partnership agreement replaces our general partner's fiduciary duties to holders of our common units with contractual standards governing its duties.Our partnership agreement contains provisions that eliminate the fiduciary standards to which our general partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law and replace those duties with several different contractual standards. For example, our partnership agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner, free of any duties to us and our unitholders other than the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which means that a court will enforce the reasonable expectations of the partners where the language in the partnership agreement does not provide for a clear course of action. This provision entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires and relieves it of any duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or our limited partners. Examples of decisions that our general partner may make in its individual capacity include:•how to allocate business opportunities among us and its affiliates;•whether to exercise its limited call right;•whether to seek approval of the resolution of a conflict of interest by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner;•how to exercise its voting rights with respect to the units it owns; and•whether or not to consent to any merger or consolidation of the partnership or amendment to the partnership agreement.Our common unitholders have agreed to become bound by the provisions in the partnership agreement, including the provisions discussed above.35Table of ContentsOur partnership agreement restricts the remedies available to holders of our common units for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.Our partnership agreement contains provisions that restrict the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty under state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement:•provides that whenever our general partner makes a determination or takes, or declines to take, any other action in its capacity as our general partner, our general partner is required to make such determination, or take or decline to take such other action, in good faith, meaning it subjectively believed that the decision was in the best interest of our partnership, and except as specifically provided by our partnership agreement, will not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by our partnership agreement, Delaware law, or any other law, rule or regulation, or at equity;•provides that our general partner will not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as a general partner so long as such decisions are made in good faith;•provides that our general partner and its officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us, our limited partners or their assignees resulting from any act or omission unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that our general partner or its officers and directors, as the case may be, acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the conduct was unlawful; and•provides that our general partner will not be in breach of its obligations under our partnership agreement (including any duties to us or our unitholders) if a transaction with an affiliate or the resolution of a conflict of interest is:•approved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner, although our general partner is not obligated to seek such approval;•approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding common units, excluding any common units owned by our general partner or any of its affiliates;•determined by the board of directors of our general partner to be on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties; or•determined by the board of directors of our general partner to be “fair and reasonable” to us, taking into account the totality of the relationships among the parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to us.In connection with a situation involving a transaction with an affiliate or a conflict of interest, any determination by our general partner must be made in good faith. If an affiliate transaction or the resolution of a conflict of interest is not approved by our common unitholders or the conflicts committee and the board of directors of our general partner determines that the resolution or course of action taken with respect to the affiliate transaction or conflict of interest satisfies either of the standards set forth in bullets three and four above, then it will be presumed that, in making its decision, the board of directors acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner or the partnership, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption. In this context, members of the board of directors of our general partner will be conclusively deemed to have acted in good faith if it subjectively believed that either of the standards set forth in bullets three and four above was satisfied.Our partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning 20% or more of our common units.Unitholders' voting rights are further restricted by a provision of our partnership agreement providing that any units held by a person that owns 20% or more of any class of units then outstanding, other than our general partner, its affiliates, their direct transferees and their indirect transferees approved by our general partner (which approval may be granted in its sole discretion) and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of our general partner, cannot vote on any matter.Our general partner interest or the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.Our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of the unitholders. Furthermore, our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of Insight Equity to transfer all or a portion of its ownership interest in our general partner to a third party. The new owner of our general partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of our general partner with its own designees and thereby exert significant control over the decisions made by the board of directors and officers.36Table of ContentsAn increase in interest rates may cause the market price of our common units to decline.Like all equity investments, an investment in our common units is subject to certain risks. In exchange for accepting these risks, investors may expect to receive a higher rate of return than would otherwise be obtainable from lower-risk investments. Accordingly, as interest rates rise, the ability of investors to obtain higher risk-adjusted rates of return by purchasing government-backed debt securities may cause a corresponding decline in demand for riskier investments generally, including yield-based equity investments such as publicly traded partnership interests. Reduced demand for our common units resulting from investors seeking other more favorable investment opportunities may cause the trading price of our common units to decline.We may issue additional units without your approval, which would dilute your existing ownership interests.Our partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional limited partner interests that we may issue at any time without the approval of our unitholders. The issuance by us of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:•our existing unitholders' proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;•the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease;•the ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase;•the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and•the market price of the common units may decline.Our general partner has a call right that may require you to sell your units at an undesirable time or price.If at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than 80% of the common units, our general partner will have the right, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, but not the obligation, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price that is not less than their then-current market price, as calculated pursuant to the terms of our partnership agreement. As a result, you may be required to sell your common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return or a negative return on your investment. You may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of your units.Your liability may not be limited if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of our business.A general partner of a partnership generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership, except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner. Our partnership is organized under Delaware law, and we conduct business in a number of other states. The limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some of the other states in which we do business. You could be liable for any and all of our obligations as if you were a general partner if a court or government agency were to determine that:•we were conducting business in a state but had not complied with that particular state's partnership statute; or•your right to act with other unitholders to remove or replace our general partner, to approve some amendments to our partnership agreement or to take other actions under our partnership agreement constitute “control” of our business.Unitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them.Under certain circumstances, unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, we may not make a distribution to you if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets. Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of an impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount. Substituted limited partners are liable both for the obligations of the assignor to make contributions to the partnership that were known to the substituted limited partner at the time it became a limited partner and for those obligations that were unknown if the liabilities could have been determined from the partnership agreement. Neither liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interest nor liabilities that are non-recourse to the partnership are counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted.The New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, does not require a publicly traded partnership like us to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements.Because we are a publicly traded partnership, the NYSE does not require us to have a majority of independent directors on our general partner's board of directors or to establish a compensation committee or a nominating and corporate governance committee. Accordingly, unitholders do not have the same protections afforded to certain corporations that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.37Table of ContentsWe have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. These material weaknesses are attributable, in part, to the rapid growth and expanding complexity of our Sand segment. If one or more material weakness persists or if we fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately report our financial results could be adversely affected.In connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. These material weaknesses relate to our inability to effectively perform, complete, document and track various information technology general control activities and our inability to effectively perform and document certain daily recurring activity controls in our Sand segment. Both material weaknesses stem, in part, from our inability to staff, train and monitor a sufficient number of accounting and technology personnel in response to the rapid growth of sales volume and operational complexity in our Sand segment. We are in the process of dedicating resources and effort to remediate these material weaknesses and improve our internal control in these areas. Our remediation plan includes (i) performing an administrative headcount and competency gap analysis to determine the appropriate level of staffing, (ii) hiring qualified accounting, monitoring and information technology staff, (iii) incorporating training of information technology and accounting personnel where appropriate to improve competencies and understanding of our policies and (iv) increasing managerial monitoring activities over remediation efforts in areas of particular weakness. However, there can be no assurance that we will remediate these material weaknesses or avoid future weaknesses or deficiencies. Any failure to remediate these material weaknesses and any future weaknesses or deficiencies or any failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. If our management were to conclude in future reports that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common units could be impacted. Failure to comply with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, FINRA or other regulatory authorities, as well as increasing the risk of liability arising from litigation based on securities law.If we fail to develop or maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential unitholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our units.Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We cannot be certain that our efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls will be successful, that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or that we will be able to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Any failure to develop or maintain effective internal controls, or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving our internal controls, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our units.Tax Risks to Common UnitholdersOur tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, which would subject us to entity-level taxation, then our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced.The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in the common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Despite the fact that we are a limited partnership under Delaware law, it is possible in certain circumstances for a partnership such as ours to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. Although we do not believe based upon our current operations that we will be so treated, a change in our business or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity.If we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 35%, and would likely pay state and local income tax at varying rates. Distributions would generally be taxed again as corporate dividends (to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits), and no income, gains, losses, deductions, or credits would flow through to you. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to you would be substantially reduced. Therefore, if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, there would be a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to our unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units.38Table of ContentsIf we were subjected to a material amount of additional entity-level taxation by individual states, it would reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders.Changes in current state law may subject us to additional entity-level taxation by individual states. Because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons, several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation. Imposition of any such taxes may substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to you and, therefore, negatively impact the value of and investment in our common units.The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.The present federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial interpretation at any time. For example, from time to time, members of the U.S. Congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships, including the elimination of the qualifying income exception upon which we rely for our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Any modification to the federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be retroactively applied and could make it more difficult or impossible to meet the exception for us to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will ultimately be enacted. However, it is possible that a change in law could affect us, and any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units.Our unitholders' share of our income is taxable to them for federal income tax purposes even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us.Because a unitholder is treated as a partner to whom we allocate taxable income which could be different in amount than the cash we distribute, a unitholder's allocable share of our taxable income is taxable to it, which may require the payment of federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes, on its share of our taxable income even if it receives no cash distributions from us. Our unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income.If the IRS contests the federal income tax positions we take, the market for our common units may be adversely impacted and the cost of any IRS contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders.The IRS has made no determination with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or any other matter affecting us. The IRS may adopt positions that differ from the positions we take, and the IRS's positions may ultimately be sustained. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take and such positions may not ultimately be sustained. A court may not agree with some or all the positions we take. Any contest with the IRS, and the outcome of any IRS contest, may have a materially adverse impact on the market for our common units and the price at which they trade. In addition, our costs of any contest with the IRS will be borne indirectly by our unitholders because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution.We have a subsidiary that is treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes and subject to corporate-level income taxes.Even though we (as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) are not subject to federal income tax, some of our operations are currently conducted through a subsidiary that is organized as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. The taxable income, if any, of a subsidiary that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is subject to corporate-level federal income taxes, which may reduce the cash available for distribution to us and, in turn, to our unitholders. If the IRS or other state or local jurisdictions were to successfully assert that this corporation has more tax liability than we anticipate or legislation was enacted that increased the corporate tax rate, the cash available for distribution could be further reduced. The income tax return filings positions taken by this corporate subsidiary require significant judgment, use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. Despite our belief that the income tax return positions taken by this subsidiary are fully supportable, certain positions may be successfully challenged by the IRS, state or local jurisdictions.Tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected.If you sell your common units, you will recognize a gain or loss for federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the amount realized and your tax basis in those common units. Because distributions in excess of your allocable share of our net taxable income decrease your tax basis in your common units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the common units you sell will, in effect, become taxable income to you if you sell such common units at a price greater than your tax basis in those common units, even if the price you receive is less than your original cost. Furthermore, a substantial 39Table of Contentsportion of the amount realized on any sale of your common units, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items, including depreciation and depletion recapture. In addition, because the amount realized includes a unitholder's share of our nonrecourse liabilities, if you sell your common units, you may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash you receive from the sale.Tax-exempt entities and non-U.S. persons face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.Investment in common units by tax-exempt entities, such as employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts (known as IRAs), and non-U.S. persons raises issues unique to them. For example, virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax, including IRAs and other retirement plans, is unrelated business taxable income and is taxable to them.Distributions to non-U.S. persons are reduced by withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate, and non-U.S. persons are required to file federal income tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income. If you are a tax-exempt entity or a non-U.S. person, you should consult a tax advisor before investing in our common units.We treat each purchaser of common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units.Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units and because of other reasons, we have adopted depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing Treasury Regulations. A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to you. It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain or loss from your sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to your tax returns.We prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction for federal income tax purposes between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.We prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction for federal income tax purposes between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing Treasury Regulations. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued proposed regulations that provide a safe harbor pursuant to which publicly traded partnerships may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among transferor and transferee unitholders. Nonetheless, the proposed regulations do not specifically authorize the use of the proration method we have adopted. If the IRS were to challenge this method or new Treasury Regulations were issued, we may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.A unitholder whose common units are loaned to a “short seller” to effect a short sale of common units may be considered as having disposed of those common units. If so, he would no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition.Because a unitholder whose common units are loaned to a “short seller” to effect a short sale of common units may be considered as having disposed of the loaned common units, he may no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan to the short seller, any of our income, gain, loss or deductions with respect to those common units may not be reportable by the unitholder, and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those common units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Our unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to consult a tax advisor to discuss whether it is advisable to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from loaning their common units.The sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profits interests during any twelve-month period will result in the termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes.We will be considered to have technically terminated our partnership for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a twelve-month period. For purposes of determining whether the 50% threshold has been met, multiple sales of the same interest will be counted only once. Our technical termination would, among other things, result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders, which would result in us filing two tax returns (and our unitholders could receive two Schedules K-1 if relief was not available, as described below) for one fiscal year and could result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income. In the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a fiscal year ending December 31, the closing of our taxable year may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being includable in his taxable income for the year of termination. Our termination currently 40Table of Contentswould not affect our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, but instead we would be treated as a new partnership for tax purposes. If treated as a new partnership, we must make new tax elections and could be subject to penalties if we are unable to determine that a termination occurred. The IRS has announced a publicly traded partnership technical termination relief program whereby, if a publicly traded partnership that technically terminated requests publicly traded partnership technical termination relief and such relief is granted by the IRS, among other things, the partnership will only have to provide one Schedule K-1 to unitholders for the year in which the termination occurs, notwithstanding two partnership tax years.We may become a resident of Canada and be required to pay tax in Canada on our worldwide income, which could reduce our earnings, and unitholders could then become taxable in Canada in respect of their ownership of our common units.Under the Income Tax Act (Canada), or the Canadian Tax Act, a company that is resident in Canada is subject to tax in Canada on its worldwide income, and unitholders of a company resident in Canada may be subject to Canadian capital gains tax on a disposition of its units and to Canadian withholding tax on dividends paid in respect of such units.Under Canadian law, our place of residence would generally be determined based on the location where our central management and control is exercised. Although our central management and control is currently exercised in the United States and we intend to continue to conduct our affairs and operate in such a manner, if we were nonetheless to be considered a Canadian resident for purposes of the Canadian Tax Act, our worldwide income would become subject to Canadian income tax under the Canadian Tax Act. Further, unitholders who are non-residents of Canada may become subject under the Canadian Tax Act to tax in Canada on any gains realized on the disposition of our units and would become subject to Canadian withholding tax on dividends paid or deemed to be paid by us, subject to any relief that may be available under a tax treaty or convention.As a result of investing in our common units, you may become subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in jurisdictions where we operate or own or acquire properties.In addition to federal income taxes, our unitholders could be subject to other taxes, including state and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or control property now or in the future, even if they do not live in any of those jurisdictions. Our unitholders will likely be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions. Further, our unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. We currently own property or conduct business in many states, most of which impose an income tax on individuals, corporations and other entities. As we make acquisitions or expand our business, we may control assets or conduct business in additional states that impose a personal income tax. It is your responsibility to file all federal, state and local tax returns. Please consult your tax advisor.41Table of ContentsITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.
