ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business faces many risks. Some of the more significant risks that we face are described below. There may be additional risks that we do not currently perceive to be significant or that we are not currently aware of that may also impact our business. Each of the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or equity. In addition, ownership of our common stock may be subject to risks associated with the liquidity of the investment. Approximately 63% of our common stock is owned by affiliates of CNAF. This concentration of ownership may reduce the number of market participants willing to purchase our stock and limit the ability of a minority owner to liquidate their position. WE MAY DETERMINE THAT OUR LOSS RESERVES ARE INSUFFICIENT TO COVER OUR ESTIMATED ULTIMATE UNPAID LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS AND WE MAY NEED TO INCREASE THEM. We maintain loss reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses for reported and unreported claims. Reserves represent our best estimate at a given accounting date. Loss reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates derived by us, generally utilizing a variety of reserve estimation techniques from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, many of which are highly uncertain, such as estimates of claims severity, frequency of claims, inflation, claims handling, case reserving policies and procedures, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement. Many of these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable and require significant judgment on our part. In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels, we review and change our reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled. If estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against our earnings for the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. SURETY LOSSES AND OUR RESULTS CAN BE VOLATILE. In the past, our results have been adversely impacted by a relatively small number of large claims. In addition, our results have been significantly impacted by increases in corporate default rates. These past occurrences illustrate that our loss experience and results can be volatile. WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF EXPOSURE TO CONSTRUCTION FIRMS. A significant portion of our business is guaranteeing the performance of construction firms. Therefore, we are exposed to the challenges that the construction industry faces. Over the recent past, the construction industry has enjoyed very strong demand for its services. However, if the construction economy encounters difficulties, we may experience a higher frequency of claims and higher losses. OUR PREMIUM WRITINGS AND PROFITABILITY ARE IMPACTED BY THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE AND OUR REINSURANCE PURCHASING DECISIONS. Reinsurance coverage is an important component of our capital structure. Reinsurance allows us to meet certain regulatory restrictions that would otherwise limit the size of bonds that we write and limit the market segments in which we could compete. In addition, reinsurance reduces the potential volatility of earnings and protects our capital by limiting the amount of loss associated with any one bond principal. We have experienced periods where it was difficult for us to buy as much reinsurance as we desired and when reinsurance costs have risen substantially. The availability and cost of reinsurance protection depends on a number of factors such as our loss 12 experience, the surety industry's loss experience, the number of reinsurers willing to provide coverage, and broader economic conditions. If sufficient reinsurance is not available or is too costly or if we purchase insufficient reinsurance, we may need to reduce our premium writings and may be susceptible to higher losses. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT AMOUNTS OWED TO US BY REINSURERS. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are reported as receivables in our balance sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. The ceding of insurance does not, however, discharge our primary liability for claims. As a result, we are subject to credit risk relating to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. It is possible that future financial deterioration of our reinsurers could result in certain balances becoming uncollectible. WE RELY UPON AFFILIATED COMPANIES THAT WE DO NOT CONTROL TO CONDUCT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS. Due to regulatory restrictions that limit the size of the bonds that our insurance subsidiaries can write, we utilize the capacity of affiliated companies to service some parts of our business. If this capacity is no longer available to us, or no longer satisfies the regulatory requirements, we may need to stop servicing parts of our business. RATING AGENCIES MAY DOWNGRADE THEIR RATINGS FOR US OR FOR AFFILIATED COMPANIES THAT WE RELY ON TO WRITE BUSINESS. THIS WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO WRITE BUSINESS. Our customers often refer to the financial strength ratings assigned by A.M. Best, S&P and other similar companies when they are choosing a surety company. Because we use the underwriting capacity of CCC, an affiliate, to serve larger accounts, our financial strength ratings, as well as those of CCC, factor into customers' decisions. After reporting a significant net loss in the third quarter of 2003, our A.M. Best rating was lowered from A+ to A with a negative outlook. CCC also reported a significant net loss in the third quarter of 2003, but A.M. Best affirmed CCC's rating of A with a negative outlook. In the second quarter of 2005, our outlook was raised from negative to stable. However, if our ratings or CCC's ratings are downgraded, we may experience a significant reduction in premium writings. WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION. All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and we must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve our products and services. Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength. Although we seek pricing that will result in what we believe are adequate returns on the capital allocated to our business, we may lose business to competitors offering competitive products at lower prices. We compete with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors and customers. We also compete against providers of substitute products such as letters of credit in certain markets. DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS CREATED BY LAWS THAT COULD BE CHANGED. We believe that the vast majority of the demand for our products results from federal, state and local laws that mandate the use of surety bonds. If these laws are loosened or eliminated, our business would be severely impacted. WE ARE SUBJECT TO CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS AND, IF WE DO NOT MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS, REGULATORY AGENCIES MAY RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT US FROM OPERATING OUR BUSINESS. Insurance companies are subject to risk-based capital standards set by state regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention. These standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of our statutory capital and surplus reported in our statutory financial statements. Current rules require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the risk-based capital formula. If we do not meet these minimum requirements, state regulators may restrict or prohibit us from operating our business. 13 OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, UPON WHOM WE DEPEND FOR DIVIDENDS AND ADVANCES IN ORDER TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, ARE LIMITED BY STATE REGULATORS IN THEIR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS. We are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends, advances, loans and other sources of cash from our subsidiaries in order to meet our obligations. Dividend payments, however, must be approved by the subsidiaries' domiciliary state departments of insurance and are generally limited to amounts determined by formula which varies by state. If we are restricted, by regulatory rule or otherwise, from paying or receiving inter-company dividends, we may not be able to fund our working capital needs and debt service requirements from available cash. As a result, we would need to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all. SOME OF THE CREDIT EXTENDED TO US REQUIRES ONGOING COMPLIANCE WITH CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS REGARDING OUR PROFITABILITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. We borrow money from banks under a credit facility that requires that we meet certain tests of profitability and financial condition. If we do not meet these tests, we may be required to repay outstanding borrowings. If we are capable of repaying the borrowings, we may experience a reduction in capital strength that may hamper our ability to conduct business. If we are not capable of repaying the borrowings, we would need to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all. OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY SUFFER REDUCED RETURNS OR LOSSES. Investment returns are an important part of our overall profitability. General economic conditions, fluctuations in interest rates, and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the returns and the overall value of our investment portfolio and our ability to control the timing of the realization of investment income. In addition, any defaults in the payments due to us for our investments, especially with respect to liquid corporate and municipal bonds, could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or could cause us to incur investment losses. As a result of these factors, we may not realize an adequate return on our investments, may incur losses on sales of our investments and may be required to write down the value of our investments. WE RELY ON OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. Our business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems. We rely on these systems to process new and renewal business, provide customer service, make claims payments and facilitate collections and cancellations, as well as to perform actuarial and other analytical functions necessary for pricing and product development.
