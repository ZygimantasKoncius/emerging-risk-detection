Risk Factors potential consumer liability. In addition, although Italian law already requires strict limits in relation to transmission equipment, these concerns may cause regulators to impose greater restrictions on the construction of base station towers or other infrastructure, which may hinder the completion of network build-outs and the commercial availability of new services and may require additional investments. Fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates may adversely affect our results. In the past, we have made substantial international investments, primarily in U.S. dollars, and have significantly expanded our operations outside of the Euro zone, particularly in Latin America. We generally hedge our foreign exchange exposure, but do not cover translation risk relating to our foreign subsidiaries. Movements in exchange rates of the Euro relative to other currencies (in particular Brazilian Real) may adversely affect consolidated results. A rise in the value of the Euro relative to other currencies in certain countries in which we operate or have made investments will reduce the relative value of the revenues or assets of our operations in those countries and, therefore, may adversely affect our operating results or financial position. In addition, we have raised, and may raise in an increasing proportion in the future, financing in currencies other than the Euro, principally the U.S. dollar and British Pound. We systematically hedge the foreign currency risk exposure relating to non-Euro denominated liabilities, through cross-currency and interest rate swaps. Furthermore, we enter into derivative transactions to hedge our interest exposure and to diversify debt parameters in order to reduce debt cost and volatility within predefined target boundaries. However, no assurance can be given that fluctuations in interest rates will not adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows. 12 Table of Contents Item 3. Key Information Exchange Rates 3.2 EXCHANGE RATES We publish our consolidated financial statements in euros. References to , euro and Euro are to the euro, the single unified currency that was introduced in Italy and 10 other member states of the EU on January 1, 1999. References to U.S. dollars, dollars, U.S.$ or $ are to U.S. dollars, the currency of the United States of America. For convenience only (except where noted otherwise), certain euro figures have been translated into dollars at the rate (the Euro/Dollar Exchange Rate) of 1.00= U.S.$ 1.3197, using the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers in foreign currencies as announced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for customs purposes (the Noon Buying Rate) on December 29, 2006. These translations should not be construed as a representation that the euro amounts actually represent such dollar amounts or have been or could be converted into dollars at the rate indicated. For the purpose of this Annual Report, billion means a thousand million.

The Ordinary Shares, par value 0.55 (the Ordinary Shares) and Savings Shares, par value 0.55 (the Savings Shares) of Telecom Italia trade on Mercato Telematico Azionario (Telematico), managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. (Borsa Italiana) in euro. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the U.S. dollar will affect the U.S. dollar equivalent of the euro price of the Ordinary Shares and the Savings Shares and the price of the Ordinary Share American Depositary Shares (Ordinary Share ADSs) and the Savings Share American Depositary Shares (Savings Share ADSs), on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Cash dividends are paid in euro (Olivetti paid no dividend in 2002). Exchange rate fluctuations will affect the U.S. dollar amounts received by owners of Ordinary Share ADSs and Savings Share ADSs upon conversion by the Depositary of cash dividends paid in euro on the underlying Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares. See Item 10. Additional Information10.5 Description of American Depositary Receipts. On completion of the Merger, Telecom Italia (formerly Olivetti) became a successor registrant to Old Telecom Italia under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act) and, therefore, became subject to and continues to file periodic reports under the 1934 Act required for a foreign private issuer. Telecom Italia (formerly Olivetti) obtained a listing of the Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares issued at completion of the Merger, on the NYSE where such Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares trade in the form of ADSs. 13 Table of Contents Item 3.

(2) For the purposes of IFRS, Parent, as used in this annual report, means Telecom Italia S.p.A.. (3) The average number of employees in the Group (excluding employees relating to the consolidated companies considered as discontinued operations/assets held for sale and including personnel with temp work contracts) was 79,993, 79,869 and 79,602 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (4) In accordance with IAS 33 Earnings per share, basic earnings per Ordinary Share is calculated by dividing the Groups net income available to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year, excluding treasury shares. Since Telecom Italia has both Ordinary and Savings Shares outstanding, the calculations also take into account the requirement that holders of Savings Shares are entitled to an additional dividend equal to 2% of the par value of shares above dividends paid on the Ordinary Shares. For the purpose of these calculations, the weighted average number of: · Ordinary Shares was 13,254,860,233 for the year ended December 31, 2006, 12,283,195,845 for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 10,208,327,613 for the year ended December 31, 2004; · Savings Shares was 6,026,120,661 for the year ended December 31, 2006, 5,930,204,164 for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 5,795,921,069 for the year ended December 31, 2004. 18 Table of Contents Item 3. Key Information Selected Financial And Statistical Information For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of shares outstanding is adjusted assuming conversion of all dilutive potential shares. Potential shares are those securities that, if converted into shares, would increase the total number of shares outstanding and reduce the earnings attributable to each share. Potential shares include options, warrants and convertible securities. The Groups net income is also adjusted to reflect the impact of the conversion of potential shares net of the related tax effects. (5) Telecom Italias dividend coupons for the year ended December 31, 2006, were clipped on April 23, 2007 and were payable from April 26, 2007. (6) Share capital represents share capital issued net of the par value of treasury shares. (7) Net Financial Debt is a Non-GAAP Financial Measure as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K under the 1934 Act. For further details please see Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects5.5 Results of Operations for the Three Years Ended December 31, 20065.5.2 Non-GAAP Financial Measures. (8) Refers only to Net income (loss) attributable to equity holders of the Parent. (9) In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Net income (loss) per Ordinary Share has been calculated using the two class method, since the Company has both Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares outstanding. Under this method, set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings per Share, basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. For the purpose of these calculations, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares was 13,254,860,233 and 6,026,120,661 for the year ended December 31, 2006, 12,283,195,845 and 5,930,204,164 for the year ended December 31, 2005, 10,208,327,613 and 5,795,921,069 for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 6,620,513,494 and 2,414,967,112 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The weighted average number of Ordinary Shares was 4,054,375,543 for the year ended December 31, 2002. The calculations take into account the requirement that holders of Savings Shares are entitled to an additional dividend equal to 2% of the par value of Savings Shares in addition to dividends paid on the Ordinary Shares. The calculations also take into account that in 2002 (after the redenomination of the share capital into Euro following the resolution taken by the Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting held on July 4, 2000) the par value of Ordinary Shares was 1 per share, and that in 2003, after the Merger, the par value of Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares was reduced to 0.55 per share. For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of shares outstanding is increased to include any potential common shares and is adjusted for any changes to income that would result from the assumed conversion of those potential common shares. (10) Equity under U.S. GAAP refers only to Equity attributable to equity holders of the Parent. (11) Includes Minority Interests. (12) Data exclude internal lines. (13) Number of contracts; data include Teleconomy, Hellò and other Business voice offers. (14) Number of contracts. 19 Table of Contents Item 3. Key Information Dividends 3.4 DIVIDENDS The determination of our future dividend policy, and the amounts thereof, will depend upon a number of factors, including but not limited to our earnings, financial condition and cash requirements, prospects and such other factors as may be deemed relevant at the time. Subject to the foregoing, we plan to pay dividends over the period 2007-2009 closer to the dividend policy of other European telecommunications operators. Dividends declared by Old Telecom Italia. The following table sets forth the dividends per Ordinary Share and per Savings Share declared by Old Telecom Italia with respect to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 and the aggregate dividend paid in such year.

(2) Approved at the Annual Shareholders Meeting held on April 16, 2007. Pursuant to Italian Stock Exchange rules, dividends on the Ordinary Shares and the Savings Shares are payable from the fourth trading day after the third Friday of each month, and in any case, at least four business days after the Annual Meeting of Shareholders approving the dividends. Telecom Italias dividend coupons for the year ended December 31, 2006 were clipped on April 23, 2007, and were payable from April 26, 2007. Payment of annual dividends is subject to approval by the holders of Ordinary Shares at the annual general shareholders meeting, which must be convened within 120 days after the end of the financial year to which it relates or, in case specific reasons arise, within 180 days, and the reasons for the delay to be described in the annual report. In addition, Article 21 of the Companys Bylaws gives the Board of Directors the power to approve the distribution of interim dividends. Pursuant to Italian law, the distribution may be approved after the final approval of the preceding years financial statements, and the interim dividends may not exceed the lower of (i) the difference between profits from the preceding fiscal year and amounts required to be attributed to legal and statutory reserves and (ii) available reserves. Once paid in compliance with applicable laws, shareholders cannot be required to repay interim dividends to the Company if the shareholders collected such dividends in good faith. Dividends not collected within five years from the date they become payable will be forfeited in favor of the Company. If profits are not fully distributed, additional reserves are created. According to the Italian Civil Code, before dividends may be paid with respect to any year, an amount equal to 5% of the net income of the Company for such year must be set aside to the legal reserve until the legal reserve, including amounts set aside during prior years, is at least equal to one-fifth of the par value of the Companys 20 Table of Contents Item 3. Key Information Dividends issued share capital. This legal reserve is not available for payment of dividends. Such restriction on the payment of dividends applies, on a non-consolidated basis, to each Italian subsidiary of the Telecom Italia Group. The Company may also pay dividends out of available retained earnings from prior years or other reserves. Dividends in respect of Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares held with Monte Titoli S.p.A. (Monte Titoli) are automatically credited to the accounts of the beneficial owners with the relevant participant of Monte Titoli, without the need for presentation by such beneficial owners of any documentation. See Item 10. Additional Information10.4 Description of Capital Stock. Arrangements between Euroclear or Clearstream and Monte Titoli permit the shareholders to collect the dividends through Euroclear or Clearstream. Holders of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are entitled to receive payments in respect of dividends on the underlying Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares, as the case may be, in accordance with the relevant Deposit Agreement. Dividends payable on the Companys Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares may be subject to deduction of Italian withholding tax. See Item 10. Additional Information10.6 Taxation. Italian regulations do not contain any specific restrictions on the payment of dividends to non-residents of Italy. See Item 10. Additional Information10.2 Exchange Controls and Other Limitations Affecting Security Holders. Pursuant to Italian law, in connection with the payment of dividends, participants of Monte Titoli are required to supply to the Italian tax authorities certain information concerning the identity of non-resident shareholders holding Ordinary Shares or Savings Shares. Shareholders are required to provide their Italian tax identification number, if any, or alternatively, in the case of legal entities, their name, country of establishment and address, or in the case of individuals, their name, address and place and date of birth, or in the case of partnerships, the information required for legal entities and the information required for individuals with respect to one of their representatives. In the case of Ordinary Share ADSs and Savings Share ADSs owned by non-residents of Italy, Telecom Italia understands that the provision of information concerning the Depositary, in its capacity as holder of record of the Ordinary Shares and Savings Shares, as the case may be, will satisfy these requirements. The Depositary, in accordance with Telecom Italia, will provide information to beneficial owners of Ordinary Share ADSs and Savings Share ADSs, that are considered U.S. residents for purposes of applicable law, to the extent such owners wish to benefit from reduced withholding tax rates on dividends under an income tax convention, and claims for such benefits therefore must be accompanied by the required information. See Item 10. Additional Information10.6 Taxation. 21 Table of Contents
