ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. We encourage you to carefully consider all such risk factors when making investment decisions regarding our company. If any such risks, or any other risks that we do not currently consider to be material, or which are not known to us, materialize, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Fluctuations in our operating results may cause our stock price to decline. Given the nature of the markets in which we participate, it is difficult to reliably predict future revenues and profitability. Changes in competitive, market and economic conditions may cause us to adjust our operations. A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our significant sales, research and development and manufacturing costs. Thus, small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results. Factors that may affect our operating results and/or the market price of our Common Stock include, but are not limited to: demand for and market acceptance of our products; competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices; adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business; 20 Table of Contents low or fluctuating levels of political stability in regions in which we do business; adverse changes in industries, such as semiconductors and electronics, on which we are particularly dependent; changes in the portions of our revenue represented by various products and customers; delays or problems in the introduction of new products; announcements or introductions of new products, services or technological innovations by our competitors; variations in our product mix; timing and amount of our expenditures in anticipation of future sales; availability of equity and credit markets to provide our customers with funding to make equipment purchases; public guidance that we provide regarding future financial results based on facts, judgments and assumptions made at the time of the publication of the guidance, all of which may change after the publication of the guidance; exchange rate fluctuations; increased costs of raw materials or supplies; changes in the volume or timing of product orders; timing of completion of acceptance testing of some of our products; changes in regulatory requirements; natural disasters; and changes in general economic factors. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our profitability. Our international sales and our operations in foreign countries expose us to risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates. Gains and losses on the conversion of accounts receivable, accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities to U.S. dollars may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations. In addition, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We face aggressive competition in each of our operating divisions. If we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed. We encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in each of our divisions. In the security and inspection and patient monitoring, diagnostic cardiology and anesthesia systems markets, competition is based primarily on such factors as product performance, functionality and quality, cost, prior customer relationships, technological capabilities of the product, price, certification by government authorities, past performance, local market presence and breadth of sales and service organization. In the optoelectronic devices and electronics manufacturing markets, competition is based primarily on factors such as expertise in the design and development of optoelectronic devices, product quality, timeliness of delivery, price, customer technical support and on the ability to provide fully-integrated services from application development and design through volume subsystem production. We may not be able to compete effectively with all of our competitors. To remain competitive, we must develop new products and enhance our existing products and services in a timely manner. We anticipate that we may have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive. In addition, new competitors may emerge and 21 Table of Contents entire product lines or service offerings may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines or service offerings. The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, subsequent attacks in other locations worldwide and the creation of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security have increased financial expectations that may not materialize. The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and subsequent attacks in other locations worldwide have created increased interest in our security and inspection systems and service offerings. However, we are not certain whether the level of demand will continue to be as high as it is now. We do not know what solutions will continue to be adopted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of Defense, and similar agencies in other countries and whether our products will be a part of those solutions. Additionally, should our products and services be considered as a part of future security solutions, it is unclear what the level may be and how quickly funding to purchase our products and services may be made available. These factors may adversely impact us and create unpredictability in revenues and operating results. If operators of, or algorithms installed in, our security and inspection systems fail to detect weapons, explosives or other devices or materials that are used to commit a terrorist act, we could be exposed to product and professional liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development, manufacturing, sale and service of security and inspection systems as well as in the provision of training to our customers in the use and operation of such systems. Our customers use our security and inspection systems to help them detect items that could be used in performing terrorist acts or other crimes. Some of our security and inspection systems require that an operator interpret an image of suspicious items within a bag, parcel, container or other vessel. Others signal to the operator that further investigation is required. In either case, the training, reliability and competence of the customer's operator are crucial to the detection of suspicious items. Security inspection systems that signal to the operator that further investigation is required are sometimes referred to in the security industry as "automatic" detection systems. Such systems utilize software algorithms (often designed to meet government requirements) to interpret data produced by the system and to signal to the operator when a dangerous object may be present. Such algorithms are probabilistic in nature and are also subject to significant technical limitations. Nevertheless, if such a system were to fail to signal to an operator when an explosive or other contraband was in fact present, resulting in significant damage, we could become the subject of significant product liability claims. Furthermore, security inspection by technological means is circumstance and application-specific. Our security and inspection systems are not designed to work under all circumstances and can malfunction. We also offer turnkey security screening solutions under which we perform certain of the security screening tasks that have historically been performed by our customers. Such tasks include: design, layout and construction of the security checkpoint where the inspection equipment is located; selection of the security equipment to be used at the checkpoint; selection, training and management of the personnel operating the checkpoint; operation of the security screening equipment; interpretation of the images and other signals produced by the security screening equipment; maintenance and security of the checkpoint as well as other related services. Such projects expose us to certain professional liability risks that are inherent in performing security inspection services (in live checkpoint environments and over extended periods of time) for the purpose of assisting our customers in the detection of contraband items, including items that could be used in performing terrorist acts or other crimes. If a contraband item were to pass through the checkpoint and be used to perform a terrorist act or other crime, we could become the subject of significant professional liability claims. 22 Table of Contents In addition, there are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims should an act of terrorism occur. The 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the September 11, 2001 attacks, subsequent attacks in other locations worldwide and the potential for future attacks, have caused commercial insurance for such threats to become extremely difficult to obtain. Although we have been able to obtain insurance coverage, it is likely that, should we be found liable following a major act of terrorism, the insurance we currently have in place would not fully cover the claims for damages. The Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002 (SAFETY Act) may not shield us against all legal claims we may face following an act of terrorism. The SAFETY Act provides important legal liability protections for providers of qualified anti-terrorism products and services. Under the SAFETY Act, providers, such as our Security division, may apply to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for coverage of the products and services. If granted coverage, such providers would receive certain legal protections against product liability, professional liability and certain other claims that could arise following an act of terrorism. We have applied to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for many of the products and services offered by our Security division but we do not enjoy coverage (or the highest level of coverage) for every product line, model number and service offering that our Security division provides. In addition, the terms of the SAFETY Act coverage decisions awarded to us by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security contain conditions and requirements that we may not (or may not be able to) continue to satisfy in the future. In the future, if we fail to maintain the coverage that we currently enjoy or fail to timely apply for coverage for new products and services as we introduce them, or if the U.S. Department of Homeland Security limits the scope of any coverage previously awarded to us, denies us coverage or continued coverage for a particular product, product line or service offering, or delays in making decisions about whether to grant us coverage, we may become exposed to legal claims that the SAFETY Act was otherwise designed to prevent. The SAFETY Act was not designed to shield providers of qualified anti-terrorism products and services from all types of claims that may arise from acts of terrorism, including from many types of claims lodged in courts outside of the United States or acts of terrorism that occur outside of the United States. This too could leave us exposed to significant legal claims and litigation defense costs despite the SAFETY Act awards we have received. Our patient monitoring, diagnostic cardiology and anesthesia systems could give rise to product liability claims and product recall events that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The development, manufacturing and sale of medical devices expose us to significant risk of product liability claims, product recalls and, sometimes, product failure claims. We face an inherent business risk of financial exposure to product liability claims if the use of our medical devices results in personal injury or death. Substantial product liability litigation currently exists within the medical device industry. Some of our patient monitoring, diagnostic cardiology and anesthesia systems products may become subject to product liability claims and/or product recalls. Future product liability claims and/or product recall costs may exceed the limits of our insurance coverages or such insurance may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, a significant product liability claim or product recall could significantly damage our reputation for producing safe, reliable and effective products, making it more difficult for us to market and sell our products in the future. Consequently, a product liability claim, product recall or other claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. 23 Table of Contents If we are unable to sustain high quality processes for the manufacture and delivery of goods and services, our reputation could be harmed, our competitive advantage could erode and we could incur significant costs. Quality is extremely important to us and our customers due in part to the serious consequences of product failure. Our quality certifications are critical both to the marketing success of our goods and services and to the satisfaction of both regulatory and contractual requirements under which we sell many of our products. If we fail to meet these standards or other standards required in our industries, we could lose customers and market share, our revenue could decline and we could face significant costs and other liabilities. The loss of certain of our customers, including government agencies that can modify or terminate agreements more easily than other commercial customers with which we contract, could have a negative effect on our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We sell many of our products to prominent, well-respected institutions, including agencies and departments of the U.S. government, state and local governments, foreign governments, renowned hospitals and hospital networks, and large military-defense and space-industry contractors. Many of these larger customers spend considerable resources testing and evaluating our products and our design and manufacturing processes and services. Some of our smaller customers know this and rely on this as an indication of the high-quality and reliability of our products and services. As a result, part of our reputation and success depends on our ability to continue to sell to larger institutions that are known for demanding high standards of excellence. The loss or termination of a contract by such an institution, even if for reasons unrelated to the quality of our products or services, could therefore have a more wide-spread and potentially material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, government contracts typically contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government agencies rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts, including providing the government agency with the ability to unilaterally: terminate our existing contracts; reduce the value of our existing contracts; modify some of the terms and conditions in our existing contracts; suspend or permanently prohibit us from doing business with the government or with any specific government agency; control and potentially prohibit the export of our products; cancel or delay existing multiyear contracts and related orders if the necessary funds for contract performance for any subsequent year are not appropriated; decline to exercise an option to extend an existing multiyear contract; and claim rights in technologies and systems invented, developed or produced by us. Most U.S. government agencies and some other agencies with which we contract can terminate their contracts with us for convenience, and in that event we generally may recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. If an agency terminates a contract with us for default, we may be denied any recovery and may be liable for excess costs incurred by the agency in procuring undelivered items from an alternative source. We may receive notices under such contracts that, if not addressed to the agency's satisfaction, could give the agency the right to terminate those contracts for default or to cease procuring our services under those contracts. The U.S. government may also initiate administrative proceedings that, if resulting in an adverse finding against us or our subsidiaries as to our present responsibility to be a U.S. government contractor or subcontractor, could result in our company or our subsidiaries being suspended for a period of time from eligibility for awards of new government contracts or task orders or in a loss of export 24 Table of Contents privileges and, if satisfying the requisite level of seriousness, in or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government for a specified term as well as being subject to other remedies available to the U.S. government. For example, subsidiaries within our Security division received a "show cause" letter in November 2012 from the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and a related Notice for Proposed Debarment from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in May 2013. Although, with respect to that "show cause" letter and Notice for Proposed Debarment, they were ultimately able to reach an Administrative Agreement with the U.S. government, which allowed them to continue with their current and future business with U.S. government agencies, there is no assurance that we would be able to reach a similar outcome with respect to any future proceedings that we may become involved. In addition, if our Security division fails to remain in compliance with its current Administrative Agreement, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security could initiate debarment proceedings. Further, we are generating increasing revenues from certain customers, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, in January 2012, we entered into a six-year contract with the Mexican government to provide a turnkey security screening solution at various locations throughout the country. This project is expected to provide significant revenues over the life of the contract and will require substantial management and financial resources for capital equipment and infrastructure in anticipation of future revenues and result in substantial cash-flow volatility. The termination or non-renewal of this contract, even if for reasons unrelated to the quality of our products or services, could therefore have a more wide-spread and potentially material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our revenues are dependent on orders of security and inspection systems, turnkey security screening solutions and patient monitoring, diagnostic cardiology and anesthesia systems, which may have lengthy and unpredictable sales cycles. Sales of security and inspection systems and turnkey security screening solutions often depend upon the decision of governmental agencies to upgrade or expand existing airports, border crossing inspection sites, seaport inspection sites, military facilities and other security installations. In the case of turnkey security screening solutions, the commencement of screening operations may be dependent on the approval, by a government agency, of the protocols and procedures that our personnel are to follow during the performance of their activities. Sales outside of the United States of our patient monitoring, diagnostic cardiology and anesthesia systems depend in significant part on the decision of governmental agencies to build new medical facilities or to expand or update existing medical facilities. Accordingly, a significant portion of our sales of security and inspection systems, turnkey security screening solutions and our patient monitoring, diagnostic cardiology and anesthesia systems is often subject to delays associated with the lengthy approval processes. During these approval periods, we expend significant financial and management resources in anticipation of future revenues that may not occur. If we fail to receive such revenues after expending such resources, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Current economic conditions, including the slow pace of recovery from recession in the United States and other parts of the world, as well as further disruptions in the financial markets could result in substantial declines in our revenues, earnings, cash flows and financial condition. The worldwide economic slowdown has and could continue to adversely affect our businesses and our profitability. If economic growth continues to remain slow, many customers may continue to delay purchases or reduce purchase quantities. This could result in the reduction in sales of certain of our products, slower adoption of both new technologies and upgrades to existing technologies and could also result in increased price competition. Continued market disruptions and broader economic downturns also increase our exposure to losses from bad debts. Among other effects we have seen during the slowdown, some of our customers, such as hospitals and healthcare systems in Europe and the United States, who rely on the credit markets for access to capital, have and may continue to delay purchases of our products and services until the credit markets recover. If economic or other 25 Table of Contents factors cause financial institutions to fail, we could lose current or potential customers. We cannot predict when the world's credit markets will recover and therefore when this period of delayed and diminished purchasing will end. A prolonged delay could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, in August 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 ("BCA"), committing the U.S. government to significantly reduce the federal deficit over ten years. The BCA contains provisions commonly referred to as "sequestration", which call for substantial, unspecified automatic spending cuts split between defense and non-defense programs that may continue for a period of ten years. In January 2013, Congress enacted the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which temporarily postponed enactment of the sequestration provisions for approximately two months. The sequestration cuts went into effect at the beginning of March 2013 and the impact of the spending reductions have only recently begun to spread through the economy. Likewise, various European governments have implemented or intend to implement austerity measures intended to reduce government spending. Such measures may reduce demand for our products directly by affected governmental agencies and by our customers who derive revenues from these governmental agencies. We cannot currently predict the impact of governmental spending reductions on us or our customers or whether and to what extent our business and results of operations may be adversely harmed. Any or all of these factors, as well as other consequences of the current economic conditions which cannot currently be anticipated, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. We have limited operating experience with our screening solutions business. If we fail to perform on our existing agreements to provide security screening solutions to customers after expending substantial resources, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although our turnkey screening solutions business has a limited operating history, we have recently entered into significant large-scale agreements to provide turnkey security screening solutions to certain customers. For example, in January 2012, we entered into a substantial six-year contract with the Mexican government to provide a turnkey security screening solution at various sites throughout Mexico. The contract is expected to provide significant revenues over the life of the contract. However, this contract required substantial management and financial resources for capital equipment and infrastructure in anticipation of future revenues. Under this contract, we were provided an advance of $100 million; however, we are obligated to provide a guarantee until the advance has been earned. If we fail to receive such revenues after expending such resources, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We anticipate that future contracts for turnkey security screening solutions in other territories will also require the outlay and management of substantial financial resources for capital equipment and infrastructure. Turnkey screening solutions projects, in contrast to the sale and installation of security inspection equipment, also require that we hire and manage large numbers of local personnel in jurisdictions where we may not have previously operated. They also require that we establish, adhere to, adapt and monitor operating procedures over periods that last much longer than our other projects. If we are unable to efficiently manage the adaptation and growth of our operations relating to these projects, our operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products could become obsolete and our operating results would suffer. We sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards and customer needs. Without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, our products could become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our 26 Table of Contents revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors, including our ability to: accurately anticipate customer needs; innovate and develop new technologies and applications; successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner; price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time; and differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings. Some of our products are used by our customers to develop, test and manufacture their products. We therefore must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers' products. In developing any new product, we may be required to make a substantial investment before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product. If we fail to accurately foresee our customers' needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenues. Interruptions in our ability to purchase raw materials and subcomponents may adversely affect our profitability. We purchase raw materials and certain subcomponents from third parties. Standard purchase order terms are as long as one year at fixed costs, but we do not have guaranteed long-term supply arrangements with our suppliers. In addition, for certain raw materials and subcomponents that we use, there are a limited number of potential suppliers that we have qualified or that we are currently able to qualify. Consequently, some of the key raw materials and subcomponents that we use are currently available to us only from a single vendor. The reliance on a single qualified vendor could result in delays in delivering products or increases in the cost of manufacturing the affected products. Any material interruption in our ability to purchase necessary raw materials or subcomponents could adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer orders and therefore could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Delays by the construction firms we engage may interfere with our ability to complete projects on time. Purchasers of our security and inspection systems and turnkey security screening solutions sometimes require, as a part of our contract, the construction of the facilities that will house our systems and/or operations. Some of these construction projects are significant in size and complexity. We engage qualified construction firms to perform this work. However, if such firms experience delays, if they perform sub-standard work or if we fail to properly monitor the quality of their work or the timeliness of their progress, we may not be able to complete our construction projects on time. In any such circumstance, we could face the imposition of delay penalties and breach of contract claims by our customer. In addition, we could be forced to incur significant expenses to rectify the problems caused by the construction firm. Any material delay caused by our construction firm subcontractors could therefore ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Inability of service vendors to fulfill contracts. We contract with third-party vendors to service our equipment in the field. We have made such arrangements because sometimes it is more efficient to outsource these activities than it is for our own employees to service our equipment. In addition, some of these vendors maintain stocks of spare parts that are more efficiently accessed in conjunction with a service agreement than would be the case if we were to maintain such spare parts independently. Any material interruption in our the ability of our vendors to fulfill such service contracts could adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer orders and therefore could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 27 Table of Contents Potential to accumulate excess inventory. Because of long lead times and specialized product designs, in certain cases we purchase components and manufacture products in anticipation of customer orders based on customer forecasts. For a variety of reasons, such as decreased end-user demand for our products, inadequate or inaccurate forecasts, or other issues that might impact production planning, our customers might not purchase all the products that we have manufactured or for which we have purchased components. In any such event, we would attempt to recoup material and manufacturing costs by means such as returning components to our vendors, disposing of excess inventory through other channels, or requiring our OEM customers to purchase or otherwise compensate us for such excess inventory. Some of our significant customer agreements do not give us the ability to require our OEM customers to do this. To the extent that we are unsuccessful in recouping our material and manufacturing costs this could adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer orders and therefore could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to successfully implement our acquisitions and investment strategies, integrate acquired businesses into our existing business or make acquired businesses profitable. One of our strategies is to supplement our internal growth by acquiring and investing in businesses and technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines. This growth has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management, working capital and financial resources. We may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons, including: competition among buyers; the need for regulatory approvals, including antitrust approvals; and the high valuations of businesses. Some of the businesses we may seek to acquire or invest in may be marginally profitable or unprofitable. For these businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability, we must improve their management, operations, products and market penetration. We may not be successful in this regard and we may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations. To finance our acquisitions, we may have to raise additional funds, through either public or private financings. We may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on unfavorable terms. Our acquisition and alliance activities could disrupt our ongoing business. We intend to continue to make investments in companies, products and technologies, either through acquisitions, investments or alliances. Acquisition and alliance activities often involve risks, including: difficulty in assimilating the acquired operations and employees and realizing synergies expected to result from the acquisition; difficulty in managing product co-development activities with our alliance partners; difficulty in retaining the key employees of the acquired operation; disruption of our ongoing business; inability to successfully integrate the acquired technologies and operations into our businesses and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures; and lacking the experience necessary to enter into new product or technology markets successfully. 28 Table of Contents Integrating acquired businesses has been and will continue to be complex, time consuming and expensive, and can negatively impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The use of debt to fund acquisitions or for other related purposes increases our interest expense and leverage. If we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition, current stockholders percentage ownership and earnings per share may be diluted. As a result of these and other risks, we cannot be certain that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the conduct, operating results or financial condition of our business. Acquisition and alliance activities by our competitors could disrupt our ongoing business. From time to time, our competitors acquire or enter into exclusive arrangements with companies with whom we do business or may do business in the future. Reductions in the number of partners with whom we may do business in a particular context may reduce our ability to enter into critical alliances on attractive terms or at all, and the termination of an existing alliance by a business partner may disrupt our operations. Our ability to successfully adapt to ongoing organizational changes could impact our business results. We have executed a number of significant business and organizational changes to rationalize our overall cost structure. These changes have included and may continue to include the implementation of cost-cutting measures and the consolidation of facilities. We expect these types of changes may continue from time to time in the future as we uncover additional opportunities to streamline our operations. Successfully managing these changes is critical to our productivity improvement and business success. If we are unable to successfully manage these changes, while continuing to invest in business growth, our financial results could be adversely impacted. Economic, political, operational and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our financial performance. In fiscal 2011, 2012 and 2013 revenues from shipments made to customers outside of the United States accounted for approximately 47%, 47% and 52% of our revenues, respectively. Of the revenues generated during fiscal 2013 from sales made to customers outside of the United States, 18% represented sales made by subsidiaries based in the United States to foreign customers, and the balance represented sales generated by foreign subsidiaries. Since we sell certain of our products and services worldwide, our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenues from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities, and therefore employees, suppliers, real property, capital equipment, cash and other assets are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including without limitation: changes in foreign currency exchange rates; changes in a country's or region's political or economic conditions, particularly in developing or emerging markets; political and economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, terrorism, mass violence or armed conflict; longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions; trade protection measures; difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; and difficulty in managing distributors and sales agents and their compliance with applicable laws. 29 Table of Contents We are facing an increasingly complex international regulatory environment which is constantly changing and if we fail to comply with international regulatory requirements, or are unable to comply with changes to such requirements, our financial performance may be harmed. Our international operations and sales subject us to an international regulatory environment which is becoming increasingly complex and is constantly changing due to factors beyond our control. Risks associated with our international operations and sales include, without limitation, those arising from the following factors: differing legal and court systems and changes to such systems; differing labor laws and changes in those laws; differing tax laws and changes in those laws; differing environmental laws and changes in those laws; differing laws governing our distributors and sales agents and changes in those laws; differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection; differing import and export requirements and changes to those requirements; and differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements. If we fail to comply with applicable international regulatory requirements, even if such non-compliance by us is inadvertent, or if we are unable to comply with changes to such requirements, our financial performance may be harmed. There are inherent risks associated with operations in Mexico. We are currently in the process of fulfilling a multi-year agreement to provide a turnkey security scanning solution to the tax and customs authority of Mexico. This agreement is individually material to our business, financial condition and results of operations. There are certain administrative, legal, governmental and societal risks to operating in Mexico that could adversely impact our operations. Any one or more of the risks that could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our agreement and therefore ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations include, without limitation: regional political and economic stability; high rate of crime in Mexico where we conduct operations; ability of key suppliers and subcontractors to fulfill obligations; ability to hire and maintain a significant work force; burdensome and evolving government regulations; cooperation of various departments of the Mexican government in issuing permits, inspecting our operations on a timely basis; providing adequate security among other items; receipt of payments in a timely manner; termination or change in scope of program; change in the value of the Mexican peso. 30 Table of Contents Our operations are vulnerable to interruption or loss due to natural disasters, epidemics, terrorist acts and other events beyond our control, which could adversely impact our operations. Although we perform manufacturing in multiple locations, we generally do not have redundant manufacturing capabilities in place for any particular product or component. As a result, we depend on our current facilities for the continued operation of our business. A natural disaster, pandemic, terrorist act, act of war, or other natural or manmade disaster affecting any of our facilities could significantly disrupt our operations, or delay or prevent product manufacturing and shipment for the time required to repair, rebuild, or replace our manufacturing facilities. This delay could be lengthy and we could incur significant expenses to repair or replace the facilities. Any similar natural or manmade disaster that affects a key supplier or customer could lead to a similar disruption in our business. Third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property rights, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products. As we introduce any new and potentially promising product or service, or improve existing products or services with new features or components, companies possessing competing technologies, or other companies owning patents or other intellectual property rights, may be motivated to assert infringement claims in order to generate royalty revenues, delay or diminish potential sales and challenge our right to market such products or services. Even if successful in defending against such claims, patent and other intellectual property related litigation is costly and time consuming. In addition, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation in order to protect our patent or other intellectual property rights, and even if the claims are well-founded and ultimately successful such litigation is typically costly and time-consuming and may expose us to counterclaims, including claims for intellectual property infringement, anti-trust, or other such claims. Third parties could also obtain patents or other intellectual property rights that may require us to either redesign products or, if possible, negotiate licenses from such third parties. Adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or injunctions, or could require us to seek licenses from third parties, and if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms, prevent us from manufacturing, importing, distributing, selling or using certain products, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive, which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies. Under any of these circumstances, we may incur significant expenses. Our ongoing success is dependent upon the continued availability of certain key employees. We are dependent in our operations on the continued availability of the services of our employees, many of whom are individually key to our current and future success, and the availability of new employees to implement our growth plans. In particular, we are dependent upon the services of Deepak Chopra, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and Chief Executive Officer. The market for skilled employees is highly competitive, especially for employees in technical fields. While our compensation programs are intended to attract and retain the employees required for us to be successful, ultimately, we may not be able to retain the services of all of our key employees or a sufficient number to execute on our plans. In addition, we may not be able to continue to attract new employees as required. Future legislation or regulatory changes to the healthcare system may affect our ability to sell our products profitably. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system, and some could involve changes that could significantly affect our business. This legislation will significantly affect the ways in which doctors, hospitals, healthcare systems and health insurance companies are compensated for the services they provide. For example, the 2010 health care reform includes a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of a wide range of medical devices. The excise tax became effective in 2013 and increased our costs. Although some provisions of the health reform legislation have been implemented, many of the 31 Table of Contents legislative changes contained within the health reform legislation will not be effective or implemented until later this year or in subsequent years. It is not clear at this time whether and to what extent this legislation may impact the ability of hospitals and hospital networks to purchase the patient monitoring, diagnostic cardiology and anesthesia systems that we sell or if it will alter market-based incentives that hospitals and hospital networks currently face to continually improve, upgrade and expand their use of such equipment. While this legislation could materially and adversely affect us, at this time we cannot predict the extent of any impact on our business or results of operations. Apart from the 2010 health reform law, efforts by governmental and third- party payers to reduce healthcare costs or the announcement of legislative proposals or reforms to implement government controls could cause a reduction in sales or in the selling price of our products, which could adversely affect our business. Substantial government regulation in the United States and abroad may restrict our ability to sell our patient monitoring, diagnostic cardiology and anesthesia systems. The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries extensively and rigorously regulate our patient monitoring, diagnostic cardiology and anesthesia systems, including related development activities and manufacturing processes. In the United States, the FDA regulates the introduction of medical devices as well as the manufacturing, labeling and record-keeping procedures for such products. We are required to: obtain clearance before we can market and sell medical devices; satisfy content requirements applicable to our labeling, sales and promotional materials; comply with manufacturing and reporting requirements; and undergo rigorous inspections. Our future products may not obtain FDA clearance on a timely basis, or at all. Our patient monitoring, diagnostic cardiology and anesthesia systems must also comply with the laws and regulations of foreign countries in which we develop, manufacture and market such products. In general, the extent and complexity of medical device regulation is increasing worldwide. This trend is likely to continue and the cost and time required to obtain marketing clearance in any given country may increase as a result. Our products may not obtain any necessary foreign clearances on a timely basis, or at all. Once any of our patient monitoring, diagnostic cardiology and anesthesia systems is cleared for sale, regulatory authorities may still limit the use of such product, prevent its sale or manufacture or require a recall or withdrawal of such product from the marketplace. Following initial clearance from regulatory authorities, we continue to be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. Government authorities can withdraw marketing clearance or impose sanctions due to our failure to comply with regulatory standards or due to the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial clearance. Ongoing regulatory requirements are wide-ranging and govern, among other things: annual inspections to retain a CE mark for sale of products in the European Union; product manufacturing; patient health data protection and medical device security; supplier substitution; product changes; process modifications; medical device reporting; and product sales and distribution. 32 Table of Contents Consolidation in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. The healthcare industry has been consolidating and organizations such as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks, and large single accounts such as the United States Veterans Administration, continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our healthcare provider customers. As a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex, and tend to involve more long-term contracts. The purchasing power of these larger customers has increased, and may continue to increase, causing downward pressure on product pricing. If we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations, we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants. Even if we are one of the selected providers, we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of products. Further, we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues and profit margins, business, financial condition and results of operations. We expect that market demand, governmental regulation, third-party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances, which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Technological advances and evolving industry and regulatory standards and certifications could reduce our future product sales, which could cause our revenues to grow more slowly or decline. The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, changing customer needs, evolving industry or regulatory standards and certifications and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. The emergence of new industry or regulatory standards and certification requirements in related fields may adversely affect the demand for our products. This could happen, for example, if new standards and technologies emerged that were incompatible with customer deployments of our applications. In addition, any products or processes that we develop may become obsolete or uneconomical before we recover any of the expenses incurred in connection with their development. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in developing and marketing product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change, new industry standards, changed customer requirements or competitive products on a timely and cost-effective basis. Additionally, even if we are able to develop new products and product enhancements, we cannot assure you that they will achieve market acceptance. We develop certain of our security inspection technologies to meet the certification requirements of various agencies worldwide, including the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration and the European Civil Aviation Conference among others. Such standards frequently change and there is a risk now and in the future that we may not ultimately be able to develop technologies, or develop in a timely way, solutions that are ultimately able to meet the new standards. We are subject to various environmental regulations which may impose liability on us whether or not we knew of or caused the release of hazardous substances on or in our facilities. We are subject to various foreign and U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations relating to the use, storage, handling and disposal of certain hazardous substances and wastes used or generated in the manufacturing and assembly of our products. Under such laws, we may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances or wastes that have been or are being disposed of offsite as wastes or that have been or are being released on or in our facilities. Such laws may impose liability without regard to whether we knew of or caused the release of such hazardous substances or wastes. For example, we continue to assess the risks related to U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws related to the soil and groundwater contamination at our Hawthorne, California facility. See "BusinessEnvironmental Regulations". Any failure by us to comply with present or future regulations could subject us to the imposition of substantial 33 Table of Contents fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, or cessation of operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A failure of a key information technology system, process or site could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business. We rely extensively on information technology systems to interact with our employees and our customers. These interactions include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping product to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, transmitting data used by our service personnel and by and among our wide-spread operations, complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements, and other processes necessary to manage our business. If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, ranging from the failures of third-party service providers, to catastrophic events, to power outages, to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations which may adversely impact our results of operations and/or financial condition. Our business and financial results could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats. Information technology is a critically important part of our business operations. Therefore, we may be exposed to cyber and other security threats, including computer viruses, attacks by hackers or physical break-ins. Any electronic or physical break-in or other security breach or compromise may jeopardize security of information stored or transmitted through our information technology systems and networks. This could lead to unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Although we have implemented policies, procedures and controls to protect against, detect and mitigate these threats, attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated. Because of the evolving nature of these security threats, there can be no assurance that our policies, procedures and controls have or will detect or prevent any of these threats and we cannot predict the full impact of any such incident. Occurrence of any of these security threats could adversely affect our business operations and financial results. We receive significant amounts of research and development funding for our security and inspection systems from government grants and contracts, but we may not continue to receive comparable levels of funding in the future. The U.S. government currently plays an important role in funding the development of certain of our security and inspection systems and sponsoring their deployment at airports, ports, military installations and border crossings. However, in the future, additional research and development funds from the government may not be available to us. If the government fails to continue to sponsor our technologies, we may have to expend more resources on product development or cease development of certain technologies, which could adversely affect our business. Government funded research and development also presents risks associated with government contracting in general that are described elsewhere in our risk factors. Government agencies can generally terminate their contracts for convenience, and if we fail to meet the goals of government funded research and development, there is a risk that the government agency may terminate our contracts for default. In addition, any future grants to our competitors may improve their ability to develop and market competing products and cause our customers to delay purchase decisions, which could harm our ability to market our products. Our credit facility contains provisions that could restrict our ability to finance our future operations or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest. Our credit facility contains a number of significant covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to: dispose of assets; 34 Table of Contents incur certain additional indebtedness; repay certain indebtedness; create liens on assets; pay dividends on our Common Stock; make certain investments, loans and advances; repurchase or redeem capital stock; make certain capital expenditures; engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations; and engage in certain transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates. These covenants could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, finance our operations, engage in strategic acquisitions or disposals or meet our capital needs or could otherwise restrict our activities or business plans. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, our credit facility also requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios. Our inability to comply with the required financial ratios or covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. In addition, our lenders could terminate their commitments to make further extensions of credit under our credit facility. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. Changes in our tax rates could affect our future financial results. Our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. In March 2010, significant reforms to the healthcare system were adopted as law in the United States. The law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of an excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013. The excise tax will increase the Company's operating expenses. While the new law could reduce medical procedure volumes, lower reimbursement for the Company's products, and impact the demand for the Company's products or the prices at which the Company sells its products, at this time we cannot predict the extent of any impact on our business or results of operations. Our Certificate of Incorporation and other agreements contain provisions that could discourage a takeover. Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series, to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued shares of Preferred Stock, to fix the number of shares constituting any such series and to fix the designation of any such series, without further vote or action by stockholders. The terms of any series of Preferred Stock, which may include economic rights senior to our Common Stock and special voting rights, could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our Common Stock and thereby reduce the value of our Common Stock. The issuance of Preferred Stock, coupled with the concentration of ownership in the directors and executive officers, could discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change in control 35 Table of Contents of our company, including transactions in which the holders of Common Stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current prices, could otherwise dilute the rights of holders of Common Stock and may limit the ability of such stockholders to cause or approve transactions which they may deem to be in their best interests, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock. Our Certificate of Incorporation limits the liability of our directors, which may limit the remedies we or our stockholders have available. Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that, pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, the liability of our directors for monetary damages shall be eliminated to the fullest extent permissible under Delaware law, as that law exists currently and as it may be amended in the future. This is intended to eliminate the personal liability of a director for monetary damages in an action brought by us, or in our right for breach of a director's duties to us or our stockholders and may limit the remedies available to us or our stockholders. Under Delaware law, this provision does not apply to eliminate or limit a director's monetary liabilities for: (i) breaches of the director's duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders; (ii) acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or knowing violations of law; (iii) the unlawful payment of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law or (iv) transactions in which the director received an improper personal benefit. Additionally, under Delaware law, this provision does not limit a director's liability for the violation of, or otherwise relieve us or our directors from complying with, federal or state securities laws, nor does it limit the availability of non-monetary remedies such as injunctive relief or rescission for a violation of federal or state securities laws.
