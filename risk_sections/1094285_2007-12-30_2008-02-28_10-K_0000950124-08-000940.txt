Item 1A. Risk Factors. Risk Factors; Cautionary Statement as to Forward-Looking Statements The following text highlights various risks and uncertainties associated with Teledyne. These factors could materially affect forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) that we may from time to time make, including forward-looking statements contained in Item 1. Business and Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K and in Teledynes 2007 Annual Report to Stockholders. It is not possible for management to predict all of such factors, and new factors may emerge. Additionally, management cannot assess the impact of each such factor on Teledyne or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Our dependence on revenue from government contracts subjects us to many risks: Our revenue from government contracts depends on the continued availability of funding from the U.S. Government, and, accordingly, we have the risk that funding for our existing contracts may be diverted to other uses or delayed. We perform work on a number of contracts with the Department of Defense and other agencies and departments of the U.S. Government including sub-contracts with government prime contractors. Sales under contracts with the U.S. Government as a whole, including sales under contracts with the Department of Defense, as prime contractor or subcontractor, represented approximately 41% of our total revenue for 2007, as compared to 40% and 42% of our total revenue for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Congress typically appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal-year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. As a result, at the beginning of a major program, a contract is typically only partially funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring 14 Table of Contents agency only as Congress makes appropriations available for future fiscal years. The timing of program cycles can also affect our results of operations for a particular quarter or year. It is not uncommon for the Department of Defense to delay the timing of awards for major programs for six to twelve months, or more, beyond the original anticipated timeframe. While U.S. defense spending increased as a result of the September 11th terrorist attacks and the war in Iraq, it is currently expected to continue to moderate over the next few years. The continued war on terrorism and the Iraqi situation could result in a diversion of funds from programs in which Teledyne participates. In addition, continued defense spending does not necessarily correlate to continued business for us, because not all the programs in which we participate or have current capabilities may be provided with continued funding. Further, changes in the leadership of the U.S. Government could result over time in reductions in defense spending and further changes in programs in which we participate. Our Electronics and Communications segment provides a variety of products for newer military platforms such as the F/A-22 and F-35 aircraft. Development and production of these aircraft are very expensive, and there is no guarantee that the Department of Defense, as it balances budget priorities, will continue to provide funding to manufacture and support these platforms. Reallocation of funding priorities within the Department of Defense could also affect repair and spares sales for older military platforms, including, by way of example, sales of our traveling wave tubes for F-15, F-16, F-18, EA-6B, B-52, B-1, C-130 and U-2 aircraft. The recent grounding of the Air Forces F-15 fleet as a result of apparent structural failures could result in decreased orders for products we supply to the F-15 program. Our participation in government programs may decrease or be subject to renegotiation as those programs evolve over time. The relocation to Huntsville, Alabama of the Missile Defense Agency or MDA has resulted in the transfer to the MDA of certain missions and functions from the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command or SMDC. We understand that work currently performed under one or more existing SMDC contracts may be transferred to one or more existing or new MDA contracts. Such transfers may require us to recompete for some work currently performed by us, and there is no guarantee that we would maintain historic levels of revenue or profitability if we successfully recompeted, or even that MDA will effect this transition without a break in contract coverage. Such changes could affect our Engineered Systems segment, but it is too early to tell the impact of such changes. Over time, and for a variety of reasons, programs can evolve and affect the extent of our participation. For example, Teledyne Brown Engineerings Ground-based Midcourse Defense program is moving toward the end of the program cycle resulting in declining revenues. Revenues from this contract in 2005 and 2006 totaled approximately $51 million and $48 million, respectively. In 2007, revenues related to this program declined to $45 million, and are expected to decline further through 2009 as MDA shifts its focus toward integrating the Ground-based Midcourse Defense program into the larger Ballistic Missile Defense Program. We have been a significant participant in NASA programs, traditionally through our Engineered Systems segment and through Teledyne Scientific Company. The foci of our current NASA activities are the International Space Station and the James Webb Space Telescope. While we anticipate participating in NASAs lunar and interplanetary exploration activities, funding for these activities has been reduced as NASA focuses on the completion of the International Space Station and on keeping the Space Shuttle fleet in continuous service, each of which is also facing a tightened budget. These changes could adversely impact us. We may not be successful in bidding for future contracts. We obtain many U.S. Government prime contracts and subcontracts through the process of competitive bidding. We may not be successful in having our bids accepted. In addition, we may spend substantial amounts of time, money and effort, including design, development and marketing activities, required to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us. 15 Table of Contents Our contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to termination rights that could adversely affect us. Most of our U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the U.S. Government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor. Termination-for-convenience provisions provide only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses, and profit on work completed prior to termination. Termination-for-default clauses impose liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in reprocuring undelivered items from another source. During 2007, Teledyne had four U.S. Government contracts terminated for convenience. We did not have any of our U.S. Government contracts terminated for default during 2007. We may lose money or generate less than expected profits on our fixed-price government contracts and we may lose money if we fail to meet certain pre-specified targets in government contracts. There is no guarantee that U.S. Government contracts will be profitable. A number of our U.S. Government prime contracts and subcontracts are fixed-price type contracts (42% in 2007, 47% in 2006 and 2005). Under these types of contracts, we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price. This is particularly true where the contract was awarded and the price finalized in advance of final completion of design. Under such contracts, we must absorb cost overruns, notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts. Our failure to anticipate technical problems, estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance of a fixed-price contract may reduce the profitability of a fixed-price contract or cause a loss. We cannot assure that our contract loss provisions in our financial statements will be adequate to cover all actual future losses. We may lose money on some contracts if we fail to meet these targets. Certain fees under some of our U.S. Government contracts are linked to meeting specified technical, cost and/or schedule targets, including development or testing deadlines. Fees may also be influenced or be dependent on the collective efforts and success of other defense contractors over which we had no or limited control. Our business is subject to government contracting regulations, and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and prospects. We, like other government contractors, are subject to various audits, reviews and investigations (including private party whistleblower lawsuits) relating to our compliance with federal and state laws. Generally, claims arising out of these U.S. Government inquiries and voluntary disclosures can be resolved without resorting to litigation. However, should the business unit or division involved be charged with wrongdoing, or should the U.S. Government determine that the unit or division is not a presently responsible contractor, that unit or division, and conceivably our company as a whole, could be temporarily suspended or, in the event of a conviction, could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or government-approved subcontracts. In addition, we could expend substantial amounts in defending against such charges and in damages, fines and penalties if such charges are proven or result in negotiated settlements. Our pension expenses and the value of our pension assets are affected by factors outside of our control, including the performance of plan assets, the stock market, interest rates and actuarial data. We have a defined benefit pension plan covering most of our employees. At year-end 2007, the value of the combined pension assets was less than our accumulated pension benefit obligation. Given our pension plans underfunded status, in 2004 we began making required cash contributions to our pension plan. For 2007, 2006 and 2005, cash contributions totaled $7.5 million, $20.9 million and $15.5 million, respectively, and we currently expect such contributions to be approximately $9.0 million for 2008. The lower contribution level in 2007 is due primarily to the merger into our pension plan of the overfunded Scientific Company pension plan in September 2006, which was part of our September 2006 acquisition of Scientific Company. The accounting rules applicable to our pension plan require that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis, rather than as contributions are made to the plan. Two significant elements in determining our pension income or pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount 16 Table of Contents rate used in projecting pension benefit obligations. Declines in the stock market and lower rates of return could increase required contributions to our pension plan. Any decreases in market interest rates will affect the discount rate assumption used in projecting pension benefit obligations, and therefore if and to the extent these decreases are not offset by contributions and asset returns, our obligations could increase under the plans. For additional discussion of pension matters, see the discussion under Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition and Notes 2 and 12 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At the end of 2007, we changed some investment allocations to reduce exposure to deterioration in the subprime mortgage market. However, our investment strategy may not be successful if the problems in the subprime credit market spread to other types of investments. United States and global responses to terrorism, the Iraq situation and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect our business and results of operations. United States and global responses to terrorism, the Iraq situation and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to U.S. and other business and financial markets. Several factors associated, directly or indirectly, with terrorism, the Iraq situation and perceived nuclear threats and responses may adversely affect us. The reaction to Irans continuing desire to explore nuclear capabilities could affect adversely oil prices and some of our businesses. While some of our businesses that provide products or services to the U.S. Government experienced greater demand for their products and services as a result of increased U.S. Government defense spending, various responses could realign government programs and affect the composition, funding or timing of our government programs. Changes in the leadership of the U.S. Government could also further affect responses and government programs. Government spending could shift to the Department of Defense or Homeland Security programs in which we may not participate or may not have current capabilities and curtail less pressing non-defense programs in which we do participate, including Department of Energy or NASA programs. Government spending could also shift towards non-defense programs in which we do not currently participate, such as medical research programs of the National Institutes of Health. Air travel declines have occurred after terrorist attacks and heightened security alerts, as well as after the SARS and bird flu scares. Additional declines in air travel resulting from such factors and other factors could adversely affect the financial condition of many of our commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers and in turn could adversely affect our Electronics and Communications segment. Deterioration of financial performance of airlines could result in a reduction of discretionary spending for upgrades of avionics and in-flight communications equipment, which would adversely affect our Electronics and Communications segment. The government continues to evaluate potential security issues associated with general aviation. Increased government regulations, including but not limited to increased airspace regulations (including user fees), could lead to an overall decline in air travel and have an adverse affect on our Aerospace Engines and Components segment. As happened after the September 11th terrorist attacks, reinstatement of flight restrictions would negatively impact the market for general aviation aircraft piston engines and components and our Aerospace Engines and Components segment. Potential reductions in the need for general aviation aircraft maintenance as a result of declines in air travel could also adversely affect our Aerospace Engines and Components segment. Higher oil prices could reduce general aviation air travel, negatively affecting our Aerospace Engines and Components segment. Higher oil prices could also adversely affect commercial airline-related customers of our Electronics and Communications segment. Conversely, lower oil prices could decrease oil exploration activities and hinder our marine instrumentation businesses, including Teledyne Geophysical Instruments, Teledyne Benthos, Teledyne D.G. OBrien and majority-owned ODI. In addition, instability in the Middle East or other oil-producing regions could adversely affect expansion plans of the oil and gas industry customers of our marine instrumentation business. 17 Table of Contents Acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Our growth strategy includes acquisitions. Acquisitions involve various inherent risks, such as:  our ability to assess accurately the value, strengths, weaknesses, internal controls, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates;  the potential loss of key personnel of an acquired business;  our ability to integrate acquired businesses and to achieve identified financial, operating and other synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition;  our ability to assess, integrate and implement internal controls of acquired businesses in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;  the distraction of management resulting from the need to integrate acquired businesses;  increased competition for acquisition targets, which may increase acquisition costs; and  unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business. While we conduct financial and other due diligence in connection with our acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection, including indemnification from a seller and sometimes an escrow of a portion of the purchase price to cover potential issues, such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition. Further, indemnities or escrows may not fully cover such matters, particularly matters identified after a closing. We also have acquired several private companies, including the recent acquisitions of Storm Products Co., TSS (International) Limited, and the assets of Impulse Enterprise and Judson Technologies, LLC. Private companies generally may not have as formal or comprehensive internal controls and compliance systems in place as public companies. While we have required various sellers to take certain compliance actions prior to the closing of an acquisition, including making voluntary disclosures under various export control laws and regulations, and have sought protections in the purchase agreement for such matters, there is no assurance that we have identified all issues or will be fully protected from historic liabilities. After acquiring a company, notwithstanding pre-closing due diligence, we have discovered issues that required further action, including making voluntary disclosures under various defense and export control laws and regulations. While the products and customer base of the companies we acquired in 2007 are complementary to some of Teledynes existing businesses, there is no assurance that we will achieve all identified financial, operating and marketing synergies. We may also experience problems that arise in entering new markets through acquisitions in which we may have little or no experience. In connection with acquisitions, we may consolidate one or more acquired facilities with other Teledyne facilities to obtain synergies and cost-savings. For example, in 2006, we relocated, with minimal disruption, the operations of the microwave technical solutions assets acquired from Avnet Inc. to a Teledyne Cougar facility in Sunnyvale, California. In 2007, we also moved 2007-acquired Tindall Technologies, Inc.s operations into the same Teledyne Cougar facility. On a larger scale, in 2006, we successfully consolidated into a newly leased facility in Poway, California the operations of 2005-acquired Teledyne RD Instruments, Inc., 2005-acquired MGD Technologies, Inc. (now part of Teledyne Isco) and Teledyne Interconnect Devices. In 2007, we added 2006-acquired Teledyne KW Microwave to such facility. Nonetheless, despite planning, relocation and consolidation of manufacturing operations has inherent risks, as it tends to involve, among other things, change of personnel, application of a new business system software and learning or adaptation of manufacturing processes and techniques. As a result, production delays at a new operating location may occur. As permitted by SEC rules, our current managements report as to our assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting excludes in its scope and coverage our 2007 acquisition of the assets of D.G. OBrien, Inc.. We plan to evaluate more fully the internal controls of Teledyne D.G. OBrien and subsequently acquired companies and implement a formal and rigorous system of internal controls at those 18 Table of Contents acquired companies. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to provide a report that contains no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses with respect to these acquired companies or other acquisitions. Our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we are required to test both acquired goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach, rather than amortizing them over time. We have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in an entitys market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business, or other factors. If the fair market value is less than the book value of goodwill, we could be required to record an impairment charge. The valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows, discount rates and estimated product life cycles. In making these judgments, we evaluate the financial health of the business, including such factors as industry performance, changes in technology and operating cash flows. As we have grown through acquisitions, we have accumulated $351.6 million of goodwill, and have $61.7 million of acquired intangible assets, which includes $11.3 of indefinite-lived intangible assets, out of total assets of $1,159.4 million at December 30, 2007. As a result, the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken. We also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if, as a result of a change in strategy or other reason, we determined the value of other assets has been impaired. We account for the impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets (SFAS No. 144). SFAS No. 144 requires that a long-lived asset to be disposed of be reported at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. An asset (other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets) is considered impaired when estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. In the event the carrying amount of such asset is not deemed recoverable, the asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value. Fair value is generally determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows. We may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions. In order to remain competitive, we must make substantial investments in research and development of new or enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities. Although we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our recently amended $590.0 million credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated working capital, research and development and capital investment needs, we may be unable to fund all of these needs or possible acquisitions. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors, some of which will not be within our control, including the existence of a public offering market, investor perceptions of us, our businesses and the industries in which we operate, and general economic conditions. We may be unable to successfully raise additional capital, if needed. Failure to successfully raise needed capital on a timely or cost-effective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business. As of December 30, 2007, we had $143.2 million in total outstanding indebtedness, including $138.0 million under our then $400.0 million credit facility. The borrowing capacity under our credit facility was subsequently increased to $590.0 million in February 2008. Our indebtedness could harm our business by, among other things, reducing the funds available to make new strategic acquisitions. Our indebtedness could 19 Table of Contents also have a material adverse effect on our business by increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business. General adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business could result in our inability to repay this indebtedness in a timely manner. We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to increase our participation in certain new markets. We intend to both adapt our existing technologies and develop new products to expand into new market segments. For example, we continue to work towards developing new fuel cell related technologies. The market for fuel cell technologies is not well established and there are a number of companies that have announced intentions to develop and market fuel cell products. Some of these companies have greater financial and/or technological resources than we do. We have also been developing new electronic products, including high-power millimeter traveling wave tubes and imaging sonar systems, which are intended to access markets in which Teledyne does not currently participate or has limited participation. We may be unsuccessful in accessing these and other new markets if our products do not meet our customers requirements, as a result of changes in either technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors. We may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and cost-effective manner. Our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis. Successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors, including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements, changes in technology and industry standards, our ability to differentiate our offerings from offerings of our competitors, and market acceptance. We may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and cost-effective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements. Our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly anticipate new industry standards and technological changes. As an example, we have been working to develop high power solid state power amplifiers, which could replace our traveling wave tubes in some applications, and, in this area, there is a larger base of potential competitors than for tube amplifiers. As a result, it may be more difficult for our solid state power amplifier products to gain market acceptance. We may also lose any technological advantage to competitors if we fail to develop new products in a timely manner. For example, if Teledyne Continental Motors fails to fully launch Aerosances PowerLink FADEC, its electronic engine control product, competitors may be able to introduce similar products that are able to gain market acceptance to the disadvantage of Teledynes product. Additionally, new products may trigger increased warranty costs as such products are tested further by actual usage. Accelerated entry of new products to meet heightened market demand and competitive pressures may cause additional warranty costs as development and testing time periods might be condensed. In 2008, for example, Teledyne Energy Systems, Inc. currently believes it will continue to incur additional warranty costs as it continues to roll out two new hydrogen generation product lines. Technological change and evolving industry and regulatory standards could cause certain of our products or services to become obsolete or non-competitive. The markets for a number of our products and services are generally characterized by rapid technological development, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements. A faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or services, or in market demand for products or services based on a particular technology, could result in faster than anticipated obsolescence of certain of our products or services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, Teledyne Reynolds high voltage connector business could be negatively impacted by marketplace shifts to lower voltage requirements where the number of competitors is larger. Most lighting displays in legacy aircraft use tubes that require high voltage connectors. LED backlights, which are increasingly being used for aircraft lighting displays, have substantially lower voltage requirements. 20 Table of Contents Currently accepted industry and regulatory standards are also subject to change, which may contribute to the obsolescence of our products or services. For example, a European directive that certain electronic products must not contain impermissible levels of lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls or polybrominated diphenyl ethers, recently took effect on July 1, 2006. As a result, we must make sure that certain of our electronic products sold into European member states comply with this new directive. Although many of our products are exempt from the European directive, we expect that, over time, component manufacturers may discontinue selling components that have the restricted substances. This will, in turn, require us to accommodate changes in parameters, such as the way parts are soldered, and may, in some cases, require redesign of certain products. This could lead to increased costs, which we may not be able to recover from our customers, delays in product shipments and loss of market share to competitors. Our sales of environmental monitoring equipment could be negatively impacted if regulatory requirements change to deemphasize environmental monitoring. Similarly, revenues of our Teledyne Test Services business, which provides testing and certification for products used in nuclear power plants, could be negatively impacted in the event of any changes in certification standards by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The airline industry is heavily regulated, and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements, our results of operations could suffer. Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, or the FAA, prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products, as well as regulations regarding the repair and overhaul of aircraft engines. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. We include, with the products and replacement parts that we sell to our aircraft manufacturing industry customers, documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. In order to sell our products, we and the products we manufacture must also be certified by our individual original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, customers. If any material authorization or approval qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended, then the sale of the subject product would be prohibited by law, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations, which are usually more stringent than existing regulations. If these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted, we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Product liability claims, product recalls and field service actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. As a manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of products, including aircraft engines and medical devices, our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products. In part, product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a particular product, which could adversely affect our results of operations. This could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven untrue or settled for immaterial amounts. While we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities, we have self-insured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities. For example, our current annual self-insured retention for general aviation aircraft liabilities incurred in connection with products manufactured by Teledyne Continental Motors, Inc., is approximately $21.0 million, a decrease from $22.9 million for the prior annual period. Our existing aircraft product liability insurance policy expires on May 31, 2008. Additionally, based on facts and circumstances of claims, we have not always accrued amounts up to the applicable annual self-insured retentions. Awarded damages could be more than our accruals. Product recalls can be expensive and tarnish our reputation and have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products. For example, Teledyne Continental Motors had been engaged in a product recall of 21 Table of Contents piston engine crankshafts as a result of which we recorded a $12.0 million pretax charge in the second quarter of 2000. In 2002, we reached a monetary settlement related to the 2000 recall with two of three companies that manufactured and processed allegedly defective steel subsequently made into aircraft engine crankshafts. We failed to win a jury verdict against a third company involved in making the steel. In 2008, we reached another monetary settlement with a materials supplier as a result of the 2000 product recall program. Through Aerosance, Inc., we have developed electronic controls, known as PowerLink FADEC, for piston aircraft engines that automate many functions requiring manual control, such as fuel flow and power management. While such control systems should improve engine management and facilitate maintenance of engines, we could face additional claims as they become standard equipment on selected new piston engine aircraft or are retrofitted on some piston engine aircraft. New products can trigger additional product liability claims as such products are further tested by actual usage. Additionally, general aviation aircraft crash lawsuits tend to name as defendants manufacturers of a multitude of aircraft-related products as discovery and recoveries are pursued. We have been joined, among a number of defendants (often over 100), in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos. We have not incurred material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits. The filings typically do not identify any of our products as a source of asbestos exposure, and we have been dismissed from cases for lack of product identification, but only after some defense costs have been incurred. Also, because of the prominent Teledyne name, we may be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not assumed by us as part of our 1999 spin-off. Our historic insurance coverage, including that of its predecessors, may not fully cover such claims and defense of such matters, as coverage depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors. Nonetheless, we intend to defend these claims vigorously. Congress from time to time has considered tort reform to deal with asbestos-related claims, but to date nothing has materialized. Certain gas generators manufactured by Teledyne Energy Systems, Inc. contain a sealed, wetted asbestos component. While the company has been transitioning to a replacement material, has placed warning labels on its products and takes care in handling of this material by employees, there is no assurance that the Company will not face product liability claims involving this component. Our Teledyne Brown Engineerings laboratory in Knoxville, Tennessee performs radiological analyses. While the laboratory is certified by the Department of Energy and has other nuclear-related certifications and internal quality controls in place, errors and omissions in analyses may occur. We currently have errors and omissions insurance coverage and nuclear liability insurance coverage that might apply depending on the circumstances. We also have sought indemnities from some of our customers. Our insurance coverage or indemnities, however, may not be adequate to cover potential problems associated with faulty radiological analyses. We cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any additional products. We may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverages, or be subject to increased costs for such coverage. As a manufacturer of a variety of products including aircraft engines used in general aviation aircraft, we have general liability and other insurance policies that provide coverage beyond self-insured retentions or deductibles. We cannot assure that, for 2008 and in future years, insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability, especially as it relates to general aviation. Over the last several years, the number of insurance companies providing general aviation product liability insurance coverage has decreased. If such insurance is available, we may be required to pay substantially higher prices for coverage and/or increase our levels of self-insured retentions or reserves. Our current aircraft product liability insurance policy expires in May 2008 and has an annual self-insured retention of approximately $21.0 million. 22 Table of Contents To offset aircraft product liability insurance costs, we continue to try to reduce manufacturing and other costs and also to pass on such insurance costs through price increases on its aircraft engines and spare parts. We cannot provide assurances that further cost reduction efforts will prove successful or that customers will accept additional price increases. Aircraft engines and spare part cost increases, coupled with increased costs of insurance for general aviation aircraft owners, tend to result in decreasing aftermarket sales of our piston engines. This, in turn, leaves our Aerospace Engines and Components segment more dependent on sales to OEMs, which is more dependent on general economic conditions. For certain electronic components for medical applications that we manufacture, such as those that go into cardiac defibrillators, we have asked for indemnities from our customers and/or to be included under their insurance policies. We cannot, however, provide any assurance that such indemnities or insurance will offset potential liabilities that we may incur as a result of our manufacture of such components. Aside from the uncertainties created by external events that can affect insurance coverages, such as the devastating 2005 hurricane season, our ability to obtain product liability insurance and the cost for such insurance are affected by our historical claims experience. While we have taken steps to improve our claims management process over the last few years, we cannot assure that, for 2008 and in future years, our ability to obtain insurance, or the cost for such insurance, or the amount of self-insured retentions or reserves will not be negatively impacted by our experience in prior years. Increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services. Although we believe that we have certain advantages that help us compete in our markets, each of our markets is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have, and potential competitors could have, greater name recognition, a larger installed base of products, more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial, technological and personnel resources than we do. New or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services. Industry consolidation trends, particularly among aerospace and defense contractors, could adversely affect demand for our products and services if prime contractors seek to control more aspects of vertically integrated projects. For example, the pending combination of the network activities of Nokia and Siemens could negatively impact our wireless transceivers business. Our general aviation piston engines business could face increasing competition from German-based Thielert Aircraft Engines GmbH as it continues to enter the U.S. market with retrofits and attracts OEMs. Low-cost competition from China and other developing countries could also result in decreased demand for our products. We sell products and services to customers in industries that are cyclical and sensitive to changes in general economic activity. We develop and manufacture products for customers in the energy exploration market, which has been cyclical and suffered from over capacity in prior years. Strong demand and increased prices for oil and natural gas contributed to substantial revenue growth at Teledyne Geophysical Instruments and ODI since 2003. A cyclical downturn in this market may affect future operating results, particularly given our broader range of marine instrumentation businesses since 2003. We derive significant revenues from the commercial aerospace industry. Domestic and international commercial aerospace markets are cyclical in nature. Historic demand for new commercial aircraft has been related to the stability and health of domestic and international economies. Delays or changes in aircraft and component orders could impact the future demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. While the market for commercial aircraft has improved since the downturn triggered by the events of September 11th and the war in Iraq, another such event could increase the level of uncertainty regarding future orders for aircraft. Many of the OEM customers of the businesses in our Aerospace Engines and Components segment are privately-held and may not be well-capitalized. In 2007, one of the airplane manufacturer customers of Teledyne Continental Motors filed a petition for bankruptcy, resulting in a $1.7 million write down of our accounts receivable. In February 2008, Adam Aircraft filed for bankruptcy protection. We have no unpaid 23 Table of Contents receivables from Adam Aircraft outstanding. Any future credit problems with our customers could result in similar or larger write downs. Several of our businesses are also suppliers to the semiconductor industry, which is highly cyclical by nature. The semiconductor industry has experienced significant, and sometimes prolonged, downturns. Any downturn in the semiconductor industry or any other industry that uses a significant number of semiconductor devices, such as consumer electronic products, telecommunication devices, or computing devices could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. In addition, we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and in mature industries that are sensitive to capacity. Adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services, which may reduce our profits, or our production levels, or both. We sell products to customers in industries that may undergo rapid and unpredictable changes. We develop and manufacture products for customers in industries that have undergone rapid changes in the past. For example, we manufacture products and provide manufacturing services to companies that serve telecommunications markets. During 2001, many segments of the telecommunications market experienced a dramatic and rapid downturn that resulted in cancellations or deferrals of orders for our products and services. This market, or others that we serve, may exhibit rapid changes in the future and may adversely affect our operating results, or our production levels, or both. We also manufacture products using fuel cell technology, which is a market that is not well established and subject to significant change and evolution. We are subject to the risks associated with international sales. During 2007, sales to international customers accounted for approximately 22% of our total revenues, as compared to 21% in 2006 and 18% in 2005. We anticipate that future sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues. Risks associated with these sales include:  political and economic instability;  international terrorism;  export controls, including U.S. export controls related to China;  changes in legal and regulatory requirements;  U.S. and foreign government policy changes affecting the markets for our products;  changes in tax laws and tariffs;  changes in U.S.-China relations; and  exchange rate fluctuations. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position. If the U.S. Dollar strengthens against the British Pound Sterling or Euro, our European customers may no longer find our product prices more attractive than European competitors. Sales of our products and services internationally are subject to U.S. and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices including regulations relating to import-export control. Violations of export control rules could result in suspension of our ability to export items from one or more business units or the entire corporation. Depending on the scope of the suspension, this could have a material effect on our ability to perform certain international contracts. Concerns over theft of technology for military uses, nuclear proliferation concerns, terrorism and other factors have resulted in increased export scrutiny of international sales, including some of our products to international customers. There has also been increasing export oversight and regulation of sales to China. Travel restrictions to Middle Eastern and other countries may 24 Table of Contents negatively affect continuing international sales or service revenues from such regions. There are also U.S. and international regulations relating to investments, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings, as well as varying currency, political and economic risks. Among other things, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. In particular, we may be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners even though our partners are not subject to the FCPA. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA could result in sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Compliance with increasing environmental regulations and the effects of potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse financial effect on us. We, like other industry participants, are subject to various federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations. We may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future. Future developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. While we have, as part of our overall risk management program, an environmental management and compliance program applicable to our operating facilities, including a review and audit program to monitor compliance where each facility is reviewed and audited by an internal environmental team every three years, such program does not eliminate potential environmental liabilities. In addition, while we conduct environmental-related due diligence in acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection, including indemnification from a seller, companies we acquire may have environmental liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition. For additional discussion of environmental matters, see the discussion under the caption Other Matters  Environmental of Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition and Note 15 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Increased environmental regulatory monitoring requirements of the air we breathe and the water we drink could have a favorable effect on the results of operations or financial condition of our instrumentation businesses, including the sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone gas monitoring business of Teledyne Advanced Pollution Instrumentation, Inc. and the water quality monitoring business of Teledyne Isco, Inc. Our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success. Our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. Recruiting and retaining skilled technical and engineering personnel has become even more competitive as the domestic economy has improved in recent years. Also, our Engineered Systems segment has already begun to face increasing competition for qualified engineering personnel as a result of the Department of Defense 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (also known as BRAC) decisions, particularly as positions continue to move to Huntsville, Alabama over the next several years. While we have engaged in succession planning, the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to sell, or exit on acceptable terms, product lines that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy. Consistent with our growth strategy to focus on markets to expand our profitable niche businesses, we continually evaluate our product lines to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy. For example, after the June 2004 acquisition of Isco, Inc., we determined that the on-line process control instrumentation business of 25 Table of Contents its German subsidiary was not aligned with our strategy, and in March 2005, we sold this non-strategic business. In 2007, principally because of the decision of a customer to manufacture certain medical products at its facilities in India, we closed our contract manufacturing operations in El Rubi, Mexico and transferred the remaining operations to our La Mesa, Mexico facility and our Lewisburg, Tennessee facility. Our ability to dispose of or exit product lines that may no longer be aligned with our growth strategy will depend on many factors, including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement, as well as industry, business and economic conditions. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell non-strategic product lines on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Also, if the sale of any non-strategic product line cannot be consummated or is not practical, alternative courses of action, including closure, may not be available to us or may be more costly than anticipated. Provisions of our governing documents, applicable law, and our Change in Control Severance Agreements could make an acquisition of Teledyne Technologies more difficult. Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated Bylaws and Rights Agreement and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware contain several provisions that could make the acquisition of control of Teledyne Technologies in a transaction not approved by our board of directors more difficult. We have also entered into Change in Control Severance Agreements with 14 members of our management, which could have an anti-takeover effect. The market price of our Common Stock has fluctuated significantly since our spin-off from ATI, and could continue to do so. Since the spin-off from ATI on November 29, 1999, the market price of our Common Stock has ranged from a low of $7.6875 to a high of $57.21 per share. At February 26, 2008, our closing stock price was $46.84. Fluctuations in our stock price could continue. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:  quarterly variations in our operating results;  strategic actions by us or our competitors;  acquisitions;  adverse business developments;  war in the Middle East or elsewhere;  additional terrorist activities;  increased military or homeland defense activities; changes to the Federal budget;  changes in the semiconductor, telecommunications, commercial aviation, energy exploration and electronic manufacturing services markets;  general market conditions;  changes in tax laws; and  general economic factors unrelated to our performance. The stock markets in general, and the markets for high technology companies in particular, have experienced a high degree of volatility not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies. We cannot provide assurances as to our stock price. Our financial statements are based on estimates required by GAAP, and actual results may differ materially from those estimated under different assumptions or conditions. Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. These principles require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of 26 Table of Contents revenue and expenses during the reporting period. For example, estimates are used when accounting for items such as asset valuations, allowances for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization, impairment assessments, employee benefits, taxes, aircraft product and general liability and contingencies. While we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made, actual results may differ materially from those estimated. While we believe our control systems are effective, there are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. We continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls, disclosure controls and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. Natural disasters, such as a serious earthquake or wildfire in California or a major hurricane in Alabama or Florida, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Several of our facilities, as a result of their locations could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by an earthquake, a hurricane or a tornado. Many of our production facilities and our headquarters are located in California and thus are in areas with above average seismic activity and may also be at risk of damage in wildfires. In addition, we have manufacturing facilities in the Southeastern United States and Texas that have been threatened and struck by major hurricanes. Our facilities in Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Nebraska and Tennessee have also been threatened by tornados. In 2007, prior to our acquisition of Storm Products Co., a tornado caused minor damage to one of its Dallas, Texas facilities. While Teledyne Continental Motors piston-engines manufacturing facility, located in Mobile, Alabama, Teledyne Geophysical Instruments facility in Houston, Texas, and ODIs facility in Daytona Beach, Florida were relatively fortunate with respect to the building damage and business interruption they suffered during the severe 2005 hurricane season, there can be no assurance that any one of them will be as fortunate in the future. If any of our California facilities, including our California headquarters, were to experience a catastrophic earthquake or wildfire loss or if any of our Alabama, Florida, Nebraska, Kansas, Tennessee or Texas facilities were to experience a catastrophic hurricane, storm or tornado, such event could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities. While Teledyne has property insurance to partially reimburse it for losses caused by windstorm and earth movement, such insurance would not cover all possible losses. In addition, our existing disaster recovery plans (including those relating to our information technology systems) may not be fully responsive to, or minimize losses associated with, catastrophic events.
