ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors: Our business is concentrated in and dependent upon the continued economic growth and welfare of our primary market areas. We operate primarily in North Eastern Massachusetts, primarily Essex County. The BankÂ’s general market areas consist of the municipalities in which it operates banking offices and all of the contiguous cities and towns. Our 9 branch offices are located in Essex County. The Company success is somewhat dependent upon the local economic conditions, business activity, population, income levels, deposits and real estate activity in these markets. Adverse economic conditions that affect these market areas could reduce our growth rate, affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans to us and generally affect our financial condition and results of operations. Because of our geographical concentration, we are less able than national financial institutions to diversify our credit risks across multiple markets. 18 Table of Contents We face intense competition in all phases of our business from other banks and financial institutions. The banking and financial services business in our market is highly competitive. Our competitors include large national and regional banks, local community banks, savings and loan associations, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, money market mutual funds, credit unions and other non-bank financial service providers. Some of these competitors are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions, have advantages of scale due to their size, or have cost advantages due to their tax status. These competitive factors may limit our growth and profitability. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable.
