Risk factors  Risks related to our business". Competition from producers of generics has increased sharply in response to healthcare cost containment measures and to the increased number of products for which patents or regulatory exclusivity have expired. Generics manufacturers who have received all necessary regulatory approvals for a product may decide to launch a generic version before the patent expiry date. Such launch may occur notwithstanding the fact that the owner of the original product may already have commenced patent infringement litigation against the generics manufacturer. Such launches are said to be "at risk" for the promoter of the generic product because it may be required to pay damages to the owner of the original product in the context of patent infringement litigation; however, these launches may also significantly impair the profitability of the pharmaceutical company whose product is challenged. Drug manufacturers also face competition through parallel trading, also known as reimportation. This takes place when drugs sold abroad under the same brand name as in a domestic market are imported into that domestic market by parallel traders, who may repackage or resize the original product or sell it through alternative channels such as mail order or the Internet. This situation is of particular relevance to the European Union, where these practices have been encouraged by the current regulatory framework. Parallel traders take advantage of the price differentials between markets arising from factors including sales costs, market conditions (such as intermediate trading stages), tax rates, or national regulation of prices. Finally, pharmaceutical companies face illegal competition from counterfeit drugs. The WHO estimates that counterfeit products account for 10% of the market worldwide, rising up to 30% in some countries. However, in markets where powerful regulatory controls are in place, counterfeit drugs are estimated to represent less than 1% of market value. B.6.3. Regulatory Framework B.6.3.1 Overview The pharmaceutical and health-related biotechnology sectors are highly regulated. National and supranational health authorities administer a vast array of legal and regulatory requirements that dictate pre-approval testing and quality standards to maximize the safety and efficacy of a new medical product. These authorities also regulate product labeling, manufacturing, importation/exportation and marketing, as well as mandatory post-approval commitments that may include pediatric development. 51 Table of Contents The submission of an application to a regulatory authority does not guarantee that a license to market will be granted. Furthermore, each regulatory authority may impose its own requirements during the course of the product development and application review. It may refuse to grant approval and require additional data before granting approval, even though the same product has already been approved in other countries. Regulatory authorities also have the authority to request product recalls, product withdrawals and penalties for violations of regulations based on data that are made available to them. Product approval can vary from six months or less to several years from the date of application depending upon the country. Factors such as the quality of data, the degree of control exercised by the regulatory authority, the review procedures, the nature of the product and the condition to be treated, play a major role in the length of time a product is under review. In recent years, efforts have been made by members of the ICH (International Conference on Harmonization) on harmonization of product development and regulatory submission requirements. The ICH consists of the regulatory agencies of the three founding members (the European Union, Japan, and the United States), plus Health Canada and Swissmedic as observers. An example of these efforts is the Common Technical Document (CTD), which is a format used for product applications in ICH, with only local or regional adaptation. In 2013, the ICH Steering Committee continued its discussions on its reform on increased engagement and implementation of guidelines globally, increased transparency, and reviewed future ICH topics. Organizational reform measures are planned to foster international cooperation. Emerging markets countries are starting to participate in ICH standardization discussions, and will be more involved in the near future. ICH has expanded beyond its initial members and observers with the 1999 formation of the Global Cooperation Group (GCG), which was formed as a subcommittee of the ICH Steering Committee in response to a growing interest in ICH Guidelines beyond the three ICH regions. Recognising the need to engage actively with other harmonisation initiatives, representatives from five Regional Harmonisation's Initiatives (RHIs) were invited to participate in GCG discussions: APEC, ASEAN, EAC, GCC, PANDRH and SADC. A further expansion of the GCG was agreed in 2007 and regulators were invited from countries with a history of ICH Guideline implementation and/or where major production and clinical research are carried out (Australia, Brazil, China, Chinese Taipei, India, Czech Republic, Russia and Singapore). International collaboration between regulatory authorities continues to develop with the implementation of confidentiality arrangements and memoranda of understanding between both ICH and non-ICH regulatory authorities. Examples include work-sharing on Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and Good Clinical Practices (GCP) inspections and regular interactions in the form of "clusters" (i.e. pediatrics, oncology, advanced therapy medicinal products, vaccines, pharmacogenomics, orphans, biosimilars, and blood products) between the United States and the European Union. In addition to the joint efforts listed above, Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) have proved to be one of the best ways to open up foreign markets to exporters and to allow for discussions on harmonization topics for regulatory authorities. Some agreements, such as the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), are international in nature, while others are between specific countries. The requirement of many countries, including Japan and several member states of the European Union, to negotiate selling prices or reimbursement rates for pharmaceutical products with government regulators significantly extends the time for market entry beyond the initial marketing approval. While marketing approvals for new pharmaceutical products in the European Union have been largely centralized with the EMA, pricing and reimbursement remain a matter of national competence. In the European Union, there are three main procedures by which to apply for marketing authorization: The centralized procedure is mandatory for drugs derived from biotechnologies, new active substances designed for human use to treat HIV, viral diseases, cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes and auto-immune diseases, orphan drugs and innovative products for veterinary use. When an application is submitted to the EMA, the scientific evaluation of the application is carried out by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) and a scientific opinion is prepared. This opinion is sent to the European Commission which adopts the final decision and grants an E.U. marketing authorization. Such a marketing authorization is valid throughout the E.U. and the drug may be marketed within all E.U. member states. If a company is seeking a national marketing authorization in more than one member state, the mutual recognition or decentralized procedure is available to facilitate the granting of harmonized national 52 Table of Contents authorizations across member states. Both the decentralized and the mutual recognition procedures are based on the recognition by national competent authorities of a first assessment performed by the regulatory authority of one member state. National authorizations are still possible, but are only for products intended for commercialization in a single E.U. member state or for line extensions to existing national product licenses. Generic products are subject to the same marketing authorization procedures. A generic product must contain the same active medicinal substance as a reference product approved in the E.U. Generic applications are abridged: generic manufacturers only need to submit quality data and demonstrate that the generic drug is "bioequivalent" to the originator product (i.e., works in the same way in the patient's body), but do not need to submit safety or efficacy data since regulatory authorities can refer to the reference product's dossier. Generic product applications can be filed and approved in the European Union only after the originator product eight-year data exclusivity period has expired. Further, generic manufacturers can only market their generic products after a 10- or 11-year period has elapsed from the date of approval of the originator product. Another relevant aspect in the E.U. regulatory framework is the "sunset clause": a provision leading to the cessation of the validity of any marketing authorization if it is not followed by marketing within three years or, if marketing is interrupted for a period of three consecutive years. Post-authorization safety monitoring of pharmaceutical products is carefully regulated in Europe. The E.U. pharmaceutical legislation for medicinal products describes the respective obligations of the marketing authorization holder and of the regulatory authorities to set up a system for pharmacovigilance in order to collect, collate and evaluate information about suspected adverse reactions. It is possible for the regulatory authorities to withdraw products from the market for safety reasons. Responsibilities for pharmacovigilance rest with the regulatory authorities of all the E.U. member states in which the marketing authorizations are held. In accordance with applicable legislation, each E.U. member state has a pharmacovigilance system for the collection and evaluation of information relevant to the benefit to risk balance of medicinal products. The regulatory authority regularly monitors the safety profile of the products available in its territory, takes appropriate action where necessary, and monitors the compliance of marketing authorization holders (MAHs) with their pharmacovigilance obligations. All relevant information is shared between the regulatory authorities and the MAH, in order to allow all parties involved in pharmacovigilance activities to fulfill their obligations and responsibilities. In 2010, new legislation aimed at improving patient protection by strengthening the E.U. system for the safety monitoring of medicines was approved. In July 2012, pharmacovigilance legislation came into force, with significant impacts on the regulatory environment. Changes include the creation of a new scientific advisory committee, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) at EMA level, with a key role in the assessment of all aspects of the risk management of the use of medicinal products for human use approved in the European Economic Area (EEA). This includes measures relating to the detection, assessment, minimisation and communication of the risk of adverse reactions, having due regard to the therapeutic effect of the medicinal product. This committee is also responsible for the design and evaluation of post-authorisation safety studies (PASS) and pharmacovigilance audits. Since its introduction in the second quarter of 2012 the PRAC has initiated reviews of marketed products (by class or on ad hoc basis) through various procedures. 38 Sanofi products underwent PRAC review from July 2012 to October 2013, generating 10 labeling variations (up to November 2013; two additional variations are ongoing). In only one case for Sanofi (Myolastan®) did the review lead to the product being withdrawn from the E.U. market. The pharmacovigilance legislation was amended in October 2012 by Regulation (EU) No 1027/2012 (applicable since June 5, 2013 to centrally authorized medicines) and Directive 2012/26/EU (applicable since October 28, 2013 to nationally authorized medicines). The amendments aim to further strengthen of the protection of patient health by promoting prompt and appropriate regulatory action on European medicines. The amendments include major changes to notification requirements: MAHs of human medicines have to notify E.U. regulators of any action to withdraw a product from the market, together with the reason for this action.These amendments also include other aspects: clarification of the scope and strengthened safety-referral procedures in the E.U.; improved coordination and facilitation of swift action and extension of assessment, for the benefit of public health; the scope of translation exemptions to include cases of severe issues of availability, including shortages of medicines, in order to facilitate the availability of medicines across the E.U.; and extension of the mandatory scope of the medicines subject to additional monitoring. 53 Table of Contents The Pharmacovigilance legislation also strengthens the legal basis for regulators to require post-authorization safety and efficacy studies throughout the life cycle of a medicinal product, with regulatory supervision of protocols and results. Such studies are aimed at collecting data to enable the safety or efficacy of medicinal products to be assessed in everyday medical practice. The granting of marketing authorization will be conditional on such studies being performed. Consequently, the pharmaceutical industry will have to build the need for post-authorization safety studies (PASS) and post-authorization efficacy studies (PAES) into development and life cycle management plans. Sanofi has put in place robust processes to ensure that required PASS and PAES can be properly implemented as required, either in the frame of a RMP (Risk Management Plan) or following a Health Authority request. The Pharmacovigilance legislation also introduces a new periodic safety report to be prepared by the pharmaceutical companies. This is no longer limited to safety data, but instead presents a critical analysis of the risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product, taking into account new or emerging information in the context of cumulative information on risks and benefits. Sanofi has fully implemented the new report since January 2013. In the United States, applications for approval are submitted for review to the FDA, which has broad regulatory powers over all pharmaceutical and biological products that are intended for sale and marketing in the U.S. To commercialize a product in the U.S., a New Drug Application (NDA) under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act or Biological License Application (BLA) under the Public Health Service (PHS) Act is submitted to the FDA with data for filing and pre-market review. Specifically, the FDA must decide whether the product is safe and effective for its proposed use, if the benefits of the drug's use outweigh its risks, whether the drug's labeling is adequate, and if the manufacturing of the drug and the controls used for maintaining quality are adequate to preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality and purity. Based upon this review, the FDA can require post-approval commitments and requirements. Approval for a new indication of a previously approved product requires the submission of a supplemental NDA (sNDA) for a drug or supplemental BLA (sBLA) for a biological product. The FD&C Act provides another abbreviated option for NDA approved products, called the 505(b)(2) pathway. This pre-market application may rely on the FDA finding that the reference product has been found to be safe and effective by the FDA based upon the innovator's preclinical and clinical data. Sponsors wishing to market a generic drug can file an Abbreviated NDA (ANDA) under 505(j) of the FD&C Act. These applications are "abbreviated" because they are generally not required to include data to establish safety and effectiveness, but need only demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent (i.e., performs in humans in the same manner as the originator's product). Consequently, the length of time and cost required for development of generics can be considerably less than for the originator's drug. With effect from October 1, 2012, under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) and the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments (GDUFA), an application for a generic drug product requires a user fee payment. The current review time for an ANDA exceeds 30 months. The ANDA pathway in the United States can only be used for generics of drugs approved under the FD&C Act. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law by President Obama on March 23, 2010, amends the Public Health Service Act to create an abbreviated licensure pathway (351k) for biological products that are demonstrated to be "biosimilar" to or "interchangeable" with an FDA-licensed biological product. As of January 1, 2014, no sponsor has submitted a 351k application to the FDA for review. The FDASIA, signed into law on July 9, 2012, expands the FDA's authority and strengthens its ability to safeguard and advance public health by giving the FDA the authority to collect user fees from industry to fund reviews of innovator drugs, medical devices, generic drugs and biosimilar biological products; promoting innovation to speed patient access to safe and effective products; increasing stakeholder involvement in FDA processes; and enhancing the safety of the drug supply chain. The FDA has established a three-year implementation plan, which is planned to be updated on a monthly basis. In Japan, regulatory authorities can require local development studies, though they also accept multi-national studies. They can also request bridging studies to verify that foreign clinical data are applicable to Japanese patients and require data to determine the appropriateness of the dosages for Japanese patients. These additional procedures have created a significant delay in the registration of some innovative products in Japan compared to the European Union and the United States. In order to solve this drug-lag problem, the MHLW (Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare) introduced the new NHI (National Health Insurance) pricing system on a trial basis in April 2010. Reductions in NHI prices of new drugs every two years are compensated by a "Premium" for a maximum of 15 years. A "Premium" is granted in exchange for the development of off-label indications with high medical needs. The pharmaceutical companies concerned are required to conduct submission based on available documentation within six months or start a clinical trial for registration within one year after the official development request of the off label 54 Table of Contents indications. For unproven drugs with high medical needs, clinical trials in Japanese patients are generally required. Otherwise, NHI prices of all products of the company would be reduced dramatically. Based on the reform of the NHI price system finalized on December 25, 2013, the "Premium" classification will be restricted to new products from companies which conduct R&D on "pharmaceuticals truly conducive to the improvement of healthcare quality," namely (a) pediatric/orphan drugs, (b) drugs to treat diseases which cannot be adequately controlled with existing drugs. The "Premium" policy will continue its trial stage. The PMDA plans to achieve its targets for a total review time of 12 months for products with standard review status and 9 months for products with priority review status for 80% (currently 50%) of all applications by the end of 2018. The PMDA also plans to eliminate the "review lag" between the application filing and approval of drugs and medical devices compared to the FDA by the end of 2020. The revised Pharmaceutical Affairs Law was enacted on November 27, 2013. There are three major objectives. The first objective is to strengthen safety measures for drugs and medical devices. In particular, MAHs must prepare a package insert based on the latest knowledge and notify the J-MHLW before placing products on the market or when revisions are made. The second objective is to accelerate the development of medical devices. The third-party accreditation system will be expanded to specially controlled generic medical devices (i.e. Class III devices). Consequently, the PMDA can accelerate the review of innovative medical devices. The third objective is accelerated commercialization of regenerative medicinal products. The term "Regenerative Medicinal Products" used in the law includes cellular and tissue-based products and gene therapies. This concept is similar to "Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs)" in the E.U. This law enables conditional regulatory approval based on confirmation of probable efficacy and safety in small-scale clinical trials, followed up by comprehensive studies to confirm safety and efficacy in a wider population that would then lead to a regular (full) approval. For new drugs and biosimilar products with approval applications submitted on or after April 2013 Japan will begin implementing an RMP, similar to the E.U. Pharmacogivilance system. For generic products, the data necessary for filing are similar to E.U. and U.S. requirements. Pharmaceutical companies only need to submit quality data, and data demonstrating bioequivalence to the originator product, unless the drug is administered intravenously. B.6.3.2 Biosimilars Products can be referred to as "biologics" when they are derived from plant or animal tissues, including blood products or products manufactured within living cells (e.g., antibodies). Most biologics are complex molecules or mixtures of molecules which are difficult to characterize and require physico-chemical-biological testing, and an understanding of and control over the manufacturing process. The concept of "generics" is not scientifically appropriate for biologics due to their high level of complexity and therefore the concept of "biosimilar" products is more appropriate. A full comparison of the purity, safety and efficacy of the biosimilar product against the reference biological product should be undertaken, including assessment of physical/chemical, biological, non-clinical and clinical similarity. In the European Union, a regulatory framework for developing and evaluating biosimilar products has been in place since November 2005. The CHMP has issued several product/disease specific guidelines for biosimilar products including guidance on preclinical and clinical development of biosimilars of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH). However, starting in 2011 and continuing in 2013, the EMA initiated a revision of the majority of the existing biosimilar guidelines (general over-arching guidelines, quality, non-clinical and clinical guidelines, comments on which had to be submitted to the EMA by end of 2013, as well as immunogenicity and product-related guidelines for recombinant insulin and LMWH). The major update in the revised over-arching biosimilar guideline is the opportunity to use a version of the reference product sourced outside the EEA provided bridging data are generated by the applicant. This important change will help facilitate the global development of biosimilars and will come into force via the revision of the over-arching biosimilar guideline, expected in 2014. 55 Table of Contents While the EMA has adopted a balanced approach for all biosimilars, allowing evaluation on a case-by-case basis in accordance with relevant biosimilar guidelines, the EMA has expressed some willingness to simplify the pathway in very specific circumstances. For a very simple biological fully characterized on the quality level, a biosimilar could be authorized based on a bioequivalence study combined only with an extensive quality package. With respect to vaccines, the CHMP position is that it is at present unlikely that these products may be characterized at the molecular level, and that each vaccine product must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. In 2013, the European Commission granted marketing authorisations for the first monoclonal-antibody biosimilar. This approval was considered a landmark decision by the EMA, proving that the biosimilar concept can be successfully applied to complex molecules such as monoclonal antibodies and that extrapolation of multiple indications is possible. Since February 2012, the FDA has published for consultation four draft scientific guidance documents for biosimilar development. All four of these guidance documents remain in draft format. At the December 2013 FDA-CMS meeting, the FDA acknowledged that the agency has had the equivalent of pre-NDA "meetings" in the biosimilar space. In Japan, guidelines defining the regulatory approval pathway for follow-on biologics were finalized in March 2009. These guidelines set out the requirements on preclinical and clinical CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control) data to be considered for the development of the new application category of biosimilars. Unlike the CHMP guidelines, the main scope of the Japanese guidelines includes recombinant proteins and polypeptides, but not polysaccharides such as LMWH. Many regulatory authorities worldwide have in place, or are in the process of developing, a regulatory framework for biosimilar development and approval. It should be noted that although many emerging markets are basing their regulations and guidance on WHO or EMA documentation, some markets have approved biosimilars under an existing regulatory framework that is not specific to biosimilars. B.6.3.3 Medical Devices Currently in the E.U., there is no pre-market authorisation by a regulatory authority. Instead there is a Conformity Assessment Procedure (for medium and high risk devices), involving an independent third party "Notified Body" (NB). Once certified, medical devices bear the CE-mark, allowing them to circulate freely in the EU/EFTA countries and Turkey. Medical Devices are currently regulated by three core Directives. On September 26, 2012 the European Commission adopted proposals to introduce two Regulations that will overhaul and tighten the current E.U. rules governing medical devices (EU Medical Device Directive 93/42/EC amended in 2007, 2007/47/EC). The proposed texts are currently being discussed in the European Parliament and in the Council. The position of the European Parliament Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) passed a vote on September 25, 2013, and ratified by the full European Parliament on October 22, 2013. With these votes, members of the European Parliament endorsed essential measures that will strengthen patient safety and which are supported by the industry, such as improving the competence and control of Notified Bodies, introducing unannounced site visits by Notified Bodies, increasing the transparency and traceability of medical devices, introducing a stricter post-market follow-up, and improved stakeholder engagement. A "scrutiny procedure" would be used at least for high-risk Class III devices (novel technologies or specific public health threats). The recycling of single use medical devices is still under discussion. The new revised framework also formally introduces the concept of "companion diagnostic", which is expected to deliver a more accurate definition of the patient population that will benefit from a given product. B.6.3.4 Generic drugs In the E.U., the number of positive opinions by centralized procedure for generics is unchanged year-on-year (16 in 2013). Most of the generics applications for chemical entities use mutual recognition and decentralized procedures, with about 8% of the procedures relating to non-prescription products. Pricing systems for generics remain at national level in the E.U. 56 Table of Contents In the U.S., to help the FDA ensure that participants in the U.S. generic drug system comply with U.S. quality standards and to increase the likelihood that American consumers get timely access to low cost, high quality generic drugs, the FDA and the industry have jointly agreed to a comprehensive user fee program (GDUFA) to supplement traditional appropriated funding, focused on safety, access, and transparency. In December 2013 the FDA and EMA announced the launch of a joint initiative to share information on inspections of bioequivalence studies submitted in support of generic drug approvals. This collaborative effort provides a mechanism to conduct joint facility inspections for generic drug applications submitted to both agencies. Taking part in this initiative are the EMA and the E.U. member states France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom The NHI price system will be reformed in Japan in fiscal year 2014, including a new special price reduction rule for long-listed drugs. The new rule would reduce the NHI prices of long-listed drugs whose generic replacement rates are less than 20% five years after their first generics join the NHI price list by 2.0% in the first NHI price revision, by 1.75% if the substitution rate is 20% or higher but less than 40%, and by 1.5% if the rate is 40% or higher but less than 60%. The rule would be introduced in April 2014. Under the new price system, NHI prices of first generics (currently set at 70%) would be set at 60% of the price of the originator product, while a 50% rule would be applied to oral first generics when more than 10, with the same ingredients, obtain listing. In addition, a 10% "precursor premium" would be introduced for new drugs with new mechanisms of action that obtain approval in Japan ahead of the rest of the world if they receive either the premium for innovativeness or the premium for usefulness. B.6.3.5 OTC drugs In the E.U., one product has had a prescription-to-OTC switch approved through Centralized Procedure since May, 2009. In the United States, FDA approved two first-in-class prescription-to-OTC switches in 2013, one of which was Sanofi's Nasacort® Allergy 24HR. The FDA's Nonprescription Drug Safe Use Regulatory Expansion (NSURE) Initiative was launched to explore regulatory approaches to expanding the nonprescription drug market but the timeline for implementation may be longer than some anticipated. In Japan, the J-MHLW drug safety committee meeting held on December 20, 2013 decided on the details of safety evaluations for drugs newly switched from prescription to OTC, following the passage of a bill to revise the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law (PAL). The J-MHLW will give the green light for online sales of such OTC drugs if no safety concerns arise during their three-year safety evaluation period (the safety evaluation period is currently four years). During the three-year evaluation period, drugs that moved from prescription to OTC will have to be categorized as products that require pharmacist consultations when purchasing. Under the new plan, the J-MHLW will require marketing authorization holders to submit interim reports upon the completion of their post-marketing surveillance (PMS). Based on these interim reports and other reports on adverse events, the J-MHLW will evaluate serious adverse events two years after the launch of OTC drugs or later. B.6.3.6 Transparency and public access to documents Transparency regarding clinical trials Over the last two to three years the pharmaceutical industry has been subject to growing pressure for greater transparency about clinical trials (conduct and results). Regulatory authorities are also being pushed for more openness and transparency, for example by making more comprehensive disclosures about the rationale and basis of regulatory decisions on medicinal products, so as to enhance the credibility of the regulatory process. This is a significant driver of the transparency initiatives undertaken in several countries. Pharmaceutical manufacturers have committed to publishing protocols and results of clinical studies performed with their products in publicly accessible registries. In addition, both ICH and non-ICH countries often impose mandatory disclosure of clinical trials information. 57 Table of Contents From a regulatory perspective, ambitious initiatives have been undertaken by the major regulatory authorities. E.U. pharmaceutical legislation for medicinal products requires national regulatory authorities and the EMA to actively publish information concerning authorization and supervision of medicinal products. The EMA has introduced a series of initiatives aimed at improving the transparency of its activities, such as improving the format of the European Public Assessment Report and web-published product approvals, withdrawals and rejections. In addition, there is an increased focus on comparative efficacy and effectiveness. The new E.U. pharmacovigilance legislation aims at giving greater transparency, especially with regard to communication of safety issues (e.g. public hearings, specific European web-portals with information on medicinal products). Finally, patients and consumers are increasingly involved in the work of the EMA's scientific committees. In June 2013, the EMA released a draft policy on publication and access to clinical-trial data. In the U.S., the FDA launched a Transparency Initiative in June 2009. The objective of the initiative was to render the FDA much more transparent and open to the American public by providing the public with useful, user-friendly information about agency activities and decision-making. The FDA Transparency Initiative has three phases: Phase I  Improving the understanding of the FDA basics (completed with ongoing updates); Phase II  Improving the FDA's disclosure of information to the public (ongoing); and Phase III  Improving the FDA's transparency to regulated industry (ongoing). Proposals to improve transparency and access to information were released for consultation for both Phase II and Phase III. Some of the less controversial proposals have been implemented; others, such as proactive release of information that the Agency has in its possession, may require revisions to U.S. federal regulations. The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) have strengthened their long-standing commitment to enhancing public health by endorsing joint "Principles for Responsible Clinical Trial Data Sharing". Under the new commitments, biopharmaceutical companies will dramatically increase the amount of information available to researchers, patients, and members of the public. On January 2, 2014 Sanofi announced its commitment to expanding access to its clinical trial data. In Japan, the J-MHLW/PMDA actively publishes information concerning approvals of medicinal products (ethical drugs, non-prescription drugs, and quasi-drugs) and medical devices. For ethical drugs discussed at the J-MHLW's Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council, the redacted clinical trials data module 1&2 (except for commercial confidential information and personal data) have been made publicly available on the PMDA website. Transparency regarding Health Care Professionals Regarding transparency regarding Health Care Professionals (HCP), there is no common harmonized approach in the E.U. For transparency purpose, there is an increased external scrutiny of interactions between pharmaceutical companies and HCPs at national level with legal provisions or with Healthcare Industry voluntary undertakings (Pharma Code) in some countries (such as United Kingdom, Denmark, France, Portugal or Slovakia). The EFPIA released mid-2013 a new Code on Disclosure of Transfers of Value from Pharmaceutical Companies to HCPs and Healthcare Organizations (HCOs) the "EFPIA HCP/HCO Disclosure Code". The compliance with this new Disclosure Code has become an obligation for EFPIA's memberships, who are required to transpose this Code into their national codes in full by 31 December 2013. This new Code includes stricter rules on hospitality and gifts, with the requirement for member associations to include a threshold on hospitality in their national codes and the prohibition of gifts. B.6.3.7 Other new legislation proposed or pending implementation Clinical trials regulation: a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, repealing Directive 2001/20/EC, was first released in July 2012. On December 20, 2013, the Council of the E.U. endorsed a compromise agreement, reached by the Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission. The move opens the way to the regulation's final approval before the parliamentary elections in May 2014. One of the main objectives behind a new proposal for clinical trials regulation by the European Commission was the impact on the competitiveness of the European life sciences industry caused by changes to the conditions of the 58 Table of Contents clinical trial approval process. The new legislation was drafted as a more stringent form of regulation instead of a directive in order to reach better harmonization between countries, without interfering with Member States' competences in terms of ethical aspects. While the final text has not been released yet, the following major points are known: The timeline for approving a clinical trial proposal was set at 60 days without questions (and a maximum of 99 with questions and clock stops). This can be seen as a setback for the industry, as the Commission's proposal was based on 41 days without questions and a maximum of 74 days including all possible delays. In the case of advanced therapy medicinal products, the timeline can be extended by another 50 days, making 110 days in total. To make both the reference state and the relevant Member States comply with the timelines, the legislation includes the concept of tacit approval. The fact that this feature was accepted by all parties can be seen as a positive outcome for the industry. As regards transparency requirements for clinical trial data submitted through a single E.U. submission portal and stored in a Union-level database, the new clinical trial regulation allows for protection of personal data of patients and commercially confidential information, which is in line with the industry data sharing laid out in Policy 70 (see previous section). Selection of reference Member State by the sponsor was maintained. During the three-year transition period, both sets of rules will apply in parallel. Falsified medicines: implementation of Directive 2011/62/EU: The European Union has reformed the rules for importing active substances for medicinal products for human use into the E.U. As of January 2, 2013, all imported active substances must have been manufactured in compliance with good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards or standards at least equivalent to GMP. The manufacturing standards in the E.U. for active substances are those of the "International Conference for Harmonisation"  ICH Q7. As of July 2, 2013, such compliance must be confirmed in writing by the competent authority of the exporting country, except for countries with waivers. Written confirmation must also confirm that the plant where the active substance was manufactured is subject to control and enforcement of GMP at least equivalent to that in the E.U. Implementation of Directive 2011/62/EU was expected by July 2, 2013. To date 17 of the 27 Member States have yet to transpose the directive in to national law. A major uncertainty was expected regarding potential temporary drug shortages in the E.U. in cases where manufacturers were unable to supply the required documentation. At end 2013, no shortages of medicines from innovator or generic companies associated with the Falsified Medicines Directive had been identified, largely due to measures taken by companies to avoid importation problems. In the U.S., on November 28, 2013, President Obama signed into law H.R. 3204, the Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA). The legislation introduces a federal track-and-trace system for medicines with serial numbers added to individual packs and (non-mixed) cases within four years of the legislation being adopted, and electronic tracing of production through the supply chain mandated within 10 years. It also strengthens licensure requirements for wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers, and requires the FDA to maintain a database of wholesalers that will be available to the public through its website. The law also boosts oversight of compounding pharmacies that make drugs to order, with the FDA getting greater powers to oversee large-volume or 'outsourcing' compounders without individual prescriptions. NDA electronic clinical trial data submission: In Japan, the PMDA intends to require pharmaceutical companies to submit clinical trial data for their NDAs in electronic formats, beginning in fiscal year 2016  a move that would allow the authority to efficiently store and analyze the data to improve its efficacy and safety predictions. Under its plan, the PMDA would launch a pilot program this fiscal year, which would run through to the end of fiscal year 2015, to verify its capabilities for storing, managing, and analyzing submitted electronic data with its current setup. Although the agency aims to require such electronic data filings from fiscal year 2016, it will also consider transitional measures to smooth the way for the full changeover. 59 Table of Contents Such mandatory electronic submissions are expected to be limited to clinical trial data for new drugs newly filed for regulatory approval. The necessity of the electronic submission for Phase I trial data will likely be decided on a case-by-case basis, while makers will be required to file nonclinical toxicity study data in one of the SEND (Standard for the Exchange on Non-clinical Data) formats in due course. In the E.U., electronic submission for marketing authorization and variation applications has already been in place for many years. To allow secure submission over the internet for all types of eCTD applications for human medicines, the EMA launched the eSubmission Gateway; this was followed by the eSubmission web client, launched in January, 2013. From March, 2014, the use of the eSubmission Gateway or web client will become mandatory for all eCTD submissions through the centralized procedure, order to improve efficiency and decrease costs for applicants. The EMA will extend the use of eSubmission Gateway and web client to paediatric submissions, veterinary medicines and referral procedures in the near future. B.6.4. Pricing & Reimbursement Rising overall healthcare costs are leading to efforts to curb drug expenditures in most markets in which Sanofi operates. Increasingly, these efforts result in pricing and market access controls for pharmaceuticals. The nature and impact of these controls vary from country to country, but some common themes are reference pricing, systematic price reductions, formularies, volume limitations, patient co-pay requirements, and generic substitution. In addition, governments and third party payers are increasingly demanding comparative / relative effectiveness data to support their decision making process. They are also increasing their utilization of emerging healthcare information technologies such as electronic prescribing and health records to enforce transparency and tight compliance with these regulations and controls. As a result, the environment in which pharmaceutical companies must operate in order to make their products available to patients and providers who need them continues to grow more complex each year. Significant recent pricing events and trends include: In the United States, mandatory health insurance has begun (January 1, 2014). The positive effects of this on the size of the market should begin to appear over the coming years, while increased mandated rebates will have a deleterious effect on the net value of products in these segments of the market. In Europe, the financial crisis of recent years seems to have stabilised. The long-anticipated Value-Based Pricing system in the UK has not led to considerable changes from previous framework agreements. Instead, a new edition of the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme has been approved, while certain evaluation criteria used by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) are to be revised in 2014. In Germany, the price freeze implemented under the law on the restructuring of the pharmaceutical market (AMNOG) and scheduled to finish at the end of 2013 has been temporarily extended so that debates can take place to renew the measure for the medium term. However, the mandatory rebate has been reduced from 16% to 6% as scheduled. The global theme of universal healthcare, with implementation underway in several regions, has led to many issues in funding. Price controls for all products and all sectors of the market have been at issue and are anticipated to be a subject for scrutiny in the future. Among the large emerging markets, India has finally implemented price control. Also, instances of positions taken against innovative product patents have multiplied and compulsory licensing has again been considered with a wider therapeutic scope. Russia continues to widen its programme of pilot insurance schemes and reforms to its Essential Drugs List price controls are expected in 2014, while legislation favours national production. National production is also a theme of policy in Brazil. We believe that third party payers will continue to act to curb the cost of pharmaceutical products. While the impact of these measures cannot be predicted with certainty, we are taking the necessary steps to defend the accessibility and price of our products in order to reflect the value of our innovative product offerings: We actively engage with our key stakeholders on the value of our products to them. These stakeholders  including physicians, patient groups, pharmacists, government authorities and third party payers  can have a significant impact on market access for our products. We continue to add flexibility and adaptability to our operations so as to better prepare, diagnose, and address issues in individual markets. 60 Table of Contents Conscious of the importance of recognizing the value of our products and the high cost of R&D, we continue to analyze innovative pricing and access strategies that balance patient access with appropriate rewards for innovation. Specifically, we are involved in risk sharing agreements with payers, whereby part of the financial risk related to a treatment's success is carried by the marketing company. Those agreements provide that clinical efficacy be monitored after launch, for a specified period of time and patient population. The price and reimbursement level of the drug is then either confirmed or revised based on these post-marketing results. We are also actively looking at tiered pricing options where this is possible, allowing wider access to populations that would otherwise be denied this for new, innovative therapies. B.7. Patents, Intellectual Property and Other Rights Patent Protection We own a broad portfolio of patents, patent applications and patent licenses worldwide. These patents are of various types and may cover: active ingredients; pharmaceutical formulations; product manufacturing processes; intermediate chemical compounds; therapeutic indications/methods of use; delivery systems; and enabling technologies, such as assays. Patent protection for individual products typically extends for 20 years from the patent filing date in countries where we seek patent protection. A substantial part of the 20-year life span of a patent on a new molecule (small molecule or biologic) has generally already passed by the time the related product obtains marketing approval. As a result, the effective period of patent protection for an approved product's active ingredient is significantly shorter than 20 years. In some cases, the period of effective protection may be extended by procedures established to compensate regulatory delay in Europe (a Supplementary Protection Certificate or SPC), the United States (a Patent Term Extension or PTE) and Japan (also a PTE). Additionally, the product may benefit from the protection of patents obtained during development or after the product's initial marketing approval. The protection a patent affords the related product depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage, and may also vary from country to country. In Europe for instance, applications for new patents may be submitted to the European Patent Office (EPO), an intergovernmental organization which centralizes filing and prosecution. As of December 2013, an EPO patent application may cover the 38 European Patent Convention member states, including all 27 member states of the European Union. The granted "European Patent" establishes corresponding national patents with uniform patent claims among the member states. However, some older patents were not approved through this centralized process, resulting in patents having claim terms for the same invention that differ by country. Additionally, a number of patents prosecuted through the EPO may pre-date the European Patent Convention accession of some current European Patent Convention member states, resulting in different treatment in those countries. In 2013, E.U. regulations were signed to create a European patent (Unitary Patent) and a Unified Patent Court. However, they will only enter into force once the agreement on the Unified Patent Court is ratified by at least 13 Member States including France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. As of the date of this document only Austria has ratified. The Unitary Patent will provide a unitary protection within the participating states of the European Union (when ratified by the member states with the exception of Italy and Spain). The Unified Patent Court will be a specialized patent court with exclusive jurisdiction for litigation relating to European patents and Unitary patents. The Court will be composed of a central division (with seat in Paris and the pharmaceutical section in London) and by several local and regional divisions in the contracting Member States to the agreement. The Court of Appeal will be located in Luxembourg. 61 Table of Contents We monitor our competitors and vigorously seek to challenge patent infringement when such challenges would negatively impact our business objectives. See "Item 8  A. Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information  Patents" of this annual report. The expiration or loss of a patent covering a new molecule, typically referred to as a compound patent, may result in significant competition from generic products and can result in a dramatic reduction in sales of the original branded product. See "Item 3. Key Information  D. Risk Factors  We may lose market share to competing remedies or generic brands if they are perceived to be equivalent or superior products". In some cases, it is possible to continue to obtain commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets or from other types of patents, such as patents on processes, intermediates, structure, formulations, methods of treatment, indications or delivery systems. Certain categories of products, such as traditional vaccines and insulin, have been historically relatively less reliant on patent protection and may in many cases have no patent coverage, although it is increasingly frequent for novel vaccines and insulins to be patent protected. See " Focus on Biologics" below. Patent protection is also an important factor in our animal health business, but is of comparatively lesser importance to our Consumer Health Care and generics businesses, which rely principally on trademark protection. Regulatory Exclusivity In some markets, including the European Union and the United States, many of our pharmaceutical products may also benefit from multi-year regulatory exclusivity periods, during which a generic competitor may not rely on our clinical trial and safety data in its drug application. Exclusivity is meant to encourage investment in research and development by providing innovators the exclusive use for a limited time of the innovation represented by a newly approved drug product. This exclusivity operates independently of patent protection and may protect the product from generic competition even if there is no patent covering the product. In the United States, the FDA will not grant final marketing approval to a generic competitor for a New Chemical Entity (NCE) until the expiration of the regulatory exclusivity period (five years) that commences upon the first marketing authorization of the reference product. The FDA will accept the filing of an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) containing a patent challenge one year before the end of this regulatory exclusivity period (see the descriptions of ANDAs in " Product Overview  Challenges to Patented Products" below). In addition to the regulatory exclusivity granted to NCEs, significant line extensions of existing NCEs may qualify for an additional three years of regulatory exclusivity. Also, under certain limited conditions, it is possible to extend unexpired U.S. regulatory and patent-related exclusivities by a pediatric extension. See " Pediatric Extension", below. Further, in the United States, a different regulatory exclusivity period applies to biological drugs. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 ("BPCIA"), was enacted on March 23, 2010 as part of the much larger health care reform legislation known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ("PPACA"). The BPCIA introduced an approval pathway for biosimilar products. A biosimilar product is a biologic product that is highly similar to the reference (or innovator) product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and which has no clinically meaningful differences from the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product. The BPCIA provides that an application for a biosimilar product that relies on a reference product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years after the date on which the reference product was first licensed, and that the FDA may not approve a biosimilar application until 12 years after the date on which the reference product was first licensed. In the European Union, regulatory exclusivity is available in two forms: data exclusivity and marketing exclusivity. Generic drug applications will not be accepted for review until eight years after the first marketing authorization (data exclusivity). This eight-year period is followed by a two-year period during which generics cannot be marketed (marketing exclusivity). The marketing exclusivity period can be extended to three years if, during the first eight-year period, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which are deemed to provide a significant clinical benefit over existing therapies. This is known as the "8+2+1" rule. In Japan, the regulatory exclusivity period varies from four years for medicinal products with new indications, formulations, dosages, or compositions with related prescriptions, to six years for new drugs containing a medicinal composition, or requiring a new route of administration, to eight years for drugs containing a new chemical entity, to ten years for orphan drugs or new drugs requiring pharmaco-epidemiological study. Emerging Markets One of the main limitations on our operations in emerging market countries is the lack of effective intellectual property protection or enforcement for our products. The World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade- 62 Table of Contents Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIP) has required developing countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products since January 1, 2005, although it provides a limited number of developing countries an extension to 2016. Additionally, these same countries frequently do not provide non-patent exclusivity for innovative products. While the situation has gradually improved, the lack of protection for intellectual property rights or the lack of robust enforcement of intellectual property rights poses difficulties in certain countries. Additionally, in recent years a number of countries facing health crises have waived or threatened to waive intellectual property protection for specific products, for example through compulsory licensing of generics. See "Item 3. Key Information  D. Risk Factors  Risks Relating to the Group Structure and Strategy  The globalization of the Group's business exposes us to increased risks" Pediatric Extension In the United States and Europe, under certain conditions, it is possible to extend a product's regulatory exclusivities for an additional period of time by providing data regarding pediatric studies. In the United States, the FDA may ask a company for pediatric studies if it has determined that information related to the use of the drugs in the pediatric population may produce health benefits. The FDA has invited us by written request to provide additional pediatric data on several of our main products. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, timely provision of data meeting the FDA's requirements (regardless of whether the data supports a pediatric indication) may result in the FDA extending regulatory exclusivity and patent life by six months, to the extent these protections have not already expired (the so-called "pediatric exclusivity"), for example, Lantus® received FDA grant of pediatric exclusivity. In Europe, a regulation on pediatric medicines provides for pediatric research obligations with potential associated rewards including extension of patent protection (for patented medicinal products) and regulatory exclusivity for pediatric marketing authorization (for off-patent medicinal products). In Japan, for pediatric research there is no extension of patent protection (for patented medicinal products), however, it may result in an extension of marketing exclusivity from 8 to 10 years. Orphan Drug Exclusivity Orphan drug exclusivity may be granted in the United States to drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions (affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the U.S. or in some cases more than 200,000 with no expectation of recovering costs). Obtaining orphan drug exclusivity is a two-step process. An applicant must first seek and obtain orphan drug designation from the FDA for its drug. If the FDA approves the drug for the designated indication, the drug will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity runs from the time of approval and bars approval of another application (ANDA, 505(b)(2), New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologic License Application (BLA)) from a different sponsor for the same drug in the same indication for a seven-year period. Whether a subsequent application is for the "same" drug depends upon the chemical and clinical characteristics. The FDA may approve applications for the "same" drug for indications not protected by orphan exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivities also exist in the European Union and Japan. Product Overview We summarize below the intellectual property coverage in our major markets of the marketed products described above at " Pharmaceutical Products  Main Pharmaceutical Products". Concerning animal health products, Merial's intellectual property coverage is described above (see " Animal Health: Merial"). In the discussion of patents below, we focus on active ingredient patents (compound patents) and any later filed patents listed, as applicable, in the FDA's list of Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the "Orange Book") or on their foreign equivalents. These patents or their foreign equivalents tend to be the most relevant in the event of an application by a competitor to produce a generic version of one of our products (see " Challenges to Patented Products" below). In some cases, products may also benefit from pending patent applications or from patents not eligible for Orange Book listing (e.g., patents claiming industrial processes). In each case below, we specify whether the active ingredient is claimed by an unexpired patent. Where patent terms have been extended to compensate for regulatory delay, the extended dates are presented below. U.S. patent expirations presented below reflect U.S. Patent and Trademark Office dates, and also reflect six-month pediatric extensions to the FDA's Orange Book dates for Lantus®. Where patent terms have expired we indicate such information and mention if generics are on the market. 63 Table of Contents We do not provide later filed patent information relating to formulations already available as an unlicensed generic. References below to patent protection in Europe indicate the existence of relevant patents in most major markets in the European Union. Specific situations may vary by country, most notably with respect to older patents and to countries having only recently joined the European Union. We additionally set out any regulatory exclusivity from which these products continue to benefit in the United States, European Union or Japan. Regulatory exclusivities presented below incorporate any pediatric extensions obtained. While E.U. regulatory exclusivity is intended to be applied throughout the European Union, in some cases member states have taken positions prejudicial to our exclusivity rights.

The suit was triggered by Eli Lilly's submission to FDA of an NDA (505(b)(2) New Drug Application) seeking approval to sell an insulin glargine drug product. The suit resulted in a stay during which the FDA cannot approve Eli Lilly's NDA. The stay is expected to expire the earlier of (i) a court decision favorable to Eli Lilly or (ii) June 2016.

For example, notwithstanding the presence of unexpired patents, competitors launched generic versions of Eloxatin® in Europe, Allegra® in the United States (prior to the product being switched to over-the-counter status) and Plavix® in Europe. We caution the reader that there can be no assurance that we will prevail when we assert a patent in litigation and that there may be instances in which the Group determines that it does not have a sufficient basis to assert one or more of the patents mentioned in this report, for example in cases where a competitor proposes a formulation not appearing to fall within the claims of our formulation patent, a salt or crystalline form not claimed by our composition of matter patent, or an indication not covered by our method of use patent. See "Item 3. Key Information  D. Risk Factors  Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters  We rely on our patents and proprietary rights to provide exclusive rights to market certain of our products, and if such patents and other rights were limited or circumvented, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected". As disclosed in Item 8 of this annual report, we are involved in significant litigation concerning the patent protection of a number of our products. Challenges to Patented Products In the United States, companies have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs), containing challenges to patents related to a number of our products. An ANDA is an application by a drug manufacturer to receive authority to market a generic version of another company's approved product, by demonstrating that the purportedly generic version has the same properties as the original approved product. ANDAs may not be filed with respect to drugs licensed as a biological. See " Focus on Biologics" below. An ANDA relies on the safety and other technical data of the original approved product, and does not generally require the generic manufacturer to conduct clinical trials (thus the name "abbreviated" new drug application), presenting a significant benefit in terms of time and cost. As a result of regulatory protection of our safety and other technical data, the ANDA may generally be filed only five years following the initial U.S. marketing authorization of the original product. See " Regulatory Exclusivity" above. This period can be reduced to four years if the ANDA includes a challenge to a patent listed in the FDA's Orange Book. However, in such a case if the patent holder or licensee brings suit in response to the patent challenge within the statutory window, then the FDA is barred from granting final approval to an ANDA during the 30 months following the patent challenge (this bar is referred to in our industry as a "30-month stay"), unless, before the end of the 30 months, a court decision or settlement has determined either that the ANDA does not infringe the listed patent or that the listed patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. FDA approval of an ANDA after this 30-month period does not resolve outstanding patent disputes, but it does remove the regulatory impediments to a product launch by a generic manufacturer willing to take the risk of later being ordered to pay damages to the patent holder. In the European Union, a generic drug manufacturer may only reference the data of the regulatory file for the original approved product after data exclusivity has expired. However, there is no patent listing system in Europe 68 Table of Contents comparable to the Orange Book, which would allow the patent holder to prevent the competent authorities from granting marketing approval by bringing patent infringement litigation prior to approval. As a result, generic products may be approved for marketing following the expiration of marketing exclusivity without regard to the patent holder's rights. Nevertheless, in most of these jurisdictions once the competing product is launched and in some jurisdictions, even prior to launch (once launch is imminent), the patent holder may seek an injunction against such marketing if it believes its patents are infringed. See Item 8 of this annual report. The accelerated ANDA-type procedures are potentially applicable to many, but not all, of the products we manufacture. See " Focus on Biologics" and " Regulation" below. We seek to defend our patent rights vigorously in these cases. Success or failure in the assertion of a given patent against a competing product is not necessarily predictive of the future success or failure in the assertion of the same patent  or a fortiori the corresponding foreign patent  against another competing product due to factors such as possible differences in the formulations of the competing products, intervening developments in law or jurisprudence, local variations in the patents and differences in national patent law and legal systems. See "Item 3. Key Information  D. Risk Factors  Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters  We rely on our patents and proprietary rights to provide exclusive rights to market certain of our products, and if such patents and other rights were limited or circumvented, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected". Trademarks Our products are sold around the world under trademarks that we consider to be of material importance in the aggregate. Our trademarks help to identify our products and to protect the sustainability of our growth. Trademarks are particularly important to the commercial success of our CHC, generics and retail animal health business. It is our policy to protect and register our trademarks with a strategy adapted to each product or service depending on their countries of commercialization: i.e., on a worldwide basis for worldwide products or services, or on a regional or local basis for regional or local products or services. The process and degree of trademark protection vary country by country, as each country applies its own trademark laws and regulations. In most countries, trademark rights may only be obtained through formal trademark application and registration. In some countries, trademark protection can be based primarily on use. Registrations are granted for a fixed term (in most cases ten years) and are renewable indefinitely, except in some countries where maintenance of the trademarks is subject to their effective use. When trademark protection is based on use, it covers the products and services for which the trademark is used. When trademark protection is based on registration, it covers only the products and services designated in the registration certificate. Additionally, in certain cases, we may enter into a coexistence agreement with a third-party that owns potentially conflicting rights in order to better protect and defend our trademarks. Our trademarks are monitored and defended based on this policy and in order to prevent counterfeit, infringement and/or unfair competition. B.8. Production and Raw Materials For many years, we have chosen to keep the manufacture of our products in-house in order to have better control of quality and distribution. Our production process consists of three principal stages: the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients, the transformation of these ingredients into products, and packaging. Our general policy is to produce our main active ingredients and principal products at our own plants in order to minimize our dependence on external manufacturers and to maintain strict and precise control over the product throughout the production cycle. In some cases, however, we rely on third parties for the manufacture and supply of certain active ingredients and medical devices. We have outsourced some of our production, under supply contracts associated with plant divestitures or to establish a local presence to capitalize on growth in emerging markets. In particular, we outsource part of the production of the active ingredients used in Stilnox® and Xatral®, and certain pharmaceutical product formulations. Our main pharmaceutical subcontractors are Famar, MSD, Unither, Valeant and Alza. These subcontractors follow our general quality and logistics policies, as well as meeting other criteria. See "Item 3. Key Information  D. Risk Factors  Risks Relating to Our Business". 69 Table of Contents We also obtain active ingredients from third parties under partnership agreements. This applies to the monoclonal antibodies developed with Regeneron. Our pharmaceutical production sites are divided into three categories: Global sites, which serve all markets. Situated principally in Europe, these facilities are dedicated to the manufacture of our active ingredients, injectables, and a number of our principal products in solid form; Regional sites, which serve markets at continental level, in Europe and particularly the BRIC-M countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and Mexico), giving us a strong industrial presence in emerging markets; Local sites, which serve their domestic market only. Sanofi Pasteur produces vaccines at sites located in North America, France, Mexico, China, Thailand, Argentina and India. The pharmaceutical sites at Le Trait (France) and Anagni (Italy) also contribute to Sanofi Pasteur's industrial operations by making available their aseptic filling and freeze-drying facilities. In 2013, the new influenza vaccine production plant at Shenzhen was approved by the Chinese authorities (CFDA). In 2011, we diversified our industrial operations into rare diseases (with the acquisition of Genzyme) and via the integration of Merial, Sanofi's dedicated animal health division. Merial markets pharmaceutical products (Frontline®, Heartgard®, Zactran®, Previcox®) and a broad range of vaccines for different animal species (dogs, cats, horses, ruminants, pigs and fowl). A number of pharmaceutical products are subcontracted (Heartgard®, Eprinex®) but almost all veterinary vaccines are manufactured at its own plants. Merial's dedicated animal health industrial operations cover all activities, from the purchase of raw materials through to the delivery of the finished product, meeting customer needs through a reliable and flexible offering that meets quality expectations. There are 18 production sites spread across nine countries. All of our pharmaceutical and vaccine facilities are GMP compliant, in line with international guidelines. Our principal sites are approved by the FDA. This applies to our pharmaceutical facilities in France (Ambarès, Tours, Le Trait, Maisons-Alfort, Compiègne and Lyon); in the United Kingdom (Haverhill, Holmes Chapel, and Fawdon, the latter due to close in 2015); in Ireland (Waterford); in Germany (Frankfurt); in Hungary (Veresegyhaz); in Italy (Anagni); and in the United States (Saint Louis and Chattanooga). Our Vaccines sites with FDA approval are Marcy l'Étoile and Le Trait (Fluzone® ID USA) in France; Swiftwater, Canton and Rockville in the United States; and Toronto in Canada. The Genzyme facilities in the United States (Allston, Framingham, Ridgefield, Cambridge, Northpointe-Lynnwood, Woburn and Northborough) and in Europe (Geel, Belgium) are all FDA approved. Our Animal Health facilities in Athens, Worthington, Gainesville, Berlin and Raleigh in the United States are managed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), while the sites at Paulinia (Brazil) and Toulouse (France) have FDA approval for some of their operations. Wherever possible, we seek to have multiple plants approved for the production of key active ingredients and our strategic finished products. This is the case with Lovenox®, for example. On May 24, 2010, Genzyme entered into a consent decree with the FDA relating to the facility at Allston in the United States, following FDA inspections at the facility that resulted in observations and a warning letter raising Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) deficiencies. A consent decree is a court order entered by agreement between a company and the government (in this case the FDA) that requires the company to take certain actions as set out in the decree. Under the terms of Genzyme's consent decree, Genzyme is permitted to continue manufacturing at the site during the remediation process, subject to compliance with the terms of the consent decree. The consent decree requires Genzyme to implement a plan to bring the Allston facility operations into compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The plan must address any deficiencies reported to Genzyme or identified as part of an inspection completed by a third-party expert in February 2011. Genzyme has itself retained an expert to monitor and oversee the implementation of the remediation workplan. This workplan was submitted to the FDA in April 2011 and accepted by the FDA in January 2012, and is expected to be completed in 2016. It includes a timetable of specified milestones. If the milestones are not met in accordance with the timetable, the FDA can require 70 Table of Contents us to pay $15,000 per day, per affected drug, until these compliance milestones are met. Upon satisfying all compliance requirements in accordance with the terms of the consent decree, Genzyme will be required to retain an auditor to monitor and oversee ongoing compliance at the Allston facility for an additional five years. To date, all requirements of the consent decree, including all requirements of the workplan, have been met by Genzyme. In March 2012, modifications to the workplan were submitted to the FDA to take account of planned changes in manufacturing operations for Fabrazyme® and Cerezyme® at the Allston facility. These modifications were accepted by the FDA. In addition, the U.S. facility at Framingham was approved by the FDA and the EMA in January 2012 for the production of Fabrazyme® (agalsidase beta). Production of the Fabrazyme® active substance at the Allston factory ended in 2012. In July 2012, Sanofi Pasteur received a warning letter from the FDA following routine inspections conducted at its facilities in Toronto (Canada) and Marcy l'Étoile (France). Sanofi Pasteur is working actively with the FDA to implement a series of immediate and ongoing measures to address the issues raised in the warning letter and to further strengthen its production tools and quality systems. In June and September 2013, follow-up inspections took place at the Marcy l'Etoile and Toronto facilities respectively. Though significant progress in quality systems was reported by the U.S. authorities at the time of the inspections, Sanofi Pasteur decided to strengthen and accelerate its improvement plan in the third quarter of 2013. More details about our manufacturing sites are found below at section "D. Property, Plant and Equipment". B.9. Insurance and Risk Coverage We are protected by four key insurance programs, relying not only on the traditional corporate insurance and reinsurance market but also on our captive insurance company, Carraig Insurance Ltd (Carraig). These four key programs cover Property & Business Interruption, General & Product Liability, Stock and Transit, and Directors & Officers Liability. Our captive insurance company, Carraig, participates in our coverage for various lines of insurance mainly including Property & Business Interruption, Stock and Transit, and General & Product Liability. Carraig is run under the supervision of the Irish regulatory authorities, is wholly-owned by Sanofi, and has sufficient resources to meet those portions of our risks that it has agreed to cover. It sets premiums for Group entities at market rates. Claims are assessed using the traditional models applied by insurance and reinsurance companies, and the company's reserves are regularly verified and confirmed by independent actuaries. Our Property & Business Interruption program covers all Group entities worldwide, wherever it is possible to use a centralized program operated by our captive insurance company. This approach shares risk between Group entities, enabling us to set deductibles and guarantees that are appropriate to the needs of local entities. It also incorporates a prevention program, including a comprehensive site visit program covering our production, storage, research and distribution facilities and standardized repair and maintenance procedures across all sites. Specialist site visits are conducted every year to address specific needs, such as testing of sprinkler systems or emergency plans to deal with flooding risks. The Stock and Transit program protects goods of all kinds owned by the Group that are in transit nationally or internationally, whatever the means of transport, and all our inventories wherever they are located. Sharing risk between Group entities means that we can set deductibles at appropriate levels, for instance differentiating between goods that require temperature controlled distribution and those that do not. We have developed a prevention program with assistance from experts, implementing best practices in this area at our distribution sites. This program, which is led by our captive insurance company, has substantial capacity, largely to deal with the growth in sea freight which can lead to a concentration of value in a single ship. Our General & Product Liability program has been renewed for all our subsidiaries worldwide wherever it was possible to do so, despite the increasing reluctance in the insurance and reinsurance market to cover product liability risks for large pharmaceutical groups. For several years, insurers have been reducing product liability cover because of the difficulty of insuring some products that have been subject to numerous claims. These products are excluded from the cover provided by insurers, and hence from the cover obtained by us on the insurance market. This applies to a few of our products, principally those described in Note D.22.a) to our consolidated financial statements included at 71 Table of Contents Item 18 in this annual report. Because of these market conditions we have increased, year by year, the extent to which we self-insure. The principal risk exposure for our pharmaceutical products is covered with low deductibles at the country level, the greatest level of risk being retained by our captive insurance company. The level of risk self-insured by the Group  including our captive reinsurance company  enables us to retain control over the management and prevention of risk. Our negotiations with third-party insurers and reinsurers are tailored to our specific risks. In particular, they allow for differential treatment of products in the development phase, for the discrepancies in risk exposure between European countries and the United States, and for specific issues arising in certain jurisdictions, including generics coverage in the U.S. Coverage is adjusted every year in order to take into account the relative weight of new product liability risks, such as those relating to rare diseases with very low exposure or to healthcare products which do not require marketing approval. Our cover for risks that are not specific to the pharmaceutical industry (general liability) is designed to address the potential impacts of our operations. For all lines of business of Carraig, outstanding claims are covered by provisions for the estimated cost of settling all claims incurred but not paid at the balance sheet date, whether reported or not, together with all related claims handling expenses. Where there is sufficient data history from the company or from the market for claims made and settled, management  with assistance from independent actuaries  prepares an actuarial estimate of the company's exposure to unreported claims for the risks covered. The actuaries perform an actuarial valuation of the company's IBNR (incurred but not reported) and ALAE (allocated loss adjustment expense) liabilities at year end. Two ultimate loss projections (based upon reported losses and paid losses respectively) are computed each year using the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method; these projections form the basis for the provisions set. The Directors & Officers Liability program protects the legal entities under our control, and their directors and officers. Our captive insurance company is not involved in this program. The Group also operates other insurance programs, but these are of much lesser importance than those described above. All the insurance programs are backed by best-in-class insurers and reinsurers and are designed in such a way that we can integrate most newly-acquired businesses on a continuous basis. Our cover has been designed to reflect our risk profile and the capacity available in the insurance market. By centralizing our major programs, not only do we reduce costs, but we also provide world-class coverage for the entire Group. B.10. Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) The manufacturing and research operations of Sanofi are subject to increasingly stringent health, safety and environmental (HSE) laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex and rapidly changing, and Sanofi invests the necessary sums in order to comply with them. This investment, which aims to respect health, safety and the environment, varies from year to year and totaled approximately €86 million in 2013. The applicable environmental laws and regulations may require Sanofi to eradicate or reduce the effects of chemical substance usage and release at its various sites. The sites in question may belong to the Group, be currently operational, or they may have been owned or operational in the past. Under some of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of a property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances on, under or in its property, or transported from its property to third party sites, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or under certain circumstances caused the presence of the contaminants, or at the time site operations occurred, the discharge of those substances was authorized. 72 Table of Contents Moreover, as is the case for a number of companies involved in the pharmaceutical, chemical and agrochemical industries, soil and groundwater contamination has occurred at some Group sites in the past, and may still occur or be discovered at others. In the Group's case, such sites are mainly located in the United States, Germany, France, Hungary, the Czech Republic,, Brazil, Italy and the United Kingdom. As part of a program of environmental audits conducted over the last few years, detailed assessments of the risk of soil and groundwater contamination have been carried out at current and former Group sites. In cooperation with national and local authorities, the Group regularly assesses the rehabilitation work required and carries out such work when appropriate. Long-term rehabilitation work is in progress or planed in Rochester, Cincinnati, Mount-Pleasant, East Palo Alto, and Portland in the United States; Frankfurt in Germany; Beaucaire, Valernes, Limay, Rousset, Romainville, Neuville, Vitry, Tours and Toulouse in France; Dagenham in the United Kingdom; Brindisi and Garessio in Italy; Ujpest in Hungary; Prague in the Czech Republic; and on a number of sites divested to third parties and covered by contractual environmental guarantees granted by Sanofi. Sanofi may also have potential liability for investigation and cleanup at several other sites. Provisions have been established for the sites already identified and to cover contractual guarantees for environmental liabilities for sites that have been divested. For example, the Group is currently participating in an assessment process for natural resource damage liability (NRD) and in the allocation process for future remediation costs that are related to the past operations of a former Rhone-Poulenc site in Portland Harbor, Oregon. The Group retains the ultimate liability for these costs under contractual environmental guarantees granted at the time of Bayer's acquisition of the CropScience business. Rehabilitation studies and an NRD assessment are underway in a similar project in Portland, Oregon. Potential environmental contingencies arising from certain business divestitures are described in Note D.22.e) to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. In 2013, Sanofi spent € 52 million on rehabilitating sites previously contaminated by soil or groundwater pollution. During the year ended December 31, 2013, a comprehensive review was carried out relating to the legacy of environmental pollution. In light of data collected during this review, the Group adjusted the provisions to approximately €698 million as at December 31, 2013; Due to changes in environmental regulations governing site remediation, the Group's provisions for remediation obligations may not be adequate due to the multiple factors involved, such as the complexity of operational or previously operational sites, the nature of claims received, the rehabilitation techniques considered, the planned timetable for rehabilitation, and the outcome of discussions with national regulatory authorities or other potentially responsible parties, as in the case of multiparty sites. Given the long industrial history of some of our sites and the legacy obligations of Aventis arising from its past involvement in the chemical and agrochemical industries, it is impossible to quantify the future impact of these laws and regulations with precision. See "Item 3.D. Risk Factors  Environmental Risks of Our Industrial Activities". To our knowledge, the Group has not been subject in 2013 to liabilities for non-compliance with current HSE laws and regulations that could be expected to significantly jeopardize its activities, financial situation or operating income. We also believe that we are in substantial compliance with current HSE laws and regulations and that all the environmental permits required to operate our facilities have been obtained. Regular HSE audits (43 in 2013) are carried out by the Group in order to assess compliance with our standards (which implies compliance with regulations) and to initiate corrective measures. Additionally, 81 specialized audits covering contractors (72) or biosafety (9) and 164 loss prevention technical visits were carried out by our teams in 2013. Sanofi has implemented a worldwide master policy on health, safety and the environment to promote the health and well-being of the employees and contractors working on its sites and respect for the environment. We consider this master policy to be an integral part of our commitment to social responsibility. In order to implement this master policy, 78 rules (policies) have been drawn up in the key fields of HSE management, Good HSE Practices, safety in the workplace, process safety, industrial hygiene, health in the workplace and protection of the environment. Health From the development of compounds to the commercial launch of new drugs, Sanofi research scientists continuously assess the effect of products on human health. This expertise is made available to employees through two committees responsible for chemical and biological risk assessment. The Group's COVALIS committee classifies all chemical and pharmaceutical products handled within the Group and establishes workplace exposure limits for each of them. The Group's TRIBIO Committee is responsible for classifying all biological agents according to their degree of pathogenicity, and applies rules for their containment and the preventive measures to be respected throughout the Group. See "Item 3. Key Information  D. Risk Factors  Environmental Risks of Our Industrial Activities  Risks from the handling of hazardous materials could adversely affect our results of operations". 73 Table of Contents Appropriate industrial hygiene practices and programs are defined and implemented in each site. These practices consist essentially of containment measures for collective and individual protection against exposure in all workplaces where chemical substances or biological agents are handled. All personnel are monitored with an appropriate initial and routine medical program, focused on the potential occupational health risks linked to their duties. In addition, a committee has been set up to prepare and support the implementation of the new European Union REACH regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals. To fully comply with the new European regulation on the labeling of chemicals (Classification Labeling Packaging), the Group has registered the relevant hazardous chemical substances with the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). Safety Sanofi has rigorous policies to identify and evaluate safety risks and to develop preventive safety measures, and methods for checking their efficacy. Additionally, Sanofi invests in training that is designed to instill in all employees a sense of concern for safety, regardless of their duties. These policies are implemented on a worldwide scale to ensure the safety of all employees and to protect their health. Each project, whether in research, development or manufacturing, is subject to evaluation procedures, incorporating the chemical substance and process data communicated by the COVALIS and TRIBIO committees described above. The preventive measures are designed primarily to reduce the number and seriousness of work accidents and to minimize exposures involving permanent and temporary Sanofi employees as well as our sub-contractors. The French chemical manufacturing sites in Aramon, Sisteron and Vertolaye, as well as the plants located in the Hoechst Industry Park in Frankfurt, Germany, and the chemical production site in Budapest, Hungary, are listed Seveso II (from the name of the European directive that deals with potentially dangerous sites through a list of activities and substances associated with classification thresholds). In accordance with French law on technological risk prevention, the French sites are also subject to heightened security inspections due to the toxic or flammable materials stored on the sites and used in the operating processes. Risk assessments of processes and installations are drawn up according to standards and internal guidelines incorporating the best state-of-the-art benchmarks for the industry. These assessments are used to fulfill regulatory requirements and are regularly updated. Particular attention is paid to any risk-generating changes: process or installation changes, as well as changes in production scale and transfers between industrial or research units. Our laboratories that specialize in process safety testing, which are fully integrated into our chemical development activities, apply methods to obtain the physico-chemical parameters of manufactured chemical substances (intermediate chemical compounds and active ingredients) and apply models to measure the effect of potentially leachable substances in the event of a major accident. In these laboratories the parameters for qualifying hazardous reactions are also determined to define scale-up process conditions while transferring from development stage to industrial scale. All these data ensure that our risk assessments are relevant. We believe that the safety management systems implemented at each site, the hazard studies carried out and the risk management methods implemented, as well as our third-party property insurance policies covering any third-party physical damage, are consistent with legal requirements and the best practices in the industry. Environment The main objectives of our environmental policy are to implement clean manufacturing techniques, minimize the use of natural resources and reduce the environmental impact of our activities. In order to optimize and improve our environmental performance, we have a strategy of continuous improvement practiced at all our sites through the annual implementation of HSE progress plans. In addition, 54 sites are currently ISO 14001 certified and 15 buildings are LEED certified either in U.S. and Europe. We believe that this strategy clearly expresses the commitment of both management and individuals to health, safety and the environment. In 2013, eight of our European sites were included in the scope of the European CO2 Emissions Credit Trading Scheme aimed at helping to reach the targets set by the Kyoto protocol. Our recent efforts in terms of environmental protection have mainly targeted reductions in energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions control, improvements in the performance of water treatment installations, reduction of volatile organic compound emissions, raw material savings and recycling, and reductions in waste materials or increases in the percentage being recycled. In 2013, we reduced carbon dioxide emissions caused by our sales representation car fleet by 10% versus 2012 due to the policy of using energy efficient cars as well as a reduction in 74 Table of Contents the number of cars. Measured against the benchmark year for our new targets (2010), direct and indirect emissions from our production and research facilities (excluding vehicle fleets) have fallen by 11.0% overall. We are targeting a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions in 2020 vs. 2010 on a constant structure basis. An internal committee of experts called ECOVAL assesses the environmental impact of the pharmaceutical agents found in products marketed by Sanofi. It has developed an environmental risk assessment methodology and runs programs to collect the necessary data for such assessments. Additional ecotoxicity assessments are being performed on certain substances which predate current regulations, in order to obtain information that was not gathered when they were launched (as regulatory requirements were different at that time) and evaluate environmental risks resulting from their use by patients. C. Organizational Structure Significant subsidiaries Sanofi is the holding company of a consolidated group of subsidiaries. The table below sets forth our significant subsidiaries and affiliates as of December 31, 2013. For a list of the principal companies in our consolidated group, see Note F. to our consolidated financial statements, included in this annual report at Item 18.

The financial effects of the Genzyme acquisition are presented in Note D.1.3. to our consolidated financial statements, included in this annual report at Item 18. The financial effects of the Merial acquisition are presented in Note D.1.3. to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2010, included in our annual report on Form 20-F for that year. In certain countries, we carry on some of our business operations through joint ventures with local partners. We have also entered into worldwide marketing arrangements. Two of our major products (Plavix® and Aprovel®) are marketed through an alliance with BMS, Actonel® is marketed through an alliance with Warner Chilcott (acquired by Actavis), and Zaltrap® is marketed through an alliance with Regeneron. See "Item 5  Financial Presentation of Alliances". Internal organization of activities Sanofi and its subsidiaries form a group, organized around three activities: Pharmaceuticals, Human Vaccines (Vaccines) and Animal Health. Within the Group, responsibility for research and development (R&D) in their respective fields rests with Sanofi and Genzyme Corporation (Pharmaceuticals), Sanofi Pasteur and Sanofi Pasteur, Inc. (Vaccines), and Merial Ltd 75 Table of Contents and Merial S.A.S. (Animal Health); these entities define strategic priorities and coordinate R&D efforts. To fulfill this role, these entities subcontract R&D work to subsidiaries that have the necessary resources. They also license patents, manufacturing know-how and trademarks to certain French and foreign subsidiaries. In these cases, the licensee subsidiaries manufacture and distribute the Group's products, either directly or via local distribution entities. Our industrial property rights, patents and trademarks are mainly held by the following companies: Pharmaceuticals: Sanofi, Aventis Pharma S.A. (France), Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH (Germany), Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC and Genzyme Corporation (United States); Vaccines: Sanofi Pasteur (France) and Sanofi Pasteur, Inc. (United States); Animal Health: Merial Ltd (United Kingdom) and Merial S.A.S. (France). For a description of our principal items of property, plant and equipment, see Item 4.D.

D.2. Description of our sites Sanofi industrial sites The profound transformation of Sanofi and the increased importance of our growth platforms are driving the continuing evolution of our Industrial Affairs department in support of our new business model. As a result, since June 2013 the Industrial Affairs department has been responsible for all production and quality operations within the Group. The department focuses on the needs of customers and the quality of service, the sharing of lean manufacturing practices, the development of a common culture committed to quality, and the sharing of expertise within technology platforms, particularly in biologics and injectables. 76 Table of Contents We carry out our industrial production at 112 sites in 41 countries (including 37 sites in emerging markets): 82 sites for our Pharmaceuticals activity, including Genzyme; 12 sites for the industrial operations of Sanofi Pasteur in vaccines; and 18 sites for the Animal Health activities of Merial. In 2013, we produced the following quantities: Pharmaceuticals: 3,153 million boxes produced and packaged (3,758 including outsourced production); Vaccines: 476 million containers prepared (including outsourced production); and Animal Health: 550 million doses of vaccines for all species other than avian, 90 billion doses of avian vaccines, and 68 million units of pharmaceutical products. We believe that our production facilities are in compliance with all regulatory requirements, are properly maintained and are generally suitable for future needs. Nonetheless, we regularly inspect and evaluate these facilities with regard to environmental, health, safety and security matters, quality compliance and capacity utilization. For more information about our property, plant and equipment, see Note D.3 to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18 of this annual report and "B.8 Production and Raw Materials." Industrial Sites: Pharmaceuticals Production of chemical and pharmaceutical products is the responsibility of our Industrial Affairs department, which is also in charge of most of our logistics facilities (distribution and storage centers). The sites where our major drugs, active ingredients, specialties and medical devices are manufactured are: France: Ambarès (Aprovel®, Depakine®, Multaq®), Aramon (irbesartan), Compiègne (Arava®, Orelox®, Magne B6®), Le Trait (Lovenox®), Lyon Gerland (Thymoglobulin®, Celsior®), Maisons-Alfort (Lovenox®), Neuville-sur-Saône (which discontinued its traditional chemicals activities at end 2013 with the transfer of dronedarone production to the Sisteron site), Quetigny (Stilnox®, Plavix®), Sisteron (clopidogrel bisulfate, dronedarone, zolpidem tartrate), Tours (Stilnox®, Aprovel®, Xatral®), Vitry-sur Seine (docetaxel/ aflibercept); Germany: Frankfurt (insulins, Ramipril, Lantus®, Tritace®, oncology, Taxotere®, Eloxatine®, medical devices, Apidra®); Ireland: Waterford (Myozyme®, Lumizyme®, Cholestagel®, Thymoglobulin®, Renagel®, Renvela®, and Cerezyme®); Italy: Scoppito (Tritace®, Amaryl®) and Anagni (Depakine®, Fasturtec®, Rifa antibiotic family); United Kingdom: Dagenham (Taxotere® and Eloxatine®, production of which was transferred to Frankfurt in Germany after closure of the site in June 2013), Fawdon (Plavix®, Aprovel®), Haverhill (sevelamer hydrochloride API (Renagel®), sevelamer carbonate API (Renvela®), Cerezyme®, Fabrazyme®, Thyrogen®, Myozyme®, etc), and Holmes Chapel (Nasacort®, Flutiform); Hungary: Ujpest (irbesartan), Csanyikvölgy (Lovenox®); Japan: Kawagoe (Plavix®); United States: Kansas City (Allegra®, currently being transferred to Tours and Compiègne in France), and Chattanooga (Consumer Health Care products); Brazil: Suzano (Amaryl® and Novalgine®) and Campinas (generics); Mexico: Ocoyoacac (Flagyl®); and Singapore: Jurong (enoxaparin).

In May 2009, we began construction of a new vaccine manufacturing center at our Neuville-sur-Saône site in France. This €300 million investment over the 2009-2011 period, the largest ever made by Sanofi, is intended to gradually replace the chemicals activity on the site, which was discontinued at the end of 2013, by vaccine production from 2014 onwards. Sanofi Pasteur owns its R&D and production sites, either freehold or under finance leases with a purchase option exercisable at expiration of the lease. Industrial Sites: Animal Health (Merial) Merial has 18 industrial sites in nine different countries, 15 R&D sites, and numerous administrative offices including its headquarters at Lyon, France.

Vaccines research and development sites are presented above. In Animal Health, research and development activities are conducted at 15 sites. 78 Table of Contents D.3. Acquisitions, Capital Expenditures and Divestitures The carrying amount of our property, plant and equipment at December 31, 2013 was €10,182 million. During 2013, we invested €1,082 million (see Note D.3. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18 of this annual report), mainly in increasing capacity and improving productivity at our various production and R&D sites. Our principal capital expenditures and divestitures in 2011, 2012 and 2013 are described in Notes D.1. ("Impact of changes in the scope of consolidation"), D.2. ("Merial"), D.3. ("Property, plant and equipment") and D.4. ("Goodwill and other intangible assets") to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18 of this annual report. As of December 31, 2013, our firm commitments in respect of future capital expenditures amounted to €324 million. The principal sites involved were: for the Pharmaceuticals segment, the industrial facilities at Frankfurt (Germany), Framingham and Allston (United States), Vertolaye (France), and in Hungary; and for the Vaccines segment, the facility at Swiftwater (United States). In the medium term and assuming no changes in the scope of consolidation, we expect to invest on average €1.3 billion a year in property, plant and equipment. We believe that our own cash resources and the undrawn portion of our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund these expenditures. Our principal ongoing investments are described below. During 2013, our industrial network actively contributed to the development of our seven growth platforms: Emerging Markets, Diabetes Solutions, Consumer Health Care, Genzyme and Other Innovative Products (all of which are part of our Pharmaceuticals segment), Vaccines, and Animal Health. Pharmaceuticals In our Diabetes Solutions growth platform, the Frankfurt site  the principal manufacturing center for Sanofi Diabetes products  is being equipped with a new aseptic processing area that uses isolator technology to significantly improve the aseptic filling process and improve productivity. This investment will be operational in 2016. The Frankfurt site also celebrated the production of its billionth SoloSTAR® insulin pen on World Diabetes Day in November 2013. In February 2013, Sanofi announced it was investing €44 million in Genzyme's biotechnology campus in Waterford, Ireland. In particular, Sanofi will be investing in filling facilities for Lantus®. Subject to regulatory approval, Lantus® should go into commercial production in Waterford in 2017. The Sanofi Diabetes industrial network is also expanding its footprint in emerging markets, both in Russia with the Orel site, which is now Sanofi's second largest insulin pen production site after Frankfurt, and in China (Beijing), where a new facility inaugurated in 2012 has begun assembly and packaging of SoloSTAR®, the pre-filled injection system for Lantus®. Finally in order to incorporate Shantha (India) into Sanofi's injectables platform, a certain number of technologies for manufacturing Insuman® insulin are currently being transferred from the Frankfurt site to the Indian site so that it can handle filling and packaging for the local market. Our industrial pharmaceutical operations for the Consumer Health Care platform are based on a network of 10 production sites spread over four growth hubs: in Europe, with the Lisieux (France) factories producing Doliprane®, Origgio (Italy), Cologne (Germany) and Rzeszow (Poland); in Asia, where the new consumer products facility at Hangzhou in China (production capacity: 3 billion pills) has been operational since the beginning of 2013, as well as the Tangshan (China) and Virginia (Australia) sites; in South America, with the Suzano (Brazil) site; and in the United States, with the Chattem site, which in September 2013 launched the over-the-counter antacid Rolaids® product from its Chattanooga (Tennessee) production facility (which in 2012 led preparations for the U.S. launch of the pediatric oral suspension formulation of Allegra®). In 2013, the industrial development teams also continued making an active contribution to consumer health care product launches, expanding our presence in this highly competitive market. In the Other Innovative Products platform, our industrial teams are pooling their expertise to develop ever more sophisticated processes. Three dedicated biotech hubs are being developed in Europe at Frankfurt (Germany); Vitry-sur-Seine (France), our biggest integrated cell culture facility, which in 2013 completed a production campaign of aflibercept (the active ingredient of Zaltrap®) as well as launching production of a new product; and Lyon Gerland (France), a new world center dedicated to production of thymoglobulin® for the prevention and treatment of transplant rejection. In March 2013, a bioproduction platform was launched to develop synergies between Pharmaceuticals, Sanofi Pasteur, Genzyme, Merial and the Biotherapeutics businesses. This platform will enable Sanofi to build its 79 Table of Contents presence in biotechnologies by taking advantage of transversal opportunities, in particular in the use of production capacity, development, technologies of the future in biotechnology, and skills management. The development of our Emerging Markets platform is built on a network of over 30 regional and local industrial sites in 20 countries, supporting growth in these markets. In addition to our recent investments in China in Diabetes Solutions and CHC, a number of other projects are under way. In the Middle East, 2012 saw Sanofi lay the foundation stone for a facility in Saudi Arabia that will produce solid pharmaceutical formulations, which will be marketed from 2015. In Latin America, where we already have a large industrial footprint, the Brasilia plant has been operational since 2013, producing oral antibiotics and generic contraceptives, with potential capacity of 66 million units. In addition, after the acquisition of Genfar at end 2012, Sanofi is now the leading player in the Colombian pharmaceuticals market and in the generics market, with the Villa-Rica factory supporting the Sanofi production site at Cali. In India since 2012, the Ankleshwar Pharma site in Gujarat State (India) has handled packaging and quality control through to release of the first commercial batches of AllStar, the first high-quality affordable insulin pen. The Goa site (India) invested to extend its solid formulation production capacity to around 2.5 billion pills a year. In Vietnam, Sanofi announced in March 2013 that it was investing $75 million in the construction of a new factory to produce specialty pharmaceuticals and CHC products from 2015. In Algeria, where Sanofi has been operating for over 20 years, the foundation stone of the new Sidi Abdellah factory was laid in September 2013. This site, which will be the largest Sanofi industrial complex in the Africa/Middle East territory, will mainly produce dry and liquid formulations, and will also host a distribution center. It will have production and distribution capacity of 100 million units per annum, or around 80% of the volumes distributed by Sanofi in Algeria. During 2013, our Pharmaceuticals segment continued to roll out the economic performance improvement plan launched in 2011. Based on its Sanofi Manufacturing System, the plan is intended to deliver performance standards commensurate with the diversity of our pharmaceuticals businesses and markets, and to meet the industrial challenges ahead to 2020. Our Industrial Affairs department is constantly adapting the network of industrial sites to market needs, as a result of which a number of sites are in the process of sale or closure, such as Kansas City in 2015 (United States), Dagenham in 2013 and Fawdon in 2015 (United Kingdom), Romainville in 2013, and the traditional chemicals business in Neuville-sur-Saône in 2013 (France). The industrial network of the Genzyme growth platform is predominantly located in the United States where major investments are under way. The site at Allston (Massachusetts) has initiated a major investment program in connection with the implementation of its compliance remediation workplan, approved by the FDA in January 2012. In addition, the Framlington Biologics site, based at 74 New York Avenue, has started construction of a new factory to increase purification capacity for production of Fabrazyme® representing an investment of $83 million. Vaccines (Sanofi Pasteur) Sanofi Pasteur is undergoing a major investment phase, particularly the new dedicated dengue fever vaccine facility at Neuville (France), which produced its first batches in 2014. Two new dedicated influenza vaccine facilities are in the start-up phase: Shenzhen (China), approved by the Chinese authorities (CFDA) at end 2013, and Ocoyoacac (Mexico). Ocoyoacac was approved by the Mexican authorities at the start of 2012, had a successful first influenza vaccination season in Mexico in 2013, and is currently doubling its capacity for 2014. In response to observations made by the FDA during routine inspections conducted in 2012 in Toronto (Canada) and Marcy l'Etoile (France), Sanofi Pasteur initiated and stepped up a compliance program to address the quality issues identified. Animal Health (Merial) Merial is adapting its industrial capacity to keep pace with the growing animal health market. In 2012, Merial acquired Newport Laboratories, which has an autogenous vaccine production facility at Worthington, Minnesota (United States). In order to support the future growth of avian and other vaccines in the Chinese market, Merial has invested $70 million in a new site in the Nanchang high-tech development zone, which was inaugurated in October 2013. In Brazil at the Paulinia site, Merial is adapting its industrial facilities for the production of the new product NexGard (to be governed by European Union Good Manufacturing Practices and approved by the FDA). 80 Table of Contents Innovation and culture of industrial excellence In 2013 Sanofi highlighted industrial innovation by organizing its fifth annual round of innovation trophies, centered on patient needs, industrial performance and citizen entrepreneurship. In addition, the investment in an innovative biosynthesis process at the Saint-Aubin-Lès-Elbeuf and Vertolaye sites in France is entering the final phase before start-up and production, with the certification/approval of the numerous items of fermentation and extraction plant which will improve Sanofi's international competitiveness in the production of corticosteroids. The Chemistry and Biotechnology teams were awarded the 2013 industry prize by the Chemistry Society of France for developing an innovative industrial process for manufacturing artemisinin, used as the basis for anti-malarial drugs. Finally, the development teams won the Good Design Award, one of the most important industrial design prizes, giving worldwide recognition for Lyxumia® and its AllStar and JuniorSTAR® insulin pens. The ambition of our Industrial Affairs department is to continue to raise quality standards in the Group's production activities, and to remain a world leader and a benchmark in the global pharmaceutical industry. To achieve this goal, all our activities share a common culture of industrial excellence, enshrined in the Sanofi Manufacturing System. This sets out a series of priorities (such as customer service, constant improvement, site network optimization and transverse optimization) that constitute our industrial vision and will be crucial to our mutual success. D.4. Office Space As part of the rationalization of our office sites in the Paris region of France, we have been carrying out a review of our office space master plan for the Greater Paris area since 2009. This review will result in all our Group support functions and operating divisions being housed on a smaller number of sites (five in 2012 on completion of phase 1, and three by 2015). All of these sites will meet environmental certification standards, and offer cost-effective space solutions. In this context, the new "Campus Sanofi Val de Bièvre" (CSVB) is currently under construction on the old site (Gentilly Val De Bièvre). The foundation stone was laid at end 2012, with completion expected in early 2015. Group support functions and operational divisions were brought together under one roof at the new world headquarters in the business district of Paris (54 rue La Boétie, 8th arrondissement) in February 2012. The headquarters, in which new work spaces have been developed, marks the Group's transformation symbolically. A new Master Plan, initiated at end 2011, which defines the Group's medium-term office space requirements in the Lyon agglomeration, is in the implementation phase. A first off-plan lease was signed in early 2013 covering some of the "Pooled Services" functions, due to be delivered in March 2015 by its owner, Plastic Omnium. A second lease will be signed in early October 2014 for 2016, covering the corporate functions of Merial and Sanofi Pasteur via the sale of an existing freehold site and the off-plan reconstruction of the Group's first energy-positive building in France. The Master Plan aims to align the new sites on the Paris Master Plan, involving buildings with environmental certification, accompanied by a reduction in overall occupancy costs and work space in line with the new Corporate Charter. An office space integration project covering the real estate portfolio of Genzyme and Merial, begun in 2011, is operative in 50 countries covering 540,000m2. At end 2013, 44 sites had been integrated. Other Master Plans were initiated at end 2012 to define office space real estate strategy, the first in the Cambridge (Massachussetts, USA) agglomeration, the second in Frankfurt (Germany). Operational implementation had not begun at end 2013. Integration of Genzyme's activities in the United States will enable office space use to be redefiined in that city. Item 4A. Unresolved Staff Comments N/A 81 Table of Contents Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report at Item 18. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and with IFRS adopted by the European Union as of December 31, 2013. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. See "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the beginning of this document. Unless otherwise stated, all change figures in this item are given on a reported basis. 2013 Overview During 2013, we continued to follow the strategic direction that we established in 2008, and to pursue our four key objectives: continuing to build a global healthcare leader with synergistic platforms, bringing innovative products to market, exploring value-enhancing external growth opportunities, and adapting our structures to meet the opportunities and challenges of the future. Our full-year results for 2013 were, until August, negatively impacted by the residual effects of the loss of exclusivity in the United States of a number of our historical flagship products in the previous year: Avapro® in March 2012, Plavix® in May 2012, and Eloxatin® in August 2012. Despite temporary difficulties for our Generics business in Brazil, a slowdown in the Chinese pharmaceutical market, temporary supply limitations for our Pentacel® and Adacel® vaccines in the United States and strong competition for our Frontline® product in Animal Health, our net sales growth has nevertheless moved back into positive territory since September 2013, which marked the end of the patent cliff related to some of our major products. In a tough economic climate and against a backdrop of pressure by governments to cut healthcare costs, we have been able to limit the drop in our net sales and profitability thanks to the performance of our growth platforms and rigorous cost control. Our net sales for the year were €32,951 million, 5.7% lower than in 2012 (0.5% at constant exchange rates, see definition at " Presentation of Net Sales" below), reflecting the €1.3 billion of net sales lost through competition from generics (see " Impacts from generic competition" below) but also good performances from our Diabetes Solutions, Genzyme and Emerging Markets growth platforms. The year also saw a number of new product launches stemming from our research efforts including Zaltrap® (metastatic colorectal cancer), Lyxumia® (type 2 diabetes), and Aubagio® and Lemtrada (multiple sclerosis) in Europe, and Kynamro (homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia) in the United States. Our other revenues fell by €655 million (64.9%) year-on-year, mainly as a result of the loss of license revenues under the worldwide alliance with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) on Plavix® and Aprovel®. The restructuring of the alliance between Sanofi and BMS, announced in October 2012 following the loss of exclusivity for Plavix® and Avapro®/Avalide® in many major markets, took effect on January 1, 2013. Under the new agreement, BMS returned to us our rights to Plavix® and Avapro®/ Avalide® worldwide, with the exception of the United States and Puerto Rico for Plavix®, thereby giving us exclusive control over these products and their commercialization. The ongoing realignment of our resources, combined with favorable exchange rate effects, helped reduce further our research and development expenses by 2.8% and our selling and general expenses by 3.7%. Our business net income was €6,687 million, down 17.5% from 2012, while our business earnings per share were €5.05, down 17.8% from 2012. This year-on-year fall includes the effect of exchange rates, which was negative overall. Business net income and business earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures which our management uses to monitor our operational performance, and which are defined under " Business Net Income" below. Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi amounted to €3,717 million, down 24.0% from 2012. Basic earnings per share were €2.81, down 24.3% from 2012; diluted earnings per share for 2013 were €2.78 (24.5% lower). During 2013, we continued our policy of targeted acquisitions and of alliances in research and development. In Consumer Health Care, we acquired the worldwide rights to the Rolaids® brand via our Chattem subsidiary in January 2013. In Generics, we completed the acquisition of Colombian pharmaceutical company Genfar S.A., a 82 Table of Contents significant player in its home country and throughout Latin America generally, in March 2013. In Animal Health, Merial acquired the animal health division of Dosch Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd in India in June 2013. We also entered into various alliances and licensing deals to extend or strengthen our existing research fields. As of December 31, 2013, we had reduced our debt, net of cash and cash equivalents to €6.0 billion (compared with €7.7 billion as of December 31, 2012). A dividend of €2.80 per share in respect of the 2013 financial year, representing a payout equivalent to 55% of our business net income, will be submitted for approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of May 5, 2014. Our operations generate significant cash flow. We recorded €6,954 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2013 compared to €8,171 million in 2012. During 2013, we paid out €3.6 billion in dividends. With respect to our financial position, we ended 2013 with our debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (see definition at " Liquidity and Capital Resources" below) at €6,043 million (2012: €7,719 million). Debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, is a financial indicator that is used by management to measure our overall net indebtedness and to manage our equity capital. In order to assess our financing risk, we also use a "gearing ratio", a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as the ratio of debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, to total equity. Our gearing ratio was 10.6% at the end of 2013 compared to 13.4% at the end of 2012. See " Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. Impacts from generic competition Some of our flagship products continued to experience sales erosion in 2013 due to generic competition. While we do not believe it is possible to state with certainty what level of net sales would have been achieved in the absence of generic competition, we are able to estimate the impact of generic competition for each product. A comparison of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (see " Results of Operations  Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2012") shows that in 2013, generic competition led to a loss of €1.3 billion of net sales on a reported basis (or €1.3 billion at constant exchange rates). The table below sets forth the impact by product. (€ million) Product 2013 Reported 2012 Reported Change on a reported basis Change on a reported basis (%) Plavix® Western Europe 257 307 (50 ) -16.3% Aprovel® Western Europe 338 557 (219 ) -39.3% Taxotere® Western Europe 22 53 (31 ) -58.5% Eloxatin® U.S. 19 718 (699 ) -97.4% Lovenox® U.S. 187 319 (132 ) -41.4% Plavix® U.S.(1) 5 76 (71 ) -93.4% Aprovel® U.S.(1) 17 45 (28 ) -62.2% Taxotere® U.S. 42 53 (11 ) -20.8% Ambien® U.S. 88 85 +3 +3.5% Xatral® U.S. 3 20 (17 ) -85.0% Nasacort® U.S. 7 21 (14 ) -66.7% Xyzal® U.S. 6 6   Allegra® U.S. (3 ) (1 ) (2 )  Total 988 2,259 (1,271 ) -56.3% (1) Sales of active ingredient to the BMS majority-owned entity in the United States. We expect the erosion caused by generic competition to continue in 2014, with a negative impact on net income. Products susceptible to the effects of such competition in 2014 include: those for which new generic competition can reasonably be expected in 2014 based on expiration dates, patents or other regulatory or commercial exclusivity: Renagel®/Renvela® in the United States and Europe; 83 Table of Contents those which already faced generic competition as of January 1, 2013, but whose sales can reasonably be expected to be subject to further sales erosion in 2014: Plavix® and Aprovel® in Europe; Lovenox®, Ambien® and Taxotere® in the United States; and Allegra®, Amaryl®, Myslee® and Taxotere® in Japan. In 2013, the aggregate consolidated net sales of these products in countries where generic competition currently exists or is expected in 2014 were €2,260 million (€848 million in the United States, €728 million in Europe and €684 million in Japan). This 2013 figure includes Renagel®/Renvela® sales of €531 million in the U.S. and €133 million in Western Europe. The negative impact on our 2014 net sales is liable to represent a substantial portion of this amount, but the actual impact will depend on a number of factors such as the actual launch dates of generic products in 2014, the prices at which they are sold, and potential litigation outcomes. Purchase Accounting Effects Our results of operations and financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2013, December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 have been significantly affected by our August 2004 acquisition of Aventis and certain subsequent transactions, mainly our acquisition of Genzyme on April 4, 2011. See " Critical accounting and reporting policies  Business combinations" below for an explanation of the impact of business combinations on our results of operations. The Aventis business combination has given rise to significant amortization expenses (€1,199 million in 2013, €1,489 million in 2012, and €1,788 million in 2011). The Genzyme business combination has given rise to significant amortization of intangible assets (€930 million in 2013, €976 million in 2012 and €705 million in 2011) and impairment of intangible assets (€665 million in 2013, €25 million in 2012 and €119 million in 2011). In order to isolate the purchase accounting effects of all acquisitions and certain other items, we use a non-GAAP financial measure that we refer to as "business net income". For a further discussion and definition of "business net income", and business net income for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, see " Business Net Income" below. Sources of Revenues and Expenses Revenue. Revenue arising from the sale of goods is presented in the income statement under "Net sales". Net sales comprise revenue from sales of pharmaceutical products, human vaccines, animal health products and active ingredients, net of sales returns, of customer incentives and discounts, and of certain sales-based payments paid or payable to the healthcare authorities. Returns, discounts, incentives and rebates described above are recognized in the period in which the underlying sales are recognized, as a reduction of sales revenue. See Note B.14. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. We sell pharmaceutical products, vaccines and animal health products directly, through alliances, and through licensees throughout the world. When we sell products directly, we record sales revenues as part of our consolidated net sales. When we sell products through alliances, the revenues reflected in our consolidated financial statements are based on the overall level of sales of the products and on the arrangements governing those alliances. For more information about our alliances, see " Financial Presentation of Alliances" below. When we sell products through licensees, we receive royalty income that we record in "Other revenues". See Note C. to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. Cost of Sales. Our cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of purchasing raw materials and active ingredients, labor and other costs relating to our manufacturing activities, packaging materials, payments made under licensing agreements and distribution costs. We have license agreements under which we manufacture, sell and distribute products that are patented by other companies and license agreements under which other companies distribute products that we have patented. When we pay royalties, we record them in cost of sales, and when we receive royalties, we record them in "Other revenues" as discussed above. Operating Income. Our operating income reflects our revenues, our cost of sales and the remainder of our operating expenses, the most significant of which are research and development expenses and selling and general expenses. For our business segments, we also measure our results of operations through an indicator referred to as "Business Operating Income," which we describe below under " Segment Information  Business Operating Income of Segments." 84 Table of Contents Segment Information Operating Segments In accordance with IFRS 8 "Operating Segments," we have defined our segments as "Pharmaceuticals", "Human Vaccines" (Vaccines) and "Animal Health". Our other identified segments are categorized as "Other". The Pharmaceuticals segment covers research, development, production and marketing of medicines, including activities acquired with Genzyme. Sanofi's pharmaceuticals portfolio consists of flagship products, plus a broad range of prescription medicines, generic medicines, and consumer health products. This segment also includes all associates and joint ventures whose activities are related to pharmaceuticals, in particular the entities majority owned by BMS. See " Financial Presentation of Alliances" below. The Vaccines segment is wholly dedicated to vaccines, including research, development, production and marketing. This segment includes our Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture with Merck & Co., Inc. in Europe. The Animal Health segment comprises the research, development, production and marketing activities of Merial, which offers a complete range of medicines and vaccines for a wide variety of animal species. The Other segment includes all activities that do not qualify as reportable segments under IFRS 8 "Operating Segments"; it also includes the effects of retained commitments in respect of divested businesses. In particular, this segment included our interest in the Yves Rocher group (see note D.6. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report). Inter-segment transactions are not material. Business Operating Income of Segments We report segment results on the basis of "Business Operating Income". This indicator, adopted in compliance with IFRS 8, is used internally to measure operational performance and to allocate resources. "Business Operating Income" is derived from "Operating income", adjusted as follows: the amounts reported in the line items "Fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilities", "Restructuring costs" and "Other gains and losses, and litigation" are eliminated; amortization and impairment losses charged against intangible assets (other than software) are eliminated; the share of profits/losses of associates and joint ventures is added; the share attributable to non-controlling interests is deducted; other acquisition-related effects (primarily, the workdown of acquired inventories remeasured at fair value at the acquisition date, and the impact of acquisitions on investments in associates and joint ventures) are eliminated; and restructuring costs relating to associates and joint ventures are eliminated. 85 Table of Contents The following table presents our Business Operating Income for the year ended December 31, 2013.

(5) See Note D.28. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. Business Net Income In addition to net income, we use a non-GAAP financial measure that we refer to as "business net income" to evaluate our Group's performance. Business net income, which is defined below, represents the aggregate business operating income of all of our operating segments, less net financial expenses and the relevant income tax effects. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure allows investors to understand the performance of our Group because it segregates the results of operations of our current business activities, as opposed to reflecting the impact of past transactions such as acquisitions. Our management uses business net income to manage and to evaluate our performance, and we believe it is appropriate to disclose this non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplement to our IFRS reporting, in order to assist investors in analyzing the factors and trends affecting our business performance. Our management also intends to use business net income as the basis for proposing the dividend policy for the Group. Accordingly, management believes that an investor's understanding of trends in our dividend policy is enhanced by disclosing business net income. We have also decided to report "business earnings per share". Business earnings per share is a specific non-GAAP financial measure, which we define as business net income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Our management intends to give earnings guidance based on business earnings per share. We also present business earnings per share on a diluted basis. Business net income is defined as "Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi", determined under IFRS, excluding (i) amortization of intangible assets; (ii) impairment of intangible assets; (iii) fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilities; (iv) other impacts associated with acquisitions (including impacts of acquisitions on associates and joint ventures); (v) restructuring costs (including restructuring costs relating to associates and joint ventures); (vi) other gains and losses, and litigation; (vii) the tax effect related to the items listed in (i) through (vi); as well as (viii) the effects of major tax disputes, the tax on dividends distributed to Sanofi shareholders starting in 2013, and as an exception for 2011, the retroactive effect (2006-2010) on the tax liability resulting from the agreement signed on December 22, 2011 by France and the United States on transfer prices (APA-Advance Pricing Agreement), for which the amount is deemed to be significant; and (ix) the share of non-controlling interests in items (i) through (viii). Items (i), (ii), (iii), (v) and (vi) correspond to those reported in the income statement line items 87 Table of Contents "Amortization of intangible assets", "Impairment of intangible assets", "Fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilities", "Restructuring costs" and "Other gains and losses, and litigation", as defined in Notes B.19. and B.20. to our consolidated financial statements. The following table reconciles our business net income to our Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011: (€ million) 2013 2012(1) 2011(1) Business net income 6,687 8,101 8,748 (i) Amortization of intangible assets (2,914 ) (3,291 ) (3,314 ) (ii) Impairment of intangible assets (1,387 ) (117 ) (142 ) (iii) Fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilities 314 (192 ) 15 (iv) Expenses arising from the impact of acquisitions on inventories(2) (8 ) (23 ) (476 ) (v) Restructuring costs (300 ) (1,141 ) (1,314 ) (vi) Other gains and losses, and litigation(3)   (327 ) (vii) Tax effects on the items listed above, comprising: 1,480 1,580 1,905  amortization of intangible assets 939 1,159 1,178  impairment of intangible assets 527 42 37  fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilities (85 ) 2 34  expenses arising from the impact of acquisitions on inventories 2 7 143  restructuring costs 97 370 399  other gains and losses, and litigation   114 (iv)/(ix) Other tax items(4) (109 )  577 (x) Share of items listed above attributable to non-controlling interests 4 3 6 (iv)/(v) Restructuring costs and expenses arising from the impact of acquisitions on associates and joint ventures(5) (50 ) (31 ) (32 ) Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi 3,717 4,889 5,646 (1) Includes the impact of applying the revised IAS 19 (see Note A.2.2. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report). (2) This line comprises the workdown of inventories remeasured at fair value at the acquisition date. (3) See Note D.28. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. (4) In 2013, this line item corresponds to the tax on dividends distributed to Sanofi shareholders. In 2011, this line item includes €349 million relating to the effect of the Franco-American Advance Pricing Agreement (APA), and a €228 million reduction in deferred tax liabilities on remeasurements of intangible assets of Merial as a result of changes in tax legislation in the United Kingdom. (5) This line shows the portion of major restructuring costs incurred by associates and joint ventures, and expenses arising from the impact of acquisitions on associates and joint ventures (workdown of acquired inventories, amortization and impairment of intangible assets, and impairment of goodwill). The following table sets forth the calculation of our business net income for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011: (€ million) 2012 2012(1) 2011(1) Business operating income 9,324 11,448 12,274 Financial income and expenses (503 ) (658 ) (604 ) Income tax expense (2,134 ) (2,689 ) (2,922 ) Business net income 6,687 8,101 8,748 (1) Includes the impact of applying the revised IAS 19 (see Note A.2.2. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report). The most significant reconciliation items in the table above (reconciling our business net income to our Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi) relate to the purchase accounting effect of our acquisitions, particularly the amortization and impairment of intangible assets. We believe that excluding these non-cash charges 88 Table of Contents enhances an investor's understanding of our underlying economic performance because we do not consider that the excluded charges reflect the combined entity's ongoing operating performance. Rather, we believe that each of the excluded charges reflects the decision to acquire the businesses concerned. The purchase-accounting effects on net income primarily relate to: charges related to the amortization and impairment of intangible assets, net of tax and non-controlling interests; charges to cost of sales resulting from the workdown of acquired inventories remeasured at fair value, net of tax; and charges related to the impairment of goodwill. We believe (subject to the limitations described below) that disclosing business net income enhances the comparability of our operating performance, for the following reasons: the elimination of charges related to the purchase accounting effect of our acquisitions (particularly amortization and impairment of finite-lived intangible assets) enhances the comparability of our ongoing operating performance relative to our peers in the pharmaceutical industry that carry these intangible assets (principally patents and trademarks) at low book values either because they are the result of in-house research and development that has already been expensed in prior periods or because they were acquired through business combinations that were accounted for as poolings-of-interest; the elimination of selected items, such as the increase in cost of sales arising from the workdown of inventories remeasured at fair value, gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets and costs and provisions associated with major litigation, improves comparability from one period to the next; and the elimination of restructuring costs relating to the implementation of our transformation strategy enhances comparability because these costs are directly, and only, incurred in connection with transformation processes such as the rationalization of our research and development structures. We remind investors, however, that business net income should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi reported in accordance with IFRS. In addition, we strongly encourage investors and potential investors not to rely on any single financial measure but to review our financial statements, including the notes thereto, and our other publicly filed reports, carefully and in their entirety. There are material limitations associated with the use of business net income as compared to the use of IFRS net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi in evaluating our performance, as described below: The results presented by business net income cannot be achieved without incurring the following costs that the measure excludes: ?Amortization of intangible assets. Business net income excludes the amortization charges related to intangible assets. Most of these amortization charges relate to intangible assets that we have acquired. Although amortization is a non-cash charge, it is important for investors to consider it because it represents an allocation in each reporting period of a portion of the purchase price that we paid for certain intangible assets that we have acquired through acquisitions. For example, in connection with our acquisition of Aventis in 2004, we paid an aggregate of €31,279 million for these amortizable intangible assets (which, in general, were to be amortized over their useful lives, representing an average amortization period of eight years) and €5,007 million for in-progress research & development. More recently, in connection with our acquisition of Genzyme in April 2011, we paid an aggregate of €7,873 million for amortizable intangible assets (average amortization period of eight and a half years) and €2,148 million for in-progress research & development. A large part of our revenues could not be generated without owning acquired intangible assets. ?Restructuring costs. Business net income does not reflect restructuring costs even though it does reflect the benefits of the optimization of our activities, such as our research and development activities, much of which we could not achieve in the absence of restructuring costs. In addition, the results presented by business net income are intended to represent the Group's underlying performance, but items such as gains and losses on disposals and provisions associated with major litigation may recur in future years. 89 Table of Contents We compensate for the above-described material limitations by using business net income only to supplement our IFRS financial reporting and by ensuring that our disclosures provide sufficient information for a full understanding of all adjustments included in business net income. In determining the level of future dividend payments, and in analyzing dividend policy on the basis of business net income, our management intends to take into account the fact that many of the adjustments reflected in business net income have no effect on the underlying amount of cash available to pay dividends. However, although the adjustments relating to the elimination of the effect of the purchase accounting treatment of the Aventis acquisition and other acquisitions represent non-cash charges, the adjustments relating to restructuring costs represent significant cash charges in the periods following the closing of the acquisition. This Item 5 contains a discussion and analysis of business net income on the basis of consolidated financial data. Because our business net income is not a standardized measure, it may not be comparable with the non-GAAP financial measures of other companies using the same or a similar non-GAAP financial measure. Presentation of Net Sales In the discussion below, we present our consolidated net sales for 2013, 2012 and 2011. We break down our net sales among various categories, including by business segment, product and geographic region. We refer to our consolidated net sales as "reported" sales. In addition to reported sales, we analyze non-GAAP financial measures designed to isolate the impact on our net sales of currency exchange rates and changes in group structure. When we refer to changes in our net sales "at constant exchange rates", we exclude the effect of exchange rates by recalculating net sales for the relevant period using the exchange rates that were used for the previous period. See Note B.2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information relating to the manner in which we translate into euros transactions recorded in other currencies. When we refer to our net sales on a "constant structure basis", we eliminate the effect of changes in structure by restating the net sales for the previous period as follows: by including sales from an entity or with respect to product rights acquired in the current period for a portion of the previous period equal to the portion of the current period during which we owned them, based on sales information we receive from the party from whom we made the acquisition; similarly, by excluding sales for a portion of the previous period when we have sold an entity or rights to a product in the current period; and for a change in consolidation method, by recalculating the previous period on the basis of the method used for the current period. A reconciliation of our reported net sales to our net sales at constant exchange rates is provided at " Results of Operations  Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2012  Net Sales" and at " Results of Operations  Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2011  Net Sales" below. Financial Presentation of Alliances We have entered into a number of alliances for the development, co-promotion and/or co-marketing of our products. We believe that a presentation of our two principal alliances is useful to an understanding of our financial statements. The financial impact of the alliances on the Company's income statement is described in " Results of Operations  Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2012" and " Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2011", in particular in " Net sales", " Other Revenues", " Share of Profit/Loss of Associates and Joint Ventures" and " Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests". 90 Table of Contents Alliance Arrangements with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) Our revenues, expenses and operating income are affected significantly by the presentation of our alliance with BMS in our consolidated financial statements. Initial Alliance Agreement Under the terms of the initial alliance agreement, there are three principal marketing arrangements that are used: Co-marketing. Under the co-marketing system, each company markets the products independently under its own brand names. We record our own sales and related costs in our consolidated financial statements. Exclusive Marketing. Under the exclusive marketing system, one company has the exclusive right to market the products. We record our own sales and related costs in our consolidated financial statements. Co-promotion. Under the co-promotion system, the products are marketed through the alliance arrangements (either by contractual arrangements or by separate entities) under a single brand name. The accounting treatment of the co-promotion agreement depends upon who has majority ownership and operational management in that territory, as discussed below. The initial alliance arrangements include two royalty streams that are applied on a worldwide basis (excluding Japan and other opt out countries), regardless of the marketing system and regardless of which company has majority ownership and operational management: Discovery Royalty. As inventor of the two molecules, we earn an adjustable discovery royalty on part of Aprovel®/Avapro®/Karvea®/Karvezide® and Plavix®/Iscover® sold in alliance countries regardless of the marketing system. The discovery royalty earned in territories under operational management of BMS is reflected in our consolidated income statement in "Other revenues." Development Royalty. In addition to the discovery royalty, we and BMS are each entitled to a development royalty related to certain know-how and other intellectual property in connection with sales of Aprovel®/Avapro®/Karvea®/Karvezide® and Plavix®/Iscover®. We record development royalties paid to BMS in our consolidated income statement as an increase to our cost of sales in countries where we consolidate sales of the products. We record development royalties that we receive as "other revenues" in countries where BMS consolidates sales of the products. Under the initial alliance arrangements, there are two territories, one under our operational management and the other under the operational management of BMS. The territory under our operational management consists of Europe and most of Africa and Asia, while the territory under the operational management of BMS consists of the rest of the world (excluding Japan). In Japan, Aprovel® has been marketed jointly by Shionogi Pharmaceuticals and Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co. Ltd since June 2008. Our alliance with BMS does not cover distribution rights to Plavix® in Japan, which is marketed by Sanofi. Territory under our operational management. In the territory under our operational management, the marketing arrangements and recognition of operations by the Group are as follows: we use the co-promotion system for most of the countries in Western Europe for Aprovel®/Avapro®/Karvea®/Karvezide® and Plavix®/Iscover® and for certain Asian countries for Plavix®/Iscover®. We record 100% of all alliance revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. We also record, as selling and general expenses, payments to BMS for the cost of BMS's personnel involved in the promotion of the products. BMS's share of the operating income of the alliances is recorded as "non-controlling interests"; we use the co-marketing system in Germany, Spain and Greece for both Aprovel®/Avapro®/Karvea®/Karvezide® and Plavix®/Iscover® and in Italy for Aprovel®/Avapro®/Karvea®/Karvezide®; and we have the exclusive right to market Aprovel®/Avapro®/Karvea®/Karvezide® and Plavix®/Iscover® in Eastern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and certain Asian countries (excluding Japan); we have the exclusive right to market Aprovel® in Scandinavia and Ireland, and Plavix® in Malaysia. 91 Table of Contents Territory under BMS operational management. In the territory under BMS operational management, the marketing arrangements and recognition of operations by the Group are as follows: we use the co-promotion system in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, where the products are sold through the alliances under the operational management of BMS. With respect to Avapro® (the brand name used in the United States for Aprovel®) and Plavix®, we record our share of the alliance's operating income under "Share of profit/loss of associates and joint ventures". We also record payments from BMS for the cost of our personnel in connection with the promotion of the product as a deduction from our selling and general expenses; we use the co-marketing system in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Australia for Plavix®/Iscover® and Aprovel®/Avapro®/Karvea®/Karvezide® and in Colombia for Plavix®/Iscover®; and we have the exclusive right to market the products in certain other countries of Latin America. In countries where the products are marketed by BMS on a co-marketing basis, or through alliances under the operational management of BMS, we also earn revenues from the sale of the active ingredients for the products to BMS or such entities, which we record as "Net sales" in our consolidated income statement. Revised Agreement effective January 1, 2013 On September 27, 2012 Sanofi and BMS restructured their alliance following the loss of exclusivity of Plavix® and Avapro®/Avalide® in many major markets. Under the terms of the revised agreement, which came into effect on January 1, 2013, BMS returned to Sanofi its rights to Plavix® and Avapro®/Avalide® in all markets worldwide with the exception of Plavix® in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, giving Sanofi sole control and freedom to operate commercially. In exchange, starting January 1, 2013 BMS receives royalty payments on Sanofi's sales of branded and unbranded Plavix® worldwide, excluding the U.S. and Puerto Rico, and on sales of branded and unbranded Avapro®/Avalide® worldwide, in each case through 2018; BMS will also receive a terminal payment of $200 million from Sanofi in December 2018. Plavix® rights in the U.S. and Puerto Rico will continue unchanged under the terms of the existing agreement through December 2019. In addition, under the terms of this new agreement ongoing disputes between the companies related to the alliance have been resolved. The resolution of these disputes includes various commitments by both companies, including a one-time payment of $80 million by BMS to Sanofi in relation to the Avalide® supply disruption in the U.S. in 2011. In the territory managed by BMS (the United States and Puerto Rico for Plavix®), the accounting policies applied by Sanofi remain unchanged and in accordance with the terms of the initial agreement. Marketing is handled through co-promotion entities majority owned by and under the operational management of BMS. Sanofi does not recognize the sales, but invoices these entities for its promotional expenses, recognizes its royalty income in "Other revenues", and recognizes its share of profits (net of tax) in "Share of profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures". In all of the territories managed by Sanofi (including the United States and Puerto Rico for Avapro®/Avalide®) as defined in the new agreement, the Group recognizes in its financial statements the revenue and expenses generated by its own operations. Payments due to BMS are recognized in "Cost of sales". Alliance Arrangements with Regeneron Our relationship with Regeneron began in 2003 with an agreement for the co-development of the anti-angiogenic agent Zaltrap®. We expanded our relationship in 2007 and created a strategic R&D collaboration on fully human monoclonal antibodies. Collaboration agreement on Zaltrap® (aflibercept) Zaltrap® (aflibercept) is a solution administered by intravenous perfusion, used in association with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) as a treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer that is resistant to or has progressed following an oxaliplatin-containing regimen. In September 2003, Sanofi and Regeneron signed an agreement to collaborate on the development and commercialization of Zaltrap®. Under the terms of this agreement (as amended in 2005), Sanofi is responsible for funding 100% of the development costs, co-promotion rights are shared between Sanofi and Regeneron, and the profits generated from sales of Zaltrap® worldwide (except Japan) are shared equally. Sales of Zaltrap® made by subsidiaries under the control of Sanofi are recognized in consolidated net sales, and the associated costs incurred by those subsidiaries are recognized as operating expenses in the consolidated income statement. Regeneron's share of the profits is recognized in the line item "Other operating expenses", a component of operating income. 92 Table of Contents Under the terms of the same agreement, Regeneron agreed to repay 50% of the development costs initially funded by Sanofi. Contractually, this amount represents 5% of the residual repayment obligation per quarter, but may not exceed Regeneron's profit share for the quarter unless Regeneron voluntarily decides to make a larger payment in a given quarter. The agreement also stipulates milestone payments to be made by Sanofi on receipt of specified marketing approvals for Zaltrap® in the United States, within the European Union and in Japan. In the United States, Zaltrap® is a registered trademark of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The product was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in August 2012, and has been marketed in the United States since that date. On February 5, 2013, the European Commission granted marketing authorization in the European Union for Zaltrap®. Regeneron has not elected to co-promote Zaltrap® at launch in the major market countries defined as United States, France, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, Germany and Canada. In Japan, Sanofi will develop and commercialize Zaltrap®, with Regeneron entitled to receive a royalty. Collaboration agreement on the discovery, development and commercialization of human therapeutic antibodies In November 2007, Sanofi and Regeneron signed additional agreements for the discovery, development and commercialization of fully human therapeutic antibodies. In November 2009, the agreements were broadened and the term extended. Under the 2009 agreements Sanofi committed to funding Regeneron's discovery and pre-clinical development of fully human therapeutic antibodies, up to $160 million per year through 2017 (see Note D.21. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report). Sanofi has an option to license for further development any antibodies discovered by Regeneron that attain Investigational New Drug (IND) status. If such an option is exercised, Sanofi would be primarily responsible for funding, and would co-develop the antibody with Regeneron. Sanofi and Regeneron would share co-promotion rights and profits on sales of the co-developed antibodies. Development costs for the drug candidate would be shared between the companies, with Sanofi generally funding these costs up front, except that following receipt of the first positive Phase III trial results for a co-developed drug candidate, subsequent Phase III trial-related costs for that drug candidate would be shared 80% by Sanofi and 20% by Regeneron. Once a product begins to be marketed, Regeneron would progressively repay out of its profits 50% of the development costs borne by Sanofi for all antibodies licensed by Sanofi. However, Regeneron would not be required to apply more than 10% of its share of the profits from collaboration products in any calendar quarter towards reimbursing Sanofi for these development costs. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, Sanofi may also be required to make milestone payments based on aggregate sales of antibodies. In 2013, seven antibodies were in clinical development, two of which were in Phase III. If Sanofi does not exercise its licensing option for an antibody under development, Sanofi would be entitled to receive a royalty once the antibody begins to be marketed. Investor Agreement On January 11, 2014, Regeneron, Sanofi and some of its subsidiaries (collectively "Sanofi") agreed to amend and restate the original investor agreement, dated as of December 20, 2007, as amended in its entirety and entered into the Amended and Restated Investor Agreement (the "Amended Investor Agreement"). The Amended Investor Agreement was amended to, among other things, provide Sanofi with the right to nominate a single independent director to the Regeneron's Board of Directors upon reaching 20% ownership of the Company's then outstanding shares of Class A Stock, par value $0.001 per share and Common Stock (together the "Capital Stock") and to extend the term of the lock-up obligations. Sanofi retains its right to acquire up to 30% of the Capital Stock. The Amended Investor Agreement also provides Sanofi with the right to receive certain information as may be reasonably agreed upon by the parties that will facilitate Sanofi 's ability to account for their investment in the Company using the equity method of accounting under International Financial Reporting Standards. Subsequently Sanofi has determined to purchase, directly or through its subsidiaries, additional shares of Common Stock to increase its beneficial ownership to approximately 20.5% of the Common Stock outstanding. Sanofi made no commitment in terms of the timing of such transactions, which will depend on market conditions including the price and availability of shares of Common Stock, and on such other factors considered relevant to Sanofi. 93 Table of Contents Alliance arrangements with Warner Chilcott (previously with Procter & Gamble Pharmaceuticals) Our agreement with Warner Chilcott ("the Alliance Partner") covers the worldwide development and marketing arrangements of Actonel®, except Japan for which we hold no rights. Until October 30, 2009, this agreement was between Sanofi and Procter & Gamble Pharmaceuticals (P&G). Since the sale by P&G of its pharmaceutical business to Warner Chilcott on October 30, 2009, Actonel® has been marketed in collaboration with Warner Chilcott. The local marketing arrangements may take various forms. Co-promotion, whereby sales resources are pooled but only one of the two parties to the alliance agreement (Sanofi or the Alliance Partner) invoices product sales. Co-promotion is carried out under contractual agreements and is not based on any specific legal entity. The Alliance Partner sells the product and incurs all of the related costs in France and Canada. This co-promotion scheme formerly included Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg until December 31, 2007, the Netherlands until March 31, 2008, and the United States and Puerto Rico until March 31, 2010. We recognize our share of revenues under the agreement in our income statement as a component of operating income in the line item "Other operating income". Since April 1, 2010, we have received royalties from the Alliance Partner on sales made by the Alliance Partner in the United States and Puerto Rico. In the secondary co-promotion territories (the United Kingdom until December 31, 2008, Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Greece, Switzerland, Austria, Portugal and Australia), we sell the product and recognize all the revenues from sales of the product along with the corresponding expenses. The share due to the Alliance Partner is recognized in "Cost of sales"; Co-marketing, which applies in Italy, whereby each party to the alliance agreement sells the product in the country under its own brand name, and recognizes all revenues and expenses from its own operations in its respective income statement. Each company also markets the product independently under its own brand name in Spain, although Spain is not included in the co-marketing territory; Warner Chilcott only territories: the product has been marketed by the Alliance Partner independently in Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg since January 1, 2008, in the Netherlands since April 1, 2008, in the United Kingdom since January 1, 2009 and in the United States and Puerto Rico since April 1, 2010. We recognize our share of revenues under the alliance agreement in "Other operating income"; and Sanofi only territories: we have exclusive rights to sell the product in all other territories. We recognize all revenues and expenses from our own operations in our income statement, but in return for these exclusive rights we pay the Alliance Partner a royalty based on actual sales. This royalty is recognized in "Cost of sales". In 2010, Sanofi and Warner Chilcott began negotiations on the future of their alliance arrangements. In an arbitration proceeding, an arbitration panel decided on July 14, 2011 that the termination by Warner Chilcott of an ancillary agreement did not lead to the termination of the Actonel® Alliance. Pursuant to this decision, the alliance will remain in effect until January 1, 2015. In October 2013, Warner Chilcott and Sanofi have agreed on an early buy-back of Sanofi's interest in the product in the United States and Puerto Rico. As a consequence, the parties have amended the U.S. amendment (arising from a 2010 restructuring for the U.S. and Puerto Rico) with a view to restructure the parties' economic rights and obligations for the contract year 2014. As such, Warner Chilcott has paid to Sanofi a definitive lump-sum of $125 million. Impact of Exchange Rates We report our consolidated financial statements in euros. Because we earn a significant portion of our revenues in countries where the euro is not the local currency, our results of operations can be significantly affected by exchange rate movements between the euro and other currencies, primarily the U.S. dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Japanese yen, and currencies in emerging countries. We experience these effects even though certain of these countries do not account for a large portion of our net sales. In 2013, we earned 31.7% of our net sales in the United States. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against the euro has a negative impact on our revenues, which is not offset by an equal reduction in our costs and therefore negatively affects our operating income. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar has a particularly significant impact on our operating income, which is higher in the United States than elsewhere, and on the contribution to net income of our alliance with BMS in the United States, which is under the operational management of BMS, as described at " Financial Presentation of Alliances  Alliance arrangements with Bristol-Myers Squibb" above. For a description of positions entered into to manage operational foreign exchange risks as well as our hedging policy, see "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk", and "Item 3. Key Information  D. Risk Factors  Risks Related to Financial Markets  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition". 94 Table of Contents Divestments In 2013, Sanofi sold its U.S. commercial rights to five pharmaceutical products to Covis Pharma.

Exchange rate movements had an unfavorable effect of 5.2 points, mainly reflecting the depreciation of the yen, the U.S. dollar, the Brazilian real, the Venezuelan bolivar, the Australian dollar and the South African rand against the euro. At constant exchange rates, net sales fell by 0.5% year-on-year. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of our reported net sales for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 to our net sales at constant exchange rates: (€ million) 2013 2012 Change Net sales 32,951 34,947 -5.7% Effect of exchange rates 1,806 Net sales at constant exchange rates 34,757 34,947 -0.5% Our net sales comprise the net sales generated by our Pharmaceuticals, Human Vaccines (Vaccines) and Animal Health segments. The following table breaks down our 2013 and 2012 net sales by business segment: (€ million) 2013 Reported 2012 Reported Change on a reported basis Change at constant exchange rates Pharmaceuticals 27,250 28,871 -5.6% -0.2% Vaccines 3,716 3,897 -4.6% -0.1% Animal Health 1,985 2,179 -8.9% -5.3% Total 32,951 34,947 -5.7% -0.5% Net Sales by Product  Pharmaceuticals segment In 2013, net sales for the Pharmaceuticals segment were €27,250 million, down 5.6% on a reported basis and 0.2% at constant exchange rates. The year-on-year change (decrease of €1,621 million) reflects the negative effect of exchange rates (€1,551 million) on the one hand, and the following impacts at constant exchange rates on the other hand: the positive performance of growth platforms (€1,684 million), mainly our Diabetes and Genzyme businesses; the negative effects of generic competition (mainly on sales of Eloxatin® and Lovenox® in the United States, and of Aprovel® and Plavix® in Western Europe), totaling €1,253 million of net sales lost; and other impacts (negative evolution of €501 million), including the negative impact of austerity measures in the European Union and temporary difficulties in distribution channels for our Generics business in Brazil. Our flagship products (Lantus® and Apidra®, Cerezyme®, Myozyme®/Lumizyme®, Fabrazyme®, Aubagio® and Lemtrada, Multaq®, Jevtana®, Auvi-Q®, Mozobil®, Zaltrap®, Plavix®, Lovenox®, Aprovel®/CoAprovel®, Renagel®/Renvela®, Allegra®, Stilnox® / Ambien® / Myslee®, Synvisc® / Synvisc-One®, Taxotere® and Eloxatin®) are discussed below. 97 Table of Contents The following table breaks down our 2013 and 2012 net sales for the Pharmaceuticals segment by product: (€ million) Product Indication 2013 Reported 2012 Reported Change on a reported basis Change at constant exchange rates Lantus® Diabetes 5,715 4,960 +15.2% +20.0% Apidra® Diabetes 288 230 +25.2% +31.7% Amaryl® Diabetes 375 421 -10.9% -1.0% Insuman® Diabetes 132 135 -2.2% 0.0% Lyxumia® Diabetes 9    Other products 49 36 +36.1% +38.9% Total: Diabetes Diabetes 6,568 5,782 +13.6% +18.7% Taxotere® Breast, lung, prostate, stomach, and head & neck cancer 409 563 -27.4% -19.5% Jevtana® Prostate cancer 231 235 -1.7% +1.3% Eloxatin® Colorectal cancer 221 956 -76.9% -76.0% Thymoglobulin® Organ rejection 198 193 +2.6% +7.3% Mozobil® Hematologic malignancies 101 96 +5.2% +8.3% Zaltrap® Colorectal cancer 53 25 +112.0% +116.0% Other products 252 326 -22.7% -18.7% Total: Oncology 1,465 2,394 -38.8% -35.3% Cerezyme® Gaucher disease 688 633 +8.7% +13.9% Myozyme®/Lumizyme® Pompe disease 500 462 +8.2% +11.9% Fabrazyme® Fabry disease 383 292 +31.2% +39.0% Aldurazyme® Mucopolysaccharidosis 159 150 +6.0% +11.3% Other products 244 241 +1.2% +8.7% Sub-total: Rare diseases 1,974 1,778 +11.0% +16.6% Aubagio® Multiple sclerosis 166 7   Lemtrada Multiple sclerosis 2    Sub-total: Multiple sclerosis 168 7   Total: Genzyme 2,142 1,785 +20.0% +25.9% Plavix® Atherothrombosis 1,857 2,066 -10.1% +1.1% Lovenox® Thrombosis 1,703 1,893 -10.0% -7.2% Aprovel®/CoAprovel® Hypertension 882 1,151 -23.4% -20.9% Renagel®/Renvela® Hyperphosphatemia 750 653 +14.9% +19.0% Allegra® Allergic rhinitis, urticaria 406 553 -26.6% -12.1% Depakine® Epilepsy 405 410 -1.2% +2.7% Stilnox®/Ambien®/Myslee® Sleep disorders 391 497 -21.3% -9.5% Synvisc®/Synvisc-One® Arthritis 371 363 +2.2% +6.1% Tritace® Hypertension 307 345 -11.0% -7.2% Multaq® Atrial fibrillation 269 255 +5.5% +8.2% Lasix® Edema, hypertension 172 210 -18.1% -9.5% Targocid® Bacterial infections 166 198 -16.2% -11.1% Orudis® Rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis 144 184 -21.7% -9.8% Cordarone® Arrhythmia 141 163 -13.5% -4.3% Xatral® Benign prostatic hypertrophy 101 130 -22.3% -20.0% Actonel® Osteoporosis, Paget's disease 100 134 -25.4% -20.1% Auvi-Q Severe allergies, anaphylaxis 51    Other prescription products 4,230 4,853 -12.8% -8.1% Total: Other prescription products 12,446 14,058 -11.5% -5.5% Consumer Health Care 3,004 3,008 -0.1% +5.2% Generics 1,625 1,844 -11.9% -8.2% Total Pharmaceuticals 27,250 28,871 -5.6% -0.2% 98 Table of Contents Diabetes division Net sales for the Diabetes division were €6,568 million, up 18.7% at constant exchange rates, driven by double-digit growth for Lantus® and Apidra®. Lantus® increased its net sales by 20.0% (at constant exchange rates) to €5,715 million in 2013 due to robust growth in the United States (up 25.6% at constant exchange rates, at €3,747 million) driven by Lantus® SoloSTAR®, which accounted for 57% of full-year sales, and to a solid performance in Emerging Markets (up 16.8% at constant exchange rates), especially in the Africa/Middle East region (up 34.6% at constant exchange rates) and in Eastern Europe (up 14.5% at constant exchange rates). In Western Europe, growth was once again modest (up 4.1% at constant exchange rates). The product's sales growth reflected both an increase in volumes and a generally favorable price effect. Volumes advanced in all geographic segments during 2013 (+9.8% overall), especially in Emerging Markets but also in the United States, reflecting continued strength in prescription rates. We expect continued strength in prescription rates in all geographic segments in the medium term. In the longer term, volume growth will be dependent on a number of factors such as new competing products entering the markets and prevalence of type 2 diabetes. We expect the Emerging Markets zone to continue to be a robust contributor to volume growth going forward, reflecting increased diagnosis of Diabetes and better access to drugs. Price effects were overall favorable (+10.2% at constant exchange rates), with price rises in the United States and other key markets more than offsetting price pressure in some countries, such as China. We cannot foresee what the long-term price effects will be, as these will depend on the impact of new competing products on the pricing of diabetes treatments across all geographic treatments. However, favorable price effects are expected in the United States in the short term. Net sales of Apidra® totaled €288 million in 2013, up 31.7% at constant exchange rates, due to a strong performance in the United States (up 58.9% at constant exchange rates, at €112 million). Amaryl® posted a 1.0% fall in net sales at constant exchange rates to €375 million, reflecting the effect of generic competition in Japan (down 18.4% at constant exchange rates, at €81 million), but also a good performance in Emerging Markets (up 9.9% at constant exchange rates, at €269 million). Lyxumia® (lixisenatide, in-licensed from Zealand Pharma) was launched in various Western European countries, in Japan and in Mexico in 2013, and generated net sales of €9 million. Oncology business The Oncology business posted net sales of €1,465 million, down 35.3% at constant exchange rates, due mainly to the effects of the expected expiration of exclusivity for Eloxatin® in the United States. Eloxatin® saw net sales fall sharply in 2013, by 76.0% at constant exchange rates to €221 million, triggered by increased competition from generics in the United States beginning in August 2012. Net sales of Taxotere® fell by 19.5% at constant exchange rates to €409 million. The product is facing competition from generics in Western Europe (down 56.6% at constant exchange rates, at €22 million), in the United States (down 18.9% at constant exchange rates, at €42 million) and in Emerging Markets (down 18.5% at constant exchange rates, at €211 million). Jevtana® reported net sales of €231 million in 2013, up 1.3% at constant exchange rates, reflecting competitive pressure in the United States, where sales slipped by 19.3% at constant exchange rates to €86 million, counteracted by a strong performance in Western Europe (up 22.0% at constant exchange rates, at €110 million). Sales of Mozobil® rose by 8.3% at constant exchange rates to €101 million. Net sales of Zaltrap® reached €53 million, up 116.0% at constant exchange rates. The product generated sales of €36 million in the United States, where it was launched in the third quarter of 2012 (up 54.2% at constant exchange rates), and sales of €15 million in Western Europe, where launches began during the first half of 2013. Net sales of other Oncology products fell by 18.7% at constant exchange rates to €252 million, due mainly to the withdrawal of Campath® from the market in the second half of 2012. 99 Table of Contents Jevtana®, Zaltrap® and Mozobil®, along with the other pharmaceutical products Multaq® and Auvi-Q TM (1) (see " Other pharmaceutical products" below), constitute the "Other Innovative Products" growth platform, which in 2013 generated €705 million of net sales, up 18.8% at constant exchange rates. Genzyme business The Genzyme business consists of treatments for rare diseases, and treatments for multiple sclerosis (Aubagio® and Lemtrada). The business generated net sales of €2,142 million, up 25.9% at constant exchange rates, reflecting the return to full supply capacity for Cerezyme® and Fabrazyme®, an increased number of patients in rare diseases, and the launch of Aubagio® in the United States. In rare diseases, Cerezyme® increased its net sales by 13.9% at constant exchange rates to €688 million, driven by Emerging Markets (up 36.3% at constant exchange rates, at €241 million) and the United States (up 10.8% at constant exchange rates, at €178 million). Net sales of Myozyme® / Lumizyme® rose by 11.9% at constant exchange rates to €500 million, due to an increase in sales in Emerging Markets (up 43.6% at constant exchange rates, at €74 million) and in Western Europe (up 7.4% at constant exchange rates, at €274 million). Fabrazyme® reported strong net sales growth of 39.0% at constant exchange rates, to €383 million. The product was boosted by a rebound in the United States (up 33.6% at constant exchange rates, at €196 million) and Western Europe (up 69.2% at constant exchange rates at €87 million), mainly due to an increase in the number of new patients. For more information regarding the manufacturing issues related to Cerezyme® and Fabrazyme® see "Item 4  Information on the Company  Production and Raw Materials." In multiple sclerosis, Aubagio®, which was launched in the United States in October 2012, and in some Western European countries in the fourth quarter of 2013, generated net sales of €166 million in 2013 (of which €152 million came from the United States). Lemtrada, launched in Germany in October 2013, posted sales of €2 million. Other pharmaceutical products Net sales of Plavix® were up 1.1% at constant exchange rates at €1,857 million. Growth was limited by the effect of a fall in sales of the active ingredient to the entity majority owned by BMS in the United States (down 93.4% at constant exchange rates, at €5 million), where the product lost its exclusivity on May 17, 2012. Sales of Plavix® in the United States and Puerto Rico are handled by BMS under the terms of the Sanofi-BMS alliance (see " Financial presentation of alliances  Alliance Arrangements with Bristol-Myers Squibb" above). In Emerging Markets, Plavix® reported net sales growth of 4.6% at constant exchange rates to €807 million, driven by sales in China (up 14.3% at constant exchange rates, at €422 million). In Japan, sales advanced by 13.3% at constant exchange rates to €748 million. In Western Europe, sales fell year-on-year (down 16.3% at constant exchange rates, at €257 million) as a result of competition from generics. Lovenox® saw net sales fall in 2013 by 7.2% at constant exchange rates to €1,703 million due to competition from generics in the United States, where sales of the branded product were down 39.5% at constant exchange rates at €187 million (sales of the generic version of Lovenox® launched by Sanofi in 2012 are recorded by our Generics business). Sales rose by 0.9% at constant exchange rates in Western Europe to €858 million, while in Emerging Markets sales were down 2.6% at €563 million. Aprovel® / CoAprovel® reported a drop in net sales of 20.9% at constant exchange rates to €882 million, mainly as a result of competition from generics in Western Europe, where sales were 39.1% lower at €338 million. Emerging Markets net sales increased by 9.1% at constant exchange rates to €410 million. Net sales of Renagel® / Renvela® rose by 19.0% at constant exchange rates to €750 million, driven by a strong performance in the United States (up 22.0% at constant exchange rates, at €531 million) and in Emerging Markets (up 35.8% at constant exchange rates, at €67 million). (1) Sanofi U.S. has in-licensed the North American commercialization rights for Auvi-Q from Intelliject, Inc. 100 Table of Contents Allegra® posted a fall in prescription net sales (down 12.1% at constant exchange rates, at €406 million), affected by competition from generics in Japan (down 18.4% at constant exchange rates, at €280 million). Net sales of Allegra® OTC in the United States and in Japan are recorded by the Consumer Health Care business. Net sales of Stilnox® / Ambien® / Myslee® fell by 9.5% at constant exchange rates to €391 million, reflecting competition from generics of Myslee® in Japan (down 17.1% at constant exchange rates at €192 million). Synvisc® / Synvisc-One® achieved net sales of €371 million, up 6.1% at constant exchange rates. Sales held fairly steady in the United States (up 1.0% at constant exchange rates, at €295 million). Net sales of Multaq® increased by 8.2% at constant exchange rates to €269 million, of which €216 million was generated in the United States (up 11.5% at constant exchange rates). Auvi-Q recorded net sales of €51 million in the United States, where it was launched in January 2013. No comments are called for in respect of our other prescription medicines. Consumer Health Care business During 2013, the Consumer Health Care business increased its net sales by 5.2% at constant exchange rates to €3,004 million, driven by growth in Emerging Markets (up 7.9% at constant exchange rates, at €1,482 million) and the United States (up 4.8% at constant exchange rates, at €616 million). Net sales of Allegra® OTC rose by 7.4% at constant exchange rates, reflecting the product's launch in Japan at the end of 2012. Essentiale®, Enterogermina® and No Spa® all achieved double-digit net sales growth (at constant exchange rates). The following table breaks down our 2013 and 2012 net sales for the Consumer Health Care business by product: (€ million) Product 2013 Reported 2012 Reported Change on a reported basis Change at constant exchange rates Doliprane® 290 268 +8.2% +9.0% Allegra® 264 256 +3.1% +7.4% Essentiale® 207 178 +16.3% +21.9% Enterogermina® 130 119 +9.2% +21.8% No Spa® 117 110 +6.4% +10.0% Lactacyd® 105 110 -4.5% +3.6% Dorflex® 93 101 -7.9% +5.0% Other products 1,798 1,866 -3.6% +1.4% Total Consumer Healh Care 3,004 3,008 -0.1% +5.2% Generics business The Generics business reported net sales of €1,625 million in 2013, down 8.2% at constant exchange rates, with the performance adversely affected by temporary difficulties in distribution channels in Brazil. During the second quarter of 2013, Sanofi became aware that distribution channels in Brazil were holding inventory levels substantially and inappropriately in excess of the volumes needed to meet demand. Consequently, an adjustment was booked for product returns, discounts and chargebacks, the net impact of which was to reduce net sales by €122 million. An additional provision of €79 million was also booked to cover inventory write-downs and other associated costs. However, the business was boosted by organic sales growth in Western Europe (up 11.4% at constant exchange rates, at €552 million), principally in the French market, where the penetration of generics increased. In Emerging Markets, the business generated sales of €858 million (down 12.8% at constant exchange rates), hampered by the adjustment to net sales in Brazil. In the United States, net sales fell by 32.4% at constant exchange rates to €179 million, reflecting a decline in sales of authorized generics of Lovenox®, Aprovel® and Taxotere®, due partly to unfavorable price effects. 101 Table of Contents The following table breaks down net sales of our Pharmaceutical segment products by geographical region in 2013: (€ million) Product Western Europe (1) Change at constant exchange rates United States Change at constant exchange rates Emerging Markets (2) Change at constant exchange rates Rest of the world (3) Change at constant exchange rates Lantus® 804 +4.1% 3,747 +25.6% 874 +16.8% 290 +12.3% Apidra® 84 +7.7% 112 +58.9% 63 +31.4% 29 +28.6% Amaryl® 22 -21.4% 2 -33.3% 269 +9.9% 82 -18.1% Insuman® 90 -8.2% 1 0.0% 42 +18.9% (1 ) -100.0% Lyxumia® 6      3  Other products 45 +50.0%  -100.0% 2  2  Total: Diabetes 1,051 +4.4% 3,862 +26.1% 1,250 +16.1% 405 +5.7% Taxotere® 22 -56.6% 42 -18.9% 211 -18.5% 134 -10.7% Jevtana® 110 +22.0% 86 -19.3% 31 +3.0% 4 +150.0% Eloxatin® 6 -53.8% 19 -97.4% 127 -14.4% 69 +1.4% Thymoglobulin® 31 +6.9% 102 +8.2% 53 +10.0% 12 -6.3% Mozobil® 32 +6.7% 56 +3.6% 10 +42.9% 3 +33.3% Zaltrap® 15  36 +54.2% 2   -100.0% Other products 54 -26.7% 149 -15.8% 30 -28.9% 19 +4.3% Total: Oncology 270 -6.2% 490 -59.3% 464 -13.3% 241 -5.3% Cerezyme® 225 +5.1% 178 +10.8% 241 +36.3% 44 -16.1% Myozyme®/Lumizyme® 274 +7.4% 123 +9.4% 74 +43.6% 29 +3.0% Fabrazyme® 87 +69.2% 196 +33.6% 51 +31.7% 49 +29.8% Aldurazyme® 60 +5.2% 29 +15.4% 54 +21.3% 16 0.0% Other products 39 +14.7% 99 +5.2% 39 +13.9% 67 +8.0% Sub-total Rare diseases 685 +12.0% 625 +16.0% 459 +32.8% 205 +4.7% Aubagio® 12  152  2    Lemtrada 2        Sub-total Multiple sclerosis 14  152  2    Total: Genzyme(4) 699 +14.3% 777 +42.6% 461 +33.3% 205 +5.1% Plavix® 257 -16.3% 5 * -93.4% 807 +4.6% 788 +12.1% Lovenox® 858 +0.9% 187 -39.5% 563 -2.6% 95 -1.9% Aprovel®/CoAprovel® 338 -39.1% 17 * -60.0% 410 +9.1% 117 -20.8% Renagel®/Renvela® 133 +4.7% 531 +22.0% 67 +35.8% 19 0.0% Allegra® 10 -9.1% (3 )  120 +12.5% 279 -18.7% Depakine® 138 -2.1%   252 +5.6% 15 0.0% Stilnox®/Ambien®/Myslee® 42 -8.7% 88 -7.1% 65 0.0% 196 -16.6% Synvisc®/Synvisc-One® 25 +25.0% 295 +1.0% 33 +45.8% 18 +17.6% Tritace® 136 -9.3%   160 -4.4% 11 -20.0% Multaq® 43 -6.5% 216 +11.5% 8 +12.5% 2 0.0% Lasix® 75 -5.1% 3 0.0% 50 -11.3% 44 -13.6% Targocid® 79 -8.1%   75 -10.0% 12 -27.3% Orudis® 24 -52.9%   117 +7.8% 3 -25.0% Cordarone® 25 -10.7%   74 +2.6% 42 -10.2% Xatral® 39 -13.3% 3 -85.0% 58 -3.2% 1 -33.3% Actonel® 22 -33.3%   48 -22.7% 30 -2.9% Auvi-Q   51      Other prescription products 1,645 -13.1% 497 -12.0% 1,607 -0.3% 481 -11.1% Total: Other prescription products 3,889 -13.0% 1,890 -6.1% 4,514 +1.8% 2,153 -5.4% Consumer Health Care 664 -0.2% 616 +4.8% 1,482 +7.9% 242 +3.9% Generics 552 +11.4% 179 -32.4% 858 -12.8% 36 +51.9% Total pharmaceuticals 7,125 -5.4% 7,814 +1.8% 9,029 +3.2% 3,282 -2.6% (1) France, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugal, Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Ireland, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Denmark.

The following table presents the 2013 and 2012 sales of our Vaccines segment by range of products: (€ million) 2013 Reported 2012 Reported Change on a reported basis Change at constant exchange rates Polio/Pertussis/Hib Vaccines (including Pentacel® and Pentaxim®) 1,148 1,184 -3.0% +3.2% Influenza Vaccines (including Vaxigrip® and Fluzone®) 929 884 +5.1% +9.3% Meningitis/Pneumonia Vaccines (including Menactra®) 496 650 -23.7% -20.8% Adult Booster Vaccines (including Adacel®) 391 496 -21.2% -18.5% Travel and Other Endemics Vaccines 382 364 +4.9% +9.9% Other Vaccines 370 319 +16.0% +21.0% Total Vaccines 3,716 3,897 -4.6% -0.1% Polio / Pertussis / Hib vaccines reported net sales up 3.2% at constant exchange rates, to €1,148 million. This reflected a good performance in Emerging Markets (€644 million, up 33.9% at constant exchange rates), driven by the success of Pentaxim®, especially in China, but also a decline in net sales of 23.8% at constant exchange rates in the United States (to €275 million) triggered by supply limitations for of Pentacel® and Adacel® lasting from April 2012 until October 2013. Net sales of Influenza vaccines were up 9.3% at constant exchange rates at €929 million, helped by a strong performance in the United States (up 20.4% at €533 million) with the Fluzone® range; in Emerging Markets, net sales were down 5.7% at constant exchange rates at €291 million. Meningitis / Pneumonia vaccines posted net sales of €496 million, down 20.8% at constant exchange rates, affected by a contraction in sales of Menactra® (down 21.5% at constant exchange rates, at €424 million), largely in the United States where the timing of public procurement tenders was less favorable than in 2012. In Emerging Markets, sales for the franchise fell by 17.6% at constant exchange rates to €132 million. Net sales of Adult Booster vaccines were 18.5% lower at constant exchange rates at €391 million, mainly due to reduced sales of Adacel® in the United States (down 25.3% at constant exchange rates, at €234 million) following the temporary restrictions on shipments. Net sales of Travel and Other Endemics vaccines were up 9.9% at constant exchange rates at €382 million, driven by vaccines against rabies and hepatitis A. Other Vaccines saw net sales rise by 21.0% at constant exchange rates to €370 million, reflecting the expansion of VaxServe, a Sanofi Pasteur company that supplies vaccines in the United States. In addition to the Vaccines activity reflected in our consolidated net sales, sales generated by Sanofi Pasteur MSD, our joint venture with Merck & Co., Inc. in Europe, reached €876 million in 2013, up 3.7% (on a reported basis), boosted by sales of the Zostavax® vaccine launched at the end of 2012. Sales generated by Sanofi Pasteur MSD are not included in our consolidated net sales. 103 Table of Contents The following table presents the 2013 sales of our Vaccines segment by range of products and by region: (€ million) Western Europe (1) Reported Change at constant exchange rates United States Reported Change at constant exchange rates Emerging Markets (2) Reported Change at constant exchange rates Rest of the world (3) Reported Change at constant exchange rates Polio/Pertussis/Hib Vaccines (inc.

(2) World excluding United States, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. (3) Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In the United States, sales of vaccines were down 5.2% at constant exchange rates at €1,872 million, reflecting the supply limitations for Pentacel® and Adacel® coupled with weaker sales of Menactra®. In Emerging Markets, sales growth (up 11.5% at constant exchange rates) was driven by the success of Pentaxim®, especially in China. In the Rest of the World, the fall of 4.9% at constant exchange rates was due largely to lower sales of Imovax® in Japan, reflecting the end of the catch-up vaccinations that followed the launch of this product in September 2012. Net Sales  Animal Health segment Net sales for the Animal Health segment in 2013 amounted to €1,985 million, down 5.3% at constant exchange rates or 8.9% on a reported basis. The following table presents the 2013 and 2012 sales of our Animal Health segment by range of products: (€ million) 2013 Reported 2012 Reported Change on a reported basis Change at constant exchange rates Companion animals 1,195 1,372 -12.9% -9.8% Production animals 790 807 -2.1% +2.1% Total Animal Health 1,985 2,179 -8.9% -5.3% Of which Frontline® and other fipronil-based products 611 775 -21.2% -17.8% Of which Vaccines 727 730 -0.4% +3.0% Of which Avermectin 413 423 -2.4% +1.7% Of which Other products 234 251 -6.8% -2.8% Net sales for the Companion Animals franchise were 9.8% lower at constant exchange rates, at €1,195 million. Sales of products in the Frontline® / fipronil range (down 17.8% at constant exchange rates, at €611 million) were affected by increased competition from prescription products and branded generics, and by unfavorable weather conditions in the United States and Western Europe; however, they performed well in Emerging Markets (up 16.1% at constant exchange rates, at €99 million). 104 Table of Contents Sales of Production Animals franchise products rose by 2.1% at constant exchange rates to €790 million, driven by growth for avermectin products in the United States (up 3.6% at constant exchange rates, at €225 million).

Net Sales by Geographical Region We divide our sales geographically into four regions: the United States, Emerging Markets, Western Europe and the Rest of the World. The following table breaks down our 2013 and 2012 net sales by region: (€ million) 2013 Reported 2012 Reported Change on a reported basis Change at constant exchange rates United States 10,433 10,873 -4.0% -0.7% Emerging Markets(1) 10,957 11,145 -1.7% +4.4% Of which Eastern Europe and Turkey 2,673 2,721 -1.8% +2.2% Of which Asia (excl.

(2) France, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugal, Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Ireland, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Denmark. (3) Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In the United States, net sales fell by 0.7% at constant exchange rates to €10,433 million. Negative factors included the loss of exclusivity of Eloxatin® in August 2012 (down 97.4% at constant exchange rates), competition from generics of Lovenox® (down 39.5% at constant exchange rates), and supply limitations for Pentacel® and Adacel® in the Polio/Pertussis/Hib vaccines franchise (down 23.8% at constant exchange rates). Positive factors included strong performances by the Genzyme business (up 42.6% at constant exchange rates, at €777 million) and the Diabetes division (up 26.1% at constant exchange rates, at €3,862 million). In Emerging Markets, net sales were €10,957 million, an increase of 4.4% at constant exchange rates. Growth was slowed by temporary difficulties in the Generics business in Brazil, but was mainly driven by the Diabetes division (up 16.1% at constant exchange rates, at €1,250 million), by the Vaccines segment (up 11.5% at constant exchange rates, at €1,341 million) and by Genzyme (up 33.3% at constant exchange rates, at €461 million). In China, net sales 105 Table of Contents totaled €1,471 million, up 18.6% at constant exchange rates, reflecting strong performances by Plavix®, Aprovel®, Lantus® and the Vaccines segment. Russia posted sales of €901 million, up 12.0% at constant exchange rates, with Consumer Health Care and Generics having the most impact. Net sales in Brazil slipped by 18.2% at constant exchange rates to €1,111 million, affected by temporary difficulties in distribution channels for the Generics business. Western Europe saw net sales fall by 5.6% at constant exchange rates to €7,831 million, hit by competition from generics of Aprovel® (down 39.1% at constant exchange rates) and Plavix® (down 16.3% at constant exchange rates) and by the impact of austerity measures. In the Rest of the World, net sales were €3,730 million, down 2.9% at constant exchange rates. In Japan, net sales came to €2,507 million (down 4.3% at constant exchange rates), reflecting on the one hand the impact of generic competition on sales of Allegra® (down 18.4% at constant exchange rates, at €280 million) and Myslee® (down 17.1% at constant exchange rates, at €192 million) combined with lower sales of the Imovax® vaccine, but on the other hand a fine performance by Plavix® (up 13.3% at constant exchange rates, at €748 million). Other Revenues Other revenues, which mainly comprise royalties under licensing agreements contracted in connection with ongoing operations, fell by 64.9% to €355 million (compared with €1,010 million in 2012). The decrease was largely due to lower licensing revenue under the worldwide alliance with BMS on Plavix® and Aprovel®, which represented €4 million in 2013 versus €532 million in 2012 (down 99.2% on a reported basis), due to the loss of exclusivity in the United States for Aprovel® (from March 30, 2012) and Plavix® (from May 17, 2012). A further factor was a drop in royalties received from Amgen under a worldwide license for Enbrel®, reflecting the contractual termination of royalty payments on U.S. sales of the product in February 2013. Gross Profit Gross profit amounted to €22,316 million in 2013 (67.7% of net sales), versus €24,859 million in 2012 (71.1% of net sales). This represents a year-on-year fall of 10.2%, equivalent to a 3.4-point drop in the gross margin ratio. The gross margin ratio for the Pharmaceuticals segment was 3.1 points lower at 69.8%, reflecting not only the drop in royalty revenue (2.1 points) but also a deterioration in the ratio of cost of sales to net sales (1.0 point), due in particular to the adverse impact of generic competition and exchange rates, coupled with temporary difficulties in distribution channels for our generics in Brazil. The gross margin ratio for the Vaccines segment was 6.3 points lower at 53.0%, as a result of an unfavorable product mix that was due partly to the temporary supply limitations for Pentacel® and Adacel®. The gross margin ratio for the Animal Health segment fell by 2.5 points to 66.8%, reflecting lower sales of fipronil products. Research and Development Expenses Research and development (R&D) expenses amounted to €4,770 million in 2013 (versus €4,905 million in 2012) and represented 14.5% of net sales (versus 14.0% in 2012). The year-on-year reduction was €135 million, or 2.8%. In the Pharmaceuticals segment, R&D expenses decreased by €116 million (2.8%), the principal factors being favorable exchange rate effects and ongoing transformation and project portfolio rationalization initiatives. R&D expenses for the Vaccines segment fell by €20 million (3.7%), largely due to the end of enrollment of patients for clinical trials of the dengue fever vaccine. In the Animal Health segment, R&D expenses were €1 million (0.6%) higher than in 2012. 106 Table of Contents Selling and General Expenses Selling and general expenses totaled €8,602 million, versus €8,929 million in 2012, a reduction of €327 million or 3.7%. These expenses represented 26.1% of net sales, versus 25.6% in 2012. The Pharmaceuticals segment recorded a reduction of €289 million (3.8%), reflecting favorable exchange rate effects, despite increased spend on the Diabetes Solutions and Genzyme growth platforms in North America. In the Vaccines segment, selling and general expenses were €21 million (3.4%) lower, again helped by favorable exchange rate effects and despite an increase in promotional spending, especially in China and Japan. In the Animal Health segment, selling and general expenses were down €16 million (2.4%), due to a reduction in promotional spending and favorable exchange rate effects. Other Operating Income and Expenses In 2013, other operating income totaled €691 million (versus €562 million in 2012), and other operating expenses €242 million (versus €414 million in 2012). Overall, other operating income and expenses represented net income of €449 million in 2013, versus net income of €148 million in 2012. This €301 million rise was mainly due to receipt of a payment of €92 million ($125 million) arising from a change to the contractual terms of the alliance with Warner Chilcott on Actonel® (see Note C.3. to our consolidated financial statements), a €93 million gain arising on the settlement of a dispute between Hoechst and Genentech relating to Rituxan®, and a €165 million gain on the sale to Covis Pharma of commercial rights to some pharmaceutical products in the United States. This line item also includes a net operational foreign exchange loss of €64 million, versus €41 million in 2012. Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization charged against intangible assets totaled €2,914 million in 2013, versus €3,291 million in 2012. the year-on-year decrease of €377 million was mainly due to a reduction in amortization charged against intangible assets recognized on the acquisition of Aventis (€1,199 million in 2013, versus €1,489 million in 2012) as some pharmaceutical products reached the end of their life cycles in the face of competition from generics, plus (to a lesser extent) favorable exchange rate effects. Impairment of Intangible Assets In 2013, this line showed impairment losses of €1,387 million against intangible assets, versus €117 million in 2012. The impairment losses recognized in 2013 related primarily to (i) Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) in the United States, following the refusal by the FDA to approve the U.S. marketing application for this product as it stands (€612 million); (ii) the discontinuation of the iniparib R&D project in non-small cell lung cancer and ovarian cancer (€384 million); and (iii) the discontinuation of the project on fedratinib, a selective JAK2 inhibitor in the treatment of polycythemia vera (€170 million). In 2012, impairment losses related mainly to the discontinuation of R&D projects in the Pharmaceuticals segment, in particular development programs in oncology. Fair Value Remeasurement of Contingent Consideration Liabilities Fair value remeasurements of contingent consideration liabilities recognized on acquisitions in accordance with the revised IFRS 3 represented a net gain of €314 million in 2013, versus a net expense of €192 million in 2012. This item mainly relates to changes in the fair value of (i) the CVRs issued in connection with the Genzyme acquisition, (ii) the contingent consideration payable to Bayer as a result of an acquisition made by Genzyme prior to the latter's acquisition by Sanofi, and (iii) the contingent consideration arising from the acquisition of TargeGen (see Note D.18. to our consolidated financial statements). 107 Table of Contents Restructuring Costs Restructuring costs amounted to €300 million in 2013, versus €1,141 million in 2012, and relate primarily to measures associated with the major transformation program that we initiated in 2009 to adapt our structures to the challenges of the future. In 2013, these costs related mainly to employee-related expenses arising from headcount adjustment plans in France and the rest of Europe. In 2012, these costs mainly related to measures taken to adapt our resources in France, transform our industrial facilities in Europe and make adjustments to our sales forces worldwide, along with the integration of Genzyme and impairment losses against property, plant and equipment in France. Other Gains and Losses, and Litigation Nothing was recognized on this line in either 2013 or 2012. Operating Income Operating income totaled €5,106 million for 2013, versus €6,432 million for 2012, a fall of 20.6%. This year-on-year change reflected the drop in gross profit, but also the reduction in selling and general expenses, research and development expenses and restructuring costs. Financial Income and Expenses Net financial expense for 2013 was €503 million, versus €658 million for 2012, a decrease of €155 million. Financial expenses directly related to our debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (see the definition in section "3. Consolidated Balance sheet" below) amounted to €317 million in 2013, compared with €349 million in 2012. This decrease mainly reflects a reduction in both the average level of our total debt, and the average financing rate. The reduction in net financial expense was mainly attributable to a decrease in the net interest cost on defined-benefit pension plans (€159 million, versus €198 million in 2012); a lower level of impairment losses on investments and financial assets (€8 million, versus €30 million in 2012), which related mainly to available-for-sale financial assets; and a net financial foreign exchange gain of €5 million (versus a net loss of €17 million in 2012). Gains on disposals of non-current financial assets totaled €50 million (versus €37 million in 2012), and mainly related to divestments by Genzyme. Income before Tax and Associates and Joint Ventures Income before tax and associates and joint ventures amounted to €4,603 million in 2013, versus €5,774 million in 2012, a fall of 20.3%. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense represented €763 million in 2013, versus €1,109 million in 2012, giving an effective tax rate (based on consolidated net income) of 16.6% in 2013 compared with 19.2% in 2012 (see Note D.30. to our consolidated financial statements). The level of income tax expense was significantly impacted by the positive tax effect relating to the amortization and impairment of intangible assets (€1,466 million in 2013, versus €1,201 million in 2012) and to restructuring costs (€97 million in 2013, versus €370 million in 2012). In 2013, this line also includes the "contribution on distributed income", a new French tax levied on the dividend payout to Sanofi shareholders (3%, equivalent to €109 million). The effective tax rate based on our business net income is calculated on the basis of business operating income minus net financial expenses and before the share of profit/loss of associates and joint ventures and net income attributable to non-controlling interests. The effective tax rate was 24.0% in 2013, versus 25.5% in 2012. This 108 Table of Contents decrease was mainly due to the geographical mix of the results from Group entities, and to recent proceedings involving the tax authorities of various countries that had a positive net effect in 2013. Share of Profit/Loss of Associates and Joint Ventures The share of profits from associates and joint ventures was €35 million in 2013, versus €393 million in 2012. This line mainly includes our share of after-tax profits from territories managed by BMS under the Plavix® and Avapro® alliance, which fell by 94.0% to €25 million (versus €420 million in 2012). The decline in our share was mainly attributable to the drop in sales of Plavix® in the United States due to the loss of exclusivity and competition from generics. Net Income Net income amounted to €3,875 million in 2013, versus €5,058 million in 2012. Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests Net income attributable to non-controlling interests was €158 million in 2013, versus €169 million in 2012. This line mainly comprises the share of pre-tax profits paid to BMS from territories managed by Sanofi (€141 million, versus €149 million in 2012). Net Income Attributable to Equity Holders of Sanofi Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi amounted to €3,717 million, versus €4,889 million in 2012. Basic earnings per share for 2013 was €2.81, 24.3% lower than the 2012 figure of €3.71, based on an average number of shares outstanding of 1,323.1 million in 2013 (1,319.5 million in 2012). Diluted earnings per share for 2013 was €2.78 in 2013 (versus €3.68 in 2012), based on an average number of shares outstanding after dilution of 1,339.1 million in 2013 and 1,329.6 million in 2012. Business Operating Income Sanofi reports segment results on the basis of "Business Operating Income". This indicator, adopted in compliance with IFRS 8, is used internally to measure operational performance and to allocate resources. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects  Segment information" above for the definition of business operating income and reconciliation to our Income before tax and associates and joint ventures. Business operating income amounted to €9,324 million in 2013, 18.6% lower than in 2012 (€11,448 million) and represented 28.3% of net sales, versus 32.8% in 2012. Business operating income for 2013 and 2012 is set forth below: (€ million) 2013 2012 Change Pharmaceuticals 7,887 9,601 -17.9% Vaccines 909 1,157 -21.4% Animal Health 502 673 -25.4% Other 26 17 +52.9% Business operating income 9,324 11,448 -18.6% Business Net Income Business net income is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use to evaluate our Group's performance. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects  Business Net Income" above for the definition of business net income and reconciliation to our Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi. Business net income totaled €6,687 million in 2013, versus €8,101 million in 2012, a fall of 17.5%; it represented 20.3% of net sales, against 23.2% in 2012. 109 Table of Contents Business Earnings Per Share We also report business earnings per share, a non-GAAP financial measure which we define as business net income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (see " Business Net Income" above). Business earnings per share were €5.05 in 2013, 17.8% lower than the 2012 figure of €6.14, based on an average number of shares outstanding of 1,323.1 million in 2013 and 1,319.5 million in 2012. Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2011 The consolidated income statements for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 break down as follows: (under IFRS) (€ million) 2012(1) as % of net sales 2011(1) as % of net sales Net sales 34,947 100.0% 33,389 100.0% Other revenues 1,010 2.9% 1,669 5.0% Cost of sales (11,098 ) (31.8% ) (10,865 ) (32.5% ) Gross profit 24,859 71.1% 24,193 72.5% Research & development expenses (4,905 ) (14.0% ) (4,788 ) (14.3% ) Selling & general expenses (8,929 ) (25.6% ) (8,508 ) (25.5% ) Other operating income 562 319 Other operating expenses (414 ) (273 ) Amortization of intangible assets (3,291 ) (3,314 ) Impairment of intangible assets (117 ) (142 ) Fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilities (192 ) 15 Restructuring costs (1,141 ) (1,314 ) Other gains and losses, and litigation  (327 ) Operating income 6,432 18.4% 5,861 17.6% Financial expenses (751 ) (744 ) Financial income 93 140 Income before tax and associates and joint ventures 5,774 16.5% 5,257 15.7% Income tax expense (1,109 ) (440 ) Share of profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures 393 1,070 Net income 5,058 14.5% 5,887 17.6% Net income attributable to non-controlling interests 169 241 Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi 4,889 14.0% 5,646 16.9% Average number of shares outstanding (million) 1,319.5 1,321.7 Average number of shares outstanding after dilution (million) 1,329.6 1,326.7 Basic earnings per share (in euros) 3.71 4.27 Diluted earnings per share (in euros) 3.68 4.26 (1) Includes the impact of applying the amended IAS 19 (see Note A.2.2. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report). Our consolidated income statements include the results of the operations of Genzyme from April 2011. In order to help investors gain a better understanding of our performances, in the narrative discussion of certain income statement line items ("net sales", "research & development expenses", and "selling & general expenses"), we include non-consolidated 2011 first-quarter data for Genzyme in additional analyses. 110 Table of Contents Net Sales Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 amounted to €34,947 million, up 4.7% on 2011. Exchange rate movements had a favorable effect of 4.2 points, mainly reflecting the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro, and to a lesser extent the appreciation of the yen and the yuan. At constant exchange rates and after taking account of changes in structure (mainly the consolidation of Genzyme from April 2011), net sales rose by 0.5% year-on-year. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of our reported net sales for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 to our net sales at constant exchange rates: (€ million) 2012 2011 Change Net sales 34,947 33,389 +4.7% Effect of exchange rates (1,400 ) Net sales at constant exchange rates 33,547 33,389 +0.5% Our net sales comprise the net sales generated by our Pharmaceuticals, Human Vaccines (Vaccines) and Animal Health segments. The following table breaks down our 2012 and 2011 net sales by business segment: (€ million) 2012 Reported 2011 Reported Change on a reported basis Change at constant exchange rates Pharmaceuticals 28,871 27,890 +3.5% -0.4% Vaccines 3,897 3,469 +12.3% +5.7% Animal Health 2,179 2,030 +7.3% +3.1% Total 34,947 33,389 +4.7% +0.5% Net Sales by Product  Pharmaceuticals segment Net sales generated by our Pharmaceuticals segment were €28,871 million in 2012, up 3.5% on a reported basis but down 0.4% at constant exchange rates. The year-on-year change (increase of €981 million) reflects the positive effect of exchange rates (€1,082 million) on the one hand, and the following impacts at constant exchange rates on the other hand: the positive impact of consolidating Genzyme from April 2011 (non-consolidated sales of €733 million were generated by Genzyme in the first quarter of 2011); the performance of growth platforms (€1,381 million); the negative effects of generic competition (mainly on sales of Lovenox®, Taxotere® and Eloxatin® in the United States, and of Taxotere®, Plavix® and Aprovel® in Western Europe), totaling €1,345 million; the ending of the co-promotion agreement with Teva on Copaxone® and the divestiture of the Dermik business in 2011 (negative effects of €559 million); and other impacts (negative effects of €311 million), including the negative impact of austerity measures in the European Union. On a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates (which primarily means including the non-consolidated sales of Genzyme for the first quarter of 2011 and excluding sales of Copaxone® for the whole of 2011), net sales for the Pharmaceuticals segment fell by 0.6% in 2012. Our flagship products (Lantus® and Apidra®, Cerezyme®, Myozyme® / Lumizyme®, Fabrazyme®, Aubagio®, Multaq®, Jevtana®, Mozobil®, Zaltrap®, Lovenox®, Renagel® / Renvela®, Allegra®, Stilnox® / Ambien® / Myslee®, Synvisc® / Synvisc-One®, Taxotere® and Eloxatin®) are discussed below.

Lantus® posted a 19.3% increase in net sales at constant exchange rates in 2012 to €4,960 million, driven by very strong growth in the United States (up 22.0% at €3,087 million); in Emerging Markets (up 25.4% at €793 million), especially in China (up 35.9%) and Latin America (up 32.3%); and in Japan (up 22.0%). In Western Europe, growth was a more modest 5.3% at constant exchange rates. Net sales of the rapid-acting insulin analog Apidra® advanced by 16.8% (at constant exchange rates) to €230 million in 2012, buoyed by the product's performance in Emerging Markets (up 37.8%). Amaryl® saw net sales fall by 8.0% at constant exchange rates to €421 million, mainly as a result of competition from generics in Japan (down 31.7%, at €125 million), and in spite of 11.4% growth in Emerging Markets to €263 million. Oncology business Net sales for the Oncology business were €2,394 million, down 14.3% at constant exchange rates. Net sales of Eloxatin® fell by 17.3% at constant exchange rates to 956 million in 2012, reflecting the loss of exclusivity in the United States on August 9, 2012, which had been expected. Taxotere® reported a fall in net sales of 41.9% at constant exchange rates, to €563 million. The product faced competition from generics in Western Europe (down 72.5%) and the United States (down 80.2%). Emerging Markets sales amounted to €270 million, down 11.2% at constant exchange rates. Jevtana® posted net sales of €235 million in 2012, up 20.2% at constant exchange rates, boosted by product launches in various countries in Western Europe (€91 million, up 104.5% at constant exchange rates) and in Emerging Markets. Zaltrap®, launched in the United States and Puerto Rico at the end of August 2012, generated net sales of €25 million for the year. Mozobil® reported net sales of €96 million, up 19.7% on a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates (i.e., including non-consolidated sales generated by Genzyme in the first quarter of 2011). Jevtana®, Zaltrap® and Mozobil®, along with Multaq® (see " Other pharmaceutical products" below), form the "Other Innovative Products" growth platform. This platform generated net sales of €611 million in 2012. Genzyme business The Genzyme business consists of products used to treat rare diseases, and products for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (Aubagio® and the experimental agent Lemtrada). Because Genzyme's net sales have been consolidated from the acquisition date (i.e. the start of April 2011), the 2011 consolidated net sales of the Genzyme business do not include sales for the first quarter of 2011. On a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates, i.e. after including non-consolidated net sales for the first quarter of 2011, the net sales of the Genzyme business rose by 16.9% in 2012 to € 1,785 million. 113 Table of Contents The following table breaks down our 2012 and 2011 net sales for the Genzyme business by product: (€ million) Product Indication 2012 Reported 2011 Reported Change on a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates Aubagio® Multiple sclerosis 7   Sub-total: Multiple sclerosis 7   Cerezyme®(1) Gaucher disease 633 441 +6.0% Myozyme®/Lumizyme®(1) Pompe disease 462 308 +11.4% Fabrazyme®(1) Fabry disease 292 109 +96.4% Aldurazyme®(1) Mucopolysaccharidosis 150 100 +9.8% Other rare disease products(1) 241 164 +6.1% Sub-total: Rare diseases(1) 1,778 1,122 +16.4% Total: Genzyme(1) 1,785 1,122 +16.9% (1) In 2011, net sales of Genzyme products were recognized from the acquisition date (April 2011). Cerezyme® recorded net sales growth of 6.0% on a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates, to €633 million (+0.9% in Western Europe, at €215 million; +6.3% in the United States, at €166 million). Production continued to improve during the year, enabling normal doses to be delivered to patients in the product's principal markets. Net sales of Myozyme®/Lumizyme® were up 11.4% on a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates at €462 million (+10,4% in Western Europe, at €257 million; +6.9% in the United States, at €117 million). Fabrazyme® reported a 96.4% surge in net sales on a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates, to €292 million. This increase was due mainly to the resumption of production at the new facility at Framingham (United States) in March 2012, enabling full doses to be supplied in all markets where the product is approved for sale. For more information regarding the manufacturing issues related to Cerezyme® and Fabrazyme® see "Item 4.  Information on the Company  Production and Raw Materials." In multiple sclerosis, Aubagio® was launched in the United States in October 2012, and recorded fourth-quarter net sales of €7 million. Other pharmaceutical products Lovenox® recorded a fall in net sales of 12.0% at constant exchange rates to €1,893 million in 2012, as a result of competition from generics in the United States, where sales slipped by 53.1% (at constant exchange rates) to €319 million. Sales generated outside the United States accounted for 83.1% of worldwide net sales and rose by 5.5% at constant exchange rates to €1,574 million, driven by Emerging Markets (up 11.6% at constant exchange rates at €615 million). Sanofi also launched its own generic version of Lovenox® in the United States, sales of which are recognized in the Generics business. Net sales of Renagel®/Renvela® rose by 13.0% on a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates (i.e. including non-consolidated sales generated by Genzyme in the first quarter of 2011) to €653 million, on a fine performance in the United States (up 19.2% on a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates). Synvisc®/Synvisc-One® reported sales growth of 4.0% on a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates (including non-consolidated sales generated by Genzyme in the first quarter of 2011) to €363 million, driven mainly by the Synvisc-One® franchise in the United Sates (€302 million, up 5.7% on a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates). Net sales of the Ambien® range fell by 4.5% at constant exchange rates to €497 million, reflecting competition from generics of Ambien® CR in the United States and Western Europe and the introduction of generic versions of Myslee® in Japan during the second half of 2012. 114 Table of Contents Allegra® reported a decline in net sales as a prescription medicine (down 9.5% at constant exchange rates) to €553 million, reflecting lower prices in Japan (down 15.2% at constant exchange rates, at € 423 million). This product is sold over the counter in the United States, and has also been available over the counter in Japan since November 2012. Sales over the counter are recognized in the Consumer Health Care business. In August 2012 three generic versions of Allegra® were approved by the regulatory authorities in Japan; since February 2013, Allegra® as a prescription medicine has been subject to generic competition in this country. Net sales of Multaq® fell by 8.0% at constant exchange rates to €255 million, due to the effect of restrictions placed on the product's indication during the second half of 2011. Net sales of Copaxone® (reported under the line item "Other prescription products") amounted to €24 million, versus €436 million in 2011, down 94.7% (at constant exchange rates), reflecting the ending of the co-promotion agreement with Teva in all territories in the first quarter of 2012. Since the transfer of Copaxone® to Teva, we no longer recognize net sales of the product. Instead, for the two years following the transfer we are entitled to receive a payment representing 6% of net sales, which we recognize under the income statement line item "Other revenues". Consumer Health Care business Net sales for the Consumer Health Care business rose by 9.9% at constant exchange rates in 2012, to €3,008 million. This figure includes revenues generated from the acquisitions made in 2011 (primarily BMP Sunstone in China, and the nutraceuticals business of Universal Medicare in India). In Emerging Markets, net sales advanced by 19.9% at constant exchange rates to €1,478 million. In the United States, sales growth was modest (up 2.2% at constant exchange rates, at €606 million) compared with 2011; this reflects the fact that in the early part of 2011, distributors were building up inventories of the over-the-counter (OTC) version of Allegra®, launched in March 2011. Excluding Allegra® OTC, growth in the United States reached 6.2% at constant exchange rates. Allegra® OTC was also launched in Japan in November 2012. Generics business The Generics business reported net sales of €1,844 million in 2012, a rise of 5.0% at constant exchange rates. The business was boosted by sales growth in the United States (up 42.4% at constant exchange rates, at €272 million), where we launched our own authorized generic versions of Lovenox® and Aprovel®. In Emerging Markets, net sales fell slightly (down 2.7% at constant exchange rates) to €1,045 million, due to the impact of tougher competition and disruptions in the Brazilian market. 115 Table of Contents The following table breaks down net sales of our Pharmaceutical segment products by geographical region in 2012: (€ million) Product Western Europe(1) Change at constant exchange rates United States Change at constant exchange rates Emerging Markets(2) Change at constant exchange rates Rest of the world(3) Change at constant exchange rates Lantus® 778 +5.3% 3,087 +22.0% 793 +25.4% 302 +20.6% Apidra® 78 +14.7% 73 +3.1% 51 +37.8% 28 +30.0% Amaryl® 28 -12.5% 3 -25.0% 263 +11.4% 127 -32.6% Insuman® 98 -4.9% 1  37 +27.6% (1 )  Other products 30 +190.0% 3    3  Total: Diabetes 1,012 +4.3% 3,167 +21.5% 1,144 +22.5% 459 +0.2% Eloxatin® 13 -65.8% 718 -18.0% 153 -10.5% 72 +3.1% Taxotere® 53 -72.5% 53 -80.2% 270 -11.2% 187 -10.7% Jevtana® 91 +104.5% 109 -23.7% 33 +153.8% 2  Thymoglobulin®(4) 29  98  50  16  Zaltrap®   24    1  Mozobil®(4) 30  56  7  3  Other products(4) 75  183  45  23  Total: Oncology 291 -23.7% 1,241 -19.8% 558 0.0% 304 -1.7% Cerezyme®(4) 215  166  190  62  Myozyme®/Lumizyme®(4) 257  117  55  33  Fabrazyme®(4) 52  152  41  47  Aldurazyme®(4) 58  26  47  19  Other products(4) 34  96  36  75  Sub-total Rare diseases(4) 616  557  369  236  Aubagio®   7      Sub-total Multiple sclerosis   7      Total: Genzyme(4) 616  564  369  236  Plavix® 307 -25.8% 76 * -62.2% 799 +5.5% 884 +13.4% Lovenox® 854 +1.9% 319 -53.1% 615 +11.6% 105 +2.1% Aprovel®/CoAprovel® 557 -26.4% 45 * -8.2% 395 +2.5% 154 +17.5% Renagel®/Renvela®(4) 128  451  53  21  Allegra® 11 -15.4% (1 ) -133.3% 120 +21.2% 423 -15.1% Stilnox®/Ambien®/Myslee® 46 -13.2% 85 -4.9% 70 +7.7% 296 -5.5% Depakine® 143 -3.4%   251 +7.9% 16 -6.3% Synvisc®/Synvisc-One®(4) 20  302  24  17  Tritace® 150 -11.8%   180 -1.1% 15 -37.5% Multaq® 46 -31.8% 200 +0.5% 8 0.0% 1 -25.0% Lasix® 79 -3.7% 3 0.0% 62 +7.0% 66 -12.7% Targocid® 86 -9.5%   90 -3.3% 22 +53.8% Orudis® 51 +6.3%   129 +20.8% 4  Cordarone® 28 -9.7%   76 +7.4% 59 -9.8% Xatral® 45 -24.1% 20 -74.7% 62 -6.3% 3 0.0% Actonel® 33 -38.9%   66 -16.7% 35 -5.7% Other prescription products 1,900 -27.0% 585 -20.5% 1,731 -4.6% 637 -11.4% Total: Other prescription products(4) 4,484 -19.2% 2,085 -18.7% 4,731 +2.6% 2,758 -2.5% Consumer Health Care 666 +2.2% 606 +2.2% 1,478 +19.9% 258 -2.1% Generics 500 +11.5% 272 +42.4% 1,045 -2.7% 27 -29.4% Total pharmaceuticals 7,569 -9.9% 7,935 +0.9% 9,325 +7.8% 4,042 -0.3% (1) France, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugal, Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Ireland, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Denmark.

The following table presents the 2012 and 2011 sales of our Vaccines segment by range of products: (€ million) 2012 Reported 2011 Reported Change on a reported basis Change at constant exchange rates Polio/Pertussis/Hib Vaccines (including Pentacel® and Pentaxim®) 1,184 1,075 +10.1% +5.0% Influenza Vaccines (including Vaxigrip® and Fluzone®) 884 826 +7.0% -0.2% Meningitis/Pneumonia Vaccines (including Menactra®) 650 510 +27.5% +18.0% Adult Booster Vaccines (including Adacel®) 496 465 +6.7% 0.0% Travel and Other Endemics Vaccines 364 370 -1.6% -4.9% Other Vaccines 319 223 +43.0% +31.8% Total Vaccines 3,897 3,469 +12.3% +5.7% Polio/Pertussis/Hib vaccines saw net sales increase by 5.0% at constant exchange rates to €1,184 million. This rise reflects a strong performance in Japan (€239 million, up 140.9% at constant exchange rates, mainly due to the successful launch of Imovax® in September 2012) and a good performance in Emerging Markets (€495 million, up 5.7% at constant exchange rates), but also a drop in net sales in the United States (down 25.1% at constant exchange rates, at €374 million) due to supply limitations for Pentacel® and Adacel® following a temporary shutdown in production at Sanofi Pasteur. Net sales of Influenza vaccines were flat (down 0.2% at constant exchange rates), at €884 million. In the United States, net sales fell by 5.5% at constant exchange rates, to €466 million; in Emerging Markets, net sales rose by 5.1% at constant exchange rates, to €317 million. Meningitis/Pneumonia vaccines posted net sales of €650 million, up 18.0% at constant exchange rates, driven by a strong performance from Menactra® (€564 million, up 21.8% at constant exchange rates). Growth was especially strong in Emerging Markets (up 52.9% at constant exchange rates, at €165 million) and in the United States (up 10.5% at constant exchange rates, at €473 million). Net sales of Adult Booster vaccines were unchanged year-on-year (at constant exchange rates), at €496 million. Net sales of Travel and Other Endemics vaccines fell by 4.9% (at constant exchange rates) to €364 million, hit by a temporary shutdown in production of the Theracys®/Immucyst® and BCG vaccines. In addition to the Vaccines activity reflected in our consolidated net sales, sales of Sanofi Pasteur MSD, our joint venture with Merck & Co., Inc. in Europe, amounted to €845 million in 2012, up 6.8% on a reported basis. Sales generated by Sanofi Pasteur MSD are not included in our consolidated net sales. The main growth drivers were the performance of Gardasil® (up 13.6% on a reported basis, at €206 million) and sales of the travel and endemics vaccines franchise. 117 Table of Contents The following table presents the 2012 sales of our Vaccines segment by range of products and by region: (€ million) Western Europe(1) Reported Change at constant exchange rates United States Reported Change at constant exchange rates Emerging Markets(2) Reported Change at constant exchange rates Rest of the world(3) Reported Change at constant exchange rates Polio/Pertussis/Hib Vaccines (inc.

(2) World excluding United States, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. (3) Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In Western Europe and the United States, net sales fell slightly (by 2.2% and 0.7% at constant exchange rates, respectively). In Emerging Markets, most of the rise in sales (9.1% at constant exchange rates) was generated in Latin America and China. The Rest of the World region reported strong growth (48.9% at constant exchange rates), due mainly to the performance of Imovax® in Japan. Net Sales  Animal Health segment The Animal Health segment achieved net sales of €2,179 million in 2012, up 3.1% at constant exchange rates (7.3% on a reported basis), driven by the performance in Emerging Markets and the first-time consolidation of the net sales of Newport Laboratories ("Newport"). The following table presents the 2012 and 2011 sales of our Animal Health segment by range of products: (€ million) 2012 Reported 2011 Reported Change on a reported basis Change at constant exchange rates Companion animals 1,372 1,277 +7.4% +1.9% Production animals 807 753 +7.2% +5.1% Total Animal Health 2,179 2,030 +7.3% +3.1% Of which Frontline® and other fipronil-based products 775 764 +1.4% -3.4% Of which Vaccines 730 662 +10.3% +7.6% Of which Avermectin 423 372 +13.7% +7.8% Of which Other products 251 232 +8.2% +3.9% Net sales for the companion animals franchise rose by 1.8% at constant exchange rates to €1,372 million. Erosion in sales of the Frontline®/fipronil range of products was limited to 3.4% at constant exchange rates (€775 million) despite competitive pressure in the United States (down 7.8% at constant exchange rates, at €411 million), thanks to good performances in Emerging Markets (up 10.5%, at €93 million). Net sales for the production animals franchise were 5.1% higher at constant exchange rates, at €807 million. These figures include the contribution from Newport from April 2012 onwards. 118 Table of Contents The following table breaks down net sales of our Animal Health segment by product and by geographical region in 2012: (€ million) Product Western Europe(1) Change at constant exchange rates United States Change at constant exchange rates Emerging Markets(2) Change at constant exchange rates Rest of The World(3) Change at constant exchange rates Frontline® and other fipronil-based products 208 -0.5% 411 -7.8% 93 +10.5% 63 -3.3% Vaccines 181 -7.7% 152 +11.1% 375 +14.2% 22 +31.3% Avermectin 62 -4.7% 223 +15.8% 65 +10.0% 73 -2.8% Other products 88 -2.2% 94 +1.1% 46 +27.8% 23 0.0% Total Animal Health 539 -3.8% 880 +1.4% 579 +14.0% 181 +0.6% (1) France, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugal, Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Ireland, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Denmark.

(3) Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In the United States, net sales were up 0.7% at constant exchange rates (but fell by 2.8% after including Genzyme in the first quarter of 2011) to €10,873 million. The year-on-year change reflected strong performances from Lantus® and from the Genzyme and Generics businesses (including our own generic version of Lovenox®), but also the impact of generics of Taxotere®, Lovenox® and Eloxatin®. In Emerging Markets, net sales reached €11,145 million, up 8.3% at constant exchange rates (or 7.2% after including Genzyme for the first quarter of 2011). In China, net sales were €1,249 million, up 15.0% at constant exchange rates, on a strong performance from Plavix® and Lantus®. In Brazil, net sales increased by 7.7% at constant exchange rates to €1,530 million, boosted by the Consumer Health Care business and the contribution from Genzyme, although growth was hampered by a slowdown in sales of generics. The Africa and Middle East zones topped the billion-euro mark for the first time (€1,018 million and €1,001 million, respectively). Sales in Russia reached €851 million, up 13.6% at constant exchange rates, driven by the Consumer Health Care and Generics businesses and also by Lantus®, Plavix® and Lovenox®. 119 Table of Contents Net sales in Western Europe fell by 9.3% at constant exchange rates to €8,335 million, hampered by the transfer of the Copaxone® business to Teva; by competition from generics of Taxotere® (down 72.5% at constant exchange rates), Aprovel® (down 26.4% at constant exchange rates) and Plavix® (down 25.8% at constant exchange rates); and by the impact of austerity measures implemented by European governments. After including Genzyme for the first quarter of 2011 and excluding Copaxone®, net sales fell by 7.5% at constant exchange rates. In the Rest of the World region, net sales totaled €4,594 million, up 2.5% at constant exchange rates (or 0.8% after including Genzyme sales for the first quarter of 2011). In Japan, net sales were €3,274 million (up 6.6% at constant exchange rates, or 4.7% after including Genzyme sales for the first quarter of 2011); positive factors included strong performances from Plavix® (up 16.0% at constant exchange rates, at €837 million) and from the Polio/Pertussis/Hib vaccines franchise (up 140.9% at constant exchange rates at €239 million, driven by the successful launch of Imovax®), while negative factors included erosion in sales of Allegra® (down 15.2% at constant exchange rates, at €423 million) and the impact of bi-annual price cuts. Worldwide Presence of Plavix® and Aprovel® Two of our leading products  Plavix® and Aprovel®  were discovered by Sanofi and jointly developed with BMS under an alliance agreement. In all territories except Japan, these products are sold either by Sanofi or by BMS in accordance with the terms of this alliance agreement applicable in 2012 and 2011 (see " Financial Presentation of Alliances  Alliance arrangements with Bristol-Myers Squibb" above). Plavix® and Aprovel® lost exclusivity in the U.S. on May 17, 2012 and March 30, 2012, respectively. Worldwide sales of these two products in 2012 and 2011 are an important indicator because they facilitate a financial statement user's understanding and analysis of our consolidated income statement, particularly in terms of understanding our overall profitability in relation to consolidated revenues, and also facilitate a user's ability to understand and assess the effectiveness of our research and development efforts. Also, disclosing sales made by BMS of these two products in 2012 and 2011 enables the users to have a clearer understanding of trends in different lines of our income statement, in particular the lines "Other revenues", where we record royalties received on those sales (see " Other Revenues"); "Share of profit/loss of associates and joint ventures" (see " Share of Profit/Loss of Associates and Joint Ventures"), where we record our share of the profit/loss of entities included in the BMS Alliance and under BMS operational management; and "Net income attributable to non-controlling interests" (see " Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests"), where we record the BMS share of the profit/loss of entities included in the BMS Alliance and under our operational management. On September 27, 2012, Sanofi and BMS restructured their alliance with effect from January 1, 2013 (see " Financial Presentation of Alliances  Alliance arrangements with Bristol-Myers Squibb" above). 120 Table of Contents The table below sets forth the worldwide sales of Plavix® and Aprovel® in 2012 and 2011, by geographic region: 2012 2011 (€ million) Sanofi(2) BMS(3) Total Sanofi(2) BMS(3) Total Change on a reported basis Change at constant exchange rates Plavix®/Iscover®(1) Europe 424 29 453 530 44 574 -21.1% -21.2% United States  1,829 1,829  4,759 4,759 -61.6% -63.7% Other countries 1,613 89 1,702 1,370 286 1,656 +2.8% -4.6% Total 2,037 1,947 3,984 1,900 5,089 6,989 -43.0% -46.2% Aprovel®/Avapro® /Karvea®/Avalide®(4) Europe 527 99 626 694 130 824 -24.0% -24.3% United States 24 110 134  374 374 -64.2% -66.5% Other countries 521 91 612 451 156 607 +0.8% -5.1% Total 1,072 300 1,372 1,145 660 1,805 -24.0% -26.6% (1) Plavix® is marketed under the trademarks Plavix® and Iscover®.

Net sales of Aprovel® consolidated by Sanofi, excluding sales to BMS (€111 million in 2012 and €150 million in 2011). (3) Translated into euros by Sanofi using the method described in Note B.2. "Foreign currency translation" to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 in this annual report. (4) Aprovel® is marketed under the trademarks Aprovel®, Avapro®, Karvea® and Avalide®. Worldwide sales of Plavix®/Iscover® fell by 46.2% at constant exchange rates in 2012 to €3,984 million, under the impact of competition from generics in the United States and Europe. In the United Sates, where the product lost exclusivity on May 17, 2012, sales (consolidated by BMS) were down 63.7% at constant exchange rates, at €1,829 million. In Europe, net sales of Plavix® fell by 21.2% at constant exchange rates, to €453 million. In the Other Countries region, net sales were down 4.6% at constant exchange rates; this reflected the entry of generics into the Canadian market (where sales, consolidated by BMS, dipped by 76.1% at constant exchange rates to €50 million), but also the continuing success of the product in Japan and China where net sales (consolidated by Sanofi) reached €837 million (up 16.0% at constant exchange rates) and €371 million (up 20.6% at constant exchange rates), respectively. Worldwide sales of Aprovel®/Avapro®/Karvea®/Avalide® in 2012 amounted to €1,372 million, a decline of 26.6% at constant exchange rates, reflecting loss of exclusivity in the United States on March 30, 2012 and competition from generics in most Western European countries. In Japan and China, net sales (consolidated by Sanofi) came to €101 million (up 47.0% at constant exchange rates) and €138 million (up 17.3% at constant exchange rates), respectively. Other Revenues Other revenues, which mainly comprise royalty income under licensing agreements contracted in connection with ongoing operations, fell by 39.5% to €1,010 million (versus €1,669 million in 2011). The decrease was mainly due to lower licensing revenue under the worldwide alliance with BMS on Plavix® and Aprovel®, which totaled €532 million in 2012 versus €1,275 million in 2011 (down 58.1% on a reported basis), due largely to the loss of exclusivity in the United States for Aprovel® (on March 30, 2012) and Plavix® (on May 17, 2012). However, the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro had a favorable impact on other revenues, as did the recognition in 2012 of a €45 million payment from BMS relating to the Avalide® supply disruption in the United States during 2011. This line also includes royalty income of €171 million from Amgen relating to a worldwide license contracted on the product Enbrel®. Royalties received on U.S. sales represented a significant portion of this income in 2012 and will contractually end in February 2013. 121 Table of Contents Gross Profit Gross profit amounted to €24,859 million in 2012 (71.1% of net sales), versus €24,193 million in 2011 (72.5% of net sales). This represents an increase of 2.8% in gross profit, but a fall of 1.4 points in the gross margin ratio. The gross margin ratio for the Pharmaceuticals segment slipped by 3.0 points to 72.9%, reflecting a lower level of royalty income (-2.6 points) and a deterioration in the ratio of cost of sales to net sales (-0.4 of a point); this latter trend was mainly attributable to the adverse impact of generics (mainly of Taxotere® in the United States), partially offset by productivity gains and lower raw materials prices for heparins. The gross margin ratio for the Vaccines segment fell by 1.1 point to 59.3%. The gross margin ratio for the Animal Health segment improved by 0.2 of a point to 69.3%. In addition, consolidated gross profit for 2012 was adversely affected by a €23 million expense (0.1 of a point) arising from the workdown of acquired inventories remeasured at fair value in connection with the acquisition of Genzyme. In 2011, this expense was €476 million (1.4 points), out of which €473 million were related to the acquisition of Genzyme. Research and Development Expenses Research and development (R&D) expenses totaled €4,905 million (versus €4,788 million in 2011), representing 14.0% of net sales (versus 14.3% in 2011). Overall, R&D expenses rose by €117 million, or 2.4% on a reported basis. After including Genzyme's costs for the first quarter of 2011, R&D expenses were virtually stable year-on-year. In addition, the amount of R&D expenses reported for 2012 was adversely affected by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro. R&D expenses for the Pharmaceuticals segment increased by €121 million, up 3.0% on a reported basis. After including Genzyme's costs for the first quarter of 2011, R&D expenses were virtually stable year-on-year, reflecting our ongoing transformation initiatives and the rationalization of the project portfolio. R&D expenses for the Vaccines segment fell by €24 million to €538 million (down 4.3% on a reported basis), due mainly to trends in the cost of clinical trials on the dengue fever vaccine and various influenza-related projects. In the Animal Health segment, R&D expenses rose by €20 million (up 13.9% on a reported basis) versus 2011. Selling and General Expenses Selling and general expenses amounted to €8,929 million, compared with €8,508 million in 2011, an increase of €421 million or 4.9% on a reported basis. The ratio of selling and general expenses to net sales was virtually unchanged year-on-year at 25.6% (25.5% in 2011). After including Genzyme's costs for the first quarter of 2011, selling and general expenses were up around 1.8% year-on-year. In addition, the amount reported for 2012 was adversely affected by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro. In the Pharmaceuticals segment, selling and general expenses increased by €299 million, or 4.1% on a reported basis. After including Genzyme's costs for the first quarter of 2011, selling and general expenses for the segment were virtually stable year-on-year. This trend reflects tight cost control (especially in mature regions) and the effect of synergies unlocked by the integration of Genzyme, and was achieved in spite of ongoing investment in our growth platforms and the launch costs incurred on Zaltrap® and Aubagio®. Selling and general expenses for the Vaccines segment rose by €68 million (up 12.6% on a reported basis), due partly to adverse trends in the U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate and partly to increased promotional investments. In the Animal Health segment, selling and general expenses increased by €54 million (up 8.8% on a reported basis), reflecting adverse trends in the U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate and higher promotional costs on the companion animals franchise. Other Operating Income and Expenses In 2012, other operating income amounted to €562 million (versus €319 million in 2011), and other operating expenses to €414 million (versus €273 million in 2011). 122 Table of Contents Overall, other operating income and expenses represented net income of €148 million in 2012, compared with €46 million in 2011. This increase was mainly due to the favorable outcome of litigation relating to a license. This line item also includes a net operational foreign exchange loss of €41 million, against €5 million in 2011. Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization charged against intangible assets amounted to €3,291 million in 2012, versus €3,314 million in 2011. The year-on-year reduction of €23 million was mainly due to: reductions: a fall in amortization charged against intangible assets recognized on the acquisition of Aventis (€1,489 million in 2012, versus €1,788 million in 2011), as some products reached the end of their life cycles in the face of competition from generics; increases: amortization charges generated by intangible assets recognized on the acquisition of Genzyme in the second quarter of 2011 (€981 million over 12 months in 2012, versus €709 million over 9 months in 2011). Impairment of Intangible Assets This line showed impairment losses of €117 million against intangible assets in 2012, compared with €142 million in 2011. The impairment losses recognized in 2012 relate mainly to the discontinuation of R&D projects in the Pharmaceuticals segment, in particular some development programs in oncology. In 2011, the impairment losses related mainly to (i) the discontinuation of a Genzyme research project; (ii) certain Zentiva generics, following a downward revision of sales projections; and (iii) the discontinuation of a joint project with Metabolex in diabetes. This line also included a reversal of impairment losses on Actonel®, recognized following confirmation of the terms of the collaboration agreement with Warner Chilcott (see Note C.3. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report). Fair Value Remeasurement of Contingent Consideration Liabilities Fair value remeasurements of contingent consideration liabilities recognized on acquisitions in accordance with the revised IFRS 3 represented an expense of €192 million in 2012, compared with a net gain of €15 million in 2011. This item mainly relates to the contingent value rights (CVRs) issued in connection with the Genzyme acquisition, and to contingent consideration payable to Bayer as a result of an acquisition made by Genzyme prior to the latter's acquisition by Sanofi (see Note D.18. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report). Restructuring Costs Restructuring costs amounted to €1,141 million in 2012, versus €1,314 million in 2011, and relate primarily to measures announced in connection with the major transformation program that we initiated in 2009 to adapt our structures to the challenges of the future. In 2012, these costs mainly related to measures taken to adapt our resources in France, transform our industrial facilities in Europe and make adjustments to our sales forces worldwide, along with the integration of Genzyme and impairment losses against property, plant and equipment in France. In 2011, these costs reflected the transformation and reorganization of our R&D operations, measures taken to adapt our industrial facilities in Europe, adjustments to our sales forces in the United States and Europe, the implementation of multi-country organizations in Europe, and the integration of Genzyme entities worldwide. Other Gains and Losses, and Litigation Nothing was recognized on this line in 2012. In 2011, this line item included a net expense of €327 million, mainly comprising (i) a €519 million backlog of depreciation and amortization expense that was not charged against the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of Merial from September 18, 2009 through December 31, 2010 because these assets were classified as held for sale or exchange during that period in accordance with IFRS 5 (see Note D.8.2. to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report); (ii) a gain of €210 million arising from damages received in connection with a Plavix® patent; and (iii) the impact of the divestiture of the Dermik dermatology business (see Note D.28. to our consolidated financial statements). 123 Table of Contents Operating Income Operating income totaled €6,432 million for 2012, versus €5,861 million for 2011, an increase of 9.7%. Financial Income and Expenses Net financial expense for 2012 was €658 million, compared with €604 million for 2011, an increase of €54 million. Financial expenses directly related to our debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (see definition at " Liquidity and Capital Resources" below) were €349 million in 2012 compared to €325 million in 2011. This increase was due to a reduction in financial income resulting from a lower average rate of return on cash. Because the average level of debt and the average rate of interest on debt were relatively stable year-on-year, financial expenses were virtually unchanged in 2012. Impairment losses on investments and financial assets amounted to €30 million in 2012 (versus €58 million in 2011). In 2012, these losses related primarily to available-for-sale financial assets; in 2011, they related mainly to Greek government bonds (€49 million, versus €6 million in 2012). Gains on disposals of non-current financial assets amounted to €37 million in 2012, compared with €25 million in 2011. The 2011 figure included the effect of the change in consolidation method for the investment in Société Financière des Laboratoires de Cosmétologie Yves Rocher following loss of significant influence (see Note D.6. to our consolidated financial statements). In August 2012, Sanofi sold this investment. The effect of the unwinding of discount on provisions was €87 million in 2012 (versus €83 million in 2011), and the net financial foreign exchange loss was €17 million in 2012 (versus a net gain of €10 million in 2011). Income before Tax and Associates and Joint Ventures Income before tax and associates and joint ventures for 2012 was €5,774 million in 2011, versus €5,257 million in 2011, an increase of 9.8%. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense amounted to €1,109 million in 2012, versus €440 million in 2011. Income tax expense in 2011 included a significant reduction in the deferred tax liability relating to the remeasurement of the intangible assets of Merial in response to changes in tax rates and legislation (primarily in the United Kingdom) and the effect of the Franco-American Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) for the period from 2006 through 2011 (see Note D.30. to our consolidated financial statements). These effects did not impact income tax expense for 2012. However, the rise in income tax expense during the year was limited by the favorable effects of differential income tax rates applicable to our foreign subsidiaries (including the impact of an Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) with the Japanese authorities covering the period from 2012 through 2014), and also by the settlement of tax audits and the effects of some items becoming time-barred. This item includes positive tax effects arising from (i) the amortization of intangible assets, totaling €1,159 million in 2012 (versus €1,178 million in 2011, including the impact of the Merial backlog, see " Other Gains and Losses, and Litigation" above) and (ii) restructuring costs (€370 million in 2012, versus €399 million in 2011). The effective tax rate based on our business net income is calculated on the basis of business operating income minus net financial expenses and before the share of profit/loss of associates and joint ventures and net income attributable to non-controlling interests. The effective tax rate was 25.5% in 2012, versus 27.0% in 2011. The difference relative to the standard corporate income tax rate applicable in France (34.4%) was mainly due to royalty income being taxed at a reduced rate in France, and to the differential in tax rates applied to profits of our foreign subsidiaries. Share of Profit/Loss of Associates and Joint Ventures The share of profit/loss of associates and joint ventures in 2012 was €393 million, versus €1,070 million in 2011. This line mainly includes our share of after-tax profits from territories managed by BMS under the Plavix® and Avapro® alliance, which fell by 60.7% to €420 million (versus €1,070 million in 2011). The decline in our share was 124 Table of Contents mainly attributable to a 61.6% drop in sales of Plavix® in the United States due to the loss of exclusivity and competition from generics. Net Income Net income amounted to €5,058 million in 2012, compared with €5,887 million in 2011. Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests Net income attributable to non-controlling interests totaled €169 million in 2012, against €241 million in 2011. This line mainly comprises the share of pre-tax profits paid to BMS from territories managed by Sanofi (€149 million, versus €225 million in 2011); this year-on-year fall was directly related to increased competition from generics of clopidogrel (Plavix®) in Europe. Net Income Attributable to Equity Holders of Sanofi Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi was €4,889 million in 2012, versus €5,646 million in 2011. Basic earnings per share for 2012 was €3.71, 13.1% lower than the 2011 figure of €4.27, based on an average number of shares outstanding of 1,319.5 million in 2012 (1,321.7 million in 2011). Diluted earnings per share for 2012 was €3.68, compared to €4.26 for 2011, based on an average number of shares outstanding after dilution of 1,329.6 million in 2012 and 1,326.7 million in 2011. Business Operating Income Sanofi reports segment results on the basis of "Business Operating Income". This indicator, adopted in compliance with IFRS 8, is used internally to measure operational performance and to allocate resources. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects  Segment information" above for the definition of business operating income and reconciliation to our Income before tax and associates and joint ventures. Business operating income for 2012 was €11,448 million, compared to €12,274 million in 2011 (down 6.7%). The table below shows trends in business operating income by business segment for 2012 and 2011: (€ million) 2012 2011 Change Pharmaceuticals 9,601 10,610 -9.5% Vaccines 1,157 992 +16,6% Animal Health 673 636 +5.8% Other 17 36 -52.8% Business operating income 11,448 12,274 -6.7% Business Net Income Business net income is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use to evaluate our Group's performance. See "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects  Business Net Income" above for the definition of business net income and reconciliation to our Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi. Business net income totaled €8,101 million in 2012 versus €8,748 million in 2011 (down 7.4%), and represented 23.2% of net sales compared with 26.2% in 2011. Business Earnings Per Share We also report business earnings per share, a non-GAAP financial measure which we define as business net income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (see " Business Net Income" above). Business earnings per share for 2012 were €6.14 versus €6.62 in 2011, down 7.3%, based on an average number of shares outstanding of 1,319.5 million in 2012 (1,321.7 million in 2011). Diluted business earnings per share for 2012 were €6.09 versus €6.59 in 2011, down 7.6%, based on an average number of shares outstanding of 1,329.6 million in 2012 and 1,326.7 million in 2011. 125 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our operations generate significant positive cash flows. We fund our day-to-day investments (with the exception of significant acquisitions) primarily with operating cash flow, and pay regular dividends on our shares. In addition, we reduced our net debt during 2013 and 2012, whereas in 2011 our debt increased significantly to finance the acquisition of Genzyme. We define "debt, net of cash and cash equivalents" as (i) the sum total of short-term debt, long-term debt and interest rate and currency derivatives used to hedge debt, minus (ii) the sum total of cash and cash equivalents and interest rate and currency derivatives used to hedge cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2013, our debt, net of cash and cash equivalents stood at €6,043 million versus €7,719 million as of December 31, 2012 and €10,859 million as of December 31, 2011. See Note D.17. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. In order to assess the Company's financing risk, we also use the "gearing ratio", a non-GAAP financial measure. The gearing ratio is defined as the ratio of debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, to total equity. As of December 31, 2013, our gearing ratio stood at 10.6% of our net equity versus 13.4% as of December 31, 2012 and 19.3% as of December 31, 2011. Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows The table below shows our summarized cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011: (€ million) 2013 2012 2011 Net cash provided by / (used in) operating activities 6,954 8,171 9,319 Net cash provided by / (used in) investing activities (1,273 ) (1,587 ) (14,701 ) Net cash provided by / (used in) financing activities (3,726 ) (4,351 ) 2,893 Impact of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (79 ) 24 1 Net change in cash and cash equivalents  (decrease) / increase 1,876 2,257 (2,341 ) Generally, factors that affect our earnings  for example, pricing, volume, costs and exchange rates  flow through to cash from operations. The most significant source of cash from operations is sales of our branded pharmaceutical products and human vaccines. Receipts of royalty payments also contribute to cash from operations. Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2012 Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to €6,954 million in 2013, versus €8,171 million in 2012. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital for 2013 was €6,819 million, versus €8,503 million in 2012, reflecting the fall in consolidated net income (partly attributable to the decline in revenues from the BMS alliance). Working capital requirements fell by €135 million in 2013, after increasing by €332 million in 2012; the 2013 decrease was attributable mainly to changes in short-term provisions. Our operating cash flow before changes in working capital is generally affected by the same factors that affect "Operating income", which is discussed in detail above under "Results of Operations  Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2012". The principal difference is that operating cash flow before changes in working capital reflects our share of the profits and losses of associates and joint ventures, net of dividend and similar income received. Net cash used in investing activities decreased from €1,587 million in 2012 to €1,273 million in 2013. Acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets totaled €1,398 million (versus €1,612 million in 2012). The main items were investments in industrial and research facilities (€1,058 million, compared with €1,324 million in 2012), together with contractual payments for intangible rights under license and collaboration agreements (€310 million, versus €293 million in 2012). Acquisitions of investments during 2013 amounted to €319 million, net of cash acquired and after including assumed liabilities and commitments. The main items were the acquisitions of Genfar and Dosch, plus contingent consideration arising from the acquisition of Genzyme. In 2012, acquisitions of investments totaled €328 million, net 126 Table of Contents of cash acquired and after including assumed liabilities and commitments. The main items were a payment of contingent consideration to Bayer arising from the acquisition of Genzyme, the repurchase of some of the CVRs issued in connection with that acquisition, the acquisitions of Pluromed and Newport, and the purchase of an equity interest in Merrimack. After-tax proceeds from disposals (€409 million) mainly comprised the sale to Covis Pharma of U.S. commercial rights to five pharmaceutical products, the receipt of a $125 million payment associated with changes to the contractual terms of the alliance on Actonel®, and disposals of property, plant and equipment in the United States and France. In 2012, proceeds from disposals amounted to €358 million, related to divestitures of financial assets (in particular, our equity interests in Financière des Laboratoires de Cosmétologie Yves Rocher and Handok) and to disposals of various items of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Net cash used in financing activities came to €3,726 million in 2013, versus €4,351 million in 2012. The 2013 figure includes net external debt finance raised (net change in short-term and long-term debt) of €599 million (versus €615 million in 2012); the effect of changes in share capital (repurchases of own shares, net of capital increases), amounting to €637 million (compared to €178 million in 2012); and the dividend payout to our shareholders of €3,638 million (€3,487 million in 2012). The net change in cash and cash equivalents during 2013 was a €1,876 million increase, compared with a €2,257 million increase in 2012. Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to €8,171 million in 2012, compared with €9,319 million in 2011. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was €8,503 million, versus €9,834 million in 2011. This decrease was largely attributable to erosion in revenues from the territories managed by BMS under the alliance on Plavix® and Avapro®, due to competition from generics in the United States. This revenue erosion was reflected in a reduced share of after-tax profits from these territories (€420 million, versus €1,070 million in 2011) and lower license revenue from the worldwide alliance with BMS on Plavix® and Aprovel®/Avapro® (€532 million in 2012, versus €1,275 million in 2011). Our operating cash flow before changes in working capital is generally affected by the same factors that affect "Operating income", which is discussed in detail above under "Results of Operations  Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2011". The principal difference is that operating cash flow before changes in working capital reflects our share of the profits and losses of associates and joint ventures, net of dividend and similar income received. Working capital requirements rose by €332 million in 2012, after an increase of €515 million in 2011. The increase during 2012 was mainly attributable to an increase in inventories (€445 million, including €315 million for reconstituting inventories at the Genzyme business). Net cash used in investing activities amounted to €1,587 million in 2012, versus €14,701 million in 2011. Acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets totaled €1,612 million (2011: €1,782 million). The main items were investments in industrial and research facilities (€1,324 million, versus €1,394 million in 2011) and contractual payments for intangible rights under license and collaboration agreements (€293 million, versus €245 million in 2011). Acquisitions of investments in the period amounted to €328 million, net of cash acquired and after including assumed liabilities and commitments. The main items were a payment of contingent consideration to Bayer arising from the acquisition of Genzyme, the repurchase of some of the CVRs issued in connection with that acquisition, the acquisitions of Pluromed and Newport, and the purchase of an equity interest in Merrimack. In 2011, acquisitions of investments amounted to €13,616 million; after including assumed liabilities and commitments, they totaled €14,079 million, and mainly comprised the acquisitions of Genzyme (€13,602 million) and BMP Sunstone (€374 million). After-tax proceeds from disposals (€358 million) related to divestitures of financial assets (in particular, our equity interests in Société Financière des Laboratoires de Cosmétologie Yves Rocher and Handok), and to disposals of various items of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. In 2011, proceeds from disposals came to €359 million, mainly generated by the divestiture of the Dermik dermatology business (€321 million). 127 Table of Contents Financing activities generated a net cash outflow of €4,351 million in 2012, compared with a net cash inflow of €2,893 million in 2011. The 2012 figure includes €615 million of debt repayments (net change in short-term and long-term debt), as compared with net external debt raised of €5,283 million in 2011; it also includes the Sanofi dividend payout of €3,487 million (versus €1,372 million in 2011). After the impact of exchange rates and of the cash and cash equivalents of Merial, the net change in cash and cash equivalents in 2012 was an increase of €2,257 million, compared with a decrease of €2,341 million in 2011. Consolidated Balance Sheet and Debt Total assets stood at €96,065 million as of December 31, 2013, versus €100,409 million a year earlier, a decrease of €4,344 million. Debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (see definition above) was €6,043 million as of December 31, 2013, versus €7,719 million as of December 31, 2012. The table below shows our financial position for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011: (€ million) 2013 2012 2011 Long-term debt 10,414 10,719 12,499 Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt 4,176 3,812 2,940 Cash and cash equivalents (8,257 ) (6,381 ) (4,124 ) Related interest rate and currency derivatives (290 ) (431 ) (456 ) Debt, net of cash and cash equivalents 6,043 7,719 10,859 Our gearing ratio (debt, net of cash and cash equivalents as a proportion of total equity) fell from 13.4% in 2012 to 10.6% in 2013. Analyses of debt as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, by type, maturity, interest rate and currency, are provided in Note D.17. to our consolidated financial statements. The financing arrangements in place as of December 31, 2013 at Sanofi parent company level are not subject to covenants regarding financial ratios and do not contain any clauses linking credit spreads or fees to our credit rating. Other key movements in the balance sheet are described below. Total equity stood at €57,014 million as of December 31, 2013, versus €57,466 million as of December 31, 2012. The net year-on-year decrease in equity was attributable primarily to: increases: our net income for the year ended December 31, 2013 (€3,723 million) and the effects of share-based payment plans (€1,236 million); decreases: the dividend payout to our shareholders in respect of the 2012 financial year (€3,638 million) and repurchases of our own shares (€1,641 million). As of December 31, 2013, we held 3.6 million of our own shares, recorded as a deduction from equity and representing 0.27% of our share capital. Goodwill and Other intangible assets (€52,529 million in total) decreased by €5,736 million, mainly reflecting: decreases: amortization and impairment losses recognized during the period (€4,475 million), and currency translation differences on assets denominated in foreign currencies (€1,766 million, mainly relating to the U.S. dollar); increases: the impact of the Genfar and Dosch acquisitions (€199 million), and acquisitions of other intangible assets (€310 million). Provisions and other non-current liabilities (€8,735 million) decreased by €2,308 million, due mainly to a net decrease in provisions for pensions and other long-term employee benefits of €1,217 million (primarily as a result of actuarial gains on defined-benefit plans, contributions paid into pension funds, and plan settlements) and to transfers to other current liabilities (€682 million). 128 Table of Contents Net deferred tax liabilities (€906 million) fell by €647 million year-on-year. This reflects a reduction caused by reversals of deferred tax liabilities relating to the remeasurement of acquired intangible assets (€1,459 million), but also an increase associated with provisions for pensions (€281 million) and accrued expenses (€271 million). Current and non-current liabilities related to business combinations and to non-controlling interests were €542 million lower year-on-year at €908 million. This reduction reflects the impact of fair value remeasurements to the contingent value rights (CVRs) issued in connection with the Genzyme acquisition and to the contingent consideration payable to Bayer as a result of an acquisition made by Genzyme prior to the latter's acquisition by Sanofi, plus the reversal of contingent consideration relating to the BiPar and TargeGen acquisitions (see Note D.18. to our consolidated financial statements). Liquidity We expect that our existing cash resources and cash from operations will be sufficient to finance our foreseeable working capital requirements. At year-end 2013, we held cash and cash equivalents amounting to €8,257 million, substantially all of which were held in euros (see Note D.13. to our consolidated financial statements). As at December 31, 2013, €573 million of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our captive insurance and reinsurance companies in accordance with insurance regulations. Since 2010, some countries in Southern Europe have been facing severe financial difficulties (see section " 3.1.8. Risk Factors  2. Risks Relating to Our Business  We are subject to the risk of non-payment by our customers"). Deteriorating credit and economic conditions and other factors in these countries have resulted in an increase in the average length of time taken to collect our accounts receivable in these countries. Should these factors continue, it may require us to re-evaluate the collectability of these receivables in future periods. We carefully monitor sovereign debt issues and economic conditions and evaluate accounts receivable in these countries for potential collection risks. We have been conducting an active recovery policy, adapted to each country and including intense communication with customers, negotiations of payment plans, charging of interest for late payments, and legal action. During 2012, the amount of our trade receivables in Europe decreased, primarily as a result of a reduction in the sums owed to us by public-sector customers in Spain due to payments received. The total consolidated amount of trade receivables overdue by more than 12 months  which primarily consists of amounts due from public-sector customers  fell from €276 million as of December 31, 2011 to €161 million as of December 31, 2012 due to payments received (see Note D.10. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report). During 2013, the amount of our trade receivables in Europe continued to fall, primarily as a result of a reduction in the sums owed to us by public-sector customers in Italy and Greece. Over the Group as a whole, the amount of trade receivables overdue by more than 12 months  which primarily consists of amounts due from public-sector bodies around the world  rose from €161 million as of December 31, 2012 to €168 million as of December 31, 2013 (see Note D.10. to our consolidated financial statements). In November 2011, Sanofi obtained the necessary corporate authorizations to purchase any or all of the outstanding Contingent Value Rights ("CVR") and subsequently purchased CVRs in 2011. In 2012 following a tender offer initiated in September 2012 on the basis of the same corporate authorization, Sanofi purchased an additional 40,025,805 CVRs (for a total consideration of approximately $70 million). In 2013, Sanofi purchased an additional 10,928,075 CVRs (for a total consideration of approximately $9 million). As of December 31, 2013, 238,275,333 CVRs were outstanding out of 291,313,510 issued at the time of the Genzyme acquisition. At year-end 2013, we had no commitments for capital expenditures that we consider to be material to our consolidated financial position. Undrawn confirmed credit facilities amounted to a total of €10.0 billion at December 31, 2013. For a discussion of our treasury policies, see "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk." We expect that cash from our operations will be sufficient to repay our debt. For a discussion of our liquidity risks, see "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk." Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements / Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments We have various contractual obligations and other commercial commitments arising from our operations. Our contractual obligations and our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2013 are shown in Notes D.3., D.17., D.18. and D.21. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. Note D.21. 129 Table of Contents to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 discloses details of commitments under our principal research and development collaboration agreements. For a description of the principal contingencies arising from certain business divestitures, refer to Note D.22.e) to our 2012 consolidated financial statements. The Group's contractual obligations and other commercial commitments are set forth in the table below: Payments due by period December 31, 2013 (€ million) Total Under 1 year From 1 to 3 years From 3 to 5 years Over 5 years  Future contractual cash-flows relating to debt and debt hedging instruments(1) 15,688 4,372 3,681 2,611 5,024  Operating lease obligations 1,265 257 356 224 428  Finance lease obligations(2) 78 18 33 23 4  Irrevocable purchase commitments(3)  given 3,189 1,707 800 385 297  received (237 ) (151 ) (64 ) (3 ) (19 )  Research & development license agreements  Future service commitments(4) 569 150 253 142 24  Potential milestone payments(5) 1,589 100 174 171 1,144  Obligations relating to business combinations(6) 4,416 28 583 480 3,325  Firm commitment related to the BMS agreement(7) 75   75   Estimated benefit payments on unfunded pensions and post employment benefits(8) 1,039 54 110 119 756 Total contractual obligations and other commitments 27,671 6,535 5,926 4,227 10,983 Undrawn general-purpose credit facilities 10,021 3,020  7,001  (1) See Note D.17. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. (2) See Note D.3. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. (3) These comprise irrevocable commitments to suppliers of (i) property, plant and equipment, net of down payments (see Note D.3. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report) and (ii) goods and services. (4) Future service commitments relating to research & development license agreements mainly comprise research financing commitments, but also include consideration for access to technologies. (5) This line includes all potential milestone payments on projects regarded as reasonably possible, i.e., on projects in the development phase. (6) See Note D.18. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report.

(8) See Note D.19.1. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. The table above does not include the ongoing annual employer's contributions to plan assets, estimated at €268 million in 2013. We may have payments due to our current or former research and development partners under collaborative agreements. These agreements typically cover multiple products, and give us the option to participate in development on a product-by-product basis. When we exercise our option with respect to a product, we pay our collaboration partner a fee and receive intellectual property rights to the product in exchange. We are also generally required to fund some or all of the development costs for the products that we select, and to make payments to our partners when those products reach development milestones. We have entered into collaboration agreements under which we have rights to acquire products or technology from third parties through the acquisition of shares, loans, license agreements, joint development, co-marketing and other contractual arrangements. In addition to upfront payments on signature of the agreement, our contracts frequently require us to make payments contingent upon the completion of development milestones by our alliance partner or upon the granting of approvals or licenses. Because of the uncertain nature of development work, it is impossible to predict (i) whether Sanofi will exercise further options for products, or (ii) whether the expected milestones will be achieved, or (iii) the number of compounds that will reach the relevant milestones. It is therefore impossible to estimate the maximum aggregate amount that Sanofi will actually pay in the future under existing collaboration agreements. 130 Table of Contents Given the nature of its business, it is highly unlikely that Sanofi will exercise all options for all products or that all milestones will be achieved. The main collaboration agreements relating to development projects in the Pharmaceuticals segment are described below. Milestone payments relating to development projects under these agreements amounted to €1.4 billion in 2013. These exclude projects in the research phase (€3.8 billion in 2013, €5.0 billion in 2012) and payments contingent upon the attainment of sales targets once a product is on the market (€3.6 billion in 2013, €4.7 billion in 2012). In May 2011, Sanofi signed a license agreement with Glenmark Pharmaceuticals S.A. (Glenmark), a subsidiary of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited India, for the development and commercialization of GBR500, a novel monoclonal antibody for the treatment of Crohn's disease and other chronic autoimmune diseases. In June 2010, Sanofi signed an exclusive global collaboration and license agreement with Ascenta Therapeutics, a U.S. biopharmaceutical company, on a number of molecules that could restore apoptosis (cell death) in tumor cells. At the end of April 2010, Sanofi signed a license agreement with Glenmark for the development and commercialization of novel agents to treat chronic pain. Those agents are vanilloid receptor (TRPV3) antagonist molecules, including a first-in-class clinical compound, GRC 15300, which is currently in Phase I clinical development. In April 2010, Sanofi signed a global license agreement with CureDM Group Holdings, LLC for Pancreate, a novel human peptide which could restore a patient's ability to produce insulin and other pancreatic hormones in both type 1 and 2 diabetes. In December 2009, Sanofi and the U.S. biotechnology company Alopexx Pharmaceuticals LLC simultaneously signed (i) a collaboration agreement, and (ii) an option for a license on an antibody for the prevention and treatment of infections originating in the bacterium that causes plague and other serious infections. In May 2009, Sanofi signed a global license agreement with Exelixis, Inc. for XL147 and XL765, and simultaneously signed an exclusive research collaboration agreement for the discovery of inhibitors of Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase (PI3K) for the management of malignant tumors. On December 22, 2011, Sanofi and Exelixis, Inc. agreed to end this collaboration agreement. May 2009, Sanofi signed a collaboration and licensing agreement with Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd, under which Sanofi obtained the worldwide rights to the anti-LIGHT fully human monoclonal antibody. This anti-LIGHT antibody is expected to be first-in-class in the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. In November 2007, Sanofi signed a collaboration agreement with Regeneron to discover, develop and commercialize fully human therapeutic antibodies. This agreement was broadened, and its term extended, on November 10, 2009. Under the terms of the development agreement, Sanofi committed to fund the discovery and pre-clinical development costs of Regeneron's antibody research program until 2017 (see Note C.2. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report). Once a product begins to be marketed, Regeneron will repay out of its profits (provided they are sufficient) half of the development costs borne by Sanofi. As of December 31, 2013, the balance of the development costs initially funded by Sanofi amounted to €1.3 billion. In September 2003, Sanofi signed a collaboration agreement in oncology with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Regeneron) to develop the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Trap program. Under the terms of the agreement, Sanofi will pay 100% of the development costs of the VEGF Trap. Once a VEGF Trap product starts to be marketed, Regeneron will repay 50% of the development costs (originally paid by Sanofi) in accordance with a formula based on Regeneron's share of the profits. Sanofi has also entered into the following major agreements, which are currently in a less advanced research phase: In November 2012, Sanofi and the U.S. biotechnology company Selecta Biosciences signed a collaboration agreement to identify and develop food allergy treatments using a technology based on nanoparticles. Since acquiring Genzyme in April 2011, the Group has had a commitment to Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. under a collaboration agreement signed in January 2008. This agreement granted an exclusive license to develop and commercialize mipomersen, a treatment in an advanced development phase for the treatment of severe familial hypercholesterolemia. 131 Table of Contents In December 2010: Sanofi signed a global licensing and patent transfer agreement with Ascendis Pharma (Ascendis) on the proprietary Transcon Linker and Hydrogel Carrier technology developed by Ascendis for precise, time-controlled release of therapeutic active ingredients into the body. The agreement will enable Sanofi to develop, manufacture and commercialize products combining this technology with active molecules for the treatment of diabetes and related disorders. Also in December 2010, Sanofi entered into an alliance with Avila Therapeutics Inc. (Avila) to discover target covalent drugs for the treatment of cancers, directed towards six signaling proteins that are critical in tumor cells. Under the terms of the agreement, Sanofi will have access to Avila's proprietary Avilomics® platform offering "protein silencing" for these pathogenic proteins. In June 2010, Sanofi entered into an alliance with Regulus Therapeutics Inc. to discover, develop and commercialize novel micro-RNA therapeutics, initially in fibrosis. Sanofi also received an option which if exercised would provide access to the technology to develop and commercialize other micro-RNA based therapeutics, beyond the first four targets. At the end of April 2010, Sanofi signed a license agreement with Glenmark Pharmaceuticals S.A. for the development and commercialization of novel agents to treat chronic pain. These are vanilloid receptor (TRPV3) antagonist molecules, including ERC 15300, a first-in-class clinical compound. At the end of September 2009, Sanofi and Merrimack Pharmaceuticals Inc. signed an exclusive global licensing and collaboration agreement covering the MM-121 molecule for the management of solid tumors. In July 2013, Sanofi decided to discontinue the project on novel classes of antibiotics derived from the RX-04 and Rib-X program, and to terminate its research agreement with Rib X Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In September 2013, Sanofi decided to discontinue the project to identify novel targets in oncology for the development of new therapeutic agents directed towards these targets and their associated biomarkers, and to end its collaboration with the Belfer Institute of Applied Cancer Science at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI). In November 2013, Sanofi decided to discontinue the project relating to an exclusive global licensing option with Oxford BioTherapeutics for three existing antibodies, plus a research and collaboration agreement to discover and validate new targets in oncology. In the Vaccines segment, Sanofi Pasteur has entered into a number of collaboration agreements. Milestone payments relating to development projects under those agreements amounted to €0.2 billion in 2013. In February 2014, pursuant to the "Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework for the sharing of influenza viruses and access to vaccines and other benefits", Sanofi Pasteur and the WHO signed a "Standard Material Transfer Agreement" (SMTA 2). This bilateral agreement stipulates that Sanofi Pasteur will, during declared pandemic periods, (i) donate 7.5% of its real-time production of pandemic vaccines against any strain with potential to cause a pandemic, and (ii) reserve a further 7.5% of such production on affordable terms. This agreement cancels and replaces all preceding commitments to donate pandemic vaccines to the WHO. Critical accounting and reporting policies Our consolidated financial statements are affected by the accounting and reporting policies that we use. Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition, and in some cases the application of these critical policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The accounting and reporting policies that we have identified as fundamental to a full understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are the following: Revenue recognition. Our policies with respect to revenue recognition are discussed in Note B.14. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. Revenue arising from the sale of goods is presented in the income statement under "Net sales". Net sales comprise revenue from sales of pharmaceutical products, vaccines, and active ingredients, net of sales returns, of customer incentives and discounts, and of certain sales-based payments paid or payable to the healthcare authorities. Revenue is recognized when all of the following conditions have been met: the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer; the Group no longer has effective control over the goods sold; the amount of revenue and costs associated with the transaction can be measured reliably; and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group. 132 Table of Contents We offer various types of price reductions on our products. In particular, products sold in the United States are covered by various programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid) under which products are sold at a discount. Rebates are granted to healthcare authorities, and under contractual arrangements with certain customers. Some wholesalers are entitled to chargeback incentives based on the selling price to the end customer, under specific contractual arrangements. Cash discounts may also be granted for prompt payment. The discounts, incentives and rebates described above are estimated on the basis of specific contractual arrangements with our customers or of specific terms of the relevant regulations and/or agreements applicable for transactions with healthcare authorities, and of assumptions about the attainment of sales targets. They are recognized in the period in which the underlying sales are recognized, as a reduction of sales revenue. We also estimate the amount of product returns, on the basis of contractual sales terms and reliable historical data; the same recognition principles apply to sales returns. For additional details regarding the financial impact of discounts, rebates and sales returns, see Note D.23. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. Non-product revenues, mainly comprising royalty income from license arrangements that constitute ongoing operations of the Group, are presented in "Other revenues". Business combinations. As discussed in Note B.3. "Business combinations and transactions with non-controlling interests" to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report, business combinations are accounted for by the acquisition method. The acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that satisfy the recognition criteria of IFRS 3 "Business combinations" are measured initially at their fair values as at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets classified as held for sale, which are measured at fair value less costs to sell. Business combinations completed on or after January 1, 2010 are accounted for in accordance with the revised IFRS 3 and the revised IAS 27, "Consolidated and individual financial statements". In particular, contingent consideration to former owners agreed in a business combination, e.g. in the form of payments upon the achievement of certain R&D milestones, is recognized as a liability at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any subsequent changes in amounts recorded as a liability are recognized in the consolidated income statement (see Note D.18. "Liabilities related to business combinations and non-controlling interests" to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report). Goodwill impairment and intangible assets. As discussed in Note B.6. "Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and investments in associates and joint ventures" and in Note D.5. "Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment" to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report, we test our intangible assets periodically for impairment. We test for impairment on the basis of the same objective criteria that were used for the initial valuation. Our initial valuation and ongoing tests are based on the relationship of the value of our projected future cash flows associated with the asset to either the purchase price of the asset (for its initial valuation) or the carrying amount of the asset (for ongoing tests). The determination of the underlying assumptions relating to the recoverability of intangible assets is subjective and requires the exercise of considerable judgment. Key assumptions relating to goodwill impairment and intangible assets are the perpetual growth rate and the post-tax discount rate. Any changes in key assumptions could result in an impairment charge. A sensitivity analysis to the key assumptions is disclosed in Note D.5. "Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment" to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. Pensions and post-retirement benefits. As described in Note B.23. "Employee benefit obligations" to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report, we recognize our pension and retirement benefit commitments as liabilities on the basis of an actuarial estimate of the potential rights vested in employees and retirees as of the balance sheet date, net of the valuation of funds to meet these obligations. We prepare this estimate at least on an annual basis taking into account financial assumptions (such as discount rates) and demographic assumptions (such as life expectancy, retirement age, employee turnover, and the rate of salary increases). We recognize all actuarial gains and losses (including the impact of a change in discount rate) immediately through equity. A sensitivity analysis to discount rate is set forth in Note D.19.1. "Provisions for pensions and other benefits" to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. Depending on the key assumptions used, the pension and post-retirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. A sensitivity analysis to these key assumptions is set forth in Note D.19.1. "Provisions for pensions and other benefits" to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. Deferred taxes. As discussed in Note B.22. "Income tax expense" to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report, we account for deferred taxes using the liability method, whereby 133 Table of Contents deferred income taxes are recognized on tax loss carry-forwards, and on the difference between the tax base and carrying amount of assets and liabilities. We calculate our deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates applicable for the years during which we estimate that the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We do not recognize deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The estimates of recognized deferred tax assets are based on our assumptions regarding future profits and the timing of reversal of temporary differences. These assumptions are regularly reviewed; however, final deferred income tax could differ from those estimates. Provisions for risks. Sanofi and its subsidiaries and affiliates may be involved in litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings. These proceedings typically are related to product liability claims, intellectual property rights, compliance and trade practices, commercial claims, employment and wrongful discharge claims, tax assessment claims, waste disposal and pollution claims, and claims under warranties or indemnification arrangements relating to business divestitures. As discussed in Note B.12. "Provisions for risks" at Item 18 of this annual report, we record a provision where we have a present obligation, whether legal or constructive, as a result of a past event; when it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the outflow of resources. For additional details regarding the financial impact of provisions for risks see Notes D.19.3. "Other provisions" and D.22. "Legal and Arbitral Proceedings" to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. Provisions are estimated on the basis of events and circumstances related to present obligations at the balance sheet date, of past experience, and to the best of management's knowledge at the date of preparation of the financial statements. The assessment of provisions can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. Given the inherent uncertainties related to these estimates and assumptions, the actual outflows resulting from the realization of those risks could differ from our estimates. Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees A. Directors and Senior Management The offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer have been separated since January 1, 2007. The annual evaluations conducted since that date have indicated that this governance structure is appropriate to the Group's current configuration. This arrangement was therefore continued with the appointment of Serge Weinberg to the office of Chairman on May 17, 2010 and again with his reappointment on May 6, 2011. The Board of Directors considers that this governance structure is appropriate in the Group's current context. The Chairman represents the Board of Directors, organizes and directs the work of the Board, and is responsible for ensuring the proper functioning of the corporate decision-making bodies in compliance with good governance practices. The Chairman coordinates the work of the Board of Directors with its Committees. The Chairman is accountable to the Shareholders' General Meeting, which he chairs. When the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separated, the Chairman may remain in office until the Ordinary Shareholders' General Meeting called to approve the financial statements held during the calendar year in which he reaches the age of 70. The Chairman being an independent director, the Board of Directors has not deemed it necessary to appoint a lead independent director, since this role has been broadly assumed by Serge Weinberg. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the management of the Company, and represents the Company in dealings with third parties within the limit of the corporate purpose. The Chief Executive Officer has the broadest powers to act in all circumstances in the name of the Company, subject to the powers that are attributed by law to the Board of Directors and the Shareholders' General Meeting and within the limits set by the Board of Directors. The Chief Executive Officer must be no more than 65 years old. 134 Table of Contents Limitations on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer set by the Board The Board of Directors Meeting of July 28, 2009 set limits on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer. The prior authorization of the Board of Directors is required to commit Sanofi to investments, acquisitions and divestments in the following cases: a €500 million cap for each undertaking pertaining to a previously approved strategy; and a €150 million cap for each undertaking not pertaining to a previously approved strategy. When the consideration payable to the contracting parties for such undertakings includes potential installment payments contingent upon the achievement of future results or objectives, such as the registration of one or more products, the caps are calculated by aggregating the various payments due from signature of the contract until (and including) filing of the first application for marketing authorization in the United States or in Europe. Board of Directors The Company is administered by a Board of Directors, currently comprising sixteen members. Since May 14, 2008, the terms of office of the directors have been staggered, in order to ensure that the directors are progressively re-elected. Each year, the Board of Directors conducts a review to ensure that there is an appropriate balance in its composition and the composition of its Committees. In particular, the Board seeks to ensure a balanced representation of men and women and diversity of background and country of origin, since the business of the Group is both diversified and global. The Board investigates and evaluates potential candidates whenever individual directors are up for election. Above all, the Board seeks talented directors, who show independence of mind and who are competent, dedicated and committed. Under the terms of the AFEP-MEDEF corporate governance code (hereafter referred to as the "AFEP-MEDEF Code"), a director is deemed to be independent when the director has no relationship of any nature whatsoever with the Company, the group it belongs to or its senior management which could compromise the exercise of the director's freedom of decision. More specifically, independent directors are required: not to be an employee or corporate officer of the Company, or a corporate officer of a related company; not to be a customer, supplier, or investment banker or corporate banker of the Company; not to have close family ties with any corporate officer of the Company; not to have acted as auditor for the Company over the course of the last five years; not to be representative of a significant shareholder or of a controlling interest of the Company. The influence of other factors such as length of service on the Board, the ability to understand challenges and risks, and the courage to express ideas and form a judgment, is also evaluated before a director qualifies as independent. In compliance with our Board Charter and pursuant to the AFEP-MEDEF Code, a discussion as to the independence of the current directors took place during the meeting of the Board of Directors of October 29, 2013. Of the sixteen directors, eleven were deemed to be independent directors with reference to the independence criteria used by the Board of Directors pursuant to the AFEP-MEDEF Code: Uwe Bicker, Robert Castaigne, Lord Douro, Jean-René Fourtou, Claudie Haigneré, Fabienne Lecorvaisier, Suet-Fern Lee, Carole Piwnica, Klaus Pohle, Gérard Van Kemmel and Serge Weinberg. In particular, it was determined that the situation of Robert Castaigne had changed. Until 2012, Robert Castaigne had not been considered as an independent director due to his past links with the Total Group. Since April 2008, when the independence criteria of the AFEP-MEDEF Code were adopted, his situation has changed in two ways: Robert Castaigne retired from the Total Group four years ago. Total passed below the threshold of 5% of our voting rights: notification of February 16, 2012. (Since that date, Total has ceased to have any equity interest in the Group.) 135 Table of Contents Consequently, the Board of Directors considered that the links with Total no longer created a presumption of non-independence. Moreover, contrary to the independence criteria set by the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Board of Directors does not consider that belonging to the Board for more than 12 years of itself disqualifies a director from being independent. The length of service criterion is intended to address the concern that the passage of time may deprive a director of his ability to challenge senior management. This is a legitimate concern, which Sanofi takes very seriously. Nevertheless a mechanical application of this criterion is not considered desirable as it does not take account of the diversity of situations. Consequently, although this criterion is applied by the Board of Directors, it is not of itself a determining factor in making a decision as to a director's independence. The Board of Directors assesses the reality of each situation when making a decision. In the case of Robert Castaigne, the Board considers that this director has always demonstrated a questioning approach, which is fundamentally what the APEF-MEDEF criteria are seeking to check. Finally, there was no other reason to determine that Robert Castaigne is not independent. Consequently, the Board determined on this basis, at its meeting of May 4, 2012, that Robert Castaigne qualified as an independent director. It should be noted that this decision has no detrimental effect on compliance with the independence rules of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, which is the main objective of the Code. The fact that the proportion of independent directors on the Board is over 68% demonstrates that the Board in no way underestimates the importance of having a majority of independent directors in its governance. In 2013, it was considered that the rules governing the office of the Chairman of the Board had changed, and they henceforth enabled the Board to consider the Chairman as an independent director in accordance with the continued assessment of the Board of Directors. Until 2013, Serge Weinberg had not been considered as an independent director only because of the previous version of the AFEP-MEDEF Code which in its former article 8.4 did not distinguish the case where the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separated from the case where both functions are combined. Effective June 2013, the AFEP-MEDEF Code (in its new article 9.4) stipulates that if the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separated, the Chairman is not automatically considered as non-independent, but his (or her) independence has to be scrutinized in the light of the criteria generally used to assess directors' independence. The Board of Directors considered that no factor other than his role as Chairman is liable to undermine his independence, especially given that prior joining the Board he had no links to Sanofi. The Board assessment concerning his situation was reflected in the previous annual reports on form 20-F. On October 29, 2013 the Board of Directors determined that Serge Weinberg was an independent director. In its examination of the independence of each Director, the Board of Directors took into account the various relationships that could exist between Directors and the Group and concluded that no such relationships were of a nature that might undermine their independence. The Board of Directors noted that the Company and its subsidiaries had, in the normal course of business, over the last three years, sold products and provided services to, and/or purchased products and received services from, companies in which certain of the Company's directors who are classified as independent or members of their close family were senior managers or employees during 2013. On each occasion, the amounts paid to or received from such companies over the past three years were determined on an arm's length basis and did not represent amounts that the Board regarded as undermining the independence of the Directors in question. Similarly, the Board of Directors did not find the office of trustee held by Uwe Bicker and Klaus Pohle with the Aventis Foundation (Germany) was of such a nature as to undermine their independence as members of the Sanofi Board of Directors. Appointments to the Board of Trustees of the Foundation are made independently of Sanofi. No more than one-third of the serving members of our Board of Directors may be over 70 years of age. Subject to the powers expressly attributed to the Shareholders' General Meeting and within the scope of the Company's corporate purpose, the Board of Directors' powers cover all issues relating to the proper management of the Company, and through its decisions the Board determines all matters falling within its authority. Board evaluation The Board Charter provides that a discussion of the operating procedures of the Board must be included on the agenda of a Board meeting once a year and that a formal evaluation must be performed every three years. 136 Table of Contents The latest three-year formal evaluation of the operating procedures of the Board and its committees took place in late 2012  early 2013. The directors were heavily involved in the process, as demonstrated by the quality and the quantity of their responses. The Board indicated that it wished its contributions to be systematically acted upon and implemented. The general appraisal of how the Board and its committees functioned was positive. The quality of the Audit Committee's work was particularly appreciated and acknowledged. The evaluation showed that R&D performance monitoring was appreciated, and the directors expressed their wish that it should be continued and intensified. Directors would welcome a systematic ex-post assessment of acquisitions. Since 2011, in response to needs expressed in the 2010 evaluation presentations from various Group activities have been given during Board meetings or Strategy Committee sessions. Directors requested more interactions with key Group managers. To satisfy this request, an annual business presentation program has been set up, systematically involving Group managers. Presentations were given by the Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President Legal Affairs and General Counsel, Vice President Global Compliance Officer, Executive Vice President Chief Strategy Officer, Senior Vice President Diabetes and Senior Vice President Zentiva. Directors expressed their desire to get more information about human resources management and our main competitors' strategies. In 2013, directors were regularly kept informed of the work conducted by the Appointments and Governance Committee on the succession planning review, in particular concerning the replacement of Hanspeter Spek (President Global Operations) following his retirement. Each business activity presentation included an overview of the market and the competitive environment. Concerning the composition of the Board, directors requested that the onboarding of more women be continued and that certain competencies be reinforced. This was achieved through the proposed appointment of Fabienne Lecorvaisier as a director. On arrival, Fabienne Lecorvaisier received several days' training during which she acclimatized herself to the Company, its businesses, the health sector background and in particular the pharmaceutical industry. Two strategic seminars took place in 2013: one in March on the Group research strategy in core disease areas, and a two-day seminar held in October in China which reviewed the development portfolio and the long range plan. The annual discussion of the Board's operations during 2013 delivered an overall positive self-evaluation. The Strategic Committee sessions centered on the R&D portfolio were perceived as having facilitated the Board's oversight of Sanofi's performance in research and development. The directors also felt that their contacts with the Group's management had improved in both quality and frequency. The recent changes in board composition were viewed favorably and the directors indicated a desire to see continued investment in pharmaceutical expertise. The directors gave particularly positive feedback of their session in China, which they felt permitted them to better understand the context and the challenges of this country.

Fabienne Lecorvaisier was appointed as a Director of our Company at the Shareholders' General Meeting held on May 3, 2013. This appointment is in line with the Board of Directors' wish to increase the proportion of women on the Board but also to reinforce certain competencies, notably in finance. This appointment raises the number of female directors to four, i.e. 25% of the directors. No mandate was up for renewal in 2013. Following the enactment of the June 14, 2013 French Employment Protection Act, the Appointments and Governance Committee assessed its impact on Sanofi. The Board of Directors concluded that our Company does not fall within the scope of this Act because it has no obligation to set up a works council and indeed has set up none, the workforce of the parent company being less than 50. 153 Table of Contents Under current French legislation, and given that employees own less than 3% of our share capital, the Board does not include a director representing employee shareholders. Nevertheless, five Group employee representatives attend Board meetings without voting rights pursuant to the agreement implemented with the European Works Council signed in February 24, 2005. In addition, those French subsidiaries that fall within the scope of the new Act will appoint employee representatives to the Board.

Compensation Compensation and pension arrangements for corporate officers The compensation policy for corporate officers is established by the Board of Directors upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee. The Board of Directors follows the AFEP-MEDEF Code when setting the compensation of our corporate officers. The AFEP-MEDEF Code and the recommendations of the Autorité des marchés financiers (the French market regulator, hereafter referred to as "AMF"), require precise disclosures about the implementation of the recommendations and, if applicable, explanations of the reasons why any of them may not have been implemented. Currently, as reported " C. Board Practices  ", there is no divergence from the AFEP-MEDEF Code related to compensation. Serge Weinberg Serge Weinberg has held the office of Chairman of the Board of Directors since May 17, 2010. He was an outside appointment and has never had an employment contract with Sanofi distinct from his current office. The Chairman of the Board also chairs the Strategy Committee and the Appointments and Governance Committee. In accordance with our Board Charter and in close collaboration with the Senior Management, he represents the Company in high-level dealings with governmental bodies and with the Group's key partners, both nationally and internationally, and participates in defining the major strategic choices of the Group especially as regards mergers, acquisitions and alliances. The Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer keep each other fully informed of their actions. The compensation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors consists solely of fixed compensation and benefits in kind and excludes any variable compensation, any awards of stock options and performance shares and any directors' attendance fees. The corporate officers do not receive directors' attendance fees in their capacity as directors. Consequently, Serge Weinberg does not receive directors' attendance fees in his capacity as chairman of the Appointments and Governance Committee or as chairman of the Strategy Committee.

On March 5, 2013, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors set the terms of the compensation of Serge Weinberg. For 2013, his fixed compensation was maintained at an annual rate of €700,000. He did not receive any variable compensation, stock options, or performance shares.

On March 5, 2014, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors set the terms of the compensation of Serge Weinberg. For 2014, his fixed compensation is maintained at an annual rate of €700,000. He will not receive any variable compensation, stock options, or performance shares. He will not receive attendance fees. Christopher Viehbacher Christopher Viehbacher has held the office of Chief Executive Officer of Sanofi since December 1, 2008. He was an outside appointment and has never had an employment contract with Sanofi distinct from his current office. The compensation policy of Christopher Viehbacher follows the same structures and principles as the Group compensation policy described later in this section of the report. The Sanofi compensation policy seeks to be consistent with market and industry practice in order to provide competitive levels of compensation, to create a strong link between company performance and individual contribution and to maintain a balance between short-term performance and mid-long-term performance. The compensation of the Chief Executive Officer is determined by the Board of Directors upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee with reference to compensation paid to the chief executive officers of major global pharmaceutical companies and of major companies in the CAC 40 stock market index. Consistency with market practice is fundamental in order to attract and retain the talents necessary to the Group's success. Sanofi compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer aims at achieving a balance in the compensation structure between fixed compensation, short-term variable cash compensation, and medium-term variable equity compensation. The amounts of fixed and variable compensation are stable over time. Compensation adjustments based on performance and market practice are carried out through equity compensation, which is medium-term and aims at aligning his interest with those of our shareholders and stakeholders. Our overall compensation policy is designed to motivate and reward performance by ensuring that a significant portion of executive and employee compensation is contingent on the attainment of financial, operational and social criteria aligned with the corporate interest and creation of shareholder value. Variable cash compensation and equity compensation are the two principal levers for action. 159 Table of Contents Equity compensation is a critical tool for the worldwide attractiveness of Sanofi as an employer, and aims to align employee and shareholder interests and reinforce employees' ties to the Group. Upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors determines the performance conditions attached to equity compensation for all beneficiaries at Sanofi and its subsidiaries worldwide, favoring the attainment of goals based on the Group's consolidated results and balance sheet. Since 2011 our equity compensation plan rules have been made available to our shareholders on the governance page of our website (www.sanofi.com) in the same form as that distributed to our employees. Since 2011 the Board of Directors has substantially reworked our equity compensation policy to reinforce the link with long-term performance for all beneficiaries and to reduce potential dilution. As a result of very positive shareholder feedback collected through corporate governance roadshows, contacts with governance professionals and the results of the last three Annual General Meetings, the Board has decided to maintain this policy and reinforce it in 2013. The current policy can generally be characterized by reduced dilution; diversified, multi-year performance conditions; increased transparency; and specific additional requirements for the Chief Executive Officer. The policy requires that grants be primarily based on performance shares with only a limited number of high-level executives (members of the Global Leadership Team) continuing to receive stock options. A greater reliance on performance shares allows the Board of Directors to maintain a comparable level of employee incentivization while reducing the dilutive effect for existing shareholders. However, the Board of Directors continues to believe that options remain an appropriate component of the compensation of senior managers, due to their multiplier effect. The Board of Directors subject any grant of options to subscribe for shares and performance shares to several distinct performance criteria in order to ensure that Sanofi equity compensation incentivizes strong overall performance and does not encourage excessive risk taking. Failure to achieve these conditions over the entire performance period is sanctioned by a reduction or loss of the grant. Grants are also contingent on the beneficiary's continued employment in the Sanofi Group (4 years for options, 3 to 4 years for performance shares). The exercise price of options to subscribe for shares set by the Board never incorporates a discount, and must be at least equal to the average of the quoted market prices on the 20 trading sessions preceding the date of grant by the Board. The Board is not allowed to reset prior grants, for instance with easier performance conditions or a lower strike price. Each grant to the Chief Executive Officer takes into account previous grants and his global compensation. The compensation of Christopher Viehbacher is made up of the following elements: fixed compensation; benefits in kind; annual variable compensation subject to annual objectives; equity compensation consisting of options to subscribe for shares and performance shares, subject to both internal and external conditions measured over three years and to stringent lock-up obligations. In addition, Christopher Viehbacher benefits from: a top-up defined benefit pension plan; a termination benefit contingent upon performance conditions and only payable if the departure is non-voluntary and linked to a change in control or strategy. 160 Table of Contents Compensation, options and shares awarded to Christopher Viehbacher (in euros) 2013 2012 2011 Compensation payable for the year (details provided in the table below) 2,964,976 3,522,051 3,488,287 Value of stock subscription options awarded during the year(1) 2,884,800 2,020,800 2,364,000 Value of performance shares awarded during the year(2) 2,798,550 1,938,300 1,282,500 Total 8,648,326 7,481,151 7,134,787 (1) Valued at date of grant using the Black & Scholes method assuming fulfillment of the performance conditions.(2) Valued at date of grant assuming fulfillment of the performance conditions.

At its meeting on March 5, 2012, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors established the terms of the compensation package for Christopher Viehbacher for 2012. His fixed annual compensation was set at €1,260,000 as from March 5, 2012, i.e. the total fixed compensation for 2012 amounted to €1,250,000. This represented an increase of 5% compared to the level of fixed compensation set by the Board in 2008 at the time Christopher Viehbacher was recruited. At its meeting of March 5, 2013, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors established the terms of the compensation package for Christopher Viehbacher for 2013. His fixed compensation was maintained at €1,260,000 for 2013. For 2013, the variable compensation of Christopher Viehbacher could have represented between 0% and 200% of his fixed compensation. His variable compensation with respect to 2013 has been established on the basis of quantitative and qualitative criteria. These criteria were as follows: attainment of financial targets compared to our budget (45%) This objective included four components: Business Net Income, development of the growth platforms, gross margin and cash flow; improved performance in research and development (25%). This objective included net sales of new products, new product registration and developments in the product portfolio; organizational structure of the Group and succession planning for key posts in the Group (15%). This objective covered the implementation of a Group organizational structure suited to its strategy, succession planning for key posts, and the transition in commercial operations after the retirement of Hanspeter Spek (President Global Operations); corporate social responsibility (15%). This objective covered the environment, product quality and compliance. Objectives based on operations and research and development are quantitative criteria, whereas objectives based on the Group organizational structure and succession planning are of a qualitative nature. Corporate social 161 Table of Contents responsibility criteria are partially quantitative and partially qualitative. Overall, quantitative objectives account for 77.5% and qualitative objectives account for 22.5%. In general, the performance criteria apply not only to variable compensation but also to the vesting of stock options and performance shares in compliance with our targets, which are ambitious. For reasons of confidentiality, the precise targets set for the quantitative and qualitative criteria, even though they have been properly established in a precise manner, cannot be publicly disclosed. In evaluating these criteria, the performance of the major global pharmaceutical companies was taken into account. The Board considered that the financial targets were not fully attained, while all the other criteria concerning research and development, organizational structure and succession planning, and corporate social responsibility were fulfilled. On the basis of the foregoing, the Board of Directors fixed his variable compensation for 2013 at €1,701,000, i.e., 135% of the fixed portion of his compensation. Christopher Viehbacher's 2013 variable compensation is to be paid in 2014. The amount reported for benefits in kind relates to a company car with a chauffeur. At its meeting on March 5, 2014, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors established the terms of the compensation package for Christopher Viehbacher for 2014. His fixed compensation for 2014 is maintained at €1,260,000. His variable compensation with respect to 2014 will be established on the basis of the same structure of objectives as in 2013: 45% based on operations, 25% based on R&D, 15% based on organizational structure and talent management, and 15% based on corporate social responsibility. Defined targets are set for each of these criteria. For 2014, the variable compensation of Christopher Viehbacher may represent between 0% and 200% of his fixed compensation. Stock options awarded to Christopher Viehbacher in 2013 Origin Date of Board grant Nature of options Value (in €) Number of options awarded in 2013 Exercise price (in €) Exercise period Sanofi 03/05/2013 Subscription options 2,884,800 240,000 72.19 03/06/2017 03/05/2023 On March 5, 2013, 240,000 share subscription options were awarded to Christopher Viehbacher. In compliance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the entire award is contingent upon both internal criteria based upon Business Net Income and Return on Assets ("ROA"), and an external criterion based on Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") in comparison to a reference set of pharmaceutical companies. These criteria were selected because they align medium-term equity-based compensation on the strategy adopted by the Company. This award is broken down as follows: The performance criterion based on Business Net Income covers 40% of the award and refers to the ratio, at constant exchange rates, between actual Business Net Income and the Business Net Income specified in the budget. If the ratio is less than 95%, the corresponding options will lapse. The Business Net Income target may not be lower that the lower range of the guidance published by the Company at the beginning of each year. The ROA-based criterion covers 40% of the award. The schedule includes a target ROA, below which the performance will be penalized by the lapsing of some or all of the options. The TSR-based criterion covers 20% of the award. The overall return to shareholders is evaluated both on the value of Sanofi shares (the increase in the share price) and the value distributed to shareholders (dividends), i.e. the two sources of a return on investment in Sanofi shares. Our TSR is compared with a reference set comprised of 11 companies, i.e. Sanofi, Astra Zeneca, Bayer, BMS, Eli Lilly, GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, and Roche. The number of options exercisable depends upon our position in comparison to the TSR for the other companies of this panel. Below the median, the corresponding options will lapse. 162 Table of Contents In addition to the three conditions set forth above, an implicit condition exists in the form of the exercise price, as well as the condition of continuing employment. In order to bring the equity-based compensation in line with the medium-term performance, performance will be measured over three financial years. The Board considers that these performance conditions are good indicators of the development of shareholder value in terms of: the quality of investment decisions in a period where external growth plays a greater role than in the past (ROA condition); a commitment to delivering challenging bottom-line results in a tough business environment (Business Net Income condition); and matching or exceeding our peer group as in terms of shareholder returns (TSR condition). Although for reasons of confidentiality the quantitative measures for the internal criteria cannot be publicly disclosed, even though they have been properly established in a precise manner, the targets and the level of attainment for the internal criteria will be publicly disclosed at the end of the performance measurement period. Using the Black & Scholes method, each option awarded on March 5, 2013 was valued at €12.02, valuing the total benefit at €2,884,800. The Board of Directors previously decided to limit the number of options that could be awarded to Christopher Viehbacher to 10% of the total limit approved by the Shareholders' General Meeting held on May 6, 2011 (1% of our share capital). The number of options awarded to Christopher Viehbacher in 2013 represents 1.81% of the total limit approved by the Shareholders' General Meeting held on May 6, 2011 (1% of our share capital) and 30.43% of the total award to all beneficiaries on March 5, 2013. The Board of Directors has decided to limit the number of options that could be awarded to Christopher Viehbacher to 15% of the total limit approved by the Shareholders' General Meeting held on May 3, 2013 (0.7% of our share capital). It is important to note that since 2011, options to subscribe for shares have been restricted to members of the Global Leadership Team and are no longer offered to all beneficiaries of equity compensation plans. This explains why the proportion of the option plans granted to Christopher Viehbacher is higher than in the past.

The Board considers that disclosing the level of attainment allows our shareholders to better understand the demanding nature of the performance conditions. The 2009 performance share plan and the 2011 stock option plan were the first plans for which the Board of Directors determined the level of fulfillment of the performance conditions. On March 1, 2010, 275,000 subscription options were awarded to Christopher Viehbacher. All of these options were subject to a performance condition. The performance condition, which had to be fulfilled each financial year preceding the vesting of the shares (i.e. 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013), was based on a ratio of adjusted net income excluding selected items (which was a non-GAAP financial measure used until the end of 2009) to net sales of at 163 Table of Contents least 18%. On February 5, 2014, the Board of Directors determined that the conditions had been met and that the 275,000 options would be exercisable subject to meeting the condition of continuing employment. On March 5, 2014, 240,000 share subscription options were awarded to Christopher Viehbacher. In compliance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the entire award is contingent upon both internal criteria based on Business Net Income and Return on Assets ("ROA"), and an external criterion based on Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") in comparison to a reference set of eleven pharmaceutical companies. These criteria were maintained because they align medium-term equity-based compensation with the strategy adopted by the Company. This award is broken down as follows: The performance criterion based on Business Net Income covers 40% of the award and refers to the ratio, at constant exchange rates, between actual Business Net Income and the Business Net Income specified in the budget. If the ratio is less than 95%, the corresponding options will lapse. The Business Net Income target may not be lower than the lower range of the guidance published by the Company at the beginning of each year. The ROA-based criterion covers 40% of the award. The schedule includes a target ROA, below which the performance will be penalized by the lapsing of some or all of the options. The TSR-based criterion covers 20% of the award. The overall return to shareholders is evaluated both on the value of Sanofi shares (the increase in the share price) and the value distributed to shareholders (dividends), i.e. the two sources of return on investment in Sanofi shares. Our TSR is compared with a reference set comprised of eleven companies, i.e. Sanofi, Astra Zeneca, Bayer, BMS, Eli Lilly, GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, and Roche. The number of options exercisable depends upon our position in comparison to the TSR for the other companies of this panel. In addition to the three conditions set forth above, an implicit condition exists in the form of the exercise price, as well as the condition of continuing employment. Performance will be measured over three financial years. The targets and the level of achievement for the internal criteria will be disclosed publicly at the end of the performance measurement period. Christopher Viehbacher did not exercise any stock options in 2013. As of the date of publication of this document, the total number of unexercised options held by Christopher Viehbacher represented 0.12% of the share capital as at December 31, 2013. Performance shares awarded to Christopher Viehbacher in 2013 Origin Date of Board award Value (in €) Number of performance shares awarded in 2013 Vesting date Availability date Sanofi 03/05/13 2,798,550 45,000 03/06/2016 03/06/2018 On March 5, 2013, 45,000 performance shares were awarded to Christopher Viehbacher. The Compensation Committee, based on benchmarks for the compensation of chief executive officers in pharmaceutical companies, noted that Christopher Viehbacher's equity compensation was in the lower range and recommended increasing the number of performance shares granted. The Board of Directors therefore decided to increase his grant from 42,000 performance shares under the March 5, 2012 plan to 45,000 under the March 5, 2013 plan. In compliance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the entire award is contingent upon both internal criteria based on Business Net Income and Return on Assets ("ROA"), and an external criterion based upon Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") in comparison to a reference set of pharmaceutical companies. These criteria were selected because they align medium-term equity-based compensation with the strategy adopted by the Company. Each performance share awarded on March 5, 2013, was valued at €62.19, valuing the total benefit at €2,798,550. This award is broken down as follows: The performance criterion based on Business Net Income covers 40% of the award and refers to the ratio, at constant exchange rates, between actual Business Net Income and the Business Net Income specified in the 164 Table of Contents budget. If the ratio is less than 95%, the corresponding performance shares will lapse. The Business Net Income target may not be lower that the lower range of the guidance published by the Company at the beginning of each year. The ROA-based criterion covers 40% of the award. The schedule includes a target ROA, below which the performance will be penalized by the lapsing of part or all of the performance shares. The TSR-based criterion covers 20% of the award. The overall return to shareholders is evaluated both on the value of Sanofi shares (the increase in the share price) and the value distributed to shareholders (dividends), i.e. the two sources of return on investment in Sanofi shares. Our TSR is compared with a reference set comprised of eleven companies, i.e. Sanofi, Astra Zeneca, Bayer, BMS, Eli Lilly, GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, and Roche. The number of shares definitively acquired depends upon our position in comparison to the TSR for the other companies of this panel. Below the median, the corresponding performance shares will lapse. In order to bring the equity-based compensation in line with the medium-term performance, performance will be measured over three financial years. The Board considers that these performance conditions are good indicators of the development of shareholder value in terms of: the quality of investment decisions in a period where external growth plays a greater role than in the past (ROA condition); a commitment to delivering challenging bottom-line results in a tough business environment (Business Net Income condition); and matching or exceeding our peer group in terms of shareholder returns (TSR condition). Although for reasons of confidentiality, the quantitative measures for the internal criteria cannot be publicly disclosed, even though they have been properly established in a precise manner, the targets and the level of attainment for the internal criteria will be publicly disclosed at the end of the performance measurement period. The Board of Directors has decided to limit the number of performance shares that could be awarded to Christopher Viehbacher to 5% of the total limit approved by Shareholders' General Meeting held on May 4, 2012 (1.2% of our share capital).The number of shares awarded to Christopher Viehbacher in 2013 represents 0.28% of this total limit approved by the Shareholders' General Meeting held on May 4, 2012 and 1.05% of the total award to all beneficiaries on March 5, 2013.

This award is not included in the schedule above as Christopher Viehbacher subsequently renounced this award. On March 5, 2014, 45,000 performance shares were awarded to Christopher Viehbacher. In compliance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the entire award is contingent upon both internal criteria based on Business Net Income and Return on Assets ("ROA"), and an external criterion based on Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") in comparison to a reference set of eleven pharmaceutical companies.

The targets and the level of attainment of the internal criteria will be disclosed publicly at the end of the performance measurement period. In making the 2014 award, the Board of Directors had to determine whether to make these awards contingent upon future share purchases. Taking into account the number of shares acquired at the outset of his mandate and the lock-up obligations applicable to shares obtained on exercise of stock options or disposition of performance shares, as well as share purchases made spontaneously by Christopher Viehbacher, the Board of Directors decided not to require him to acquire any further shares at his own expense. Indeed, of the 135,442 shares owned by Christopher Viehbacher, 40,442 have been acquired at his own expense. As of the date of this annual report, the total number of performance shares awarded to Christopher Viehbacher represents 0.017% of our share capital as of December 31, 2013. Performance shares awarded to Christopher Viehbacher which became available in 2013 65,000 performance shares that were awarded to Christopher Viehbacher on March 2, 2009 and vested on March 3, 2011, became available on March 4, 2013. Pension arrangements for Christopher Viehbacher Christopher Viehbacher is covered by the Sanofi top-up defined benefit pension plan (which has been called the Sanofi plan since the Company changed its name). The plan is offered to all employees of Sanofi and its French subsidiaries who meet the eligibility criteria specified in the plan rules. This plan was set up on October 1, 2008 as the final stage in the process of harmonizing the status of personnel across the French subsidiaries. This top-up defined-benefit pension plan is offered to executives (within the meaning of the AGIRC regime  Association Générale des Institutions de Retraite des Cadres, a confederation of executive pension funds) of Sanofi and its French subsidiaries who meet the eligibility criteria specified in the plan rules; the benefit is contingent upon the plan member ending his or her career within the Group. The plan is reserved for executives with at least ten years' service whose annual base compensation has for ten years (not necessarily consecutive) exceeded four times the French social security ceiling, and is wholly funded by the Company. Based on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuation of this plan, 538 executives were potentially eligible for this plan (6 retirees, 99 early retirees and 433 active employees) as of December 31, 2013. The top-up pension, which may not exceed 37.50% (1.5% per year of service capped at 25 years) of the reference compensation, is in the form of a life annuity, and is transferable as a survivor's pension. The annuity is based on the arithmetical average of the three highest years' average annual gross compensation (fixed plus variable) paid during the five years (not necessarily consecutive) preceding final cessation of employment. This reference compensation is capped at 60 times the French social security ceiling ("PASS") applicable in the year in which the rights vest. This annuity supplements the schemes to which Christopher Viehbacher may be eligible in France or abroad, subject to a cap on the total pension from all sources equal to 52% of the reference compensation. When the total amount of the annuities paid pursuant to the different schemes exceeds this 52% cap, the amount of the Sanofi top-up defined-benefit pension is reduced accordingly to respect this cap. Because Christopher Viehbacher has pursued his career in different countries and in different groups, he has not continuously paid his contribution to the French compulsory industry schemes. Taking into account the award of ten years' service at his arrival and the five years spent at Sanofi, he has to date accumulated 15 years of service. As of 166 Table of Contents today, the reference compensation being limited to 60x PASS (i.e. €2,221,920 in 2013), the maximum theoretical amount of the annuity is 22.5% of this amount, i.e. €499,932. If Christopher Viehbacher were to leave at legal retirement age, he would have accumulated 28 years of service (the award of ten years' service at his arrival and 18 years of service since his arrival). His length of service would therefore be capped at 25 years pursuant to the Sanofi plan rules. Furthermore, in order to receive this pension, Christopher Viehbacher would have to be entitled to benefit from compulsory industry schemes, which means that if he were to leave before the legal retirement age with full pension rights, he will lose the entire benefit of the Sanofi top-up defined-benefit pension. In any event, this benefit was taken into account by the Board of Directors when setting his global compensation. The admission of Christopher Viehbacher to this plan was approved by the Shareholders' General Meeting of April 17, 2009. Commitments in favor of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer in office as of December 31, 2013 Contract of employment Top-up pension plan Compensation or benefits payable or potentially payable on termination of office Compensation payable under non-competition clause Serge Weinberg No No No No Christopher Viehbacher No Yes Yes No In the event of his removal from office as Chief Executive Officer, Christopher Viehbacher would receive a termination benefit equivalent to 24 months of total compensation on the basis of his fixed compensation effective on the date he ceases to hold office and the last variable compensation received prior to that date, subject to the performance criteria described below. In accordance with article L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code, payment of the termination benefit would be contingent upon fulfillment of two of the three performance criteria listed below, assessed over the three financial years preceding his ceasing to hold office. The three criteria are: the average of the ratios of adjusted net income excluding selected items (which was a non-GAAP financial measure used until the end of 2009) to net sales for each financial year must be at least 15%; the average of the ratios of operating cash flow before changes in working capital to net sales for each financial year must be at least 18%; the average of the growth rates for the Group's activities, measured for each financial year in terms of net sales on a comparable basis, must be at least equal to the average of the growth rates of the Pharmaceutical and Vaccines activities of the top 12 global pharmaceutical companies, measured for each financial year in terms of net sales adjusted for the principal effects of exchange rates and changes in scope of consolidation. The terms for the termination benefit entitlement of Christopher Viehbacher were approved by the Shareholders' Annual General Meeting of April 17, 2009. Any activation of this termination benefit will be carried out in compliance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, i.e. only if the departure is non-voluntary and linked to a change in control or strategy. 167 Table of Contents This termination benefit, as well as the pension benefit, was negotiated at the time of the recruitment of Christopher Viehbacher, and hence at a time when there was no conflict of interest. Moreover, the terms and conditions for the payment of this termination benefit comply with the AFEP-MEDEF Code. Lock-up obligation for shares obtained on exercise of stock options or disposition of performance shares by the Chief Executive Officer Until he ceases to hold office, the Chief Executive Officer will be required to retain, in the form of Sanofi shares, 50% of any capital gains (net of taxes and social contributions) obtained by the exercise of stock options or upon disposition of performance shares awarded by Sanofi. He must hold these shares in registered form. In compliance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code and our Board Charter, Christopher Viehbacher has undertaken to refrain from entering into speculative or hedging transactions, and, so far as Sanofi is aware, no such instruments have been contracted. Compensation and pension payments for Directors other than the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer Attendance fees The table below shows amounts paid to each member of the Sanofi Board of Directors in respect of 2012 and 2013, including those whose term of office ended during these years. Attendance fees in respect of 2012, the amount of which was approved by the Board meeting of March 5, 2013, were paid in 2013. Attendance fees in respect of 2013, the payment timing schedule for which was determined at the Board meeting of July 31, 2013, and the amount of which was approved at the Board meeting of March 5, 2014. These fees were partially paid in July 2013. The balance will be paid in 2013. For 2013, the basic annual attendance fee was set at €15,000, apportioned on a time basis for Directors who assumed or left office during the year. For 2013, the variable portion of the fee is linked to actual attendance by Directors in accordance with the principles described below: Directors resident in France receive €5,000 per Board or Committee meeting attended, except for Audit Committee meetings for which the fee is €7,500 per meeting; Directors resident outside France receive €7,000 per Board meeting attended, and €7,500 per Committee meeting attended; the chairman of the Compensation Committee receives €7,500 per Committee meeting; the chairman of the Audit Committee, who is resident outside France, receives €10,000 per Committee meeting. The attendance fee payable to a Director who participates by conference call or by videoconference is equivalent to half of the attendance fee received by a French Director who attends in person. As an exception, some dual meetings give entitlement to a single attendance fee: if on the day of a Shareholders' General Meeting, the Board of Directors meets both before and after the Meeting, only one attendance fee is paid for both; if a Director participates in a meeting of the Compensation Committee and in a meeting of the Appointments and Governance Committee the same day, only one attendance fee is paid for both. Hence, in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, attendance fees are allocated predominantly on a variable basis. 168 Table of Contents The Shareholders' Annual General Meeting of May 6, 2011 approved a proposal to increase the maximum amount of annual attendance fees to €1,500,000.

Pensions The amount recognized in 2013 in respect of corporate pension plans for directors with current or past executive responsibilities at Sanofi (or companies whose obligations have been assumed by Sanofi) was €4.0 million. As retirees, Jean-René Fourtou and Igor Landau are covered by the "GRCD" top-up pension plan instituted in 1977 for senior executives of Rhône-Poulenc. This plan was amended in 1994, 1996, 1999 and 2003, and as of December 31, 2013 applied to 31 beneficiaries (one active executive, three early retirees and 27 retired executives, including three survivor's pensions). At its meeting of February 11, 2008, the Board of Directors decided to close this plan to new entrants. Christopher Viehbacher does not benefit from this top-up pension plan. Compensation of Senior Management The compensation of the other Executive Committee members is established upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee taking into consideration the practices of major global pharmaceutical companies. In addition to fixed compensation, they receive variable compensation. Variable compensation generally represents 70% to 100% of their fixed compensation. The amount of the individual variable compensation is set pursuant to market practice. It rewards the individual contribution of each Executive Committee member to the Group performance as well as the performance of his/her organization. For 2013, the variable compensation was composed of two elements: the attainment of quantitative objectives (accounting for 75%), which are measured at Group level and at the Executive Committee member organization or function level; and the attainment of qualitative objectives, both individually and collectively within the Executive Committee (accounting for 25%). 169 Table of Contents The objectives are intended particularly to reflect growth (new product registration, growth in net sales of new products); cash flow optimization; talent management and critical skills (including selected key recruitments in critical areas for the Group); increase in the number of women in senior management positions; and promotion of high potential individuals. In addition to cash compensation, Executive Committee members may be awarded share subscription or purchase options and/or performance shares (see "Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees  E. Share Ownership" for details of the related plans). With respect to 2013, the total gross compensation paid and accrued in respect of members of the Executive Committee (including the Chief Executive Officer) amounted to €14.9 million, including €6.8 million in fixed compensation. In 2011, the Board of Directors made significant changes to its equity compensation policy. In order to limit the dilutive effect on shareholders, the Board of Directors determined to primarily award performance shares, except for a limited group of senior managers who may continue to receive options. The members of the Executive Committee are included in this limited group. Furthermore, whoever the beneficiary is, any award of options or performance shares will henceforth be fully contingent upon the performance targets being achieved over several financial years, as well as a condition of still being an employee when the option is exercised or the performance share is delivered. On March 5, 2013, 402,000 share subscription options were awarded to members of the Executive Committee (including 240,000 options awarded to Christopher Viehbacher). The entire award was contingent upon the same internal criteria based on Business Net Income and Return on Assets (ROA) as Christopher Viehbacher, but excluding the TSR-based criterion. Consequently, the weighting of the two criteria is different, with each representing 50% of the grant. The quantitative measures of performance are the same as for the award of Christopher Viehbacher. Although for reasons of confidentiality, the quantitative measures for the internal criteria cannot be publicly disclosed, even though they have been properly established in a precise manner, the targets and the level of attainment for the internal criteria will be publicly disclosed at the end of the performance measurement period. As of December 31, 2013 a total of 3,400,000 options had been awarded to members of the Executive Committee (existing plans or plans ending in 2013). As of the same date, members of the Executive Committee held 3,015,000 unexercised options. These figures include the unexercised options awarded to Christopher Viehbacher, who is also a member of the Executive Committee.

The number is subject to performance conditions During 2013, 313,000 share subscription options were exercised by individuals who were members of the Executive Committee when they exercised. These exercises related to one option plan that pre-dates the creation of the Executive Committee (sanofi-aventis subscription option plan of December 10, 2003 with an exercise price of €55.74), and two plans that post-date the creation of the Executive Committee (sanofi-aventis subscription option plan of December 13, 2007 with an exercise price of €62.33 and sanofi-aventis subscription option plan of March 9, 2009 with an exercise price of €45.09). 170 Table of Contents On March 5, 2013, 120,600 performance shares (including 45,000 performance shares awarded to Christopher Viehbacher) were awarded to members of the Executive Committee.

The number is subject to performance conditions In 2014, the Senior Management decided to put in place performance share units (hereafter "PSU") for beneficiaries (excluding the Chief Executive Officer) whose award exceeds a specified number of performance shares. The aim is to reduce the dilution resulting from share-based plans while conducting a compensation policy that is both attractive and comparable to major global companies. These PSUs allow the beneficiaries to receive, subject to the fulfilment of performance conditions, cash compensation which is indexed to the value of the Sanofi share. Upon vesting, the amount received is equal to the number of PSUs (after applying the performance conditions) multiplied by the share value. The PSUs are subject to the same performance conditions as the performance shares, and to a 3-year continuing employment condition. Around 177 Group employees benefited from PSUs in 2014. On March 5, 2014, 622,500 share subscription options, 67,000 performance shares and 156,500 PSUs were awarded to members of the Executive Committee (including 240,000 options and 45,000 performance shares awarded to Christopher Viehbacher). The entire Executive Committee award is contingent upon the same internal criteria based on Business Net Income and Return on Assets (ROA) as Christopher Viehbacher, but excluding the TSR-based criterion. Consequently, the weighting of the two criteria is different, with each representing 50% of the grant. The quantitative measures of performance are the same as for the award of Christopher Viehbacher. Although for reasons of confidentiality, the quantitative measures for the internal criteria cannot be publicly disclosed, even though they have been properly established in a precise manner, the targets and the level of achievement for the internal criteria will be publicly disclosed at the end of the performance measurement period. As part of its commitment to transparency, Sanofi has undertaken to publish in its annual report the level of attainment determined by the Board of Directors for performance conditions applicable to future equity-based compensation plans awarded to Christopher Viehbacher and the other members of the Executive Committee. The Board considers that disclosing the level of attainment allows our shareholders to better understand the demanding nature of the performance conditions. For disclosures about the level of attainment of the various equity-based compensation plans, see " B. Compensation  Compensation and pension arrangements for corporate officers  171 Table of Contents Christopher Viehbacher", bearing in mind that the TSR-based criterion only applies to the Chief Executive Officer and that the criteria based on Business Net Income and the ROA each apply to 50% of the grant. Under French law, Directors may not receive options solely as compensation for service on our Board, and consequently our Company may grant options only to those Directors who are also our officers. Because some of our non-executive Directors were formerly officers or executive officers of our Company or its predecessor companies, some of our non-executive Directors hold Sanofi stock options. We do not have separate profit-sharing plans for key executives. As employees, they are able to participate in our voluntary and statutory profit-sharing schemes on the same terms as our other employees. These plans are described below under " Employees  Profit-sharing schemes." The total amount accrued as of December 31, 2013 in respect of corporate pension plans for (i) directors with current or past executive responsibilities at Sanofi or at companies whose obligations have been assumed by Sanofi and (ii) members of the Executive Committee was €125 million, including €10 million recognized in the income statement for the year ended December 31, 2013. This total amount accrued as of December 31, 2013 included €51 million for members of the Executive Committee collectively, including €8 million recognized in the income statement for the year ended December 31, 2013. C. Board Practices Neither we nor our subsidiaries have entered into service contracts with members of our Board of Directors providing for benefits upon termination of employment. With respect to Christopher Viehbacher, see also " B. Compensation  Christopher Viehbacher" above. Application of the AFEP-MEDEF Code The AFEP-MEDEF Code requires us to specifically report on the application of its recommendations and, if applicable, explain why any of them have not been applied. Sanofi follows the guidelines contained in the AFEP-MEDEF Code as amended. Currently our departures from this Code are as follows: The limitations on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer are not contained in our Board Charter but in a decision of our Board dated July 28, 2009 (see " A. Directors and senior management  Limitations on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer set by the Board"). Because the publication and decision-making processes are the same, this departure is technical and has no practical repercussions. The Committees do not each have their own charter separate from the Board Charter. The Board Charter, which has been adopted by the Board of Directors, gives a global vision of the functioning of the Board and of its committees. Indeed, combining the rules that apply to the Board of Directors and those that apply to its committees creates a single, coherent governing document validated by the entire Board. The Board of Directors does not consider that being a Board member for more than 12 consecutive years is of itself sufficient to automatically disqualify a director from being regarded as independent. This is only one of a number of criteria that must be evaluated on a case by case basis, and not once for all. It is only after reviewing all the factors that a director can be determined as being independent or non-independent. While length of service may in certain circumstances be associated with a loss of independence, in other circumstances it may enhance the capacity of a director to question senior management and give greater independence of mind. The annual assessment of the Board of Directors and of its committees covers their functioning as collective bodies and does not evaluate each director individually. The issue of competency and individual contribution to the activities of the Board and its committees is addressed not systematically each year but when a director is up for reappointment as a board or committee member. The Chairman of the Board continually assesses the involvement of each Board member. Moreover most of the annual assessments include one-on-one interviews with the Secretary to the Board. During 2013, the Board of Directors met eight times, with an overall attendance rate among Board members of over 93%. This attendance rate includes participation by conference call, though only a limited number of Directors participated in this way. The individual attendance rates varied between 75% and 100%. 172 Table of Contents The following persons attended meetings of the Board of Directors in 2013: the Directors; the Secretary to the Board; five employee representatives who attend Board meetings without voting rights, pursuant to the agreement implemented with the European Works Council signed on February 24, 2005; and frequent attendance of: the Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer, the Executive Vice President Legal Affairs and General Counsel, the Executive Vice President Chief Strategy Officer, the Executive Vice President Global Commercial Operations and the Executive Vice President Global Divisions & Strategic Commercial Development. The agenda for each meeting of the Board is prepared by the Secretary after consultation with the Chairman, taking account of the agendas for the meetings of the specialist Committees and the suggestions of the directors. Approximately one week prior to each meeting of the Board of Directors, the Directors each receive a file containing the agenda, the minutes for the prior meeting, and documentation relating to the agenda. The minutes for each meeting are expressly approved at the next meeting of the Board of Directors. In compliance with our Board Charter, certain issues are examined in advance by the various Committees according to their areas of competence in order for them to make a recommendation; these issues are then submitted for a decision by the Board of Directors. In 2013, the main activities of the Board of Directors related to the following issues: the review of the individual company and consolidated financial statements for the 2012 financial year, the review of the individual company and consolidated financial statements for the first half of 2013 and the consolidated financial statements for the first three quarters of 2013, as well as the review of the draft press releases and presentations to analysts with respect to the publication of such financial statements; the examination of documents relating to management forecasts and the financial arrangements adopted with respect to Group subsidiaries over the 2012 financial year, the full-year forecasts for 2013 and the budget for 2014; the delegation of authority to the Chief Executive Officer to issue bonds and to issue guarantees, and the renewal of the share repurchase program; reviews of the Board of Directors' Management Report, the Chairman's Report and the reports of the statutory auditors; the recording of the amount of the share capital, the reduction in share capital through cancellation of treasury shares and the corresponding amendments to the Articles of Association; the determination of the 2012 variable compensation for the Chief Executive Officer, the determination of the 2013 fixed and variable compensation for the Chief Executive Officer, the determination of the 2013 fixed compensation of the Chairman of the Board and an update of the 2012 and 2013 fixed and variable compensation of the members of the Executive Committee. During the presentation of the report of the Compensation Committee on the compensation of corporate officers, the Board of Directors deliberated in their absence: the Board of Directors in the first place discussed the compensation of the Chairman in his absence, and then discussed the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer with the Chairman present but with the Chief Executive Officer still absent; the allocation of Directors' attendance fees for the year 2012; the principles of allocation for the year 2013 and the allocation of attendance fees for 2013 first half year, the expenses of Directors and executive officers; the adoption of equity-based compensation plans, consisting of share subscription option plans and restricted share awards, in respect of 2013 and the recording of the completion of the performance conditions of previous share-based plans; the implementation of a share capital increase reserved for employees; the composition of the Board, the proposed renewal of the mandate of Directors at the Shareholders' General Meeting in 2013, the independence of the Directors, the appointment of a new Director, the appointment of a 173 Table of Contents new member of the Audit Committee and the review of the composition of the Committees in view of the new composition of the Board; the management of the Group and succession planning; a presentation on Compliance, on the Diabetes activity, and on the Generics activity; the review of significant proposed acquisitions; Company policy on equal pay and opportunities; the notice of meeting for the General Meeting of Shareholders and of Holders of Participating Shares (Series issued in 1983, 1984 and 1987 and Series A participating shares issued in 1989), the adoption of the draft resolutions, the report of the Board of Directors on the resolutions, and the special reports on the share subscription options and on the restricted shares awarded; the amendment of the Board Charter, the evaluation of the functioning of the Board and its Committees. Board Committees Since 1999, our Board of Directors has been assisted in its deliberations and decisions by specialist committees. Chairmen and members of these committees are chosen by the Board from among its members, based on their experience. The members of these Committees are selected from among the Directors based on their experience and are appointed by the Board of Directors. The Committees are responsible for the preparation of certain items on the agenda of the Board of Directors. The decisions of the Committees are adopted by a simple majority with the chairman of the Committee having a casting vote. Minutes are established and approved by the Committee members. The chairman of each specialist Committee reports to the Board on the work of the Committee in question, so that the Board is fully informed whenever it adopts a decision. Audit Committee At December 31, 2013, this Committee was composed of: Klaus Pohle, Chairman; Robert Castaigne; Fabienne Lecorvaisier (since May 3, 2013); Christian Mulliez; Carole Piwnica; Gérard Van Kemmel. On February 25, 2013 the Appointments and Governance Committee examined the independence of its members and concluded that Fabienne Lecorvaisier was an independent Director under the AFEP-MEDEF Code. During its meeting of February 3, 2014, the Audit Committee examined the experience of Fabienne Lecorvaisier in corporate finance in various international banks and as Chief Financial Officer of Essilor and now Air Liquide. The Audit Committee concluded that Fabienne Lecorvaisier has the necessary knowledge and experience in finance and accounting, in particular with respect to IFRS standards and internal controls, to be a financial expert. Five members of the Audit Committee are classified as independent pursuant to the criteria adopted by the Board of Directors, i.e. Robert Castaigne, Fabienne Lecorvaisier, Carole Piwnica, Klaus Pohle and Gérard Van Kemmel. In addition, all of the members, including Christian Mulliez, fulfill the conditions required to be classified as independent under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. All six members of the Committee have financial or accounting expertise as a consequence of their education and professional experience. Furthermore, Robert Castaigne, Fabienne Lecorvaisier, Christian Mulliez, Klaus Pohle and Gérard Van Kemmel are deemed to be financial experts pursuant to the definition in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and 174 Table of Contents the definition in Article L. 823-19 of the French Commercial Code. See "Item 16A. Audit Committee Financial Expert". The competencies of the Audit Committee members derive both from their academic background and their professional experience as reflected in their biographies. The Audit Committee met eight times in 2013, including prior to the meetings of the Board of Directors during which the financial statements were approved. In addition to the statutory auditors, the principal financial officers, the Senior Vice President Audit and Evaluation of Internal Control and other members of senior management of the Group attended meetings of the Audit Committee. The meetings of the Audit Committee take place at least two days prior to any meetings of the Board of Directors during which the annual or interim financial statements are to be examined. The members of the Audit Committee have a good attendance record for meetings, with an overall attendance rate among members of more than 87%. Individual attendance rates varied between 40% and 100%. The statutory auditors attended all of the meetings of the Audit Committee; they presented their views as to the annual and half yearly financial statements at the Committee meetings of February 4, and July 29, 2013, respectively. In 2013, the main activities of the Audit Committee related to: the preliminary review of the individual company and consolidated financial statements for the 2012 financial year, the review of the individual company and consolidated financial statements for the first half of 2013 and of the consolidated financial statements for the first three quarters of 2013, as well as a review of the press releases and analysts presentations relating to the publication of such financial statements; the financial position of the Group, its indebtedness and liquidity; investigation and evaluation of internal control for 2012, as certified by the statutory auditors pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and an examination of the 2012 Annual Report on Form 20-F; reporting on guarantees; the review of the draft resolutions to the May 3, 2013 Shareholders' General Meeting; the principal risks facing the Company, including pharmacovigilance, the management of internal audit and computer services, update on the compliance program, impairment testing of goodwill, update on insurance, the security of computer services, update on retirement funds and actuarial assumptions, review of tax litigation, environmental litigation and other litigation (meetings of March 1, April 26, July 29, October 25, and December 16, 2013); the conclusions of Group management as to internal control procedures, the 2012 Board of Directors' Management Report and Chairman's Report, including the description of risk factors contained in the French Document de Référence; a session of the Audit Committee related specifically to the Company's business in China, held in Beijing; reporting on computer services, on the implementation of shared services in France, update on the monitoring of acquisitions (Medley, Merial), reporting on internal audit activities and computer services; the budget for audit-related services and non-audit services, and the 2013 audit plan, statutory auditors' report and fees; the expertise in financial and accounting matters of Fabienne Lecorvaisier with a view to her appointment to the Audit Committee.

The tables below give a breakdown of employees by geographic area and function for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. 177 Table of Contents Employees by geographic area As of December 31, 2013 % 2012 % 2011 % Europe 53,880 48.0% 56,265 50.2% 58,339 51.3% North America 18,795 16.8% 18,994 17.0% 20,233 17.8% Other countries 39,453 35.2% 36,715 32.8% 35,147 30.9% Total 112,128 100% 111,974 100% 113,719 100% Employees by function As of December 31, 2013 % 2012 % 2011 % Sales 33,509 29.9% 32,270 28.8% 32,874 28.9% Research and Development 16,688 14.9% 17,066 15.2% 18,823 16.6% Production 44,031 39.3% 45,035 40.2% 44,415 39.0% Marketing and Support Functions 17,900 16.0% 17,603 15.7% 17,607 15.5% Total 112,128 100% 111,974 100% 113,719 100% Industrial Relations In all countries where Sanofi operates, we strive to combine economic and social performance which we believe are inseparable. Sanofi's social responsibility is based on the basic principles of the Group's Social Charter, which outlines the rights and duties of all Group employees. The Social Charter addresses Sanofi's key commitments towards its workforce: equal opportunity for all people without discrimination, the right to health and safety, respect for privacy, the right to information and professional training, social protection for employees and their families, freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, and respect for the principles contained in the Global Compact on labor relations and ILO treaties governing the physical and emotional well-being and safety of children. The Group's social relations are based on respect and dialogue. In this spirit, the Company's management and employee representatives meet regularly to exchange views, negotiate, sign agreements and ensure that agreements are being implemented. Social dialogue takes place in different ways from one country to the next, as necessitated by specific local circumstances. Depending on the case, social dialogue relating to information, consultation and negotiation processes may take place at the national, regional or company level. It may be organized on an interprofessional or sectorial basis, or both. Social dialogue may be informal or it may be implemented through a specific formal body, or a combination of both methods. Whatever the situation, Sanofi encourages employees to voice their opinions, help create a stimulating work environment and take part in decisions aiming to improve the way we work. These efforts reflect one of the principles of the Social Charter whereby the improvement of working conditions and the Group's necessary adaptation to its environment go hand-in-hand. Profit-sharing Schemes, Employee Savings Schemes and Employee Share Ownership Profit-sharing Schemes All employees of our French companies belong to voluntary and statutory profit-sharing schemes. 178 Table of Contents Voluntary Scheme (Intéressement des salariés) These are collective schemes that are optional for the employer and contingent upon performance. The aim is to give employees an interest in the growth of the business and improvements in its performance. The amount distributed by our French companies during 2013 in respect of voluntary profit-sharing for the year ended December 31, 2012 represented 4.63% of total payroll. In June 2011, Sanofi entered into a three-year Group-wide agreement, effective from the 2011 financial year, and applicable to all French companies more than 50% owned by Sanofi. Under the agreement, payments under the Group voluntary profit-sharing scheme are contingent on the more favorable of two criteria: year-on-year growth in the net sales of our growth platforms (at constant exchange rates and on a constant structure basis) and the level of business net income. For each criterion, a matrix is used to determine the percentage of total payroll to be distributed. Statutory Scheme (Participation des salariés aux résultats de l'entreprise) The scheme is a French legal obligation for companies with more than 50 employees that made a profit in the previous financial year. The amount distributed by our French companies during 2013 in respect of the statutory scheme for the year ended December 31, 2012 represented 5.55% of total payroll. In November 2007, Sanofi entered into a new Group-wide agreement for an indefinite period, covering all the employees of our French companies. An amendment to this agreement was signed in April 2009, primarily to align the agreement on a change in French legislation (Law 2008-1258 of December 3, 2008) in order to protect against erosion in purchasing power, under which each qualifying employee can elect to receive some or all of his or her profit-sharing bonus without regard to the normally applicable mandatory lock-up period. Distribution Formula In order to favor lower-paid employees, the voluntary and statutory profit-sharing agreements entered into since 2005 split the benefit between those entitled as follows: 60% on the basis of presence during the year; and 40% on the basis of annual salary, up to a limit of three times the Social Security ceiling. Employee Savings Schemes and Collective Retirement Savings Plan The employee savings arrangements operated by Sanofi are based on a Group savings scheme (Plan Epargne Groupe) and a collective retirement savings plan (Plan Epargne pour la Retraite Collectif). These schemes reinvest the sums derived from the statutory and voluntary profit-sharing schemes (compulsory investments), and voluntary contributions by employees. In June 2013, more than 85% of the employees who benefited from the profit-sharing schemes had opted to invest in the collective retirement savings plan. In 2013, €121 million and €58.8 million were invested in the Group savings scheme and the collective retirement savings plan respectively through the voluntary and statutory schemes for 2012, and through top-up contributions. Employee Share Ownership At December 31, 2013, shares held by employees of Sanofi and of related companies and by former employees under Group employee savings schemes amounted to 1.30% of the share capital. During its meeting on October 29, 2013, the Board of Directors decided to use the delegation of powers granted by the Shareholders' General Meeting held on May 3, 2013, and to implement a share capital increase reserved for members of the Group savings plan. The subscription period took place in November 2013. The plan was open to employees of more than 80 countries. Overall, 1,672,198 shares were subscribed, including 839,892 by the Group Employee Savings Plan for employees of French subsidiaries ("FCPE Actions Sanofi") and 293,639 by the Group 179 Table of Contents Employee Savings Plan for employees of non-French subsidiaries ("FCPE Sanofi Shares"). The remainder of the shares are held in local banks for local regulatory purposes. 14,770 employees participated in this share capital increase reserved for employees. E. Share Ownership Senior Management Members of the Executive Committee hold shares of our Company amounting in the aggregate to less than 1% of our share capital. At December 31, 2013, a total of 3,400,000 options had been granted to the members of the Executive Committee (plans existing or closed in 2012) and 3,015,000 unexercised options to subscribe for or to purchase Sanofi shares were held by the members of the Executive Committee. In 2013, 313,000 options were exercised by members of the Executive Committee. These exercises related to one option plan that pre-dates the creation of the Executive Committee (sanofi-aventis subscription option plan of December 10, 2003 with an exercise price of €55.74), and two others that post-date the creation of the Executive Committee (sanofi-aventis subscription option plan of December 13, 2007 with an exercise price of €62.33 and sanofi-aventis subscription option plan of March 9, 2009 with an exercise price of €45.09). At December 31, 2013, a total of 408,500 performance shares had been awarded to the members of the Executive Committee (plans existing or closed in 2013) and 258,500 unvested performance shares were held by the members of the Executive Committee. These figures include the options granted to Christopher Viehbacher, who is a member of the Executive Committee. The terms of these options and performance shares are summarized in the tables below. Existing Option Plans as of December 31, 2013 As of December 31, 2013, a total of 35,708,847 options were outstanding, including 223,181 options to purchase Sanofi shares and 35,485,666 options to subscribe for Sanofi shares. Out of this total, 25,813,742 were immediately exercisable, including 223,181 options to purchase shares and 25,590,561 options to subscribe for shares. Equity-based compensation, consisting of share subscription option plans and performance share plans, aims to align the employees' objectives on those of the shareholders and to reinforce the link between employees and the Group. Under French law, this falls within the powers of the Board of Directors. Stock options (which may be options to subscribe for shares or options to purchase shares) are granted to employees and the Chief Executive Officer by the Board of Directors on the basis of recommendations from the Compensation Committee. Granting options is a way of recognizing the beneficiary's contribution to the Group's development, and also of securing his or her future commitment to the Group. For each plan, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors assess whether it should take the form of options to subscribe for shares or options to purchase shares, based on criteria that are primarily financial. A list of beneficiaries is proposed by the Senior Management to the Compensation Committee, which reviews the list and then submits it to the Board of Directors, which decides to grant the options. The Board of Directors also sets the terms for the exercise of the options (including the exercise price) and the lock-up period. The exercise price never incorporates a discount, and must be at least equal to the average of the quoted market prices on the 20 trading days preceding the date of grant by the Board. Stock option plans generally specify a vesting period of four years and a total duration of ten years. In 2011, the Board of Directors made significant changes to its equity-based compensation policy. In order to limit the dilutive effect on shareholders, the Board of Directors determined to primarily award performance shares, except for a limited group of senior managers who may continue to receive options. Furthermore, whoever the beneficiary is, any award of options or performance shares will henceforth be fully contingent upon the performance targets being met over three financial years. 180 Table of Contents On March 5, 2013, 548,725 share subscription options were awarded to 57 beneficiaries (excluding 240,000 options awarded to Christopher Viehbacher). Each option entitles the grantee to subscribe for one share, in the aggregate representing 0.06% of our share capital before dilution. The entire award was contingent upon two of the same internal criteria as the award of Christopher Viehbacher (i.e. those based on Business Net Income and Return on Assets), but not on the TSR-based criterion. Consequently, the weighting of each criterion is different, each representing 50% of the grant. The quantitative measures of performance are the same as for the award of Christopher Viehbacher. The percentage of options awarded to Christopher Viehbacher in 2013 represents 1.81% of the total limit approved by the Shareholders' General Meeting held on May 6, 2011 (1% of our share capital) and 30.43% of the total award to all beneficiaries on March 5, 2013. Not all employees are able to benefit from awards of performance shares, but a new agreement on the voluntary scheme (intéressement des salariés) was concluded in June 2011 to ensure that all employees have an interest in the performance of the business. In addition, pursuant to the French Law of July 28, 2011, all employees in France of the French subsidiaries of the Group benefited from a profit-sharing bonus amounting to €420 gross in July 2013. In total, Sanofi paid out €13.7 million in this regard (including social contributions). On March 5, 2014, the Board of Directors awarded 769,250 share subscription options to 59 beneficiaries (excluding 240,000 options awarded to Christopher Viehbacher). Each option entitles the grantee to subscribe for one share, in the aggregate representing 0.06% of our share capital before dilution. The entire award was contingent upon two of the same internal criteria as the award of Christopher Viehbacher (i.e. those based on Business Net Income and Return on Assets), but not on the TSR-based criterion. Consequently, the weighting of each criterion is different, each representing 50% of the grant. As part of its commitment to transparency, Sanofi has undertaken to publish in its annual report the level of attainment determined by the Board of Directors for the performance conditions applicable to future equity-based compensation plans awarded to Christopher Viehbacher and the other members of the Executive Committee. The Board considers that disclosing the level of attainment allows our shareholders to better understand the demanding nature of the performance conditions. For disclosures about the level of attainment of the various equity-based compensation plans, see " B. Compensation  Compensation and pension arrangements for corporate officers  Christopher Viehbacher", bearing in mind that the TSR-based criterion only applies to the Chief Executive Officer and that the criteria based on Business Net Income and the ROA each apply to 50% of the grant.

The main characteristics of our stock options are also described in Note D.15.8 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 18 of this annual report. Existing Restricted Share Plans as of December 31, 2013 Since 2009, the Board of Directors has awarded restricted shares to certain employees in order to give them a direct stake in the Company's future and performances via trends in the share price, as a partial substitute for the granting of stock options. Restricted shares are awarded to employees on the basis of a list submitted to the Compensation Committee. This Committee then submits this list to the Board of Directors, which decides to award the shares. The Board of Directors sets the vesting conditions for the award, and any lock-up conditions for the shares. In 2011, the Board of Directors made significant changes to its equity-based compensation policy. In order to limit the dilutive effect on shareholders, the Board of Directors determined to primarily award performance shares, except for a limited group of senior managers who may continue to receive options. Furthermore, whoever the beneficiary is, any award of options or performance shares is henceforth fully contingent upon the performance targets being attained over three financial years. On March 5, 2013, the Board of Directors set up two plans in addition to the award made to the Chief Executive Officer: a French plan awarding 1,411,910 performance shares to 2,542 beneficiaries, subject to a vesting period of three years followed by a lock-up period of two years; and an international plan awarding 2,838,795 restricted shares to 5,119 beneficiaries, subject to a vesting period of four years. The entire award was contingent upon two of the same internal criteria as the award of Christopher Viehbacher (i.e. those based on Business Net Income and Return on Assets), but not on the TSR-based criterion. Consequently, the weighting of each criterion is different, each representing 50% of the grant. The quantitative measures of performance are the same as for the award of Christopher Viehbacher. The 2013 awards represent a dilution of 0.32% of our share capital before dilution as of December 31, 2013. Not all employees are able to benefit from awards of performance shares, but a new agreement on the voluntary scheme (intéressement des salariés) was concluded in June 2011 to ensure that all employees have an interest in the performance of the business. 182 Table of Contents In addition, pursuant to the French Act of July 28, 2011, all employees in France of the French subsidiaries of the Group benefited from a profit-sharing bonus amounting to €420 gross in July 2013. In total, Sanofi paid out €13.7 million in this regard (including social contributions). On March 5, 2014, the Board of Directors set up two plans: a French plan awarding 1,257,620 performance shares to 2,546 beneficiaries, subject to a vesting period of three years followed by a lock-up period of two years; and an international plan awarding 2,605,515 restricted shares to 5,204 beneficiaries, subject to a vesting period of four years with no lock-up period. The entire award was subject to two of the same internal criteria as the award of Christopher Viehbacher (i.e. those based on Business Net Income and Return on Assets) as Christopher Viehbacher, but not on the TSR-based criterion. Consequently, the weighting of each criterion is different, each representing 50% of the grant. As part of its commitment to transparency, Sanofi has undertaken to publish in its annual report the level of attainment determined by the Board of Directors for the performance conditions applicable to future equity-based compensation plans awarded to Christopher Viehbacher and the other members of the Executive Committee.

Our statuts (Articles of Association) provide for double voting rights for shares held in registered form for at least two years. All of our shareholders may benefit from double voting rights if these conditions are met, and no shareholder benefits from specific voting rights. For more information relating to our shares, see "Item 10. Additional Information  B. Memorandum and Articles of Association." L'Oréal is the only entity known to hold more than 5% of the outstanding Sanofi ordinary shares. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we did not receive any share ownership declaration informing us that any legal threshold had been passed. In accordance with our Articles of Association, shareholders are required to notify us once they have passed the threshold of 1% of our share capital or our voting rights and each time they cross an incremental 1% threshold (see "Item 10. Additional Information  B. Memorandum and Articles of Association  Requirements for Holdings Exceeding Certain Percentages"). For the year ended December 31, 2013, we were informed that the following share ownership declaration thresholds had been passed: Amundi Asset Management declared that, through its mutual funds, it has passed above (declaration of July 1, 2013) and then below (declaration of December 3, 2013) the threshold of 3% of our voting rights and as of its last declaration held 2.99% of our voting rights; L'Oréal declared that, due to a change in the number of our voting rights, it had passively and successively passed below (declaration of June 25, 2013) and above (declaration of September 3, 2013) the threshold of 16% of our voting rights and as of its last declaration held 16.03% of our voting rights; Natixis Asset Management declared that it had passed below the threshold of 2% of our voting rights and as of its last declaration held 1.99% of our voting rights (declaration of December 18, 2013); UBS declared that it had successively passed above (declaration of May 7, 2013) and below (declaration of May 21, 2013) the threshold of 1% of our share capital and of our voting rights and as of its last declaration held 0.90% of our share capital and 0.81% of our voting rights. 185 Table of Contents Since January 1, 2014 we have been informed that the following share ownership declaration thresholds mentioned in our Articles of Association had been passed: Natixis Asset Management declared that it had passed above the threshold of 2% of our voting rights and as of its last declaration held 2.05% of our voting rights (declaration of January 9, 2014); State Street, acting on behalf of several funds and portfolios managed by its group, declared that it had passed above the threshold of 1% and 2% of our capital and 1% of our voting rights and as of its last declaration held 2.28% of our share capital and 1.38% of our voting rights (declaration of January 8, 2014). Individual shareholders (including employees of Sanofi and its subsidiaries, as well as retired employees holding shares via the Sanofi Group Employee Savings Plan) hold approximately 7.5% of our share capital. Institutional shareholders (excluding L'Oréal) hold approximately 77.2% of our share capital. Such shareholders are primarily American (26.8%), French (15.1%) and British (13.8%). German institutions hold 3.1% of our share capital, Swiss institutions hold 2.5%, institutions from other European countries hold 8.3% and Canadian institutions hold 1.7% of our share capital. Other international institutional investors (excluding those from Europe and the United States) hold approximately 5.9% of our share capital. In France, our home country, we have 16,393 identified shareholders of record. In the United States, our host country, we have 52 identified shareholders of record and 10,683 identified ADS holders of record.

Related Party Transactions In the ordinary course of business, we purchase or provide materials, supplies and services from or to numerous companies throughout the world. Members of our Board of Directors are affiliated with some of these companies. We conduct our transactions with such companies on an arm's-length basis and do not consider the amounts involved in such transactions to be material. In addition, cash management intra-group financing agreements exist between Sanofi and certain of its subsidiaries. Those and other intragroup transactions are neither unusual nor atypical but fall under the ordinary business of the companies of the Group. Such transactions are conducted on an arm's-length basis. Some examples of such transactions are listed below. On February 21, 2012, Sanofi European Treasury Center (SETC), a 100% subsidiary of the Sanofi Group, was incorporated under the laws of Belgium, with the purpose of providing financing and payment services to other Group subsidiaries. On June 28, 2012, the Group's parent company transferred the Genzyme Corporation shares acquired in April 2011 to Aventis, Inc.. This transfer consisted of two principal operations: recapitalization by the Group's parent company of its subsidiary Genzyme Corporation by incorporation of two loans totaling $16.1 billion into share capital; and sale of Genzyme Corporation to a wholly owned subsidiary, Aventis, Inc., for a total price of $19.2 billion. Aventis, Inc. financed this acquisition mainly by using its available cash resources, by increasing its share capital and by long-term intragroup financing ($15.6 billion). On March 28, 2013, Sanofi capitalized the loan to Sanofi-Aventis Amérique du Nord for an amount of €4.1 billion. C. Interests of Experts and Counsel N/A Item 8. Financial Information A. Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information Our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 are included in this annual report at "Item 18. Financial Statements." 186 Table of Contents Dividends on Ordinary Shares We paid annual dividends for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 and our shareholders will be asked to approve the payment of an annual dividend of €2.80 per share for the 2013 fiscal year at our next annual shareholders' meeting. If approved, this dividend will be paid on May 15, 2014. We expect that we will continue to pay regular dividends based on our financial condition and results of operations. The proposed 2013 dividend equates to a distribution of 55% of our business earnings per share. For information on the non-GAAP financial measure, "business earnings per share", see "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects  Business Net Income." The proposed dividend distribution will subject Sanofi to a 3% additional corporate tax charge on the amount distributed. The following table sets forth information with respect to the dividends paid by our Company in respect of the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 fiscal years and the dividend that will be proposed for approval by our shareholders in respect of the 2013 fiscal year at our May 5, 2014 shareholders' meeting. 2013(1) 2012 2011 2010 2009 Net Dividend per Share (in €) 2.80 2.77 2.65 2.50 2.40 Net Dividend per Share (in $)(2) 3.86 3.65 3.43 3.34 3.46 (1) Proposal, subject to shareholder approval. (2) Based on the relevant year-end exchange rate. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends will be determined by majority vote of the holders of our shares at an ordinary general meeting, following the recommendation of our Board of Directors. Any declaration will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our shareholders. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will pay dividends in the future on a continuous and regular basis. Under French law, we are required to pay dividends approved by an ordinary general meeting of shareholders within nine months following the meeting at which they are approved. Disclosure pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction & Syria Human Rights Act (ITRA) Sanofi conducts limited business relating to human and animal health products with Iran contributing well under 1% of the Group's consolidated net sales in 2013. Although these activities are compliant with applicable law and not financially material to the Group, the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (the "Act") requires us to include the following disclosures in this report. Sales consisted of bulk and branded pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and animal health supplies. U.S. affiliates, or foreign affiliates controlled by U.S. affiliates, are either not involved in these activities or operate under humanitarian licenses issued by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, and the Group has not knowingly conducted a transaction or dealing with a person or entity designated in U.S. Executive Orders No. 13224 and 13382. Limited business amounting to approximately €7 million in gross revenues has been conducted by foreign subsidiaries not requiring an OFAC license with entities such as public hospitals or distributors tied to the Ministry of Health or Ministry of Agriculture. It is estimated that this activity contributed no more than €2.6 million to net profits. A representative office in Tehran incurs incidental expenses from state-owned utilities. Otherwise, no business has been transacted with the Government of Iran as defined in the Act. The Group does not believe any of its activities to be sanctionable under the Iran Sanctions Act or the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010. In light of the nature of the products concerned, Sanofi does not currently intend to cease its commercial operations in Iran. Information on Legal or Arbitration Proceedings This Item 8 incorporates by reference the disclosures found at Note D.22 to the consolidated financial statements found at Item 18 of this annual report; material updates thereto as of the date of this annual report are found below under the heading " Updates to Note D.22". Sanofi and its affiliates are involved in litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings. These proceedings typically are related to product liability claims, intellectual property rights (particularly claims against generic companies seeking to limit the patent protection of Sanofi products), competition law and trade practices, commercial claims, employment and wrongful discharge claims, tax assessment claims, waste disposal and pollution claims, and claims under warranties or indemnification arrangements relating to business divestitures. As a result, the Group may become subject to substantial liabilities that may not be covered by insurance and could affect our business and 187 Table of Contents reputation. While we do not currently believe that any of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, litigation is inherently unpredictable. As a consequence, we may in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on results of operations, cash flows and/or our reputation. Patents Plavix® Patent Litigation (Canada) On April 22, 2009, Apotex filed an impeachment action against Sanofi in the Federal Court of Canada alleging the invalidity of Sanofi's Canadian Patent No. 1,336,777 (the '777 Patent) claiming clopidogrel bisulfate. On June 8, 2009, Sanofi filed its defense to the impeachment action and filed a suit against Apotex for infringement of the '777 Patent. The actions were combined and the trial was completed in June 2011. In December 2011, the Federal Court issued a decision that the '777 Patent is invalid, and subsequently generic companies entered the market with generic clopidogrel products. Sanofi filed an appeal with the Federal Court of Appeal in January, 2012. On 24 July, 2013, the Federal Court of Appeal issued its decision reversing the Federal Court's decision and upholding the validity of the '777 Patent and returned the case to the lower Court for a determination of damages owed by Apotex to Sanofi for marketing clopidogrel prior to the proper expiration of the '777 patent. In October 2013, Apotex appealed this decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. On December 5, 2013, new infringement actions were initiated in the Federal Court of Canada (a) against Apotex, seeking recovery of damages arising from exports that Apotex made from Canada to a number of other countries, and (b) against nine other generic companies seeking recovery of damages arising from their sales of generic clopidogrel within Canada. In January 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada granted leave to hear Apotex's appeal. Apotex Settlement Claim On November 13, 2008, Apotex filed a complaint before a state court in New Jersey against Sanofi and Bristol-Myers Squibb claiming the payment of a U.S.$60 million break-up fee, pursuant to the terms of the initial settlement agreement of March 2006 relating to the U.S. Plavix® patent litigation. On April 8, 2011, the New Jersey State Court granted Sanofi and Bristol-Myers Squibb a motion for summary judgment that was reversed in November 2012. On July 12, 2013, Sanofi, BMS and Apotex executed an arbitration agreement moving the case to an arbitration setting. The arbitration procedure is on-going. In January 2011, Apotex filed a lawsuit in Florida State Court, Broward County, alleging breach of contract relating to the parties' March 2006 proposed settlement agreement. Sanofi was granted a motion for summary judgment in 2012, removing Sanofi from the case. BMS's summary judgment motion was denied. In December 2012, Apotex appealed the summary judgment as to Sanofi. In March 2013, the court ruled in favor of BMS. In July 2013, as part of the agreement to move the New Jersey action to arbitration, Apotex discontinued the appeal of the summary judgment ruling of 2012 in favor of Sanofi. Allegra® Patent Litigation (Japan) In August 2012, Elmed Eisai Co., Ltd. ("Eisai"), Kobayashi Kako Co., Ltd. ("Kobayashi"), and Taisho Pharm. Ind., Ltd. ("Taisho") obtained approvals to manufacture and market generic fexofenadine hydrochloride products in Japan, despite the existence and validity of the two fexofenadine hydrochloride patents. In August and September 2012, patent invalidation actions against those two patents were filed at the Japan Patent Office ("JPO") by Eisai, Daiko Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Kyorin Rimedio Co. Ltd., Nihon Generic Co., Ltd., Nihon Pharmaceutical Industry Co. Ltd., Nippon Chemiphar Co., Ltd., Nissin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Shiono Chemical Co. Ltd., Teva Pharma Japan Inc., and Yoshindo Inc. On October 22, 2013, JPO issued a pre-decision notice finding the patents invalid. In October 2012, Sanofi filed patent infringement lawsuits against Eisai, Taisho and Kobayashi. In December 2012, the previously approved generic fexofenadine hydrochloride products of Eisai and Kobayashi were added to Japan's National Health Insurance (NHI) price list. Since February 2013, Allegra® as a prescription medicine has been subject to generic competition in this country. 188 Table of Contents Synvisc-One® Patent Litigation In April 2011, Genzyme filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against generic manufacturers Seikagaku Corporation (Seikagaku), Zimmer Holdings, Inc., Zimmer, Inc. and Zimmer U.S., Inc. (collectively, "Zimmer") for the infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,399,351 (the '351 patent) and U.S. Patent No. 7,931,030 (the '030 patent), upon Seikagaku's and Zimmer's launch of generic versions of Synvisc-One® in the United States. On December 30, 2011, the U.S. District Court granted, in part, Genzyme's Motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining Seikagaku and Zimmer from selling generic versions of Synvisc-One®, pending a decision in the infringement action, except on limited and specific pricing conditions. In August 2012, a federal jury in Massachusetts found that Seikagaku Corp's recently approved product Gel-One®, distributed in the U.S. by Zimmer, did not infringe the '030 patent. The jury also found that the '030 patent claims were invalid due to obviousness. Following the denial of the motion for judgment as a matter of law and a motion for new trial filed in September 2012, Genzyme filed an appeal before the Federal Circuit. On January 7, 2014, Genzyme settled this litigation with Seikagaku, under the terms of the settlement: Seikagaku agrees to drop its Motion for damages; and Genzyme agrees to drop its appeal to the Federal Circuit from the district court order entering judgment against Genzyme in favor Seikagaku on August 7, 2012. Co-Aprovel® Patent Infringement Actions in Europe Sanofi has been involved since early 2012 in a number of legal proceedings involving generic companies that attempted to launch or launched generic versions of Sanofi's Co-Aprovel® in several European countries including, United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy and Norway. Sanofi filed for and was granted preliminary injunctions (PI) against several generic companies based on Sanofi's Supplemental Protection Certificate (SPC) covering Co-Aprovel® until October 15, 2013. Sanofi followed its PI actions with main infringement suits against some of the generic companies. A few of the generic companies have filed revocation actions seeking to revoke Sanofi's Co-Aprovel® SPC. Some of these revocation actions were denied (Italy), others have been suspended (United Kingdom, Belgium). In France, the Tribunal de Grande Instance of Paris held the SPC and the patent invalid at the end of February 2013. On December 12, 2013, further to questions raised on the SPC regulation interpretation, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) invalidated Sanofi's SPC. The decision cannot be appealed further. All countries in which litigations were ongoing will have to incorporate the CJEU's decision in their national cases. Based on the CJEU decision, the generic companies that were affected by a preliminary injunction under the now invalidated SPC may file suit for damages. Lantus® and Lantus Solostar® Patent Litigation In mid-December 2013, Sanofi received notifications from Eli Lilly and Company ("Lilly"), stating that it had filed a NDA (505(b)(2) New Drug Application) with the FDA for an insulin glargine drug product. Lilly also stated that its NDA included a paragraph IV certification challenging six of the seven Sanofi patents listed in the FDA Orange Book for Sanofi's Lantus® and Lantus® SoloStar® products. On January 30, 2014, Sanofi filed a patent infringement suit against Lilly in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, where Sanofi alleges infringement of four patents. This suit resulted in a stay during which the FDA cannot approve Eli Lilly's NDA. The stay is expected to expire the earlier of (i) a court decision favorable to Lilly or (ii) June 2016. Multaq® Patent Litigation In January 2014, Sanofi received notices from Watson and Glenmark, respectively, that they had filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) seeking FDA approval to market generic versions of Multaq® (dronedarone hydrochloride) in the U.S. The notices challenged some of the patents listed by Sanofi in the FDA's Orange Book in connection with Multaq®. Neither Watson nor Glenmark challenge the patent directed to the active ingredient in Multaq®, US Patent No. 5,223,510 (the '510 patent). In February 2014 Sanofi brought suit against Watson, Actavis (Watson's parent company) and Glenmark individually in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware for infringement of three patents: U.S. Patent Nos. 8,318,800; 8,410,167; and 8,602,215. 189 Table of Contents Government Investigations From time to time, subsidiaries of Sanofi are subject to governmental investigations and information requests from regulatory authorities inquiring as to the practices of Sanofi with respect to the sales, marketing, and promotion of its products. For example, Sanofi is cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice in its respective investigations into the promotion of Seprafilm® and Sculptra®. In December 2013, Genzyme entered into a settlement agreement to resolve civil claims arising out of the investigation into promotional practices of Seprafilm® and paid in that respect approximately U.S.$23 million. Discussions with the U.S. Government are ongoing to resolve the matter completely, including any potential criminal resolution. As part of this settlement, and as part of the settlement entered into by Sanofi U.S. in December 2012 relating to civil claims arising out of an investigation into sampling of its former product Hyalgan® for which Sanofi U.S. paid U.S.$109 million the companies expect to enter into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Office of the Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. In June 2012, Sanofi U.S. became aware that the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating disclosures to the FDA regarding the variability of response to Plavix®. Sanofi U.S. is cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice in this matter. In France, in the claim concerning allegations brought by Teva Santé that Sanofi's communication and promotional practices inhibited the entry on the market of generics of clopidogrel (the active ingredient of Plavix®), the French Antitrust Authority issued its decision on May 14, 2013, imposing on Sanofi a fine of €40.6 million. Sanofi appealed that decision before the Paris Court of Appeals in July 2013. In Germany, a criminal investigation was initiated against three current and two retired Sanofi employees in connection with the alleged sale in Germany of medications originally destined for humanitarian aid outside of the European Union. Two employees were convicted for commercial bribery and a fine was set against the Sanofi affiliate amounting to €28 million. Sanofi is engaged in discussions with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding allegations that certain subsidiaries outside the United States made improper payments in connection with the sale of pharmaceutical products and whether those payments, if made, fall within the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Company has voluntarily provided and will continue to provide information to the DOJ and SEC, and will cooperate with the agencies' reviews of these matters. Glossary of Terminology A number of technical terms which may be used above in Item 8 are defined below for the convenience of the reader. Summary judgment: A judgment granted on a claim or defense about which there is no genuine issue of material fact and upon which the movant is entitled to prevail as a matter of law. This procedural device allows the speedy disposition of a controversy without the need for trial. Updates to Note D.22 N/A B. Significant Changes On January 11, 2014, Regeneron, Sanofi and some of its subsidiaries (collectively "Sanofi") agreed to amend and restate the original investor agreement, dated as of December 20, 2007, as amended in its entirety and entered into the Amended and Restated Investor Agreement (the "Amended Investor Agreement"). The Amended Investor Agreement was amended to, among other things, provide Sanofi with the right to nominate a single independent director to the Regeneron's Board of Directors upon reaching 20% ownership of the Company's then outstanding shares of Class A Stock, par value $0.001 per share and Common Stock and to extend the term of the lock-up obligations. The Amended Investor Agreement also provides Sanofi with the right to receive certain information as may be reasonably agreed upon by the parties that will facilitate Sanofi's ability to account for their investment in the Company using the equity method of accounting under International Financial Reporting Standards. Subsequently, Sanofi has determined to purchase, directly or through its subsidiaries, additional shares of Common Stock to increase its beneficial ownership to approximately 20.5% of the Common Stock outstanding. Sanofi made no commitment in terms of the timing of such transactions, which will depend on market conditions including the price and availability of shares of Common Stock, and on such other factors considered relevant to Sanofi. 190 Table of Contents Item 9.

Trading by Sanofi in our own Shares Under French law, a company may not issue shares to itself, but it may purchase its own shares in the limited cases described at "Item 10. Additional Information  B. Memorandum and Articles of Association  Trading in Our Own Shares." D. Selling Shareholders N/A E. Dilution N/A F. Expenses of the Issue N/A Item 10. Additional Information A. Share Capital N/A B. Memorandum and Articles of Association General Our Company is a société anonyme, a form of limited liability company, organized under the laws of France. In this section, we summarize material information concerning our share capital, together with material provisions of applicable French law and our Articles of Association (statuts), an English translation of which has been filed as an exhibit to this annual report. For a description of certain provisions of our Articles of Association relating to our Board of Directors and statutory auditors, see "Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees." You may obtain copies of our Articles of Association in French from the greffe (Clerk) of the Registre du Commerce et des Sociétés de Paris (Registry of Commerce and Companies of Paris, France, registration number: 395 030 844). Please refer to that full document for additional details. 192 Table of Contents Our Articles of Association specify that our corporate affairs are governed by: applicable laws and regulations (in particular, Title II of the French Commercial Code); and the Articles of Association themselves. Article 3 of our Articles of Association specifies that the Company's corporate purpose, in France and abroad, is: acquiring interests and holdings, in any form whatsoever, in any company or enterprise, in existence or to be created, connected directly or indirectly with the health and fine chemistry sectors, human and animal therapeutics, nutrition and bio-industry; in the following areas: purchase and sale of all raw materials and products necessary for these activities; research, study and development of new products, techniques and processes; manufacture and sale of all chemical, biological, dietary and hygiene products; obtaining or acquiring all intellectual property rights related to results obtained and, in particular, filing all patents, trademarks and models, processes or inventions; operating directly or indirectly, purchasing, and transferring  for free or for consideration  pledging or securing all intellectual property rights, particularly all patents, trademarks and models, processes or inventions; obtaining, operating, holding and granting all licenses; within the framework of a group-wide policy and subject to compliance with the relevant legislation, participating in treasury management transactions, whether as lead company or otherwise, in the form of centralized currency risk management or intra-group netting, or any other form permitted under the relevant laws and regulations; and, more generally: all commercial, industrial, real or personal property, financial or other transactions, connected directly or indirectly, totally or partially, with the activities described above and with all similar or related activities or having any other purposes likely to encourage or develop the Company's activities. Directors Transactions in Which Directors Are Materially Interested Under French law, any agreement entered into (directly or through an intermediary) between our Company and any one of the members of the Board of Directors that is not entered into (i) in the ordinary course of our business and (ii) under normal conditions is subject to the prior authorization of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors. The same provision applies to agreements between our Company and another company if one of the members of the Board of Directors is the owner, general partner, manager, director, general manager or member of the executive or supervisory board of the other company, as well as to agreements in which one of the members of the Board of Directors has an indirect interest. The Board of Directors must also authorize any undertaking taken by our Company for the benefit of our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer (directeur général) or his delegates (directeurs généraux délégués) pursuant to which such persons will or may be granted compensation, benefit or any other advantage as a result of the termination of or a change in their offices or following such termination or change. In addition, except with respect to any non-compete indemnity or certain pension benefits, any such termination package: (i) must be authorized by our shareholders through the adoption of a separate general shareholders meeting resolution for each such beneficiary, which authorization must be renewed at each renewal of such beneficiary's mandate, and (ii) cannot be paid to such beneficiary unless (a) the Board of Directors decides that such beneficiary has satisfied certain conditions, linked to such beneficiary's performance measured by our Company's performance, that must have been defined by the Board of Directors when granting such package, and (b) such decision is publicly disclosed. 193 Table of Contents Directors' Compensation The aggregate amount of attendance fees (jetons de présence) of the Board of Directors is determined at the Shareholders' Ordinary General Meeting. The Board of Directors then divides this aggregate amount among its members by a simple majority vote. In addition, the Board of Directors may grant exceptional compensation (rémunérations exceptionnelles) to individual directors on a case-by-case basis for special assignments following the procedures described above at " Transactions in Which Directors Are Materially Interested." The Board of Directors may also authorize the reimbursement of travel and accommodation expenses, as well as other expenses incurred by Directors in the corporate interest. See also "Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees." Board of Directors' Borrowing Powers All loans or borrowings on behalf of the Company may be decided by the Board of Directors within the limits, if any, imposed by the Shareholders' General Meeting. There are currently no limits imposed on the amounts of loans or borrowings that the Board of Directors may approve. Directors' Age Limits For a description of the provisions of our Articles of Association relating to age limits applicable to our Directors, see "Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees." Directors' Share Ownership Requirements Pursuant to the Board Charter, our Directors are required to hold at least 1,000 shares during the term of their appointment. Share Capital As of December 31, 2013, our share capital amounted to €2,648,641,762, divided into 1,324,320,881 outstanding shares with a par value of €2 per share. All of our outstanding shares are of the same class and are fully paid. Of these shares, we or entities controlled by us held 3,601,099 shares (or 0.27% of our outstanding share capital), as treasury shares as of such date. As of December 31, 2013, the carrying amount of such shares was €244 million. At an extraordinary general meeting held on May 3, 2013, our shareholders authorized our Board of Directors to increase our share capital, through the issuance of shares or other securities giving access to the share capital with or without preemptive rights, by an aggregate maximum nominal amount of €1.3 billion. See " Changes in Share Capital  Increases in Share Capital," below. The maximum total number of authorized but unissued shares as of December 31, 2013 was 298 million, reflecting the unused part of the May 4, 2012 and May 3, 2013 shareholder authorizations to issue shares without preemptive rights, outstanding options to subscribe for shares, and awards of shares. Stock Options Types of Stock Options We have two types of stock options outstanding: options to subscribe for shares (options de souscription d'actions) and options to purchase shares (options d'achat d'actions). Upon exercise of an option to subscribe for shares, we issue new shares, whereas upon exercise of an option to purchase shares, the option holder receives existing shares. We purchase our shares on the market prior to the vesting of the options to purchase in order to provide the option holder with shares upon exercise. Because the exercise of options to purchase shares will be satisfied with existing shares repurchased on the market or held in treasury, the exercise of options to purchase shares has no impact on the amount of our share capital. Stock Option Plans Our combined general meeting held on May 3, 2013 authorized our Board of Directors for a period of 38 months to grant, on one or more occasions, options to subscribe for shares and options to purchase shares in favor of 194 Table of Contents persons to be chosen by the Board of Directors from among the salaried employees and corporate officers of our Company or of companies or groupings of economic interest of the Group in accordance with Article L. 225-180 of the French Commercial Code. The aggregate number of options to subscribe for shares and options to purchase shares that may be granted under this authorization may not give entitlement to a total number of shares exceeding 0.7% of the share capital as of the date of the decision by the Board of Directors to grant such options. The Board of Directors sets the exercise price of options to subscribe for shares and options to purchase shares. However, the exercise price never incorporates a discount and must be at least equal to the average of the quoted market prices on the 20 trading sessions preceding the date of grant by the Board of Directors. Stock option plans generally provide for a lock-up period of four years and have a duration of ten years. Under such authorization the shareholders expressly waive, in favor of the grantees of options to subscribe for shares, their preemptive rights in respect of shares that are to be issued as and when options are exercised. The Board of Directors is granted full power to implement this authorization and to set the terms and conditions on which options are granted and the arrangements with respect to the dividend entitlement of the shares. See "Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees  E. Share Ownership" for a description of our option plans currently in force. Awards of Shares Our combined general meeting held on May 4, 2012 authorized our Board of Directors for a period of 38 months to allot, on one or more occasions, existing or new restricted shares in favor of persons to be chosen by the Board of Directors from among the salaried employees and corporate officers of our Company or of companies or economic interest groupings of the Group in accordance with Articles L. 225-197-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code. The existing or new shares allotted under this authorization may not represent more than 1.2% of the share capital as of the date of the decision by the Board of Directors to allot such shares. The authorization provides that allotment of shares to the allottees will become irrevocable either (i) at the end of a minimum vesting period of three years, in which case the allottees will also be required to retain their shares for a minimum period of two years from the irrevocable allotment thereof, or (ii) after a minimum vesting period of four years, in which case allottees may not be subject to any minimum retention period. Our combined general meeting held on May 3, 2013 authorized our Board of Directors for a period of 26 months to allot, on one or more occasions, existing or new restricted shares in favor of persons to be chosen by the Board of Directors from among the salaried employees and corporate officers of our Company or of companies or economic interest groupings of the Group in accordance with Articles L. 225-197-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code. The existing or new shares allotted under this authorization may not represent more than 0.2% of the share capital as of the date of the decision by the Board of Directors to allot such shares. The authorization provides that allotment of shares to the allottees will become irrevocable either (i) at the end of a minimum vesting period of three years, in which case the allottees will also be required to retain their shares for a minimum period of two years from the irrevocable allotment thereof, or (ii) after a minimum vesting period of four years, in which case allottees may not be subject to any minimum retention period. The allotment of shares is subject to the subscription by the allotees to a share capital increase reserved for employees decided by the Board of Directors in accordance with articles L.3332-18 and seq. of the French Employment Code and with the 11th resolution of the aforementioned general meeting. In the case of newly issued shares, the authorization entails the express waiver by the shareholders, in favor of the allottees of restricted shares, of their preemptive rights in respect of shares that are to be issued as and when restricted shares vest. The Board of Directors sets the terms on which restricted shares are granted and the arrangements with respect to the dividend entitlement of the shares. 195 Table of Contents See "Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees  E. Share Ownership" for a description of our restricted shares plans currently in force. Changes in Share Capital in 2013 See Note D.15.1. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. Voting Rights In general, each shareholder is entitled to one vote per share at any shareholders' general meeting. Our Articles of Association do not provide for cumulative voting rights. However, our Articles of Association provide that any fully paid-up shares that have been held in registered form under the name of the same shareholder for at least two years acquire double voting rights. The double voting rights cease automatically for any share converted into bearer form or transferred from one owner to another, subject to certain exceptions permitted by law. As of December 31, 2013, there were 141,851,514 shares that were entitled to double voting rights, representing 10.71% of our total share capital, approximately 9.70% of our voting rights held by holders other than us and our subsidiaries, and 9.67% of our total voting rights. Double voting rights are not taken into account in determining whether a quorum exists. Under the French Commercial Code, treasury shares or shares held by entities controlled by that company are not entitled to voting rights and do not count for quorum purposes. Our Articles of Association allow us to obtain from Euroclear France the name, nationality, address and number of shares held by holders of our securities that have, or may in the future have, voting rights. If we have reason to believe that a person on any list provided by Euroclear France holds securities on behalf of another person, our Articles of Association allow us to request information regarding beneficial ownership directly from such person. See " B. Memorandum and Articles of Association  Form, Holding and Transfer of Shares," below. Our Articles of Association provide that Board members are elected on a rolling basis for a maximum tenure of four years. Shareholders' Agreement We are not aware of any shareholder's agreement currently in force concerning our shares. Shareholders' Meetings General In accordance with the provisions of the French Commercial Code, there are three types of shareholders' meetings: ordinary, extraordinary and special. Ordinary general meetings of shareholders are required for matters such as: electing, replacing and removing directors; appointing independent auditors; approving the annual financial statements; declaring dividends or authorizing dividends to be paid in shares, provided the Articles of Association contain a provision to that effect; and approving share repurchase programs. Extraordinary general meetings of shareholders are required for approval of matters such as amendments to our Articles of Association, including any amendment required in connection with extraordinary corporate actions. Extraordinary corporate actions include: changing our Company's name or corporate purpose; increasing or decreasing our share capital; 196 Table of Contents creating a new class of equity securities; authorizing the issuance of securities giving access to our share capital or giving the right to receive debt instruments; establishing any other rights to equity securities; selling or transferring substantially all of our assets; and the voluntary liquidation of our Company. Special meetings of shareholders of a certain category of shares or shares with certain specific rights (such as shares with double voting rights) are required for any modification of the rights derived from that category of shares. The resolutions of the shareholders' general meeting affecting these rights are effective only after approval by the relevant special meeting. Annual Ordinary Meetings The French Commercial Code requires the Board of Directors to convene an annual ordinary general shareholders' meeting to approve the annual financial statements. This meeting must be held within six months of the end of each fiscal year. This period may be extended by an order of the President of the Commercial Court. The Board of Directors may also convene an ordinary or extraordinary general shareholders' meeting upon proper notice at any time during the year. If the Board of Directors fails to convene a shareholders' meeting, our independent auditors may call the meeting. In case of bankruptcy, the liquidator or court-appointed agent may also call a shareholders' meeting in some instances. In addition, any of the following may request the court to appoint an agent for the purpose of calling a shareholders' meeting: one or several shareholders holding at least 5% of our share capital; duly qualified associations of shareholders who have held their shares in registered form for at least two years and who together hold at least 1% of our voting rights; the works council in cases of urgency; or any interested party in cases of urgency. Notice of Shareholders' Meetings All prior notice periods provided for below are minimum periods required by French law and cannot be shortened, except in case of a public offer for our shares. We must announce general meetings at least thirty-five days in advance by means of a preliminary notice (avis de réunion), which is published in the Bulletin des Annonces Légales Obligatoires, or BALO. The preliminary notice must first be sent to the French Financial markets authority (Autorité des marchés financiers, the "AMF"), with an indication of the date on which it will be published in the BALO. It must be published on our website at least twenty-one days prior to the general meeting. The preliminary notice must contain, among other things, the agenda, a draft of the resolutions to be submitted to the shareholders for consideration at the general meeting and a detailed description of the voting procedures (proxy voting, electronic voting or voting by mail), the procedures permitting shareholders to submit additional resolutions or items to the agenda and to ask written questions to the Board of Directors. The AMF also recommends that, prior to or simultaneously with the publication of the preliminary notice, we publish a summary of the notice indicating the date, time and place of the meeting in a newspaper of national circulation in France and on our website. At least fifteen days prior to the date set for a first convening, and at least ten days prior to any second convening, we must send a final notice (avis de convocation) containing the final agenda, the date, time and place of the meeting and other information related to the meeting. Such final notice must be sent by mail to all registered shareholders who have held shares in registered form for more than one month prior to the date of the final notice and by registered mail, if shareholders have asked for it and paid the corresponding charges. The final notice must also be published in a newspaper authorized to publish legal announcements in the local administrative department (département) in which our Company is registered as well as in the BALO, with prior notice having been given to the AMF for informational purposes. Even if there are no proposals for new resolutions or items to be submitted to the shareholders at the meeting, we must publish a final notice in a newspaper authorized to publish legal announcements in the local administrative department (départment) in with our Company is registered as well as in the BALO. 197 Table of Contents Other issues In general, shareholders can only take action at shareholders' meetings on matters listed on the agenda. As an exception to this rule, shareholders may take action with respect to the appointment and dismissal of directors even if this action has not been included on the agenda. Additional resolutions to be submitted for approval by the shareholders at the shareholders' meeting may be proposed to the Board of Directors, for recommendation to the shareholders at any time from the publication of the preliminary notice in the BALO until twenty-five days prior to the general meeting and in any case no later than twenty days following the publication of the preliminary notice in the BALO by: one or several shareholders together holding a specified percentage of shares; a duly qualified association of shareholders who have held their shares in registered form for at least two years and who together hold at least 1% of our voting rights; or the works council. Within the same period, the shareholders may also propose additional items (points) to be submitted and discussed during the shareholders' meeting, without a shareholders' vote. The shareholders must substantiate the reasons for proposing their proposals of additional items. The resolutions and the list of items added to the agenda of the shareholders' meeting must be promptly published on our website. The Board of Directors must submit the resolutions to a vote of the shareholders after having made a recommendation thereon. The Board of Directors may also comment on the items that are submitted to the shareholders' meeting. Following the date on which documents must be made available to the shareholders (including documents to be submitted to the shareholders' meeting and resolutions proposed by the Board of Directors, which must be published on our website at least twenty-one days prior to the general meeting), shareholders may submit written questions to the Board of Directors relating to the agenda for the meeting until the fourth business day prior to the general meeting. The Board of Directors must respond to these questions during the meeting or may refer to a Q&A section located on our website in which the question submitted by a shareholder has already been answered. Attendance at Shareholders' Meetings; Proxies and Votes by Mail In general, all shareholders may participate in general meetings either in person or by proxy. Shareholders may vote in person, by proxy or by mail. The right of shareholders to participate in general meetings is subject to the recording (enregistrement comptable) of their shares on the third business day, zero hour (Paris time), preceding the general meeting: for holders of registered shares: in the registered shareholder account held by the Company or on its behalf by an agent appointed by it; and for holders of bearer shares: in the bearer shareholder account held by the accredited financial intermediary with whom such holders have deposited their shares; such financial intermediaries shall deliver to holders of bearer shares a shareholding certificate (attestation de participation) enabling them to participate in the general meeting. Attendance in Person Any shareholder may attend ordinary general meetings and extraordinary general meetings and exercise its voting rights subject to the conditions specified in the French Commercial Code and our Articles of Association. Proxies and Votes by Mail Proxies are sent to any shareholder upon a request received between the publication of the final notice of meeting and six days before the general meeting and must be made available on our website at least twenty-one days before the general meeting. In order to be counted, such proxies must be received at our registered office, or at any other address indicated on the notice of the meeting or by any electronic mail indicated on the notice of the meeting, 198 Table of Contents prior to the date of the meeting (in practice, we request that shareholders return proxies at least three business days prior to the meeting; electronic proxies must be returned before 3 p.m. Paris time, on the day prior to the general meeting). A shareholder may grant proxies to any natural person or legal entity. The agent may be required to disclose certain information to the shareholder or to the public. Alternatively, the shareholder may send us a blank proxy without nominating any representative. In this case, the chairman of the meeting will vote the blank proxies in favor of all resolutions proposed or approved by the Board of Directors and against all others. With respect to votes by mail, we must send shareholders a voting form upon request or must make available a voting form on our website at least twenty-one days before the general meeting. The completed form must be returned to us at least three days prior to the date of the shareholders' meeting. For holders of registered shares, in addition to traditional voting by mail, instructions may also be given via the internet. Quorum The French Commercial Code requires that shareholders holding in the aggregate at least 20% of the shares entitled to vote must be present in person, or vote by mail or by proxy, in order to fulfill the quorum requirement for: an ordinary general meeting; and an extraordinary general meeting where the only resolutions pertain to either (a) a proposed increase in our share capital through incorporation of reserves, profits or share premium, or (b) the potential issuance of free share warrants in the event of a public offer for our shares (article L. 233-32 of the French Commercial Code). For any other extraordinary general meeting the quorum requirement is at least 25% of the shares entitled to vote, held by shareholders present in person, voting by mail or by proxy. For a special meeting of holders of a certain category of shares, the quorum requirement is one third of the shares entitled to vote in that category, held by shareholders present in person, voting by mail or by proxy. If a quorum is not present at a meeting, the meeting is adjourned. However, only questions that were on the agenda of the adjourned meeting may be discussed and voted upon once the meeting resumes. When an adjourned meeting is resumed, there is no quorum requirement for meetings cited in the first paragraph of this "Quorum" section. In the case of any other reconvened extraordinary general meeting or special meeting, the quorum requirement is 20% of the shares entitled to vote (or voting shares belonging to the relevant category for special meetings of holders of shares of such specific category), held by shareholders present in person or voting by mail or by proxy. If a quorum is not met, the reconvened meeting may be adjourned for a maximum of two months with the same quorum requirement. No deliberation or action by the shareholders may take place without a quorum. Votes Required for Shareholder Action The affirmative vote of a simple majority of the votes cast may pass a resolution at either an ordinary general meeting or an extraordinary general meeting where the only resolution(s) pertain to either (a) a proposed increase in our share capital through incorporation of reserves, profits or share premium, or (b) the potential issuance of free share warrants in the event of a public offer for our shares (article L. 233-32 of the French Commercial Code). At any other extraordinary general shareholders' meeting and at any special meeting of holders of a specific category of shares, the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the votes cast is required. Abstention from voting by those present or those represented by proxy or voting by mail is counted as a vote against the resolution submitted to a shareholder vote. Changes to Shareholders' Rights Under French law, the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the votes cast at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting is required to change our Articles of Association, which set out the rights attached to our shares, except for capital increases through incorporation of reserves, profits or share premium, or through the issuance of free share warrants in the event of a public offer for our shares (article L. 233-32 of the French Commercial Code). The rights of a class of shareholders can be amended only after a special meeting of the class of shareholders affected has taken place. The voting requirements applicable to this type of special meeting are the same as those 199 Table of Contents applicable to an extraordinary general shareholders' meeting. The quorum requirements for a special meeting are one-third of the voting shares, or 20% upon resumption of an adjourned meeting. A unanimous shareholders' vote is required to increase the liabilities of shareholders. Financial Statements and Other Communications with Shareholders In connection with any shareholders' meeting, we must provide a set of documents including our annual report and a summary of the financial results of the five previous fiscal years to any shareholder who so requests. We must also provide on our website at least twenty-one days before a shareholders' meeting certain information and a set of documents that includes the preliminary notice, the proxies and voting forms, the resolutions proposed by the Board of Directors, and the documents to be submitted to the shareholders' meeting pursuant to articles L. 225-115 and R. 225-83 of the French Commercial Code, etc. The resolutions and the list of items added to the agenda of the shareholders' meeting must be promptly published on our website. Dividends We may only distribute dividends out of our "distributable profits," plus any amounts held in our reserves that the shareholders decide to make available for distribution, other than those reserves that are specifically required by law or our Articles of Association. "Distributable profits" consist of our unconsolidated net profit in each fiscal year, as increased or reduced by any profit or loss carried forward from prior years, less any contributions to the reserve accounts pursuant to law or our Articles of Association. Legal Reserve The French Commercial Code requires us to allocate 5% of our unconsolidated net profit for each year to our legal reserve fund before dividends may be paid with respect to that year. Funds must be allocated until the amount in the legal reserve is equal to 10% of the aggregate par value of the issued and outstanding share capital. This restriction on the payment of dividends also applies to each of our French subsidiaries on an unconsolidated basis. At December 31, 2013, our legal reserve amounted to €282,280,863, representing 10.66% of the aggregate par value of our issued and outstanding share capital as of that date. The legal reserve of any company subject to this requirement may serve to allocate losses that may not be allocated to other reserves, or may be distributed to shareholders upon liquidation of the company. Approval of Dividends According to the French Commercial Code, our Board of Directors may propose a dividend for approval by shareholders at the annual general shareholders' meeting. If we have earned distributable profits since the end of the preceding fiscal year, as reflected in an interim income statement certified by our independent auditors, our Board of Directors may distribute interim dividends to the extent of the distributable profits for the period covered by the interim income statement. Our Board of Directors exercises this authority subject to French law and regulations and may do so without obtaining shareholder approval. Distribution of Dividends Dividends are distributed to shareholders pro rata according to their respective holdings of shares. In the case of interim dividends, distributions are made to shareholders on the date set by our Board of Directors during the meeting in which the distribution of interim dividends is approved. The actual dividend payment date is decided by the shareholders at an ordinary general shareholders' meeting or by our Board of Directors in the absence of such a decision by the shareholders. Shareholders that own shares on the actual payment date are entitled to the dividend. Dividends may be paid in cash or, if the shareholders' meeting so decides, in kind, provided that all shareholders receive a whole number of assets of the same nature paid in lieu of cash. Our Articles of Association provide that, subject to a decision of the shareholders' meeting taken by ordinary resolution, each shareholder may be given the choice to receive his dividend in cash or in shares. 200 Table of Contents Timing of Payment According to the French Commercial Code, we must pay any existing dividends within nine months of the end of our fiscal year, unless otherwise authorized by court order. Dividends on shares that are not claimed within five years of the date of declared payment revert to the French State. Changes in Share Capital Increases in Share Capital As provided for by the French Commercial Code, our share capital may be increased only with shareholders' approval at an extraordinary general shareholders' meeting following the recommendation of our Board of Directors. The shareholders may delegate to our Board of Directors either the authority (délégation de compétence) or the power (délégation de pouvoir) to carry out any increase in share capital. Our Board of Directors may further delegate this power to our Chief Executive Officer or, subject to our Chief Executive Officer's approval, to his delegates (directeurs généraux délégués). Increases in our share capital may be effected by: issuing additional shares; increasing the par value of existing shares; creating a new class of equity securities; or exercising the rights attached to securities giving access to the share capital. Increases in share capital by issuing additional securities may be effected through one or a combination of the following: in consideration for cash; in consideration for assets contributed in kind; through an exchange offer; by conversion of previously issued debt instruments; by capitalization of profits, reserves or share premium; or subject to various conditions, in satisfaction of debt incurred by our Company. Decisions to increase the share capital through the capitalization of reserves, profits and/or share premium or through the issuance of free share warrants in the event of a public offer for our shares (article L. 233-32 of the French Commercial Code) require shareholders' approval at an extraordinary general shareholders' meeting, acting under the quorum and majority requirements applicable to ordinary shareholders' meetings. Increases effected by an increase in the par value of shares require unanimous approval of the shareholders, unless effected by capitalization of reserves, profits or share premium. All other capital increases require shareholders' approval at an extraordinary general shareholders' meeting acting under the regular quorum and majority requirements for such meetings. See " Quorum" and " Votes Required for Shareholder Action" above. On May 3, 2013, our shareholders approved various resolutions delegating to the Board of Directors the authority to increase our share capital through the issuance of shares or securities giving access to the share capital, subject to an overall cap set at €1.3 billion. This cap applies to all the resolutions whereby the extraordinary shareholders' meeting delegated to the Board of Directors the authority to increase the share capital, it being also specified that: the maximum aggregate par value of capital increases that may be carried out with preemptive rights maintained was set at €1.3 billion; the maximum aggregate par value of capital increases that may be carried out by public offering without preemptive rights was set at € 520 million; the maximum aggregate par value of capital increases that may be carried out by capitalization of share premium, reserves, profits or other items was set at €500 million; and capital increases resulting in the issuance of securities to members of employee savings plans are limited to 1% of the share capital as computed on the date of the Board of Directors' decision to issue such securities, 201 Table of Contents and such issuances may be made at a discount of 20% (or 30%) if certain French law restrictions on resales were to apply, i.e. a lock up period of five years (or 10 years). On May 3, 2013, our shareholders also approved resolutions delegating to the Board of Directors the authority to increase the share capital by granting options to our employees and/or corporate officers, subject to the overall cap mentioned above and under the following terms and conditions: the authorization is valid for a period of 38 months, and any options granted may not give entitlement to a total number of shares exceeding 0.7% of the share capital as computed on the date of the decision of the Board of Directors to grant such options; see " Stock Options" above; On May 4, 2012, our shareholders approved resolutions delegating to the Board of Directors the authority to increase the share capital by granting existing or new restricted shares to our employees and/or corporate officers, subject to the overall cap mentioned above and under the following terms and conditions: the authorization is valid for a period of 38 months, and is subject to a limit of 1.2% of the share capital as computed on the date of the decision of the Board of Directors to allot such shares; see " Awards of Shares" above. See also "Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees  E. Share Ownership". On May 3, 2013, our shareholders approved resolutions delegating to the Board of Directors the authority to increase the share capital by granting existing or new restricted shares to our employees and/or corporate officers, subject to the overall cap mentioned above and under the following terms and conditions: the authorization is valid for a period of 26 months, and is subject to a limit of 0.2% of the share capital as computed on the date of the decision of the Board of Directors to allot such shares; see " Awards of Shares" above. The allotment of these shares is subject to the subscription by the allottees to a share capital increase decided by the Board of Directors as above described. Decreases in Share Capital In accordance with the provisions of the French Commercial Code, any decrease in our share capital requires approval by the shareholders entitled to vote at an extraordinary general meeting. The share capital may be reduced either by decreasing the par value of the outstanding shares or by reducing the number of outstanding shares. The number of outstanding shares may be reduced either by an exchange of shares or by the repurchase and cancellation of shares. Holders of each class of shares must be treated equally unless each affected shareholder agrees otherwise. In addition, specific rules exist to permit the cancellation of treasury shares, by which the shareholders' meeting may authorize the cancellation of up to a maximum of 10% of a company's share capital within any 24-month period. On May 3, 2013, our shareholders delegated to our Board of Directors for 26 months the right to reduce our share capital by canceling our own shares. Preemptive Rights According to the French Commercial Code, if we issue additional securities to be paid in cash, current shareholders will have preemptive rights to these securities on a pro rata basis. These preemptive rights require us to give priority treatment to current shareholders. The rights entitle the individual or entity that holds them to subscribe to the issuance of any securities that may increase the share capital of our Company by means of a cash payment or a set-off of cash debts. Preemptive rights are transferable during the subscription period relating to a particular offering. These rights may also be listed on Euronext Paris Stock Exchange. Preemptive rights with respect to any particular offering may be waived by the affirmative vote of shareholders holding two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an extraordinary general meeting. Our Board of Directors and our independent auditors are required by French law to present reports that specifically address any proposal to waive preemptive rights. In the event of a waiver, the issue of securities must be completed within the period prescribed by law. Shareholders may also notify us that they wish to waive their own preemptive rights with respect to any particular offering if they so choose. The shareholders may decide at extraordinary general meetings to give the existing shareholders a non-transferable priority right to subscribe to the new securities, for a limited period of time. 202 Table of Contents In the event of a capital increase without preemptive rights to existing shareholders, French law requires that the capital increase be made at a price equal to or exceeding the weighted average market prices of the shares for the last three trading days on Euronext Paris Stock Exchange prior to the determination of the subscription price of the capital increase less 5%. Form, Holding and Transfer of Shares Form of Shares Our Articles of Association provide that the shares may be held in either bearer form or registered form at the option of the holder. Holding of Shares In accordance with French law relating to the dematerialization of securities, shareholders' ownership rights are represented by book entries instead of share certificates. We maintain a share account with Euroclear France (a French clearing system, which holds securities for its participants) for all shares in registered form, which is administered by BNP Paribas Securities Services. In addition, we maintain separate accounts in the name of each shareholder either directly or, at a shareholder's request, through the shareholder's accredited intermediary. Each shareholder account shows the name of the holder and the number of shares held. BNP Paribas Securities Services issues confirmations (attestations d'inscription en compte) to each registered shareholder as to shares registered in the shareholder's account, but these confirmations are not documents of title. Shares of a listed company may also be issued in bearer form. Shares held in bearer form are held and registered on the shareholder's behalf in an account maintained by an accredited financial intermediary and are credited to an account at Euroclear France maintained by such intermediary. Each accredited financial intermediary maintains a record of shares held through it and provides the account holder with a securities account statement. Transfers of shares held in bearer form may only be made through accredited financial intermediaries and Euroclear France. Shares held by persons who are not domiciled in France may be registered in the name of intermediaries who act on behalf of one or more investors. When shares are so held, we are entitled to request from such intermediaries the names of the investors. Also, we may request any legal entity (personne morale) which holds more than 2.5% of our shares or voting rights to disclose the name of any person who owns, directly or indirectly, more than one-third of its share capital or of its voting rights. A person not providing the complete requested information in time, or who provides incomplete or false information, will be deprived of its voting rights at shareholders' meetings and will have its payment of dividends withheld until it has provided the requested information in strict compliance with French law. If such person acted willfully, the person may be deprived by a French court of either its voting rights or its dividends or both for a period of up to five years. Transfer of Shares Our Articles of Association do not contain any restrictions relating to the transfer of shares. Registered shares must be converted into bearer form before being transferred on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange on the shareholders' behalf and, accordingly, must be registered in an account maintained by an accredited financial intermediary on the shareholders' behalf. A shareholder may initiate a transfer by giving instructions to the relevant accredited financial intermediary. A fee or commission is payable to the broker involved in the transaction, regardless of whether the transaction occurs within or outside France. Registration duty is currently payable in France if a written deed of sale and purchase (acte) is executed in France or outside France with respect to the shares of the Company. Redemption of Shares Under French law, our Board of Directors is entitled to redeem a set number of shares as authorized by the extraordinary shareholders' meeting. In the case of such an authorization, the shares redeemed must be cancelled within one month after the end of the offer to purchase such shares from shareholders. However, shares redeemed on the open market do not need to be cancelled if the company redeeming the shares grants options on or awards those shares to its employees within one year following the acquisition. See also " Trading in Our Own Shares" below. 203 Table of Contents Sinking Fund Provisions Our Articles of Association do not provide for any sinking fund provisions. Liability to Further Capital Calls Shareholders are liable for corporate liabilities only up to the par value of the shares they hold; they are not liable to further capital calls. Liquidation Rights If we are liquidated, any assets remaining after payment of our debts, liquidation expenses and all of our remaining obligations will first be distributed to repay in full the par value of our shares. Any surplus will be distributed pro rata among shareholders in proportion to the par value of their shareholdings. Requirements for Holdings Exceeding Certain Percentages The French Commercial Code provides that any individual or entity, acting alone or in concert with others, that becomes the owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 331/3%, 50%, 662/3%, 90% or 95% of the outstanding shares or voting rights of a listed company in France, such as our Company, or that increases or decreases its shareholding or voting rights above or below any of those percentages, must notify the company, before the end of the fourth trading day following the date it crosses the threshold, of the number of shares it holds and their voting rights. The individual or entity must also notify the AMF before the end of the fourth trading day following the date it crosses any such threshold. The AMF makes the notice public. Pursuant to the French Commercial Code and the AMF General Regulation, the participation thresholds shall be calculated on the basis of the shares and voting rights owned, and shall take into account the shares and voting rights which are deemed to be shares and voting rights owned, even if the individual or entity does not itself hold shares or voting rights. In accordance with this deemed ownership principle, the individual or entity must take into account specific situations where shares and voting rights are deemed to be shares and voting rights owned when calculating the number of shares owned to be disclosed in the notifications to the Company and to the AMF. It includes among others situations where an individual or entity is entitled to acquire issued shares at its own initiative, immediately or at the end of a maturity period, under an agreement or a financial instrument, without set-off against the number of shares that this individual or entity is entitled to sell under another agreement or financial instrument. The individual or entity required to make such notification shall also take into account issued shares covered by an agreement or cash-settled financial instrument and having an economic effect for said individual or entity that is equivalent to owning such shares. In the cases of deemed ownership described above, the notification shall mention the type of deemed ownership and include a description of the main characteristics of the financial instrument or agreement with specific details required by the AMF General Regulation. The AMF General Regulation provides that shares and voting rights subject to multiple cases of deemed ownership shall only be counted once. When an individual or entity modifies the allocation between the shares it owns and its financial instruments or agreements deemed to be owned shares, it must disclose that change in a new notification. However, the change must only be disclosed if the acquisition of owned shares due to the settlement of the financial instruments or agreements causes the investor to cross a threshold. Subject to certain limited exceptions, French law and AMF regulations impose additional reporting requirements on persons who acquire more than 10%, 15%, 20%, or 25% of the outstanding shares or voting rights of a company listed in France. These persons must file a report with the company and the AMF before the end of the fifth trading day following the date they cross any such threshold. In the report, the acquirer will have to specify its intentions for the following six months including: whether it acts alone or in concert with others; the means of financing of the acquisition (the notifier shall indicate in particular whether the acquisition is being financed with equity or debt, the main features of that debt, and, where applicable, the main guarantees given or received by the notifier. The notifier shall also indicate what portion of its holding, if any, it obtained through securities loans); 204 Table of Contents whether or not it intends to continue its purchases; whether or not it intends to acquire control of the company in question; the strategy it contemplates vis-à-vis the issuer; the way it intends to implement its strategy, including: (i) any plans for a merger, reorganization, liquidation, or partial transfer of a substantial part of the assets of the issuer or of any other entity it controls within the meaning of article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, (ii) any plans to modify the business of the issuer, (iii) any plans to modify the memorandum and articles of association of the issuer, (iv) any plans to delist a category of the issuer's financial instruments, and (v) any plans to issue the issuer's financial instruments; any agreement for the temporary transfer of shares or voting rights of the issuer; the way it intends to settle its agreements or instruments on the shares or voting rights of the issuer mentioned in Article L. 233-9,4° and 4° bis of the French Commercial Code; and whether it seeks representation on the Board of Directors. The AMF makes the report public. Upon any change of intention within the six-month period following the filing of the report, it will have to file a new report for the following six-month period. In order to enable shareholders to give the required notice, we must each month publish on our website and send the AMF a written notice setting forth the total number of our shares and voting rights (including treasury shares) whenever they vary from the figures previously published. If any shareholder fails to comply with an applicable legal notification requirement, the shares in excess of the relevant threshold will be deprived of voting rights for all shareholders' meetings until the end of a two-year period following the date on which the owner complies with the notification requirements. In addition, any shareholder who fails to comply with these requirements may have all or part of its voting rights suspended for up to five years by the Commercial Court at the request of our Chairman, any shareholder or the AMF, and may be subject to criminal fines. Under AMF regulations, and subject to limited exemptions granted by the AMF, any person or entity, acting alone or in concert, that crosses the threshold of 30% of the share capital or voting rights of a French listed company must initiate a public tender offer for the balance of the shares and securities giving access to the share capital or voting rights of such company. Cash-settled derivative instruments or agreements mentioned in Article L. 233-9, 4° bis of the French Commercial Code are not included in the calculation of the number of shares related to the mandatory public tender offer. In addition, our Articles of Association provide that any person or entity, acting alone or in concert with others, who becomes the owner of 1%, or any multiple of 1% of our share capital or our voting rights, even beyond the minimum declaration limits permitted by the legal and regulatory provisions, must notify us by certified mail, return receipt requested, within five trading days, of the total number of shares and securities giving access to our share capital and voting rights that such person then owns. The same provisions of our Articles of Association apply whenever such owner increases or decreases its ownership of our share capital or our voting rights to such extent that it goes above or below one of the thresholds described in the preceding sentence. Any person or entity that fails to comply with such notification requirement will, upon the request of one or more shareholders holding at least 5% of our share capital or of our voting rights made at the general shareholders' meeting, be deprived of voting rights with respect to the shares in excess of the relevant threshold for all shareholders' meetings until the end of a two-year period following the date on which such person or entity complies with the notification requirements. Change in Control/Anti-takeover There are no provisions in our Articles of Association that would have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company or that would operate only with respect to a merger, acquisition or corporate restructuring involving our Company or any of our subsidiaries. Further, there are no provisions in our Articles of Association that allow the issuance of preferred stock upon the occurrence of a takeover attempt or the addition of other "anti-takeover" measures without a shareholder vote. Our Articles of Association do not include any provisions discriminating against any existing or prospective holder of our securities as a result of such shareholder owning a substantial number of shares. 205 Table of Contents Trading in Our Own Shares Under French law, Sanofi may not issue shares to itself. However, we may, either directly or through a financial intermediary acting on our behalf, acquire up to 10% of our issued share capital within a maximum period of 18 months, provided our shares are listed on a regulated market. Prior to acquiring our shares, we must publish a description of the share repurchase program (descriptif du programme de rachat d'actions). We may not cancel more than 10% of our issued share capital over any 24-month period. Our repurchase of shares must not result in our Company holding, directly or through a person acting on our behalf, more than 10% of our issued share capital. We must hold any shares that we repurchase in registered form. These shares must be fully paid up. Shares repurchased by us continue to be deemed "issued" under French law but are not entitled to dividends or voting rights so long as we hold them directly or indirectly, and we may not exercise the preemptive rights attached to them. The shareholders, at an extraordinary general shareholders meeting, may decide not to take these shares into account in determining the preemptive rights attached to the other shares. However, if the shareholders decide to take them into account, we must either sell the rights attached to the shares we hold on the market before the end of the subscription period or distribute them to the other shareholders on a pro rata basis. On May 3, 2013, our shareholders approved a resolution authorizing us to repurchase up to 10% of our shares over an 18-month period. Under this authorization, the purchase price for each Sanofi ordinary share may not be greater than €100.00 and the maximum amount that Sanofi may pay for the repurchases is €12,948,400,800. This authorization was granted for a period of 18 months from May 3, 2013 and cancelled and replaced the authorization granted to the Board of Directors by the general meeting held on May 4, 2012. A description of this share repurchase program as adopted by the Board of Directors on May 3, 2013, (descriptif du programme de rachat d'actions) was published on March 7, 2013. Purposes of Share Repurchase Programs Under the European regulation 2273/2003, dated December 22, 2003 (which we refer to in this section as the "Regulation"), in application of European directive 2003/6/EC, dated January 28, 2003, known as the "Market Abuse Directive", an issuer will benefit from a safe harbor for share transactions that comply with certain conditions relating in particular to the pricing, volume and timing of transactions (see below) and that are made in connection with a share repurchase program the purpose of which is: to reduce the share capital through the cancellation of treasury shares; and/or to meet obligations arising from debt instruments exchangeable into equity instruments and/or the implementation of employee share option programs or other employee share allocation plans. Safe harbor transactions will by definition not be considered market abuses under the Regulation. Transactions that are carried out for other purposes than those mentioned above do not qualify for the safe harbor. However, as permitted by the Directive, which provides for the continuation of existing practices that do not constitute market manipulation and that conform with certain criteria set forth in European directive 2004/72, dated April 29, 2004, the AMF published exceptions on March 22, 2005, October 1, 2008, March 21, 2011, March 10, 2012, and April 24, 2013 to permit the following existing market practices: transactions pursuant to a liquidity agreement entered into with a financial services intermediary that complies with the ethical code (charte de déontologie) approved by the AMF; and the purchase of shares that are subsequently used as acquisition currency in a business combination transaction. The AMF confirmed that all transactions directed at maintaining the liquidity of an issuer's shares must be conducted pursuant to a liquidity agreement with a financial services intermediary acting independently. Pricing, Volume and Other Restrictions In order to qualify for the safe harbor, the issuer must generally comply with the following pricing and volume restrictions: a share purchase must not be made at a price higher than the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the trading venues where the purchase is carried out; 206 Table of Contents subject to certain exceptions for illiquid securities, the issuer must not purchase more than 25% of the average daily volume of the shares in any one day on the regulated market on which the purchase is carried out. The average daily volume figure must be based on the average daily volume traded in the month preceding the month of public disclosure of the share repurchase program and fixed on that basis for the authorized period of that program. If the program does not make reference to this volume, the average daily volume figure must be based on the average daily volume traded in the 20 trading days preceding the date of purchase. In addition, an issuer must not: sell treasury shares during the period of the repurchase program (without prejudice to the right of the issuer to meet its obligations under employee share option programs or other employee share allocation plans or to use shares as acquisition currency as mentioned above); it being further specified that such prohibition is not applicable in the event of off-market block trades or if the share repurchase program is implemented by a financial services intermediary pursuant to a liquidity agreement as mentioned above; and effect any transaction during a "blackout period" imposed by the applicable law of the Member State in which the transaction occurs (i.e., under French law, during the period between the date on which the company has knowledge of insider information and the date on which such information is made public and during the 30-day period preceding the date of publication of annual and half-year financial statements and the 15-day period preceding the date of publication of quarterly financial information), without prejudice to transactions carried out pursuant to a liquidity agreement as mentioned above; or effect any transaction in securities with respect to which the issuer has decided to defer disclosure of any material, non-public information. Use of Share Repurchase Programs Pursuant to the AMF rules, issuers must immediately allocate the repurchased shares to one of the purposes provided for in the Regulation and must not subsequently use the shares for a different purpose. As an exception to the foregoing, shares repurchased with a view to covering stock option plans may, if no longer needed for this purpose, be re-allocated for cancellation or sold in compliance with AMF requirements relating in particular to blackout periods. Shares repurchased in connection with one of the market practices authorized by the AMF (see above) may also be re-allocated to one of the purposes contemplated by the Regulation or sold in compliance with AMF requirements. Shares repurchased with a view to their cancellation must be cancelled within 24 months following their acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we used the authority delegated by our shareholders to repurchase our shares on the stock market. Pursuant to our share repurchase programs authorized by our shareholders on May 4, 2012 and on May 3, 2013, we repurchased 21,335,144 of our shares for a weighted average price of €77.46, i.e. a total cost of €1,653 million, €2,885,000 of which were incurred on brokerage fees and financial transaction taxes (net of income taxes). On April, 30, 2013, the Board of Directors cancelled 8,387,236 treasury shares, as follows: 5,528,486 shares repurchased between October 1, 2012 and March 31, 2013 pursuant to the share repurchase program of the Company; 2,858,750 shares previously allocated to expired stock option programs, which had been reallocated to the purpose of cancellation. On July 31, 2013, the Board of Directors cancelled 5,885,439 treasury shares repurchased between May 3, and June 30, 2013 pursuant to the share repurchase program of the Company. On December 19, 2013, the Board of Directors cancelled 6,543,301 treasury shares repurchased in August 2013 pursuant to the share repurchase program of the Company. During 2013, pursuant to the liquidity contract, Exane BNP Paribas purchased 4,014,180 of our shares at an average weighted price of €76,56 for a total amount of €307,316,200 and sold 4,014,180 of our shares at an average weighted price of €76,63 for a total amount of €307,613,217. In 2013, also pursuant to our repurchase program two call options were purchased and exercised in February and in May and concerned respectively 2.5 and 4 million shares. There are no outstanding options. 207 Table of Contents In 2013, of the 3,150,287 shares allocated to stock purchase option plans outstanding at December 31, 2012, 68,356 shares were transferred to grantees of options. As a result, as of December 31, 2013, out of the 3,601,099 treasury shares, representing 0.27% of our share capital, 223,181 were allocated to outstanding stock purchase option plans and 3,377,918 were allocated to the purpose of cancellation. At the same date, none of the shares was allocated to the liquidity account, even though the liquidity contract was outstanding. As of December 31, 2013, we directly owned 3,601,099 Sanofi shares with a par value of €2 representing around 0.27% of our share capital and with an estimated value of €258,379,477, based on the share price at the time of purchase. Reporting Obligations Pursuant to the AMF Regulation and the French Commercial Code, issuers trading in their own shares are subject to the following reporting obligations: issuers must report all transactions in their own shares on their web site within seven trading days of the transaction in a prescribed format, unless such transactions are carried out pursuant to a liquidity agreement that complies with the ethical code approved by the AMF; and issuers must declare to the AMF on a monthly basis all transactions completed under the share repurchase program unless they provide the same information on a weekly basis. Ownership of Shares by Non-French Persons The French Commercial Code and our Articles of Association currently do not limit the right of non-residents of France or non-French persons to own or, where applicable, to vote our securities. However, non-residents of France must file an administrative notice with the French authorities in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in our Company. Under existing administrative rulings, ownership of 331/3% or more of our share capital or voting rights is regarded as a controlling interest, but a lower percentage might be held to be a controlling interest in certain circumstances depending upon factors such as: the acquiring party's intentions; the acquiring party's ability to elect directors; or financial reliance by the company on the acquiring party. Enforceability of Civil Liabilities We are a limited liability company (société anonyme) organized under the laws of France, and most of our officers and directors reside outside the United States. In addition, a substantial portion of our assets is located in France. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon or obtain jurisdiction over our Company or our officers and directors in U.S. courts in actions predicated on the civil liability provisions of U.S. securities law. It may also be difficult to enforce against them, either inside or outside the United States, judgments obtained against them in U.S. courts, or to enforce in U.S. courts, judgments obtained against them in courts in jurisdictions outside the United States, in any action based on civil liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws. There is doubt as to the enforceability against such persons in France, whether in original actions or in actions to enforce judgments of U.S. courts, of liabilities based solely on the U.S. federal securities laws. Actions for enforcement of foreign judgments against such persons would require such persons who are of French nationality to waive their right under Article 15 of the French Civil Code to be sued only in France. We believe that no such French persons have waived such right with respect to actions predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, actions in the United States under the U.S. federal securities laws could be affected under certain circumstances by the French law No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980, which may preclude or restrict the obtaining of evidence in France or from French persons in connection with such actions. Additionally, awards of punitive damages in actions brought in the United States or elsewhere may be unenforceable in France. 208 Table of Contents C. Material Contracts The Contingent Value Rights Agreement In connection with its acquisition of Genzyme Corporation, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sanofi, Sanofi issued one CVR per Genzyme share. On March 30, 2011, Sanofi and the American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as trustee, entered into a Contingent Value Rights agreement governed by the laws of the State of New York and subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York (the "CVR Agreement") governing the terms of the CVRs. Pursuant to the terms of the CVR Agreement, a holder of a CVR is entitled to cash payments upon the achievement of contractually defined milestones. The first milestone (related to manufacturing of Cerezyme® and Fabrazyme®) had to be met by December 31, 2011 in order for the payment to be triggered. This milestone was not met and therefore lapsed. Further to the Complete Response Letter received from the FDA in December 2013, Sanofi announced that the second milestone, triggered by U.S. regulatory approval of Lemtrada for treatment of MS on or before March 31, 2014 ("Approval Milestone") would not be met and therefore no payment would be made. The remaining milestone payments are triggered on achievement of certain aggregate Lemtrada sales thresholds within defined periods ("Product Sales Milestones"), as summarized below: Product Sales Milestone #1 Payment. $2 per CVR if Lemtrada net sales post launch exceeds an aggregate of $400 million within specified periods and territories. Product Sales Milestone #2 Payment. $3 per CVR upon the first instance in which global Lemtrada net sales for a four calendar quarter period are equal to or in excess of $1.8 billion. If Product Sales Milestone #2 is achieved but the Approval Milestone was not achieved prior to March 31, 2014, the milestone payment amount will be $4 per CVR (however, in such event the Approval Milestone shall not also be payable). Product Sales Milestone #3 Payment. $4 per CVR upon the first instance in which global Lemtrada net sales for a four calendar quarter period are equal to or in excess of $2.3 billion (no quarter in which global Lemtrada net sales were used to determine the achievement of Product Sales Milestone #1 or #2 shall be included in the calculation of sales for determining whether Product Sales Milestone #3 has been achieved). Product Sales Milestone #4 Payment. $3 per CVR upon the first instance in which global Lemtrada net sales for a four calendar quarter period are equal to or in excess of $2.8 billion (no quarter in which global Lemtrada net sales were used to determine the achievement of Product Sales Milestone #1, #2 or #3 shall be included in the calculation of sales for determining whether Product Sales Milestone #4 has been achieved). The CVRs will expire and no payments will be due under the CVR agreement on the earlier of (a) December 31, 2020 and (b) the date that Product Sales Milestone #4 is paid. Sanofi has agreed to use diligent efforts (as defined in the CVR Agreement), until the CVR agreement is terminated, to achieve each of the remaining milestones. However, we are not required to take all possible actions to achieve these goals. There can be no assurance that the Product Sales Milestone #1 or the other sales milestones will be achieved. Sanofi has also agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain a listing for trading of the CVRs on the NASDAQ market. For more information on Lemtrada see "Item 4.B Business Overview  Pharmaceutical Products  Multiple Sclerosis". The CVR Agreement does not prohibit Sanofi or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates from acquiring the CVRs, whether in open market transactions, private transactions or otherwise; Sanofi has certain disclosure obligations in connection with such acquisitions under the CVR Agreement. On or after the third anniversary of the launch of Lemtrada, Sanofi may also, subject to certain terms and conditions as set forth in the CVR Agreement, optionally purchase and cancel all (but not less than all) of the outstanding CVRs at the average trading price of the CVRs if the volume-weighted average CVR trading price is less than fifty cents over forty-five trading days and Lemtrada sales in the prior four quarter period were less than one billion U.S. dollars in the aggregate. A copy of the form of CVR Agreement is on file with the SEC as Annex B to Amendment No. 2 to the Registration Statement on Form F-4 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 24, 2011. Reference is made to 209 Table of Contents such exhibit for a more complete description of the terms and conditions of the CVR Agreement, and the foregoing summary of such terms and conditions is qualified in its entirety by such exhibit. D. Exchange Controls French exchange control regulations currently do not limit the amount of payments that we may remit to non-residents of France. Laws and regulations concerning foreign exchange controls do require, however, that all payments or transfers of funds made by a French resident to a non-resident be handled by an accredited intermediary. E. Taxation General The following generally summarizes the material French and U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders (as defined below) of purchasing, owning and disposing of our ADSs and ordinary shares (collectively the "Securities"). This discussion is intended only as a descriptive summary and does not purport to be a complete analysis or listing of all potential tax effects of the purchase, ownership or disposition of our Securities. All of the following is subject to change. Such changes could apply retroactively and could affect the consequences described below. This summary does not constitute a legal opinion or tax advice. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisers regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of Securities in light of their particular circumstances, including the effect of any U.S. federal, state, local or other national tax laws. A set of tax rules is applicable to French assets that are held by or in foreign trusts. These rules provide inter alia for the inclusion of trust assets in the settlor's net assets for purpose of applying the French wealth tax, for the application of French gift and death duties to French assets held in trust, for a specific tax on capital on the French assets of foreign trusts not already subject to the French wealth tax and for a number of French tax reporting and disclosure obligations. The following discussion does not address the French tax consequences applicable to Securities held in trusts. If Securities are held in trust, the grantor, trustee and beneficiary are urged to consult their own tax adviser regarding the specific tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of Securities. The description of the French and U.S. federal income tax consequences set forth below is based on the laws (including, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), final, temporary and proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof) in force as of the date of this annual report, the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the French Republic for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital of August 31, 1994 (the "Treaty"), which entered into force on December 30, 1995 (as amended by any subsequent protocols, including the protocol of January 13, 2009), and the tax regulations issued by the French tax authorities (the "Regulations") in force as of the date of this report. U.S. holders are advised to consult their own tax advisers regarding their eligibility for Treaty benefits, especially with regard to the "Limitations on Benefits" provision, in light of their own particular circumstances. For the purposes of this discussion, a U.S. holder is a beneficial owner of Securities that is (i) an individual who is a U.S. citizen or resident for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (ii) a U.S. domestic corporation or certain other entities created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof, including the District of Colombia, or (iii) otherwise subject to U.S. federal income taxation on a net income basis in respect of Securities. A non-U.S. holder is a person other than a U.S. holder. If a partnership holds Securities, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If a U.S. holder is a partner in a partnership that holds Securities, the holder is urged to consult its own tax adviser regarding the specific tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of Securities. This discussion is intended only as a general summary and does not purport to be a complete analysis or listing of all potential tax effects of the acquisition, ownership or disposition of the Securities to any particular investor, and does not discuss tax considerations that arise from rules of general application or that are generally assumed to be known by investors. The discussion applies only to investors that hold our Securities as capital assets that have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, that are entitled to Treaty benefits under the "Limitation on Benefits" provision 210 Table of Contents contained in the Treaty, and whose ownership of the Securities is not effectively connected to a permanent establishment or a fixed base in France. Certain holders (including, but not limited to, U.S. expatriates, partnerships or other entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, banks, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, tax-exempt organizations, financial institutions, persons subject to the alternative minimum tax, persons who acquired the Securities pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation, persons that own (directly, indirectly or by attribution) 5% or more of our voting stock or 5% or more of our outstanding share capital, dealers in securities or currencies, persons that elect to mark their securities to market for U.S. federal income tax purposes, persons that acquire ADSs in "pre-release" transactions (i.e., prior to deposit of the relevant ordinary shares) and persons holding Securities as a position in a synthetic security, straddle or conversion transaction) may be subject to special rules not discussed below. Holders of Securities are advised to consult their own tax advisers with regard to the application of French tax law and U.S. federal income tax law to their particular situations, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or other foreign jurisdiction. French Taxes Estate and Gift Taxes and Transfer Taxes In general, a transfer of Securities by gift or by reason of death of a U.S. holder that would otherwise be subject to French gift or inheritance tax, respectively, will not be subject to such French tax by reason of the Convention between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the French Republic for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Estates, Inheritances and Gifts, dated November 24, 1978, unless the donor or the transferor is domiciled in France at the time of making the gift or at the time of his or her death, or the Securities were used in, or held for use in, the conduct of a business through a permanent establishment or a fixed base in France. Pursuant to Article 235 ter ZD of the French General Tax Code, purchases of Securities are subject to a 0.2% French tax on financial transactions provided that Sanofi's market capitalization exceeds 1 billion euros as of December 1 of the year preceding the taxation year. A list of companies whose market capitalization exceeds 1 billion euros as of December 1 of the year preceding the taxation year is published annually by the French state. Pursuant to a ministerial regulation (arrêté) dated January 11, 2013, Sanofi is included in such list as a company whose market capitalization exceeds 1 billion euros as of December 1, 2012 and therefore, purchases of Sanofi's Securities are subject to such tax. Wealth Tax The French wealth tax impôt de solidarité sur la fortune applies only to individuals and does not generally apply to the Securities if the holder is a U.S. resident, as defined pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty, provided that the individual does not own directly or indirectly a shareholding exceeding 25% of the financial rights. U.S. Taxes Ownership of the Securities Deposits and withdrawals by a U.S. holder of ordinary shares in exchange for ADSs, will not be taxable events for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For U.S. tax purposes, holders of ADSs will be treated as owners of the ordinary shares represented by such ADSs. Accordingly, the discussion that follows regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of ordinary shares is equally applicable to ADSs. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding Tax Distributions made to holders and proceeds paid from the sale, exchange, redemption or disposal of Securities may be subject to information reporting to the Internal Revenue Service. Such payments may be subject to backup withholding taxes unless the holder (i) is a corporation or other exempt recipient or (ii) provides a taxpayer identification number and certifies that no loss of exemption from backup withholding has occurred. Holders that are not U.S. persons generally are not subject to information reporting or backup withholding. However, such a holder may be required to provide a certification of its non-U.S. status in connection with payments received within the United States or through a U.S.-related financial intermediary to establish that it is an exempt recipient. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a holder's U.S. federal income tax liability. A holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup 211 Table of Contents withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the Internal Revenue Service and furnishing any required information. Foreign Asset Reporting In addition, a U.S. holder that is an individual (and, to the extent provided in future regulations, an entity), may be subject to recently-enacted reporting obligations with respect to ordinary shares and ADSs if the aggregate value of these and certain other "specified foreign financial assets" exceeds $50,000. If required, this disclosure is made by filing Form 8938 with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Significant penalties can apply if holders are required to make this disclosure and fail to do so. In addition, a U.S. holder should consider the possible obligation to file a Form TD F 90-22.1  Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts Report as a result of holding ordinary shares or ADSs. Holders are thus encouraged to consult their U.S. tax advisors with respect to these and other reporting requirements that may apply to their acquisition of ordinary shares and ADSs. State and Local Taxes In addition to U.S. federal income tax, U.S. holders of Securities may be subject to U.S. state and local taxes with respect to such Securities. Holders of Securities are advised to consult their own tax advisers with regard to the application of U.S. state and local income tax law to their particular situation. ADSs-Ordinary Shares French Taxes Taxation of Dividends Under French law, dividends paid by a French corporation, such as Sanofi, to non-residents of France are generally subject to French withholding tax at a rate of 30% (21% for distributions made to individuals that are resident in the European Economic Area, and 15% for distributions made to not-for-profit organizations with a head office in a Member State of the European Economic Area which would be subject to the tax regime set forth under article 206-5 of the French General Tax Code if its head office were located in France and which meet the criteria set forth in the administrative guidelines BOI-RPPM-RCM-30-30-10-70-20120912, no 130). Dividends paid by a French corporation, such as Sanofi, towards non-cooperative States or territories, as defined in Article 238-0 A of the French General Tax Code, will generally be subject to French withholding tax at a rate of 75%, irrespective of the tax residence of the beneficiary of the dividends if the dividends are received in such States or territories; however, eligible U.S. holders entitled to Treaty benefits under the "Limitation on Benefits" provision contained in the Treaty who are U.S. residents, as defined pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty and who receive dividends in non-cooperative States or territories, will not be subject to this 75% withholding tax rate. Under the Treaty, the rate of French withholding tax on dividends paid to an eligible U.S. holder who is a U.S. resident as defined pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty and whose ownership of the ordinary shares or ADSs is not effectively connected with a permanent establishment or fixed base that such U.S. holder has in France, is reduced to 15%, or to 5% if such U.S. holder is a corporation and owns directly or indirectly at least 10% of the share capital of the issuing company; such U.S. holder may claim a refund from the French tax authorities of the amount withheld in excess of the Treaty rates of 15% or 5%, if any. For U.S. holders that are not individuals but are U.S. residents, as defined pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty, the requirements for eligibility for Treaty benefits, including the reduced 5% or 15% withholding tax rates contained in the "Limitation on Benefits" provision of the Treaty, are complicated, and certain technical changes were made to these requirements by the protocol of January 13, 2009. U.S. holders are advised to consult their own tax advisers regarding their eligibility for Treaty benefits in light of their own particular circumstances. Dividends paid to an eligible U.S. holder may immediately be subject to the reduced rates of 5% or 15% provided that such holder establishes before the date of payment that it is a U.S. resident under the Treaty by completing and providing the depositary with a treaty form (Form 5000). Dividends paid to a U.S. holder that has not filed the Form 5000 before the dividend payment date will be subject to French withholding tax at the rate of 30% and then reduced at a later date to 5% or 15%, provided that such holder duly completes and provides the French tax authorities with the treaty forms Form 5000 and Form 5001 before December 31 of the second calendar year following the year during which the dividend is paid. Pension funds and certain other tax-exempt entities are subject to the same general filing requirements as other U.S. holders except that they may have to supply additional documentation evidencing their entitlement to these benefits. 212 Table of Contents Form 5000 and Form 5001, together with instructions, will be provided by the depositary to all U.S. holders registered with the depositary and are also available from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The depositary will arrange for the filing with the French Tax authorities of all such forms properly completed and executed by U.S. holders of ordinary shares or ADSs and returned to the depositary in sufficient time that they may be filed with the French tax authorities before the distribution so as to obtain immediately a reduced withholding tax rate. The withholding tax refund, if any, ordinarily is paid within 12 months of filing the applicable French Treasury Form, but not before January 15 of the year following the calendar year in which the related dividend is paid. Tax on Sale or Other Disposition In general, under the Treaty, a U.S. holder who is a U.S. resident for purposes of the Treaty will not be subject to French tax on any capital gain from the redemption (other than redemption proceeds characterized as dividends under French domestic law), sale or exchange of ordinary shares or ADSs unless the ordinary shares or the ADSs form part of the business property of a permanent establishment or fixed base that the U.S. holder has in France. Special rules apply to holders who are residents of more than one country. U.S. Taxes Taxation of Dividends For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the gross amount of any distribution paid to U.S. holders (that is, the net distribution received plus any tax withheld therefrom) will be treated as ordinary dividend income to the extent paid or deemed paid out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits of Sanofi (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles). Dividends paid by Sanofi will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to corporate U.S. holders. Subject to certain exceptions for short-term and hedged positions, the U.S. dollar amount of dividends received by an individual U.S. holder with respect to the ADSs or our ordinary shares is currently subject to taxation at a maximum rate of 20% if the dividends are "qualified dividends". Dividends paid on the ordinary shares or ADSs will be treated as qualified dividends if (i) the issuer is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States that the Internal Revenue Service has approved for the purposes of the qualified dividend rules and (ii) the issuer was not, in the year prior to the year in which the dividend was paid, and is not, in the year in which the dividend is paid, a passive foreign investment company ("PFIC"). The Treaty has been approved for the purposes of the qualified dividend rules. Based on our audited financial statements and relevant market and shareholder data, we believe Sanofi was not a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to its 2013 taxable year. In addition, based on its current expectations regarding the value and nature of its assets, the sources and nature of its income, and relevant market and shareholder data, we do not anticipate that Sanofi will become a PFIC for its 2014 taxable year. Holders of ordinary shares and ADSs should consult their own tax advisers regarding the availability of the reduced dividend tax rate in light of their own particular circumstances. If you are a U.S. holder, dividend income received by you with respect to ADSs or ordinary shares generally will be treated as foreign source income for foreign tax credit purposes. The limitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes of income. Distributions out of earnings and profits with respect to the ADSs or ordinary shares generally will be treated as "passive category" income (or, in the case of certain U.S. holders, "general category" income). Subject to certain limitations, French income tax withheld in connection with any distribution with respect to the ADSs or ordinary shares may be claimed as a credit against the U.S. federal income tax liability of a U.S. holder if such U.S. holder elects for that year to credit all foreign income taxes. Alternatively, such French withholding tax may be taken as a deduction against taxable income. Foreign tax credits will not be allowed for withholding taxes imposed in respect of certain short-term or hedged positions in Securities and may not be allowed in respect of certain arrangements in which a U.S. holder's expected economic profit is insubstantial. The U.S. federal income tax rules governing the availability and computation of foreign tax credits are complex. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisers concerning the implications of these rules in light of their particular circumstances. To the extent that an amount received by a U.S. holder exceeds the allocable share of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, such excess will be applied first to reduce such U.S. holder's tax basis in its ordinary shares or ADSs and then, to the extent it exceeds the U.S. holder's tax basis, it will constitute capital gain from a deemed sale or exchange of such ordinary shares or ADSs (see " Tax on Sale or Other Disposition", below). 213 Table of Contents The amount of any distribution paid in euros will be equal to the U.S. dollar value of the euro amount distributed, calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date the dividend is received by a U.S. holder of ordinary shares (or by the depositary, in the case of ADSs) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars on such date. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the treatment of foreign currency gain or loss, if any, on any euros received by a U.S. holder that are converted into U.S. dollars on a date subsequent to receipt. Distributions to holders of additional ordinary shares (or ADSs) with respect to their ordinary shares (or ADSs) that are made as part of a pro rata distribution to all ordinary shareholders generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. However, if a U.S. holder has the option to receive a distribution in shares (or ADSs) or to receive cash in lieu of such shares (or ADSs), the distribution of shares (or ADSs) will be taxable as if the holder had received an amount equal to the fair market value of the distributed shares (or ADSs), and such holder's tax basis in the distributed shares (or ADSs) will be equal to such amount. Tax on Sale or Other Disposition In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder that sells, exchanges or otherwise disposes of its ordinary shares or ADSs will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the U.S. dollar value of the difference between the amount realized for the ordinary shares or ADSs and the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis (determined in U.S. dollars and under U.S. federal income tax rules) in the ordinary shares or ADSs. Such gain or loss generally will be U.S.-source gain or loss, and will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder's holding period in the ordinary shares or ADSs exceeds one year at the time of disposition. If the U.S. holder is an individual, any capital gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates (currently a maximum of 20%) if specified minimum holding periods are met. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations. Medicare Tax Certain U.S. holders who are individuals, estates or trusts are now required to pay a Medicare tax of 3.8% (in addition to taxes they would otherwise be subject to) on their "net investment income" which would include, among other things, dividends and capital gains from the ordinary shares and ADSs. F. Dividends and Paying Agents N/A G. Statement by Experts N/A H. Documents on Display We are subject to the information requirements of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act, and, in accordance therewith, we are required to file reports, including this annual report on Form 20-F, and other information with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or Commission, by electronic means. You may review a copy of our filings with the Commission, as well as other information furnished to the Commission, including exhibits and schedules filed with it, at the Commission's public reference room at 100 F Street, N.E., Room 1580, Washington, D.C. 20549. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information. In addition, the Commission maintains an Internet site at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the Commission (these documents are not incorporated by reference in this annual report). I. Subsidiary Information N/A Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk(1) General Policy Liquidity risk, foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk, as well as related counterparty risks, are managed centrally by our dedicated treasury team within the Group Finance Department. Where it is not possible to manage these risks centrally  in particular due to regulatory restrictions (such as foreign exchange controls) or local tax restrictions  credit facilities and/or currency lines, guaranteed whenever necessary by the parent company, are contracted by our subsidiaries locally with banks, under the supervision of the central treasury team. Our financing and investment strategies, and our interest rate and currency hedging strategies, are reviewed monthly by the Group Finance Department. Our policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. (1) The disclosures in this section supplement those provided in Note B.8.8. to the consolidated financial statements as regards the disclosure requirements of IFRS 7, and are covered by the statutory auditors' opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 214 Table of Contents Liquidity Risk We operate a centralized treasury platform whereby all surplus cash and financing needs of our subsidiaries are invested with or funded by the parent company (where permitted by local legislation). The central treasury department manages the Group's current and projected financing, and ensures that the Group is able to meet its financial commitments by maintaining sufficient cash and confirmed credit facilities for the size of our operations and the maturity of our debt (see Notes D.17.c and D.17.g to the consolidated financial statements). The Group diversifies its short-term investments with leading banks using money-market products with instant access or with a maturity of less than three months. As of December 31, 2013, cash and cash equivalents amounted to €8,257 million, and short-term investments predominantly comprised: collective investments in 'short-term money market' and 'money market' euro-denominated funds based on the European classification used by the Autorité des Marchés Financiers, and in 'money market' U.S. dollar-denominated funds subject to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulation 2a-7. All such funds can be traded on a daily basis and the amount invested in each fund may not exceed 10% of the aggregate amount invested in such funds; bank current-account deposits, bank term deposits and certificates of deposits with a maturity of no more than three months; amounts invested directly with non-financial institutions in the form of commercial paper and euro commercial paper with a maturity of no more than three months. As of December 31, 2013, the Group had €10 billion of undrawn general corporate purpose confirmed credit facilities, of which €3 billion expire in December 2014 and €7 billion in December 2018. These credit facilities are not subject to financial covenant ratios. Our policy is to diversify our sources of funding through public or private issuances of debt securities, in the United States and Europe (Euro Medium Term Note program). In addition, our A-1+/P-1 short-term rating gives us access to commercial paper programs in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in France. The average maturity of our total debt was 4.1 years as of December 31, 2013, compared with 3.2 years as of December 31, 2012. In 2013, the French commercial paper program was not drawn down. Average drawdowns under the U.S. commercial paper program were €2.2 billion (maximum €3.1 billion); the average maturity of these drawdowns was two months. As of December 31, 2013, these programs were not drawn down. In the event of a liquidity crisis, we could be exposed to difficulties in calling up our available cash, a scarcity of sources of funding including the above-mentioned programs, and/or a deterioration in their terms. This situation could damage our capacity to refinance our debt or to issue new debt on reasonable terms. Interest Rate Risk Since the financing of the Genzyme acquisition, the Group has managed its net debt in two currencies: the euro and the U.S. dollar (see note D.17 to the consolidated financial statements). The floating-rate portion of this debt exposes the Group to rises in interest rates, primarily in the Eonia and Euribor benchmark rates (for the euro) and in the U.S. Libor and Federal Fund Effective rates (for the U.S. dollar). To optimize (or reduce the volatility of) our cost of debt, we use interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and where appropriate interest rate options that alter the fixed/floating rate split of our debt. These derivative instruments are predominantly denominated in euros, and in U.S. dollars. The projected full-year sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations of our debt, net of cash and cash equivalents for 2014 is as follows: Change in EUR and USD short-term interest rates Impact on pre-tax net income (€ million) Impact on pre-tax income/(expense) recognized directly in equity (€ million) +100 bp 23 13 +25 bp 6 3 -25 bp (6 ) (3 ) -100 bp (23 ) (12 ) 215 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Risk a. Operational Foreign Exchange Risk A substantial portion of our net sales is generated in countries where the euro, which is our reporting currency, is not the functional currency. In 2013, for example, 32% of our consolidated net sales were generated in the United States, 33% in emerging countries and 8% in Japan. Although we also incur expenses in those countries, the impact of such expenses is not enough wholly to offset the impact of exchange rates on net sales. Consequently, our operating income may be materially affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between the euro and other currencies. We operate a foreign exchange risk hedging policy to reduce the exposure of our operating income to exchange rate movements. This policy involves regular assessments of our worldwide foreign currency exposure, based on foreign-currency transactions carried out by the parent company and its subsidiaries. These transactions mainly comprise sales, purchases, research costs, co-marketing and co-promotion expenses, and royalties. To reduce the exposure of these transactions to exchange rate movements, we contract hedges using liquid derivative instruments, mainly forward currency purchases and sales, and also currency swaps. The table below shows operational currency hedging instruments in place as of December 31, 2013, with the notional amount translated into euros at the relevant closing exchange rate. See also Note D.20 to the consolidated financial statements for the accounting classification of these instruments as of December 31, 2013. Operational foreign exchange derivatives as of December 31, 2013(1): (€ million) Notional amount Fair value Forward currency sales 2,943 32 Of which  U.S. dollar 1,379 14  Singapore dollar 345 1  Russian rouble 184 1  Japanese yen 118 9  Chinese yuan renminbi 118  Forward currency purchases 537 (1 ) Of which  Hungarian forint 119 1  Russian rouble 64 (1 )  Japanese yen 54 (1 )  U.S. dollar 51   Mexican peso 32  Total 3,480 31 (1) As of December 31, 2012, the notional amount of forward currency sales was €2,972 million with a fair value of €21 million (including forward sales of U.S. dollars of a notional amount of €972 million with a fair value of €6 million). As of December 31, 2012, the notional amount of forward currency purchases was €944 million with a fair value of -€4 million (including forward purchases of U.S. dollars of a notional amount of €69 million with an immaterial fair value). These positions mainly hedge future material foreign-currency cash flows arising after the balance sheet date in relation to transactions carried out during the year ended December 31, 2013 and recognized in the balance sheet at that date. Gains and losses on hedging instruments (forward contracts) have been and will continue to be calculated and recognized in parallel with the recognition of gains and losses on the hedged items. Due to this hedging relationship, the foreign exchange profit and loss on these items (hedging instruments and hedged transactions as of December 31, 2013) will be immaterial in 2014. b. Financial Foreign Exchange Risk The cash pooling arrangements for our foreign subsidiaries outside the euro zone, and some of our financing activities, expose certain of our entities to financial foreign exchange risk (i.e., the risk of changes in the value of borrowings and loans denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the borrower or lender). This foreign exchange exposure is hedged by the Sanofi holding company using firm financial instruments (usually currency swaps and forward contracts) contracted with banking counterparties. 216 Table of Contents Although we incur the majority of our costs within the euro zone, our revenues are mainly denominated in U.S. dollars. Consequently, we maintain a significant portion of our indebtedness in U.S. dollars. The table below shows financial currency hedging instruments in place as of December 31, 2013, with the notional amount translated into euros at the relevant closing exchange rate. See also Note D.20 to the consolidated financial statements for the accounting classification of these instruments as of December 31, 2013. Financial foreign exchange derivatives as of December 31, 2013(1): (€ million) Notional amount Fair value Expiry Forward currency sales 1,860 63 Of which  U.S. dollar 833 8 2014  Japanese yen 698 50 2014  Australian dollar 123 4 2014 Forward currency purchases 2,197 (9 ) Of which  Pound sterling 525 2 2014  Singapore dollar 485 (6 ) 2014  U.S. dollar 389 (1 ) 2014 Total 4,057 54 (1) As of December 31, 2012, the notional amount of forward currency sales was €3,970 million with a fair value of €38 million (including forward sales of U.S. dollars of a notional amount of €1,897 million with a fair value of €1 million). As of December 31, 2012, the notional amount of forward currency purchases was €2,638 million with a fair value of -€12 million (including forward purchases of U.S. dollars of a notional amount of €521 million with a fair value of €1 million). These forward currency contracts generate a net financial foreign exchange gain or loss arising from the interest rate differential between the hedged currency and the euro, given that the foreign exchange gain or loss on the foreign-currency borrowing and loans is offset by the change in the intrinsic value of the hedging instruments. We may also hedge some future foreign-currency investment or divestment cash flows. c. Other Foreign Exchange Risks A significant proportion of our net assets is denominated in U.S. dollars (see Note D.35 to the consolidated financial statements). As a result, any fluctuation in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the euro automatically impacts the amount of our equity as expressed in euros. As of December 31, 2013, we had no derivative instruments in place to limit the effect of such fluctuations. Counterparty Risk Our financing and investing transactions, and our currency and interest rate hedges, are contracted with leading banks. We set limits for investment and derivative transactions with individual banks, depending on the rating of each bank. Compliance with these limits, which are based on notional amounts weighted by the residual maturity and the nature of the commitment, is monitored on a daily basis. 217 Table of Contents The table below shows our total exposure as of December 31, 2013 by rating and in terms of our percentage exposure to the dominant counterparty.

(2) Notional amounts are computed on the basis of the forward rates negotiated at the inception date of the derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2013, Sanofi held investments in 'short-term money market' and 'money market' euro-denominated funds based on the European classification used by the Autorité des Marchés Financiers, and in 'money market' U.S. dollar-denominated funds subject to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulation 2a-7. These instruments have low volatility, low sensitivity to interest rate risk, and a very low probability of loss of principal. The depositary banks of the mutual funds, and of Sanofi itself, have a long-term rating of at least A. Realization of counterparty risk could impact our liquidity in certain circumstances. Stock Market Risk It is our policy not to trade on the stock market for speculative purposes. Item 12. Description of Securities other than Equity Securities 12.A Debt Securities Not applicable. 12.B Warrants and Rights Not applicable. 12.C Other Securities Not applicable. 218 Table of Contents 12.D American Depositary Shares General JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPMorgan"), as depositary, issues Sanofi ADSs in certificated form (evidenced by an ADR) or book-entry form. Each ADR is a certificate evidencing a specific number of Sanofi ADSs. Each Sanofi ADS represents one-half of one Sanofi ordinary share (or the right to receive one-half of one Sanofi ordinary share) deposited with the Paris, France office of BNP Paribas, as custodian. Each Sanofi ADS also represents an interest in any other securities, cash or other property that may be held by the depositary under the deposit agreement. The depositary's office is located at 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, Floor 58, New York, New York 10005-1401. A holder may hold Sanofi ADSs either directly or indirectly through his or her broker or other financial institution. The following description assumes holders hold their Sanofi ADSs directly, in certificated form evidenced by ADRs. Holders who hold the Sanofi ADSs indirectly must rely on the procedures of their broker or other financial institution to assert the rights of ADR holders described in this section. Holders should consult with their broker or financial institution to find out what those procedures are. Holders of Sanofi ADSs do not have the same rights as holders of Sanofi shares. French law governs shareholder rights. The rights of holders of Sanofi ADSs are set forth in the deposit agreement between Sanofi and JPMorgan and in the ADR. New York law governs the deposit agreement and the ADRs. The following is a summary of certain terms of the deposit agreement, as amended. The form of our deposit agreement has been filed as an exhibit to our Form F-6 filed on August 7, 2007, and the amendment to our deposit agreement has been filed as an exhibit to Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 to our Form F-6 filed on April 30, 2011. For more complete information, holders should read the entire deposit agreement (including the amendment) and the ADR itself. Holders may also inspect a copy of the deposit agreement at the depositary's office. Share Dividends and Other Distributions Receipt of dividends and other distributions The depositary has agreed to pay to holders of Sanofi ADSs the cash dividends or other distributions that it or the custodian receives on the deposited Sanofi ordinary shares and other deposited securities after deducting its fees and expenses. Holders of Sanofi ADSs will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of Sanofi ADSs that they hold. Cash. The depositary will convert any cash dividend or other cash distribution paid on the shares into U.S. dollars if, in its judgment, it can do so on a reasonable basis and can transfer the U.S. dollars to the United States. If the depositary determines that such a conversion and transfer is not possible, or if any approval from the French government is needed and cannot be obtained within a reasonable period, then the depositary may (1) distribute the foreign currency received by it to the holders of Sanofi ADSs or (2) hold the foreign currency distribution (uninvested and without liability for any interest) for the account of holders of Sanofi ADSs. In addition, if any conversion of foreign currency, in whole or in part, cannot be effected to some holders of Sanofi ADSs, the deposit agreement allows the depositary to distribute the dividends only to those ADR holders to whom it is possible to do so. It will hold the foreign currency it cannot convert into U.S. dollars for the account of the ADR holders who have not been paid. It will not invest the funds it holds and it will not be liable for any interest. Before making a distribution, any withholding taxes that must be paid under French law will be deducted. The depositary will distribute only whole U.S. dollars and cents and will round fractional cents down to the nearest whole cent. Exchange rate fluctuations during a period when the depositary cannot convert euros into U.S. dollars may result in holders losing some or all of the value of a distribution. Shares. The depositary may, and at our request will, distribute new ADRs representing any shares we distribute as a dividend or free distribution, if we furnish it promptly with satisfactory evidence that it is legal to do so. At its option, the depositary may distribute fractional Sanofi ADSs. If the depositary does not distribute additional Sanofi ADSs, the outstanding ADRs will also represent the new shares. The depositary may withhold any tax or other governmental charges, or require the payment of any required fees and expenses, prior to making any distribution of additional Sanofi ADSs. Rights to Receive Additional Shares. If we offer holders of Sanofi ordinary shares any rights to subscribe for additional shares or any other rights, the depositary, after consultation with us, will, in its discretion, either (1) make 219 Table of Contents these rights available to holders or (2) dispose of such rights on behalf of holders and make the net proceeds available to holders. The depositary may make rights available to certain holders but not others if it determines it is lawful and feasible to do so. However, if, under the terms of the offering or for any other reason, the depositary may not make such rights available or dispose of such rights and make the net proceeds available, it will allow the rights to lapse. In that case, holders of Sanofi ADSs will receive no value for them. In circumstances where rights would not otherwise be distributed by the depositary to holders of Sanofi ADSs, a holder of Sanofi ADSs may nonetheless request, and will receive from the depositary, any instruments or other documents necessary to exercise the rights allocable to that holder if the depositary first receives written notice from Sanofi that (1) Sanofi has elected, in its sole discretion, to permit the rights to be exercised and (2) such holder has executed the documents Sanofi has determined, in its sole discretion, are reasonably required under applicable law. If the depositary makes rights available to holders of Sanofi ADSs, upon instruction from such holders, it will exercise the rights and purchase the shares on such holder's behalf. The depositary will then deposit the shares and deliver ADRs to such holders. It will only exercise rights if holders of Sanofi ADSs pay it the exercise price and any other charges the rights require such holders to pay. U.S. securities laws may restrict the sale, deposit, cancellation or transfer of ADRs issued upon exercise of rights. For example, holders of Sanofi ADSs may not be able to trade Sanofi ADSs freely in the United States. In this case, the depositary may deliver Sanofi ADSs under a separate restricted deposit agreement that will contain the same provisions as the deposit agreement, except for changes needed to implement the required restrictions. Other Distributions. The depositary will distribute to holders of Sanofi ADSs anything else we may distribute on deposited securities (after deduction or upon payment of fees and expenses or any taxes or other governmental charges) by any means it thinks is legal, equitable and practical. If, for any reason, it cannot make the distribution in that way, the depositary may sell what we distributed and distribute the net proceeds of the sale in the same way it distributes cash dividends, or it may choose any other method to distribute the property it deems equitable and practicable. The depositary is not responsible if it decides that it is unlawful or impractical to make a distribution available to any holders of Sanofi ADSs. We have no obligation to register Sanofi ADSs, shares, rights or other securities under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We also have no obligation to take any other action to permit the distribution of ADRs, shares, rights or anything else to holders of Sanofi ADSs. This means that holders may not receive the distribution we make on our shares or any value for them if it is illegal or impractical for the depositary to make them available to such holders. Elective Distributions. Whenever we intend to distribute a dividend payable at the election of shareholders either in cash or in additional shares, we will give prior notice thereof to the depositary and will indicate whether we wish the elective distribution to be made available to holders of Sanofi ADSs. In that case, we will assist the depositary in determining whether that distribution is lawful and reasonably practicable. The depositary will make the election available to holders of Sanofi ADSs only if it is reasonably practicable and if we have provided all the documentation contemplated in the deposit agreement. In that case, the depositary will establish procedures to enable holders of Sanofi ADSs to elect to receive either cash or additional ADSs, in each case as described in the deposit agreement. If the election is not made available to holders of Sanofi ADSs, such holders will receive either cash or additional Sanofi ADSs, depending on what a shareholder in France would receive for failing to make an election, as more fully described in the deposit agreement. Deposit, Withdrawal and Cancellation Delivery of ADRs The depositary will deliver ADRs if the holder or his or her broker deposit shares or evidence of rights to receive shares with the custodian. Upon payment of its fees and expenses and any taxes or charges, such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees, the depositary will register the appropriate number of Sanofi ADSs in the names the holder requests and will deliver the ADRs to the persons the holder requests at its office. Obtaining Sanofi ordinary shares A holder may turn in his or her ADRs at the depositary's office. Upon payment of its fees and expenses and any taxes or charges, such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees, the depositary will deliver (1) the underlying shares to an account designated by the holder and (2) any other deposited securities underlying the ADR at the office 220 Table of Contents of a custodian or, at the holder's request, risk and expense, the depositary will deliver the deposited securities at its office. Voting Rights A holder may instruct the depositary to vote the Sanofi ordinary shares underlying his or her Sanofi ADSs at any meeting of Sanofi shareholders, but only if we request that the depositary ask for holder instructions. Otherwise, holders will not be able to exercise their right to vote unless they withdraw the underlying ordinary shares from the ADR program and vote as an ordinary shareholder. However, holders may not know about the meeting sufficiently in advance to timely withdraw the underlying ordinary shares. If we ask for holder instructions in connection with a meeting of Sanofi shareholders, the depositary will mail materials to holders of Sanofi ADSs in the manner described under the heading "Notices and Reports; Rights of Holders to Inspect Books" below. For any instructions to be valid, the depositary must receive them on or before the date specified in the materials distributed by the depositary. The depositary will endeavor, in so far as practical, subject to French law and the provisions of our statuts, to vote or to have its agents vote the shares or other deposited securities as holders may validly instruct. The depositary will only vote or attempt to vote shares as holders validly instruct. We cannot assure holders that they will receive the voting materials in time to ensure that holders can instruct the depositary to vote their shares. As long as they act in good faith, neither the depositary nor its agents will be responsible for failing to carry out voting instructions or for the manner of carrying out voting instructions. This means that holders may not be able to exercise their right to vote and there may be nothing holders can do if their shares are not voted as they requested. Similar to our shares, Sanofi ADSs evidenced by ADRs that are registered in the name of the same owner for at least two (2) years are eligible for double voting rights so long as certain procedures are followed, as set out in the deposit agreement. For additional information regarding double voting rights, see "Item 10. Additional Information  B. Memorandum and Articles of Association  Voting Rights". The deposit agreement allows the depositary and Sanofi to change the voting procedures or require additional voting procedures in addition to the ones described above if necessary or appropriate to comply with French or United States law or our statuts. For example, holders might be required to arrange to have their Sanofi ADSs deposited in a blocked account for a specified period of time prior to a shareholders' meeting in order to be allowed to give voting instructions. Notices and Reports; Rights of Holders to Inspect Books On or before the first date on which we give notice, by publication or otherwise, of any meeting of holders of shares or other deposited securities, or of any adjourned meeting of such holders, or of the taking of any action in respect of any cash or other distributions or the offering of any rights, we will transmit to the depositary a copy of the notice. Upon notice of any meeting of holders of shares or other deposited securities, if requested in writing by Sanofi, the depositary will, as soon as practicable, mail to the holders of Sanofi ADSs a notice, the form of which is in the discretion of the depositary, containing (1) a summary in English of the information contained in the notice of meeting provided by Sanofi to the depositary, (2) a statement that the holders as of the close of business on a specified record date will be entitled, subject to any applicable provision of French law and of our statuts, to instruct the depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights, if any, pertaining to the amount of shares or other deposited securities represented by their respective ADSs and (3) a statement as to the manner in which such instructions may be given. The depositary will make available for inspection by ADS holders at the depositary's office any reports and communications, including any proxy soliciting material, received from us that are both (1) received by the depositary as the holder of the deposited securities and (2) made generally available to the holders of such deposited securities by us. The depositary will also, upon written request, send to ADS holders copies of such reports when furnished by us pursuant to the deposit agreement. Any such reports and communications, including any such proxy soliciting material, furnished to the depositary by us will be furnished in English to the extent such materials are required to be translated into English pursuant to any regulations of the SEC. The depositary will keep books for the registration of ADRs and transfers of ADRs that at all reasonable times will be open for inspection by the holders provided that such inspection is not for the purpose of communicating with 221 Table of Contents holders in the interest of a business or object other than our business or a matter related to the deposit agreement or the ADRs. Fees and Expenses Fees Payable By ADS Holders Pursuant to the deposit agreement, holders of our ADSs may have to pay to JPMorgan, either directly or indirectly, fees or charges up to the amounts set forth in the table below. Associated Fee Depositary Action $5.00 or less per 100 ADSs (or portion thereof) Execution and delivery of ADRs for distributions and dividends in shares and rights to subscribe for additional shares or rights of any other nature and surrender of ADRs for the purposes of withdrawal, including the termination of the deposit agreement $0.02 or less per ADS (or portion thereof) Any cash distribution made pursuant to the deposit agreement, including, among other things:  cash distributions or dividends,  distributions other than cash, shares or rights,  distributions in shares, and  rights of any other nature, including rights to subscribe for additional shares. Registration fees in effect for the registration of transfers of shares generally on the share register of the company or foreign registrar and applicable to transfers of shares to or from the name of JPMorgan or its nominee to the custodian or its nominee on the making of deposits and withdrawals As applicable A fee equal to the fee for the execution and delivery of ADSs which would have been charged as a result of the deposit of such securities Distributions of securities other than cash, shares or rights Any other charges payable by JPMorgan, its agents (and their agents), including BNP Paribas, as custodian (by deductions from cash dividends or other cash distributions or by directly billing investors or by charging the book-entry system accounts of participants acting for them) Servicing of shares or other deposited securities Expenses incurred by JPMorgan  Cable, telex and facsimile transmission (where expressly provided for in the deposit agreement)  Foreign currency conversion into U.S. dollars In addition to the fees outlined above, each holder will be responsible for any taxes or other governmental charges payable on his or her Sanofi ADSs or on the deposited securities underlying his or her Sanofi ADSs. The depositary may refuse to transfer a holder's Sanofi ADSs or allow a holder to withdraw the deposited securities underlying his or her Sanofi ADSs until such taxes or other charges are paid. It may apply payments owed to a holder or sell deposited securities underlying a holder's Sanofi ADSs to pay any taxes owed, and the holder will remain liable for any deficiency. If it sells deposited securities, it will, if appropriate, reduce the number of Sanofi ADSs to reflect the sale and pay to the holder any proceeds, or send to the holder any property, remaining after it has paid the taxes. For additional information regarding taxation, see "Item 10. Additional Information  E. Taxation". Fees Paid to Sanofi by the Depositary JPMorgan, as depositary, has agreed to reimburse Sanofi for certain expenses (subject to certain limits) Sanofi incurs relating to legal fees, investor relations servicing, investor-related presentations, ADR-related advertising and public relations in those jurisdictions in which the ADRs may be listed or otherwise quoted, investor relations channel, perception studies, accountants' fees in relation to our annual report on Form 20-F or any other expenses directly or indirectly relating to managing the program or servicing the ADR holders. The depositary has also agreed to provide 222 Table of Contents additional amounts to us based on certain performance indicators relating to the ADR facility and fees collected by it. From January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013, we received from JPMorgan reimbursements of $5,000,000 for expenses and no additional amounts were paid. In addition to these payments, JPMorgan has agreed to waive servicing fees we may incur in connection with routine corporate actions such as annual general meetings and dividend distributions, as well as for other assistance JPMorgan may provide to us, such as preparation of tax and regulatory compliance documents for holders and investor relations advisory services. Changes Affecting Deposited Securities If we: change the nominal or par value of our Sanofi ordinary shares; recapitalize, reorganize, merge or consolidate, liquidate, sell assets, or take any similar action; reclassify, split up or consolidate any of the deposited securities; or distribute securities on the deposited securities that are not distributed to holders; then either: the cash, shares or other securities received by the depositary will become deposited securities and each Sanofi ADS will automatically represent its equal share of the new deposited securities; or the depositary may, and will if we ask it to, distribute some or all of the cash, shares or other securities it receives. It may also deliver new ADRs or ask holders to surrender their outstanding ADRs in exchange for new ADRs identifying the new deposited securities. Disclosure of Interests The obligation of a holder or other person with an interest in our shares to disclose information under French law and under our statuts also applies to holders and any other persons, other than the depositary, who have an interest in the Sanofi ADSs. The consequences for failing to comply with these provisions are the same for holders and any other persons with an interest as a holder of our ordinary shares. For additional information regarding these obligations, see "Item 10. Additional Information  B. Memorandum and Articles of Association  Requirements for Holdings Exceeding Certain Percentages". Amendment and Termination We may agree with the depositary to amend the deposit agreement and the ADRs without the consent of the ADS holders for any reason. If the amendment adds or increases fees or charges, except for taxes and other governmental charges or registration fees, cable, telex or facsimile transmission costs, delivery costs or other such expenses, or prejudices a substantial right of holders of Sanofi ADSs, it will only become effective 30 days after the depositary notifies such holders of the amendment. However, we may not be able to provide holders of Sanofi ADSs with prior notice of the effectiveness of any modifications or supplements that are required to accommodate compliance with applicable provisions of law, whether or not those modifications or supplements could be considered to be materially prejudicial to the substantial rights of holders of Sanofi ADSs. At the time an amendment becomes effective, such holders will be considered, by continuing to hold their ADR, to have agreed to the amendment and to be bound by the ADR and the deposit agreement as amended. The depositary will terminate the agreement if we ask it to do so. The depositary may also terminate the agreement if the depositary has told us that it would like to resign and we have not appointed a new depositary bank within 90 days. In both cases, the depositary must notify holders of Sanofi ADSs at least 30 days before termination. After termination, the depositary and its agents will be required to do only the following under the deposit agreement: (1) collect distributions on the deposited securities, (2) sell rights and other property as provided in the deposit agreement and (3) deliver shares and other deposited securities upon cancellation of ADRs. Six months or more after termination, the depositary may sell any remaining deposited securities by public or private sale. After that, the depositary will hold the money it receives on the sale, as well as any other cash it is holding under the deposit agreement, for the pro rata benefit of the holders of Sanofi ADSs that have not surrendered their Sanofi ADSs. It will have no liability for interest. Upon termination of the deposit agreement, the depositary's only obligations will be to account for the proceeds of the sale and other cash and with respect to indemnification. After termination, our only obligation will be with respect to indemnification and to pay certain amounts to the depositary. 223 Table of Contents Limitations on Obligations and Liability to Holders of Sanofi ADSs The deposit agreement expressly limits our obligations and the obligations of the depositary, and it limits our liability and the liability of the depositary. We and the depositary: are obligated only to take the actions specifically set forth in the deposit agreement without gross negligence or bad faith; are not liable if either is prevented or delayed by law or circumstances beyond its control from performing its obligations under the deposit agreement; are not liable if either exercises, or fails to exercise, any discretion permitted under the deposit agreement; have no obligation to become involved in a lawsuit or other proceeding related to the Sanofi ADSs or the deposit agreement on holders' behalf or on behalf of any other party, unless indemnity satisfactory to it against all expense and liability is furnished as often as may be required; are not liable for the acts or omissions made by any securities depository, clearing agency or settlement system or the insolvency of the custodian to the extent the custodian is not a branch or affiliate of JPMorgan; may rely without any liability upon any written notice, request or other document believed by either of us to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper parties; and are not liable for any action or nonaction taken in reliance upon the advice of or information from legal counsel, accountants, any person presenting ordinary shares for deposit, any ADS holder, or any other person believed in good faith to be competent to give such advice or information. In addition, the depositary will not be liable for any acts or omissions made by a successor depositary. Moreover, neither we nor the depositary nor any of our respective agents will be liable to any holder of Sanofi ADSs for any indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages. Pursuant to the terms of the deposit agreement, we and the depositary have agreed to indemnify each other under certain circumstances. Requirements for Depositary Actions Before the depositary will deliver or register the transfer of Sanofi ADSs, make a distribution on Sanofi ADSs or process a withdrawal of shares, the depositary may require: payment of stock transfer or other taxes or other governmental charges and transfer or registration fees charged by third parties for the transfer of any shares or other deposited securities; production of satisfactory proof of the identity and genuineness of any signature or other information it deems necessary; and compliance with regulations it may establish, from time to time, consistent with the deposit agreement, including presentation of transfer documents. The depositary may refuse to deliver Sanofi ADSs, register transfers of Sanofi ADSs or permit withdrawals of shares when the transfer books of the depositary or our transfer books are closed, or at any time if the depositary or we think it advisable to do so. Right to Receive the Shares Underlying the Sanofi ADSs Holders have the right to cancel their Sanofi ADSs and withdraw the underlying Sanofi ordinary shares at any time except: when temporary delays arise when we or the depositary have closed our transfer books or the deposit of shares in connection with voting at a shareholders' meeting, or the payment of dividends; when the holder or other holders of Sanofi ADSs seeking to withdraw shares owe money to pay fees, taxes and similar charges; or when it is necessary to prohibit withdrawals in order to comply with any laws or governmental regulations that apply to Sanofi ADSs or to the withdrawal of shares or other deposited securities. This right of withdrawal may not be limited by any other provision of the deposit agreement. 224 Table of Contents Pre-Release of Sanofi ADSs Unless we instruct the depositary not to, the deposit agreement permits the depositary to deliver Sanofi ADSs before deposit of the underlying shares. This is called a pre-release of the Sanofi ADSs. The depositary may also deliver shares upon cancellation of pre-released Sanofi ADSs (even if the Sanofi ADSs are cancelled before the pre-release transaction has been closed out). A pre-release is closed out as soon as the underlying shares are delivered to the depositary. The depositary may receive Sanofi ADSs instead of shares to close out a pre-release. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the depositary may pre-release Sanofi ADSs only under the following conditions: (1) before or at the time of the pre-release, the person to whom the pre-release is being made must represent to the depositary in writing that it or its customer (i) owns the shares or Sanofi ADSs to be deposited, (ii) assigns all beneficial rights, title and interest in such shares or ADRs to the depositary in its capacity as depositary and (iii) will not take any action with respect to such shares or ADRs that is inconsistent with the transfer of beneficial ownership, other than in satisfaction of such pre-release; (2) the pre-release must be fully collateralized with cash, U.S. government securities or other collateral that the depositary considers appropriate; (3) the depositary must be able to close out the pre-release on not more than five business days' notice; and (4) the depositary may require such further indemnities and credit regulations as it deems appropriate. In addition, the depositary will limit the number of Sanofi ADSs that may be outstanding at any time as a result of pre-release, although the depositary may disregard the limit from time to time, if it thinks it is appropriate to do so. The depositary may retain for its own account any compensation received by it in connection with the foregoing. Any holder of pre-release ADRs should consult its tax and other advisors about the implications of pre-release for its particular situation. 225 Table of Contents PART II Item 13. Defaults, Dividend Arrearages and Delinquencies N/A Item 14. Material Modifications to the Rights of Security Holders N/A Item 15. Controls and Procedures (a)Our Chief Executive Officer and principal financial officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 20-F, have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that material information relating to Sanofi was timely made known to them by others within the Group. (b)Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 based on the framework in "Internal Control  Integrated Framework" (1992 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that assessment, management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of its financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements, and can only provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Ernst & Young et Autres, independent registered public accounting firms, as stated in their report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, which is included herein. See paragraph (c) of the present Item 15, below. (c)See report of PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Ernst & Young et Autres, independent registered public accounting firms, included under "Item 18. Financial Statements" on page F-3. (d)There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Form 20-F that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item 16. [Reserved] Item 16A. Audit Committee Financial Expert Our Board of Directors has determined that Klaus Pohle, Robert Castaigne, Fabienne Lecorvaisier, Christian Mulliez and Gérard Van Kemmel, directors serving on the Audit Committee, are independent financial experts within the meaning of paragraph 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Board of Directors deemed Klaus Pohle to be a financial expert taking into account his education and professional experience in financial matters, accountancy and internal control. The Board of Directors determined that Robert Castaigne qualifies as a financial expert based on his education and his experience as Chief Financial Officer of Total, a major corporation. The Board of Directors deemed Fabienne Lecorvaisier to be a financial expert taking into account her experience in corporate finance in various international banks and as Chief Financial Officer 226 Table of Contents of Essilor and now Air Liquide. The Board of Directors deemed Christian Mulliez to be a financial expert taking into account his experience as Vice President, General Manager Administration and Finance of L'Oréal and graduate of the Ecole Supérieure des Sciences Economiques et Commerciales (ESSEC). The Board of Directors determined that Gérard Van Kemmel qualifies as a financial expert based on his experience as a partner at an international accounting firm. The Board of Directors has determined that all six directors meet the independence criteria of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10A-3, although only Mrs. Piwnica, Mr. Castaigne, Mrs. Lecorvaisier, Mr. Pohle and Mr. Van Kemmel meet the French AFEP-MEDEF Code criteria of independence applied by the Board of Directors for general corporate governance purposes. (See Item 16G, below.) Item 16B. Code of Ethics We have adopted a financial code of ethics, as defined in Item 16B. of Form 20-F under the Exchange Act. Our financial code of ethics applies to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and other officers performing similar functions, as designated from time to time. Our financial code of ethics is available on our Website at www.sanofi.com (information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report). A copy of our financial code of ethics may also be obtained without charge by addressing a written request to the attention of Individual Shareholder Relations at our headquarters in Paris. We will disclose any amendment to the provisions of such financial code of ethics on our website. Item 16C.

This schedule does not include purchases and sales conducted by Exane under a liquidity contract entered into in 2010 and that is still in effect. For more information see Item 10.B Memorandum and Articles of Association  Use of Share Repurchase Programs. Item 16F. Change in Registrant's Certifying Accountant N/A Item 16G. Corporate Governance Sanofi is incorporated under the laws of France, with securities listed on regulated public markets in the United States (New York Stock Exchange) and France (Euronext Paris). Consequently, as described further in our 227 Table of Contents annual report, our corporate governance framework reflects the mandatory provisions of French corporate law, the securities laws and regulations of France and the United States and the rules of the aforementioned public markets. In addition, we generally follow the "AFEP-MEDEF" corporate governance recommendations for French listed issuers (hereafter referred to as the "AFEP-MEDEF Code"). As a result, our corporate governance framework is similar in many respects to, and provides investor protections that are comparable to  or in some cases, more stringent than  the corresponding rules of the New York Stock Exchange. Nevertheless, there are important differences to keep in mind. In line with New York Stock Exchange rules applicable to domestic issuers, Sanofi maintains a board of directors at least half of the members of which are independent. Sanofi evaluates the independence of members of our Board of Directors using the standards of the French AFEP-MEDEF Code as the principal reference. We believe that AFEP-MEDEF's overarching criteria for independence  no relationship of any kind whatsoever with the Company, its group or the management of either that is such as to color a Board member's judgment  are on the whole consistent with the goals of the New York Stock Exchange's rules although the specific tests proposed under the two standards may vary on some points. We have complied with the audit committee independence and other requirements of the Rule 10A-3 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, adopted pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our Compensation Committee includes non-independent members, which is permitted under the AFEP-MEDEF Code but would not be compliant with the rules of the New York Stock Exchange for domestic issuers. Under French law, the committees of our Board of Directors are advisory only, and where the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual would vest certain decision-making powers with specific committees by delegation (e.g., appointment or audit committees), under French law our Board of Directors remains the only competent body to take such decisions, albeit taking into account the recommendation of the relevant committees. Additionally, under French corporate law, it is the Shareholders' General Meeting of Sanofi that is competent to appoint our auditors upon the proposal of our Board of Directors, although our Board Charter provides that the Board of Directors will make its proposal on the basis of the recommendation of our Audit Committee. We believe that this requirement of French law, together with the additional legal requirement that two sets of statutory auditors be appointed, share the New York Stock Exchange's underlying goal of ensuring that the audit of our accounts be conducted by auditors independent from company management. In addition to the oversight role of our Compensation Committee for questions of management compensation including by way of equity, under French law any option or restricted share plans or other share capital increases, whether for the benefit of senior management or employees, may only be adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to and within the limits of a shareholder resolution approving the related capital increase and delegating to the Board the authority to implement such operations. As described above, a number of issues, which could be resolved directly by a board or its committees in the United States, require the additional protection of direct shareholder consultation in France. On the other hand, there is not a tradition of non-executive Board of Directors sessions. Our Audit Committee is entirely composed of independent directors as that term is defined in Rule 10A-3 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, adopted pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The composition of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Appointments and Governance Committee includes directors who are also officers of our largest shareholder. As a 'foreign private issuer' under the U.S. securities laws, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer issue the certifications required by §302 and §906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 on an annual basis (with the filing of our annual report on U.S. Form 20-F) rather than on a quarterly basis as would be the case of a U.S. corporation filing quarterly reports on U.S. Form 10-Q. French corporate law provides that the Board of Directors must vote to approve a broadly defined range of transactions that could potentially create conflicts of interest between Sanofi on the one hand and its Directors and Chief Executive Officer on the other hand, which are then presented to shareholders for approval at the next annual meeting. This legal safeguard provides shareholders with an opportunity to approve significant aspects of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation package, and it operates in place of certain provisions of the NYSE Listed Company Manual.
