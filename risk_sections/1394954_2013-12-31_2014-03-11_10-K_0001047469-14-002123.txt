Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for our business as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and operating 14 Table of Contents results would likely suffer. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline and an investor in our common stock could lose all or part of their investment. Risks Related to Our Business Producing sapphire material is expected to constitute an increasing portion of our operations, and if we are unable to successfully transition our business and establish our sapphire material operations our business will be harmed. Pursuant to a contract we entered into on October 31, 2013 with Apple, we have agreed to supply sapphire materials. Historically, we have been a provider of crystal growth equipment, with very limited operations supplying sapphire material produced at our Salem, Massachusetts facility. Pursuant to the supply arrangement with Apple, we have agreed to commit significant resources to the growth of our sapphire material operations and have undertaken material obligations related thereto. We expect that the sapphire material-producing operations at our Arizona facility, which is still under development, will, if successful, constitute a significant part of our overall business. We have very limited experience operating a material manufacturing operation of this scale, and if we are unable to timely establish and maintain operations of the scale contemplated, our business and results of operations would be significantly impacted and we may be unable to perform some or all of the obligations we have undertaken as part of our agreement with Apple. Among the risks we face are: (i) hiring and maintaining a workforce necessary to operate the facility, (ii) the facility consistently complying with the specifications necessary to operate the ASF systems and that these specifications will be consistently adhered to, including adequate supply of power and water (some of which are beyond our control) and (iii) ensuring that the consumable components and parts necessary to generate sapphire materials and operate and maintain the ASF systems are available in time and quantity from our suppliers necessary to meet our expected delivery schedules. In addition, we must supply sapphire material that meets agreed upon specifications by agreed upon deadlines and we must have available an adequate supply for expected, although not committed, demand. If we are unable to comply with each of these requirements, we will be subject to significant warranty claims and/or liquidated damages. We may also be subject to substantial liquidated damages for other violations, including breaching certain confidentiality obligations or the inability to replace certain key employees. We may be unable to make these liquidated damage payments or satisfy our warranty obligations and any such failure will have material adverse consequences for our business and results of operations. Through the first half of 2014, we expect that we will sell a very limited number of ASF units to our customers. For this reason, we expect to convert very limited amounts in our sapphire equipment backlog into revenue during this period. Apple has no minimum purchase obligation and if Apple does not purchase sufficient quantities of sapphire material, our revenues will suffer and we may be unable to meet our obligations to repay advances that were provided to us. We have granted certain exclusivity rights to Apple with respect to the sapphire material manufactured with our ASF systems. Therefore, our sapphire material business will depend, to a large extent, on purchases of sapphire material by Apple. Although we have significant minimum supply obligations, Apple has no purchase obligations nor is Apple subject to any requirement to purchase sapphire materials only from us under our arrangements and if Apple purchases no sapphire material, or limited sapphire material, our anticipated sapphire business revenues would be materially and adversely affected. Apple has committed to make a $578 million prepayment, or the Prepayment Amount, to us in four installments, if conditions are met. We have received the first two installments. We must repay the 15 Table of Contents Prepayment Amount ratably over a five year period beginning in January 2015, either as a credit against Apple purchases of sapphire material or as a direct cash payment to Apple. Without significant sapphire revenue from Apple, we would still be required to repay in cash (on a quarterly basis) significant amounts of the Prepayment Amount beginning in 2015, which would limit our ability to invest in or operate other portions of our business, including our equipment operations, or to repay indebtedness at the time of maturity of such indebtedness. In addition, these repayments may exhaust all of our cash and, if we are unable to make a payment when due (or fail to meet our supply obligations), we will be in default and Apple will have the right to acquire control and possession of the ASF systems and/or our subsidiary (GT Advanced Equipment Holding LLC) that owns these systems (and to be paid in cash for any deficiency). The prepayment installments from Apple may also be cancelled prior to payment, or repayment accelerated, under certain circumstances, including if the ASF systems do not generate sapphire material to specification prior to an agreed upon date or we are unable to comply with certain financial requirements. Finally, if the repayment of the Prepayment Amount were to be accelerated, it would likely produce a cross-default under our 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2017, or the 2017 notes, and our 3.00% Convertible Notes due in 2020, or the 2020 notes (correspondingly, an acceleration of the 2017 notes and 2020 notes would likely produce a cross-default under the Prepayment Agreement), and we may not have sufficient resources at such time to satisfy these obligations. Even if Apple does purchase adequate amounts of sapphire material, the margins related to this business (even when operating at expected capacity) will be lower than those of our equipment business. If we do not operate our facility at or near capacity or we are unable to manage certain expenses with respect to these sapphire material operations, we may have negative margins and our ability to meet our delivery and/or payment obligations under the arrangements with Apple would be significantly impacted, which would have a negative impact on our business and may impair our ability to operate our business and satisfy our obligations to Apple and others (including holders of our 2017 and 2020 convertible notes). We have granted Apple certain exclusivity rights with respect to our sapphire growth technologies; such rights include an agreement that we will not sell our ASF systems to customers that generate sapphire material for use in certain products, and if our ASF customers were to generate sapphire for use in those restricted applications we could be subject to significant penalties which would harm our business. In connection with our agreements to supply sapphire material to Apple, we also agreed that we would not directly or indirectly provide sapphire material, sell ASF systems to customers that would generate sapphire material, or provide licenses or services pertaining to our sapphire technology or related intellectual property to any company other than Apple in each case for use in certain applications, including consumer electronics (subject to certain exceptions). If we were to breach this provision, or our ASF customers were to produce sapphire for these restricted applications, we would be subject to penalties under our agreement with Apple, including significant monetary penalties. While we intend that all of our future ASF equipment contracts will place restrictions on the use of the ASF-generated material, there is no guarantee that our customers will honor this restriction or that, if they were to breach such contractual provision, that we would be able to collect (and we expect that we would be very unlikely to collect) sufficient amounts to off-set the monetary damages that we would owe Apple. Any violation of this exclusivity provision by us or by our customers, over which we will exercise no control, would have a material impact on our business and if we were required to pay damages to Apple, the amounts would likely be material and require significant amounts of our cash. Our future sales of ASF systems may also be limited due to these exclusivity requirements. 16 Table of Contents We have granted certain intellectual property rights with respect to our sapphire growth technology to Apple, and Apple may be able to acquire additional rights in the future under certain circumstances, and Apple may be able to transfer this intellectual property to others, including our competitors. We have granted Apple certain intellectual property rights pertaining to our sapphire growth technology, including rights with respect to certain existing and future developments. Under certain circumstances, Apple would have the ability to use our technology to generate sapphire material for its use, or to engage one or more third parties to manufacture sapphire for Apple using our technology. If Apple were to exercise its right to use our sapphire growth technology (or grant that right to a third party), our business would be harmed, and we may be unable to meet our obligations under the Prepayment Agreement through the delivery of sapphire material to Apple. In addition, if a third party were to receive a license to our technology it may replace us as a supplier of sapphire material to Apple. Any of the foregoing would significantly harm our business and results of operations. We expect to build inventory of sapphire material and if it is not purchased by Apple, our business could be harmed and we may be required to take a charge for this inventory. We are required to maintain significant inventory of sapphire material under our agreements with Apple, although Apple has no commitment or obligation to purchase any sapphire material from us. If Apple does not purchase sapphire materials in the amounts we expect, it would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, due to certain restrictions in our supply agreement on the sale of sapphire material, we may not be able to sell that material to other parties, which would result in increases in our inventory that we cannot otherwise sell and would have a negative impact on our margins and our operations and may require that we take a charge for that inventory if it becomes excess or obsolete. If our sapphire equipment and material do not achieve market acceptance, prospects for our sapphire business will be limited. The customers to whom we sell ASF equipment systems are, we believe, largely manufacturing for the LED industry and, in more limited cases, other industrial markets. Potential customers for sapphire equipment and sapphire-based LED materials manufactured with the ASF system may be reluctant to adopt these offerings as an alternative to existing sapphire materials and lighting technology or sapphire manufacturing processes. In addition, many of the customers who purchase our equipment, we believe, will utilize the material for LED lighting. However, LED lighting is currently more expensive than traditional lighting and if the price of sapphire-based LED does not decrease in the near future, our customers may not have a market in the near term for the material they produce with our ASF systems, which would reduce the demand for our ASF systems. In addition, potential customers may have substantial investments and know-how related to their existing sapphire, LED and lighting technologies, and may perceive risks relating to the complexity, reliability, quality, usefulness and cost-effectiveness of our sapphire equipment and sapphire material products compared to alternative products and technologies available in the market or that are currently under development. For example, companies are developing general lighting technologies that utilize silicon-based material (in lieu of sapphire) and assert that the production costs are significantly lower than the costs to produce sapphire-based lighting materials. If acceptance of sapphire material and sapphire-based LEDs, particularly in general illumination, do not increase significantly, opportunities to increase the sapphire equipment portion of our business and revenues would be limited. In addition, the price of sapphire-based LED material has recently experienced a marked drop due, in part, to the readily available supply of such material. If the price of LED material, which is 17 Table of Contents driven, in large part due to the supply that is generally available, drops, we would expect that our equipment business would be negatively impacted. Any of the foregoing factors could have an adverse impact on the growth of the sapphire portion of our business. Historically, the sapphire industry has experienced volatility in product demand and pricing. Changes in average selling prices of sapphire material as a result of competitive pricing pressures, availability of material, increased sales discounts and new product introductions by competitors could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Crystal growth using the ASF system requires a consistent supply of power and any interruption in the supply of power may result in sapphire material that has reduced or no sales value. The process for growing sapphire boules using the ASF system technology requires that the system be supplied with a consistent supply of power during the cycle required to grow a boule. If there are power interruptions, which we have experienced at our Salem and Merrimack facilities, even for a brief period of time, the sapphire boule being generated by that system will be of inferior quality and we would likely be unable to sell that sapphire material to a customer. Our Arizona sapphire material facility will have a number of ASF systems operating and the power demand will be significant, in particular, at that location and if the power is not consistent, we may breach our material delivery commitments and the consequences could include accelerated repayment of prepayment advances made to us and payment of damages to Apple. Such power interruptions at our facilities could also delay and impair our research and development efforts with respect to sapphire material and ASF systems. In addition, if customers of our ASF system do not have consistent power supplies, our system would not gain market acceptance because it will not create boules of the quality that may be expected by our customers and we would likely not meet the required contractual criteria necessary to receive the final installment payment for ASF systems from an equipment customer. Production and sale of sapphire growth systems for producing materials is a new industry and we have limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate the business prospects for this business segment. Because of our limited operating history in the sapphire industry it is difficult to evaluate our business and prospects. While we have gained contractual acceptances on our ASF systems, our sapphire equipment business presents the difficulties frequently encountered by those businesses that are in the early stage of development, coupled with the risks and uncertainties encountered in new and evolving markets such as the market for sapphire growth technology. We may not be able to successfully address these challenges. If we fail to do so, we may incur losses and our business would be negatively impacted. While we have commissioned ASF systems at customer sites, our customers generally lack experience in operating the ASF systems. Our sapphire furnaces require a skilled and trained employee base to properly operate and efficiently maintain the systems. While we offer training in connection with the sale of ASF systems, at certain customer sites, we have discovered that those customers have not yet hired the personnel or instituted the operations procedures necessary to properly run the ASF system they purchased. As a result of these factors, we believe that certain ASF systems have generated sapphire material that is not salable. Additionally, even in those cases where the sapphire boule met specification criteria, the boule has not always been properly oriented by the customer and some or all of the value of the sapphire boule was lost as it was sliced and cored. If our customers do not have the manufacturing expertise to operate the ASF systems and orient and cut the sapphire boules, they may be delayed in ramping up their operations and sapphire manufacturing operations, and the ASF systems may not gain wider market acceptance, all of which would harm our reputation and the results of our sapphire business segment. 18 Table of Contents We have identified a material weakness in accounting for income taxes in our internal control over financial reporting, which, if not remedied effectively, could have a further adverse effect on our share price. Management, through documentation, testing and assessment of our internal control over financial reporting has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting had a material weakness in accounting for income taxes as of December 31, 2013. See Item 9AControls and Procedures elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we are unable to effectively remediate this material weakness in a timely manner, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have a further adverse effect on our share price. In future periods, if the testing and assessment of our internal controls reveals further material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, the correction of any such material weakness or significant deficiency could require additional remedial measures including additional personnel which could be costly and time-consuming. If a material weakness exists as of a future period year-end (including a material weakness identified prior to year-end for which there is an insufficient period of time to evaluate and confirm the effectiveness of the corrections or related new procedures), our management will be unable to report favorably as of such future period year-end to the effectiveness of our control over financial reporting. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period, or if we continue to experience material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting for accounting for income taxes, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our share price and potentially subject us to potentially costly litigation and governmental inquiries and investigations. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock. We have assessed and tested our system of internal controls. We concluded our system of internal controls over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2013. We will need to undertake remediation efforts and will need to strengthen our processes and systems and adapt them to changes as our business evolves (including with respect to our materials operations in Mesa, Arizona) and we acquire new business and technologies. This continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls is expensive and time-consuming, and requires significant management attention. We cannot be certain that our internal control measures will, in the future, provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting. Furthermore, as our business changes (including due to our sapphire material operations) and if we expand through acquisitions of other companies or make significant investments in other companies or enter into joint development (and similar arrangements), our internal controls may become more complex and we will require significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective. In addition, if we reduce a portion of our workforce, as we have done in the past, our ability to adequately maintain our internal controls may be adversely impacted. Failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remediated, could reduce the market's confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price. 19 Table of Contents We expect that oversupply of, or limited demand for, polysilicon, solar panels and sapphire material, including LED quality material, may have an adverse impact on our equipment business and, unless such oversupplies are reduced or demand increases in the near future due to development of new technologies or otherwise, the negative impact on our equipment business could last for an extended period. Our equipment sales are principally to customers that manufacture polysilicon (which is a key component for making solar wafers and cells), silicon ingots (which are, through various cutting and finishing processes, used for making solar cells, modules and wafers) and sapphire boules (which are, through various cutting and finishing processes, used for making, among other things, LED wafers). Each of the polysilicon, solar wafer, modules and cell and LED wafer markets have experienced significant oversupply and/or significant decreased demand. For example, our PV business experienced a 36% decrease in revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in the prior year (although there are some market indicators suggesting that the PV market may be experiencing early signs of recovery). The consequence of this oversupply and decreased demand has been that those who sell into these markets (many of whom are customers for our equipment) are either required to sell at very low prices (including sometimes selling at a loss) or are unable to sell at all. Many customers have experienced large inventories of the polysilicon sapphire and multicrystalline silicon ingots generated with our equipment. As a consequence of these conditions, demand for all of our equipment, particularly our polysilicon reactors, DSS furnaces and ASF units, has dropped significantly. We have in the past recorded significant de-bookings for our PV, polysilicon and sapphire equipment. In the future, we may continue to have material amounts of contract de-bookings. This has had an adverse impact on our business and will continue to have such an effect, including requiring that we sell products at prices below what we usually charge or resulting in the absence of any meaningful new sales. In addition, certain customers have requested that we delay delivery of equipment or reduce the number of equipment units they are required to purchase under existing contracts (and we expect that we may receive similar requests in the future). If the existing inventories of polysilicon, solar modules cells/wafers and LED/sapphire materials are not reduced in the near future or if demand does not increase, as a result of new solar or sapphire technologies that increase demand for end-products incorporating polysilicon, solar cells or sapphire material or due to other reasons, we expect that our business and results of operations will be significantly and materially impacted. We depend on a small number of customers in any given fiscal period for a substantial part of our sales and revenue. In each fiscal period, we depend on a small number of customers for a substantial part of our sales and revenue. We expect that our success in the sapphire material business, which will be very important to our overall business, will be tied to Apple. The failure of Apple to place orders for sapphire material, the failure of our other major customers to place orders or to make payments for equipment, the loss of existing orders or lack of new orders in the future, or a change in product acceptance schedules could significantly reduce our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business and/or prospects. While we have sought to diversify our business and customer base, including a larger sapphire materials operation, we anticipate that our dependence on a limited number of customers will continue for the foreseeable future. There is a risk that existing customers will elect not to do business with us in the future, particularly as we face increased competition in each of our business segments, and/or that our equipment customers will experience financial difficulties. Furthermore, due to the cost of our equipment products, our equipment customers are often dependent on the equity capital markets and debt markets to finance their purchases. As a result of on-going turmoil in the capital and debt markets, these equipment customers could experience financial difficulties and become unable to fulfill their contracts with us. There is also a risk that these customers will attempt to impose new or 20 Table of Contents additional requirements on us that reduce the gross margins that we are able to generate through sales to such customers. If we do not develop relationships with new customers, we may not be able to increase, or even maintain, our revenue, and our financial condition, results of operations, business and/or prospects may be materially adversely affected. Our Photovoltaic business segment has historically depended upon the Directional Solidification System (DSS) furnace for its revenue and there may be limited demand for DSS equipment in 2014. Additionally, our newest photovoltaic equipment platform is in development and expect will take additional time before it gains market acceptance. The global solar industry has experienced a significant downturn that negatively impacted the growth of the industry and the profitability of PV producers and the companies who supply the equipment and materials used in the production of PV products such as wafers, cells and modules. The PV industry began to show some indication that demand was increasing in the final quarter of 2013. The principal product line of our PV business has been the DSS family of casting furnaces that are used to produce multicrystalline ingots and MonoCast ingots. Because of the high level of PV manufacturing overcapacity, in 2012, we suspended any significant additional investments in our DSS product line and focused on selling DSS furnaces that we had in inventory at that time. In 2013, we sold many of the DSS units in our inventory to several of our customers. Over the past few months, the photovoltaic market began to exhibit signs of a recovery. As a result we have resumed development efforts of our DSS product line. We are unable to determine if and when there will be demand for any existing DSS products or new DSS product releases. We are developing our next generation PV equipment offering, the HICz tool. HiCz, or continuous Czochralski (Cz) growth process, produces monocrystalline ingots that are designed to produce more efficient wafers at a lower cost and with higher uniform resistivity than those made from traditional batch Cz ingots. Our HiCz tool may not gain market-wide acceptance. Therefore, while the PV market does show indications of improvement and while we have resumed investment in our DSS platform and continue to develop our HICz tool, there may be limited demand for our PV products in the short term. If our HiCz tool does not gain market acceptance, our PV business segment could experience more prolonged periods without contributing any meaningful revenue to the business. In addition, with the idling of our facility in Hazelwood, Missouri in 2013, we will no longer sell HiCz material generated by our HiCz tools and, while the revenue from the sale of this material was minimal, we no longer expect to have this as a source of revenue in the future. Impairment charges negatively impacted our financial results in recent fiscal periods and additional charges, of comparable or greater magnitude, may be required in the future as a result of the prolonged downturn in the markets we serve. We assess our goodwill and other intangible assets and our long-lived assets for impairment when required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These accounting principles require that we record an impairment charge if circumstances indicate that the asset carrying values exceed their estimated fair values. The estimated fair value of these assets is impacted by general economic conditions in the markets we serve. Deterioration in general economic conditions may result in, among other things: declining revenue which can lead to excess capacity and declining operating cash flow; reductions in management's estimates for future revenue and operating cash flow growth. All of these factors negatively impacted our PV business during the quarter ended December 31, 2012 and, as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $57.0 million, an intangible asset charge of $0.5 million, asset impairments of $29.3 million, inventory write downs of $60.2 million and vendor 21 Table of Contents advance impairments of $8.4 million. More recently, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, we recorded $1.9 million of additional charges related to the Hazelwood facility's lease exit costs, $0.6 million of other contract termination costs related to this facility and $4.0 million of impairment charges related to the fair value of the HiCz fixed assets. If the PV market were to continue to deteriorate or our PV products, including our HiCz tool, were to not generate significant sales in the future, we could be required to take further charges and they may be material. If our other business segments, polysilicon and sapphire, were to face the same conditions as our PV segment, we may be required to take significant impairment charges for these segments as well. Any future impairment charges may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, we may be unable to adequately and timely realign our cost structure with softening demand, which would also negatively impact our results. China has recently experienced decreased growth rates and certain of the solar and sapphire manufacturers in China, and in Asia generally, have been unwilling or unable to continue to invest in capital equipment purchases. The Chinese economy has experienced decreased growth. Since Chinese companies, including solar and LED producers, ship their products to Europe, the decreased growth experienced in China is due, in part we believe, to the adverse economic situation in Europe. The negative impact of this reduced rate of growth is compounded by the fact that the solar industry, including solar wafer, module and cell manufacturers and polysilicon manufacturers, have confronted markets that are either experiencing decreased demand or are generating more capacity than the industry requires, particularly in 2013. These market conditions are making it difficult for these companies to generate adequate returns and many such companies are not making any capital investments in their operations, which results in much lower demand for our equipment products. For several years, Chinese solar manufacturers relied on, we believe, easily available credit and companies were increasing rates of investment in capital equipment. These companies utilized these financial resources to build up their manufacturing capacity. We believe that Chinese companies have incurred some of the highest levels of debt in the solar industry. Now, however, in many cases, lenders to Chinese solar companies, in particular, are no longer extending credit on favorable terms, or at all. Some of this debt is maturing and certain of these companies are unlikely to be able to make payments when due. As a result, we expect that the demand for our equipment products will continue to remain limited for the short-term amongst our Chinese customer base (which are among our largest equipment customers). Also, it may be the case that customers with orders in our backlog are unable to accept delivery of our equipment or may re-negotiate terms, including requests for reduced prices, delayed delivery and decreases in the number of units shipped. Any of the foregoing would have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. These circumstances are making competition among equipment suppliers to sell to a limited number of purchasers very challenging. As competition increases, it may be the case that our competitors engage in business practices that we will not engage in (or are legally prohibited from engaging in) in order to gain business, including providing incentives or benefits that are prohibited under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Current or future credit and financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations in several ways. Over the past few years, financial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia experienced disruption, including, among other things, volatility in security prices, tightened liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others and increased bankruptcy filings by companies in a number of industries (including several companies in the solar industry). These economic developments adversely affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. The tightening of credit in financial markets for solar companies and sapphire companies has resulted 22 Table of Contents in reduced funding worldwide, including China (where many of our equipment customers are located), and a higher level of uncertainty for solar cell, wafer and module manufacturers and manufacturers incorporating sapphire material into their products. As a result, some of our equipment customers have been delayed in securing, or prevented from securing, funding adequate to honor their existing contracts with us or to enter into new contracts to purchase our equipment products. We believe a reduction in the availability of funding for new manufacturing facilities and facility expansions in the solar and sapphire industries, or reduction in demand for solar panels or sapphire material has caused, and may continue to cause, a decrease in orders for our products. We currently require most of our equipment customers to prepay a portion of the purchase price of their orders and/or to provide letters of credit prior to shipping equipment. We use these customer deposits to prepay our suppliers in order to reduce the need to borrow to cover our cash needs for working capital. This practice may not be sustainable if the recent market disruptions continue or grow worse. Some of our equipment customers who have become financially distressed have failed to provide letters of credit or make payments in accordance with the terms of their existing contracts. If customers fail to post letters of credit or make payments, and we do not agree to revised contract terms, it could have a significant impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The impact of these disruptions are increasingly being felt in China, and by certain of our customers which are located in China and other countries in Asia, and accounts in part for the decline in our total revenue and order backlog for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in the prior year. We may experience further revenue and backlog reductions in the future. Credit and financial market conditions may similarly affect our suppliers. We may lose advances we make to our suppliers in the event they become insolvent because our advances are not secured or backed by letters of credit. The inability of our suppliers to obtain credit to finance development or manufacture of our products could result in delivery delays or prevent us from delivering our products to our customers. Ongoing trade disputes with China may adversely impact the businesses of our Chinese customers, which could harm our business and our stock price. The current limited demand for our equipment products and the excess capacity in the end markets our equipment customers serve is exacerbated by trade tensions between China and the U.S. In October 2012, the U.S. Commerce Department issued a final ruling and levied anti-dumping duties on billions of dollars of solar panels and cells from China (and set countervailing duties as well). This final ruling has, we believe, negatively impacted our equipment customers in China and we expect that this effect will continue in the future. In July 2013, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce imposed preliminary anti-dumping duties on U.S. and Korean polysilicon makers, and for certain manufacturers these duties were above 50%. And in September 2013, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce imposed an additional 6.5% "anti-subsidy" trade duty, over and above the duty imposed in July 2013 on U.S. polysilicon companies who received government subsidies. In October 2013, an unfair trade suit was filed in the U.S. alleging price fixing of silicon (some of the named parties include our polysilicon customers). We believe that certain of our equipment customers are delaying any purchasing or expansion plans until these various trade matters are resolved and we do not expect such resolution to take place in the near term and, in fact, expect that they will grow more adversarial. While the E.U. approved a final settlement of an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation, retaliatory tariffs and trade tensions with China, on the one hand, and the U.S. and Europe (as well as South Korea, where some of our equipment customers are located) on the other hand, is causing uncertainty in the industry and is having a material adverse impact on our business since we sell into China and our equipment customers sell end products into Europe and the U.S. Our business and results of operations would be negatively affected if further anti-dumping or other duties were imposed or a trade war was to occur with China (or if the duties already imposed are not removed). In addition, we expect that any further 23 Table of Contents announcements about or imposition of duties by the U.S. government or E.U. on solar cells imported from China or relating to duties imposed on polysilicon manufacturers by the Chinese government or other governments (or similar actions) could negatively impact our stock price and may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Servicing our debt, including our repayment obligations to Apple, and other payment obligations requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt. Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations under the Prepayment Agreement with Apple (if not recouped through delivery of sapphire material) or our 2017 notes and 2020 notes and any other indebtedness depends on our future performance and available cash, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt, our other repayment obligations and/or make necessary capital expenditures (particularly if there were to be a default under either or all of the MDSA or the Prepayment Agreement, 2017 notes or 2020 notes that would accelerate the payments due thereunder). If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt or repayment obligations. Our Prepayment Agreement with Apple contains certain "trigger events" which would require that we repay the full amount advanced to us through such time, including "trigger events" related to maintaining adequate financial metrics such as cash holdings. Payment of these amounts may require the use of substantial amounts of our cash and if we do not have such cash (or cannot timely raise sufficient amounts) to make this payment, we would be in default, which would likely cause a cross default under our other debt obligations (including our convertible notes). Our obligation to repay the Prepayment Amount is secured by (i) the assets held by GT Equipment Holdings LLC (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the legal owner of the ASF systems and related equipment used in the Arizona facility) and (ii) a pledge of all of the equity interests of GT Equipment Holdings LLC. If Apple were to foreclose on such equity interests and/or equipment, our business and results of operations would be substantially harmed. If our customers delay or cancel equipment purchases, we may be required to modify or cancel contractual arrangements with our suppliers which may result in the loss of deposits or pre-paid advances, which losses have been significant in the past. As a result of our customer delays or contract terminations, we reschedule or cancel, from time to time, purchase orders with our vendors to procure materials and, in certain cases, we are required to forfeit deposits and/or reimburse the vendor for costs incurred to the date of termination plus predetermined profits. We have recorded significant losses resulting from rescheduled and/or canceled commitments to our vendors as a result of customer delays, contract modifications and terminations. For example, we expect to terminate purchase commitments for DSS inventory components in fiscal 2014 and beyond. The gross amount outstanding under the purchase orders was $10.2 million at December 31, 2013 and we will negotiate with our vendors to determine the amount payable upon termination. Certain of the vendors from whom we purchased materials have been unable to deliver the ordered components because economic conditions had an adverse impact on their ability to operate their businesses and we were unable to recover advances paid to those vendors for components that were not delivered and, in some cases, these lost advances were significant amounts. In cases where we are not able to cancel or modify vendor purchase orders due to customer delays or terminations, our purchase commitments may exceed our order backlog requirements and we may be unable to redeploy the undelivered equipment. In addition, we expect that we may be required to pay advances to vendors in the future without being able to recover that advance if the vendor is placed in bankruptcy, becomes insolvent or otherwise experiences financial distress. 24 Table of Contents Delays in deliveries, or cancellations of orders, for equipment products of all of our segments could cause us to have inventories in excess of our short-term needs and may delay our ability to recognize, or prevent us from recognizing, revenue on contracts in our order backlog. Alternatively, we may be required to sell products below our historical selling prices, which was the case for certain recent DSS equipment sales. Amounts included in our order backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits. Our order backlog is primarily based on signed purchase orders or other written contractual commitments. We cannot guarantee that our order backlog will result in actual revenue in the originally anticipated period, or at all. Beginning with the three-month period ended December 31, 2012, we undertook a process of identifying contracts in our order backlog that have not been terminated or modified but for which we expect that customers will not fulfill their obligations under the respective contacts (and we expect we will continue to undertake this process on a quarterly basis). During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2013, we terminated, modified or removed contracts from our backlog resulting in a $415.6 million reduction (96% of the reduction was attributable to four contracts, of which $33.1 million related to contracts that have not been legally terminated or modified). In addition, the contracts included in our order backlog may not generate margins equal to our historical operating margins. Our customers may experience project delays or default on the terms of their contracts with us as a result of external market factors and economic or other factors beyond our or their control. If a customer fails to perform its contractual obligations and we do not reasonably expect such customer to perform its obligations, we may terminate the contract, which would result in a decrease in our reported order backlog. In addition, our backlog is at risk to varying degrees to the extent customers request that we extend the delivery schedules and make other modifications under their contracts in our order backlog. Any contract modifications that we negotiate could likely include an extension of delivery dates, and could result in lower pricing or in a reduction in the number of units deliverable under the contract, thereby reducing our order backlog and resulting in lesser (or no) revenue recognized from such contracts or a delay in recognizing revenue. Our order backlog includes contracts with customers to whom we have sent notices of breach for failure to provide letters of credit or to make payments when due. If we cannot come to an agreement with these customers, it could result in a further reduction of our order backlog. Other customers may approach us with requests for delays in the future, or may fail to make payments when due, which could further reduce our order backlog. If our order backlog fails to result in revenue in a timely manner, or at all, we could experience a reduction in revenue, profitability and liquidity. Additionally, backlog is not a term recognized under United States generally accepted accounting principles; however, it is a common measurement that the management team uses in assessing our business and operations. Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by other companies. Additionally, we adjusted our methodology for determining backlog and expect that future presentation of backlog will exclude sapphire material backlog. Furthermore, as noted above, backlog is difficult to determine with certainty and it should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. We face competition in each of our business segments, and if our competitors are able to manufacture products that employ newer technologies or are otherwise more widely used than our products, and if we are unable to modify our products to adapt to such future changes, we may be unable to attract or retain customers. The PV energy and sapphire industries are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to increase their market share and new entrants strive to capture market share. In addition, the PV energy industry (which includes polysilicon and solar wafer, module and cell manufacturers) also has to compete with the larger conventional electric power industry. The PV 25 Table of Contents energy and sapphire industries are also rapidly evolving and are highly competitive. Particularly with respect to the solar cell industry, new technologies are leading to improvements in cell efficiencies and performance. Technological advances are, we believe, also resulting in lower manufacturing costs for these products. These developments may render existing products and/or product manufacturing equipment sold by our polysilicon, PV and sapphire businesses obsolete. We will therefore need to keep pace with technological advances in these industries in order to compete effectively in the future, which may require significant expenditures on research and development or investments in acquisition of other businesses and technologies. For example, our success in the sapphire equipment market depends on our ability to expand into new applications that are based on continued advancement in the design, manufacture and use of sapphire and LEDs (including sapphire and non-sapphire-based LEDs) and lighting technology by others, as well as the continued demand for sapphire in the LED market (while we believe sapphire is currently one of the preferred substrate materials for certain LED applications in certain markets, silicon substrates and substrates incorporating other materials in LED applications are being developed). In addition, we have agreed that we will no longer sell ASF systems for use in generating sapphire in certain select markets pursuant to our MDSA with Apple (so we will no longer be able to sell sapphire equipment into those certain markets). Our success in the PV market will depend, in part, on our success in commercializing our monocrystallization, or HiCz, technology offering and improving our DSS platform. Our failure to further refine our technologies and/or develop and introduce new solar power and sapphire products could cause our products to become uncompetitive or obsolete, which could adversely affect demand for our products, and our financial condition, results of operations, business and/or prospects. Many of our competitors, in each of our business segments, have, and future competitors may also have, substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and other resources than we do. These resources may provide our competitors with an advantage because they can realize economies of scale, synergies and purchase certain raw materials, commodities and key components at lower prices. Current and potential competitors of ours may also have greater brand name recognition, more established distribution networks and larger customer bases, and may be able to devote more resources to the research, development, promotion and sale of their products or to respond more quickly to evolving industry standards and changes in market conditions. In addition, given the ability of other parties to access our equipment, we also face low-cost competitors who may be able to offer similar products at very competitive prices. We may not be able to maintain our current share of the market in our respective business segments as competitive intensity increases and particularly as our customers are targeted by local low-cost competitors in China and other countries. In addition, these overall markets are shrinking as demand has dropped and/or capacity increased. We believe that certain PV customers have already begun purchasing our competitors' equipment and installing it in their facilities. Our efforts to capitalize on technological developments in the markets in which we operate, such as the HiCz, silicon carbide, HVPE and PVD tools, may not result in increased market share and require that we make substantial capital investments without any corresponding increase in revenues. In addition, customers may place orders to supply equipment for new facilities or future expansions with our competitors, and we believe the likelihood that our customers and others will go to competitors has increased over time. Our failure to adapt to changing market conditions and to compete successfully with existing or new competitors and/or new technological developments may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business and/or prospects. In relation to our polysilicon business, we are not the only provider of polysilicon production equipment to the market based on a Siemens-type CVD reactor design. Although we believe our SDR reactor to be re-designed and distinct from the competing products offered by our competitors, there can be no assurance that our SDR reactor will compete successfully with their products which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business and/or prospects. In addition, alternative technologies for producing polysilicon exist and, to the extent that they become more widely available, the demand for our SDR reactor may also be adversely affected. 26 Table of Contents Furthermore, we believe that companies that currently produce polysilicon for their internal use and consumption compete indirectly with our polysilicon business, as any increase in the supply of polysilicon may have an adverse effect of the demand for our SDR reactor. We intend to pursue business and technology acquisition and investment opportunities in the future as part of our business plan to grow and diversify our business and we expect that one or more of these acquisitions or investments will expand our product offerings into markets we have not previously served. Our business plan is focused on growing and diversifying our product and technology offerings. Acquiring Crystal Systems, a sapphire manufacturer, and licensing PVD technology, were part of this business plan to extend our offerings beyond polysilicon and PV markets. We expect that achieving these goals of growth and diversification will include the acquisition of businesses and technologies from third parties or investments in third parties (that may lead to future acquisitions or rights to technology) and expect that in the future we will continue to engage in negotiations for such acquisitions, investments, licenses or joint venture arrangements. In order to achieve our objective of diversifying our business to technologies outside of polysilicon, photovoltaic and sapphire, we expect that some of these acquisitions will be in markets or industries that may be unrelated to those markets we currently serve. This business diversification plan involves risks. Our stock may be valued differently depending on what markets we serve in the future. Diversification may also require significant resource commitments and time from our management, which will limit the amount of time these individuals will have available to devote to our existing operations. This diversification may also involve the complexities in managing an employee base that is already located in several different locations and in effectively deploying, operating and utilizing our internal systems, including those related to financial reporting, and other systems we depend on. We may also have very little experience in dealing with these new markets and products. Any failure or any inability to effectively manage and integrate new businesses and technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any amounts that we invest may not generate any returns for us and we could lose the entire amount of the investment. Finally, we may not be successful in acquiring any new businesses or technologies, despite our efforts to do so, and there can be no certainty that we will acquire any other companies or technologies that allow us to diversify. If we do not close acquisitions in accordance with our business plan or make successful investments, we may not be able to diversify revenue and our performance will be tied to the polysilicon, PV and sapphire equipment markets (as well as demand for sapphire material from Apple), and if any of these experience difficulties, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be negatively impacted. General economic conditions may have an adverse impact on demand for our equipment products and result in charges for excess or obsolete inventory. Purchasing our equipment products requires significant capital expenditures, and demand for such products is affected by general economic conditions. A downturn in the global construction market has reduced demand for solar panels in new residential and commercial buildings, which in turn reduces demand for our products that are used in the manufacture of PV wafers, cells and modules and polysilicon for the solar power industry (including our DSS units and SDR reactors). In addition, a downturn or lack of growth in the sapphire material market, and the sapphire-based LED and general illumination markets in particular, have resulted in reduced demand for our ASF systems. Uncertainties about economic conditions, negative financial news, potential defaults by or rating downgrades of debt issued by governmental entities and corporate entities, tighter credit markets and declines in asset values have, in the recent past, caused our customers to postpone or cancel making purchases of capital equipment and materials. We believe that increasing governmental budgetary pressures will likely result 27 Table of Contents in the reduction, or the elimination of, government subsidies and economic incentives for on-grid solar electricity applications. A prolonged downturn in the global economy, combined with decreased governmental incentives for solar power usage, would have a material adverse effect on our business in a number of ways, including decreased demand for our PV and polysilicon equipment products, which would result in lower sales, reduced backlog and contract terminations. Uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it challenging for us to: forecast demand for our equipment products and our operating results, make business decisions and identify the risks that may affect our business. For example, our equipment inventory balances had increased substantially recently and, during the three month period ended December 31, 2012, we determined that we were unable to deploy certain of our PV inventory and had to take a significant impairment charge. If our remaining PV inventory, or the inventory we have built up for polysilicon or sapphire equipment, cannot be sold or utilized in our operations and becomes excess or obsolete, we could be required to take another write down or multiple write downs and the amount or amounts may be material. If we are not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the difficult macroeconomic environment, including by maintaining appropriate inventory levels, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. Our success depends on the sale of a limited number of products. A significant portion of our operating profits has historically been derived from sales of DSS units, SDR reactors, hydrochlorination equipment and ASF units, which sales accounted for 80% of our revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. There can be no assurance that sales of this equipment will increase beyond, or be maintained at, past levels or that any sales of sapphire materials (or any other future product offering) will offset any decrease in sales of DSS furnaces, ASF systems, SDR reactors or hydrochlorination equipment (or result in any revenue). Additionally, we have already experienced decreased demand for all of our equipment products. In some cases, our products, such as the STC converters, are no longer sold due to changes in technology and drastically decreased demand. Further changes in technology may also, we expect, result in a further reduction in demand and likely decreased average selling prices. Many factors affecting the level of future sales of our products are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, demand for solar products and sapphire material (including sapphire-based LED material and sapphire use in general illumination and other applications), development and/or use of alternatives to sapphire in LED applications (including in general illumination) and competing product offerings by other equipment manufacturers. We may be unable to diversify our product offerings and thereby increase or maintain our revenue and/or maintain our profits (or limit our loss) in the event of a decline in ASF systems, DSS furnaces and SDR reactors sales. If sales of our PV, polysilicon or sapphire products continue to decline, our financial condition, results of operations, business and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected. We depend on a limited number of third party suppliers. We use certain component parts supplied by either a single or a small number of third party suppliers in our polysilicon, PV and sapphire equipment products and ancillary equipment and in our manufacture of sapphire material, and certain of these components are critical to the manufacture and operation of certain of our products. For example, we use specialist manufacturers to provide vessels and power supplies which are essential to the manufacture and operation of our polysilicon products. In addition, certain of our products consist entirely (or mostly) of parts and components supplied by third party suppliers, and in these instances filling orders depends entirely upon parties over which we exercise little or no control, and if these contractors were unable to supply, or refused to supply, the parts and components, we would be unable to complete orders which would have a negative impact on our reputation and our business. 28 Table of Contents Our sapphire materials business, as well as the customers for our ASF units, also depend on suppliers of raw materials and components that are utilized during the manufacturing process. For example, the supply of qualified meltstock and crucibles used to grow sapphire materials, as well as helium, is limited and we expect demand will increase as we sell more ASF units and as we expand our operations in Arizona, and as a result, there may be an insufficient availability of these items for our sapphire materials business and sapphire research and development as currently operated or available for the purchasers of our ASF systems, which would prevent us from growing our sapphire equipment and materials business. This risk is exacerbated as we intend to expand our sapphire materials business and will be requiring significantly more raw materials and components than in the past (and we could face monetary and other penalties under our sapphire material supply agreement if we are unable to deliver sapphire material pursuant to our supply arrangements with Apple). In addition, we will require our suppliers to our sapphire material business to deliver materials in a timely manner in order to meet our supply obligations and any delay in delivery may result in our failure to deliver that could result in a breach of our obligations under our agreement with Apple, which could result in significant penalties. Further, our agreements with raw material and equipment component suppliers are typically short term in nature, which leaves us vulnerable to the risk that our suppliers may change the terms on which they have previously supplied products to us or cease supplying products to us at any time and for any reason. There is no guarantee that we will maintain relationships with our existing suppliers or develop new relationships with other suppliers. We are also dependent on our suppliers to maintain the quality of the raw materials, components and equipment we use and if the quality were to be below our standards, our equipment offerings may not function as designed or our sapphire material may not meet the specifications required by Apple (which could result in significant monetary penalties). We may be unable to identify replacement or additional suppliers or qualify their products in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Raw materials and component parts supplied by new suppliers may also be less suited to our products than the raw materials and component parts supplied by our existing suppliers. Certain of the component parts used in our products have been developed, made or adapted specifically for us. Such parts are not generally available from other vendors and could be difficult or impossible to obtain elsewhere. As a result, there may be a significant time lag in securing an alternative source of supply. In addition, the inability of our suppliers to support our demand could be indicative of a market-wide scarcity of the materials, which could result in even longer interruptions in our ability to supply our products. We utilize raw materials in manufacturing our sapphire materials and all of our equipment and the prices for these materials fluctuate significantly and any increases in price or decrease in availability will harm our business. In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in the price of raw materials and commodities necessary in the manufacture of our products, such as graphite, steel, copper, helium and molybdenum. We experience similar commodity risks in connection with the consumable materials utilized in our equipment products, and in certain cases, there is very limited access to these commodities. We may not be able to pass along fluctuations in our costs of materials to our equipment customers or material customers. The increase in the price of these commodities, due to further limitations of availability or to greater demand, will make our products less attractive and will harm our sapphire material and all of our equipment businesses (and the margins we achieve in connection with the sale of sapphire materials may drop even further or may be negative). If we bring more entrants into the photovoltaic, polysilicon and sapphire markets through the sale of our equipment products, these commodity risks increase. Any significant increase in these prices would increase our expenses, decrease demand for our products and hurt our profitability (or prevent us from 29 Table of Contents being profitable). In addition, demand for our products will be negatively impacted if the prices of raw materials that are used to create polysilicon, PV materials and sapphire materials were to increase. Our failure to obtain sufficient raw materials, commodities, component parts for our equipment (or necessary to generate sapphire material) and/or third party equipment that meet our requirements in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms could interrupt or impair our ability to assemble our products, and may adversely impact our goal of expanding our business, as well as result in a loss of market share. Further, such failure may prevent us from delivering our products as required by the terms of our contracts with our customers (including our obligations to deliver sapphire material), and may harm our reputation and result in breach of contract and other claims being brought against us by our customers (including damages we could be required to pay if we fail to timely deliver sapphire material in accordance with specifications). Any changes to our current supply arrangements, whether to the terms of supply from existing suppliers or a change in our suppliers, may also increase our costs in a material amount. Conflict minerals disclosure regulations may force us to incur additional expenses, may result in damage to our business reputation and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. The SEC has adopted requirements for companies that use conflict minerals in their products. Some of these metals are commonly used in capital equipment, including our products. These new requirements will require companies to investigate, disclose and report whether or not such metals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. We have a complex supply chain for the components and parts used in each of our equipment products and in our sapphire material operations. We have numerous foreign suppliers, many of whom are not obligated by the new law to investigate their own supply chains. As a result, we may incur significant costs to comply with the diligence and disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant metals used in our products. In addition, because our supply chain is complex and has expanded due to our sapphire material operations, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origin of all the relevant metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures we implement, which may harm our business reputation. We may also face difficulties in satisfying our equipment and sapphire material customers if they require that we prove or certify that our products are "conflict free." Key components and parts that can be shown to be "conflict free" may not be available to us in sufficient quantity, or at all, or may only be available at significantly higher cost to us. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, customers may discontinue purchasing from us. Any of these outcomes could adversely impact our business, financial condition or operating results. The prices for polysilicon and sapphire material, as well as silicon ingots, have, in the past, dropped as a result of either increased supply or decreased demand, and, at the same time, the prices for the inputs to create this output has either remained consistent or increased, which has resulted in decreased margins for polysilicon and sapphire and PV manufacturers, and if these circumstances were to continue or grow worse the demand for our PV, polysilicon and sapphire equipment business would be negatively impacted. The prices for polysilicon, sapphire and PV materials have decreased due, in part, to either excess supply or decreasing demand for these materials. At certain times, these price drops were accompanied by an increase in the costs (or the costs have remained stable) for the consumable materials that are used in our equipment to make polysilicon, sapphire boules and PV ingots and wafers. These two factors, operating in tandem, result in decreased margins for the manufacturers selling polysilicon, sapphire boules and PV ingots and wafers, and, depending on circumstances, could result in negative margins. If this situation were to persist, we would expect that the demand for our polysilicon reactors, ASF units and our PV equipment and sapphire material would drop and may hamper the adoption of any new technologies we introduce (including our HiCz equipment offering which is in development). 30 Table of Contents The on-going global economic uncertainty and tightened credit markets may exacerbate these circumstances. We may face product liability claims and/or claims in relation to third party equipment. It is possible that our equipment and materials products could result in property damage and/or personal injury (or death), whether due to product malfunctions, defects, improper use or installation or other causes. We cannot predict whether or not product liability claims will be brought against us or the effect of any resulting negative publicity on our business, which may include the loss of existing customers, failure to attract new customers and a decline in sales. The successful assertion of product liability claims against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages being payable by us, and we may not have adequate resources to satisfy any judgment against us. Furthermore, it may be difficult or impossible to determine whether any damage or injury was due to product malfunction, operator error, failure of the product to be operated and maintained in accordance with our specifications or the failure of the facility in which our equipment products are used to comply with the facility specifications provided to our customers or other factors beyond our control. For example, one of our significant equipment customers experienced chamber leakage involving a number of DSS units in its facilities which we believe was the result of their facility failing to conform to specifications. We nonetheless agreed to replace certain chambers at our cost. Other customers may experience similar issues in the future as a result of product defects, facilities not complying with specifications or other reasons. To date, we have not received any product liability or other claims with respect to these or any other accidents. In addition, we have provided third party equipment in connection with our equipment product sales (or incorporated third party components into our equipment offerings). There can be no guarantee that such third party equipment will function in accordance with our intended or specified purpose or that the customer's personnel, in particular those who are inexperienced in the use of the specialized equipment sold by us, will be able to correctly install and operate it, which may result in the return of products and/or product liability or similar claims by the customer against us. In the event of a claim against us due to third party equipment, we may be unable to recover all or any of our loss from the third party equipment or component provider. The bringing of any product liability claims against us, whether ultimately successful or not, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business and/or prospects. Our future success depends on our management team and on our ability to attract and retain key technical employees and to integrate new employees into our management team successfully. We are dependent on the services of our management team and our technical personnel. Although certain members of our management team are subject to agreements with us, any and all of them may choose to terminate their employment with us on thirty or fewer days' notice. The loss of any member of the management team could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business and/or prospects. There is a risk that we will not be able to retain or replace these or other key employees. Integrating new employees into our management team could prove disruptive to our daily operations, require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention and ultimately prove unsuccessful. In addition, we are implementing succession planning measures for our management, key staff and skilled employees. However, if we fail to successfully implement these succession plans for management and key staff when necessary, our operating results would likely be harmed. We also depend on our technical personnel to grow our business. Recruiting and retaining capable personnel, particularly those with expertise in the polysilicon, PV and the sapphire industry, is vital to our success. There is substantial competition for qualified technical personnel, and qualified personnel are currently, and for the foreseeable future are likely to remain, a limited resource. Locating 31 Table of Contents candidates with the appropriate qualifications can be costly, time-consuming and difficult. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract new, or retain existing, technical personnel. We may need to provide higher compensation or increased training to our personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, or are required to change the terms on which our personnel are employed, our financial condition, results of operations, business and/or prospects may be materially adversely affected. In addition, we expect that we will need to hire a significant number of employees to operate our expanded sapphire material operations in Arizona, and, if we are unable to hire sufficient qualified personnel, our sapphire materials business could be harmed and we may be unable to deliver sapphire material as required by our customer which may result in monetary penalties and a breach under our contractual commitments. We have spent significant amounts of money to acquire and develop new technologies and these technologies may not gain market acceptance. We have expended significant financial resources and technical expertise in developing new products and services to improve our product portfolio. These investments, however, may not result in increased revenues and may require that we incur expenses that result in decreasing our cash balances. For example, we have already spent in excess of $60 million as of December 31, 2013 (and may have additional significant capital spending) in connection with our acquisition of Confluence Solar, which provided technology for our HiCz tool which has been designed to produce high efficiency monocrystalline solar ingots and lower PV production costs. In addition, we have purchased certain select assets and intellectual property from a third party related to the Hyperion ion implant technology and have invested significant amounts in our internal research and development efforts for other technologies, including silicon carbide growth technologies. The Hyperion ion implantation and HVPE technology development efforts, which are among the proposed new product offerings we are in the process of developing, require that we expend significant cash and time resources. If we are not successful in commercializing one or more of these new product lines, we would lose the significant investments we made in our internal development efforts and in the acquisitions we have made. In addition, certain of these proposed products, such as the Hyperion ion implantation tool, may take years to bring to market and we may be unable to timely generate revenue from these projects, if we are able to generate any revenue at all. We also have no experience in manufacturing and selling HiCz equipment, the Hyperion ion implantation equipment, silicon carbide manufacturing equipment, HVPE and PVD equipment, and we may be unable to commercialize these products or ensure they gain wide-spread market acceptance. We may also have issues with installing these products in customer facilities or in training customers to properly operate this equipment, which would likely prevent us from recognizing revenue on sales of this equipment. If we are unable to bring any of these products to market and generate substantial sales, we may be unable to recover any or all of the investments we have made in them. Given the pace of technological advancements in the PV equipment industry, it is possible that monocrystalline production may not gain meaningful market share as other companies develop products that generate solar cells offering even higher efficiency. Alternatively, there are competing monocrystalline production techniques that may result in a more efficient solar wafer and/or equipment that can make comparable quality silicon at equipment prices below what we charge or at which our equipment makes ingots. We face similar challenges and competition with respect to any ion implantation, silicon carbide or other equipment product we may bring to market. Any of the foregoing would have a significant and negative impact on our business and results of operation. 32 Table of Contents We may be unable to protect our intellectual property adequately and may be required to initiate litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights. Our ability to compete effectively against our competitors in the PV, polysilicon and sapphire markets will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our current and future proprietary technologies, product designs, product uses and manufacturing processes under relevant intellectual property laws including, but not limited to, laws relating to patents and trade secrets. We own various patents and patent applications in the United States and other countries relating to our products, product uses and manufacturing processes. To the extent that we rely on patent protection, our patents may provide only limited protection for our technology and may not be sufficient to provide competitive advantages to us. For example, competitors could develop similar or more advantageous technologies or design around our patents or otherwise employ alternative products, equipment or processes that may successfully compete with our products and technology. In addition, patents are of limited duration. Any issued patents may also be challenged, invalidated or declared unenforceable. If our patents are challenged, invalidated or declared unenforceable, other companies will be better able to develop products that compete with ours, which could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition. Further, we may not have, or be able to obtain, effective patent protection in all of our key sales territories. Our patent applications may not result in issued patents and, even if they do result in issued patents, the patents may not include rights of the scope that we seek. The patent position of technology-oriented companies, including ours, is uncertain and involves complex legal and factual considerations. Accordingly, we do not know what degree of protection we will obtain from our proprietary rights or the breadth of the claims allowed in patents issued to us or to others. Further, given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important to our business. Third parties may infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our proprietary technologies, product designs, manufacturing processes and our intellectual property rights therein, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business and/or prospects. For example, we have filed a lawsuit in the Hillsborough County Superior Court (Southern District) in New Hampshire against Advanced Renewable Energy Company, LLC ("ARC"), Kedar Gupta, its Chief Executive Officer and Chandra Khattak, an ARC employee, for the misappropriation of trade secrets relating to sapphire crystallization processes and equipment. Because the laws and enforcement mechanisms of various countries that we seek protection in may not allow us to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, the strength of our intellectual property rights will vary from country to country. Litigation to prevent, or seek compensation for such infringement, misappropriation or other violation, such as the ARC lawsuit described above, may be costly and may divert management attention and other resources away from our business without any guarantee of success. Further, we conduct significant amounts of business in China, yet enforcement of Chinese intellectual property related laws (including trade secrets) has historically been weak, primarily because of ambiguities in Chinese laws and difficulties in enforcement. Accordingly, the intellectual property rights and confidentiality protections available to us in China may not be as effective as in the United States or other countries. We also rely upon proprietary manufacturing expertise, continuing technological innovation and other know-how or trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. While we generally enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property, such confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements could be breached and are limited, in some instances, in duration and may not provide meaningful protection for the trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise that we hold. We have had in the past and may continue to have certain of our employees terminate their employment with us to work for one of our customers or competitors. Adequate or timely remedies may not be available in the event of misappropriation, unauthorized use or disclosure of our manufacturing expertise, technological 33 Table of Contents innovations and trade secrets. In addition, others may obtain knowledge of our manufacturing expertise, technological innovations and trade secrets through independent development or other legal means and, in such cases, we may not be able to assert any trade secret rights against such a party. We may face claims in relation to the infringement or misappropriation of third-party intellectual property rights. We may be subject to claims that our products, technologies, processes or product uses infringe the intellectual property rights of others. These claims, even if meritless, could be expensive and time consuming to defend. In addition, if we are not successful in our defense of such claims, we could be subject to injunctions and/or damages, or be required to enter into licensing arrangements requiring royalty payments and/or use restrictions. In some instances, licensing arrangements may not be available to us or, if available, may not be available on acceptable terms. Due to the competitive nature of the industries in which we participate, we may face potential claims by third parties of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of such third parties' intellectual property rights. From time to time we have received and may in the future receive notices or inquiries from other companies suggesting that we may be infringing their patents or misappropriating their intellectual property rights. Such notices or inquiries may, among other things, threaten litigation against us. Furthermore, the issuance of a patent to us does not guarantee that we have the right to practice the patented invention. Third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from marketing our own patented product and practicing our own patented technology. In addition, third parties could allege that our products and processes make use of their unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise and/or trade secrets, whether in breach of confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements or otherwise. If an action for infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of third party rights were successfully brought against us, we may be required to cease our activities on an interim or permanent basis and could be ordered to pay compensation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business and/or prospects. Additionally, if we are found to have willfully infringed certain intellectual property rights of another party, we may be subject to treble damages and/or be required to pay the other party's attorney's fees. Alternatively, we may need to seek to obtain a license of the third party's intellectual property rights or trade secrets, which may not be available, whether on reasonable terms or at all, and such technology may be licensed to other parties thereby limiting any competitive advantage to us. In addition, any litigation required to defend such claims brought by third parties may be costly and may divert management attention and other resources away from our business, without any guarantee of success. Moreover, we may also not have adequate resources to devote to our business in the event of a successful claim against us. From time to time, we hire personnel who have obligations to preserve the secrecy of confidential information and/or trade secrets of their former employers. Some former employers monitor compliance with these obligations. While we have policies and procedures in place that are intended to guard against the risk of breach by our employees of confidentiality obligations to their former employers, there can be no assurance that a former employer of one or more of our employees will not allege a breach and seek compensation for alleged damages. If such a former employer were to successfully bring such a claim, our know-how and/or skills base could be restricted and our ability to produce certain products and/or to continue certain business activities could be affected, to the detriment of our financial condition, results of operations, business and/or prospects. The international nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks, including unfavorable political, regulatory, labor and tax conditions in foreign countries. We have substantial marketing and distribution operations that take place outside the United States, primarily in China, and much of our historical sales are to customers outside the United States. 34 Table of Contents We also have contracts with customers in Europe and expect that we may recognize revenue from sales to customers in Asia and Europe and the Middle East in the future. In addition, we have transitioned our global operations center to Hong Kong, further increasing our exposure to the risks of operating in Asia. As a result, we are subject to the legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions other than the United States. Risks inherent to maintaining international operations, include, but are not limited to, the following: trade disputes between the United States and countries where we deliver our products to our customers, as well as trade disputes between countries in which our equipment customers manufacture and those countries in which our customers sell end-products, including their sales of polysilicon, solar wafers, cells and modules, and sapphire materials produced with our furnaces or reactors, which could result in government or trade organization actions that have the effect of increasing the price for our and our customers' products which would have a corresponding decrease in the demand for our products; withholding taxes or other taxes on our foreign income, and tariffs or other restrictions on foreign trade and investment, including currency exchange controls imposed by or in other countries; the inability to obtain, maintain or enforce intellectual property rights in other jurisdictions, at a reasonable cost or at all; difficulty with staffing and managing widespread and growing international operations; complying with regulatory and legal requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate and sell products; effectively operating and maintaining our internal controls and financial reporting processes across multiple countries; trade barriers such as export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and expenses, which could increase the prices of our products and make our product offering less competitive in some countries; and establishing ourselves and becoming tax resident in foreign jurisdictions. Our business in foreign markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries. Our overall success as a global business depends, in part, on our ability to succeed under differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop, implement and maintain policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business. As a result of any of the foregoing factors, our financial condition, results of operations, business and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected. We are a global corporation with significant operations in Asia, and challenges by various tax authorities to our global operations could, if successful, increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our earnings. We are a Delaware corporation that operates through various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world, including in Asia. We established our global operations center in Hong Kong and have significant operations in Asia. Our income taxes are based upon the applicable tax laws, treaties, and regulations in the many countries in which we operate and earn income as well as upon our operating structures in these countries. While we believe that we carefully analyze and account for the tax risks and uncertainties under the applicable rules, multiple tax authorities could contend that a greater portion of our and our subsidiaries' income should be subject to income or other tax in their respective jurisdictions. If successful, these challenges could result in an increase to our effective tax rate. In addition, if we continue to generate revenue in higher tax jurisdictions, as was the case during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2012, our effective tax rate may continue to increase. 35 Table of Contents We continue to monitor the impact of various international tax proposals and interpretations of the tax laws and treaties in the countries where we operate, including those in the United States, China, Hong Kong, and other countries. If enacted, certain changes in tax laws, treaties, regulations, or their interpretation could result in a higher tax rate on our earnings, which could result in a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flow from operations. Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards may be limited. As of December 31, 2013, the Company had net operating losses of approximately $191 million of which approximately $86 million are in the US and approximately $105 million are in foreign jurisdictions. The losses in the US may be carried back two years or carried forward 20 years and if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2033. The losses in foreign jurisdictions may be carried forward indefinitely. To the extent available, we intend to use these net operating loss carryforwards to reduce the U.S. and international corporate income tax liability associated with our operations. The U.S. Internal Revenue Code, however, generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income in certain cases. To the extent our use of net operating loss carryforwards is significantly limited, our income subject to U.S. or international corporate income tax could be higher than it would if we were able to use net operating loss carryforwards, which could result in lower profits. If we repatriate any cash and cash equivalents from our foreign subsidiaries back to the U.S., we could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Our foreign subsidiaries held, as of December 31, 2013, $76.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. We currently intend that cash and cash equivalents held by these foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions in order to fund working capital requirements and repay debt (primarily inter-company) and, in the event we were to undertake certain strategic initiatives, we may use this cash for such strategic initiatives (such as investment, expansion and acquisitions) of our foreign subsidiaries. Moreover, we do not currently intend to repatriate cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries to the United States because our cash and cash equivalents held in the United States are currently sufficient to fund the cash needs of our operations in the United States and our plans to deploy cash by our subsidiaries. However, if, in the future, cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries are needed to fund our operations in the United States or for the purpose of making certain strategic investments in the United States or otherwise, the repatriation of such amounts to the United States would result in a significant incremental tax liability in the period in which the decision to repatriate occurs. Payment of any incremental tax liability would reduce the cash available to us to fund our operations by the amount of taxes paid and would have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Compliance with the legal systems of the countries in which we offer and sell our products could increase our cost of doing business. We offer and sell our products internationally, including in some emerging markets. As a result, we are and/or may become subject to the laws, regulations and legal systems of the various jurisdictions in which we carry on business and/or in which our customers or suppliers are located. Among the laws and regulations applicable to our business are health and safety and environmental regulations, which vary from country to country and from time to time. We must therefore design our products and ensure their manufacture so as to comply with all applicable standards. Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, including compliance with any change in existing legal and regulatory requirements, may cause us to incur material costs and may be difficult, impractical or impossible. In addition, China's legal system, where we do a significant amount of business, is rapidly evolving and, as a result, the interpretation and enforcement of many laws (including intellectual property laws), regulations and 36 Table of Contents rules are not always uniform and legal proceedings in China often involve uncertainties and legal protections afforded are uncertain and may be limited. In addition, any litigation brought by or against us in China may be protracted and may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention and the anticipated outcome would be highly uncertain. Accordingly, foreign laws and regulations which are applicable to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business and/or prospects. As a result of the procedural requirements or laws of the foreign jurisdictions in which we carry on business and/or in which our customers or suppliers are located, we may experience difficulty in enforcing supplier or customer agreements or certain provisions thereof, including, for example, the limitations on the product warranty we typically include in our equipment sales contracts. In some jurisdictions, enforcement of our rights may not be commercially practical in light of the duration, cost and unpredictability of such jurisdiction's legal system. Any inability by us to enforce, or any difficulties experienced by us in enforcing, our contractual rights in foreign jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business and/or prospects. We are subject to export restrictions and laws affecting trade and investments, and the future sale of our products may be further limited or prohibited in the future by a government agency or authority. As a global company headquartered in the United States, our products and services are subject to U.S. laws and regulations that may limit and/or restrict or require a license to export (and re-export from other countries) some of our products, services and related product and technical information. We are also subject to the export and import laws of those foreign jurisdictions to which we sell or from which we re-export our products. Compliance with these laws and regulations could significantly limit our operations and our sales in the future and failure to comply, even indirectly, could result in a range of penalties, including restrictions on exports of all of our products for a specified time period, or forever, and severe monetary penalties. In certain circumstances, these restrictions may affect our ability to interact with our foreign subsidiaries and otherwise limit our trade with third parties (including vendors and customers) operating inside and outside the U.S. In addition, as we introduce new products, we may need to obtain licenses or approvals from the US and other governments to ship them into foreign countries. Failure to receive the appropriate approvals may mean that our development efforts (and expenses related to such development) may not result in any revenue, particularly as most of our customers are located in foreign jurisdictions. This would have a material and adverse impact on our business and our development efforts. In addition, certain customers of our sapphire materials business operate in the defense sector or are subcontractors of companies in the defense industry, and our products may be incorporated in, among other things, missiles, military aircraft and aerospace systems. In addition, Crystal Systems has received funding from the U.S. government in connection with certain research work for certain U.S. government agencies. Certain work performed pursuant to certain of these contracts is not commercially available, but we may make it available commercially in the future. The State Department, the Commerce Department or other government agencies may, however, determine that our sapphire material or other products, including our ASF systems, PV furnaces and/or polysilicon reactors, are important to the military potential of the U.S. If so, we may be subject to more stringent export licensing requirements or prohibited from selling certain of our sapphire materials (for certain applications or end uses), ASF systems, PV furnaces and/or polysilicon reactors to any customer outside the U.S. or to customers in certain jurisdictions. The U.S. government has, and will likely continue to, vigorously enforce these laws in light of continuing security concerns. If the export or sale of any of our current or future products outside the U.S. are limited or restricted by the U.S. government or any foreign government, our operations and results of operations would be negatively impacted. 37 Table of Contents We face particular political, market, commercial, jurisdictional and legal risks associated with our business in China. We have had significant equipment sales in China. Further, we have significant facilities and operations in China. Accordingly, our financial condition, results of operations, business and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected by economic, political and legal conditions or developments in China. In November 2012, China selected a new leadership group to run the government of the country. In China, the government has significant impact on what industries will receive financial and government assistance. At this point, the new government's economic priorities are unclear, but it may be the case that they will not be supportive of alternative energy industries, such as solar manufacturing, or of sapphire manufacturing. The Chinese government is able to exercise such control through its direct control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that may be applicable to us. In addition, a substantial portion of the productive assets in China remain government owned. The Chinese government also exercises significant control over Chinese economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. If the solar and/or sapphire industries are not a priority, our customers may have a difficult time expanding their operations and may have difficulty continuing their operations (particularly if direct and indirect financial support for our customers is reduced). This would have a negative impact on all of our business segments and, we expect, our results of operations. Any factors that result in slower (or decreased) growth in China could result in decreased capital expenditures by solar and sapphire product manufacturers, which in turn could reduce demand for our equipment products. Additionally, China has historically adopted laws, regulations and policies which impose additional restrictions on the ability of foreign companies to conduct business in China or otherwise place them at a competitive disadvantage in relation to domestic companies. Any adverse change in economic conditions or government policies in China could have a material adverse effect on our overall growth and therefore have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects. We have a presence in China, including in the areas of customer service, certain manufacturing services, administrative functions, sales and research and development. As we adopt a greater presence in China, we will be increasingly exposed to the economic, political and legal conditions and developments in China, which could further exacerbate these risks, including the risk that we may not be able to obtain adequate legal protection in connection with any technological developments resulting from our research and development conducted in China. We have entered into business combinations and acquisitions that may be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, expose us to litigation or unknown liabilities, dilute stockholder value and divert management attention. In the past we have entered into, and may in the future enter into business combinations or purchases. Acquisitions and combinations are accompanied by a number of risks, including the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired company, disruption of our ongoing business, distraction of management, expenses related to the acquisition and potential unknown liabilities and claims associated with acquired businesses. We may be subject to (i) liability for activities of the acquired company prior to the acquisition, including environmental and tax and other known and unknown liabilities and (ii) litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims brought by terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties. 38 Table of Contents In addition, there may, in particular, be risks and uncertainties in connection with the intellectual property rights and ownership of technology of an acquired company or any assets we may acquire, including (i) the nature, extent and value of the intellectual property and technology assets of an acquired company (or of the acquired assets), (ii) the rights that an acquired company (or company selling assets) has to utilize intellectual property and technology that it claims to have developed, acquired or to have licensed, and (iii) actions by third parties against the acquired company (or company selling assets) for intellectual property and technology infringement and the extent of the potential loss relating thereto. Third parties may also be more likely to assert claims against the acquired company (or acquired assets), including claims for breach of intellectual property rights, once the company or assets have been acquired by us. Any inability to integrate completed acquisitions or combinations in an efficient and timely manner or the inability to properly assess and utilize the intellectual property and technology portfolio without infringing the rights of a third party could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to recognize any expected synergies or benefits in connection with an acquisition, combination or asset purchase or we may be unable to effectively implement the business plan for the acquired company or assets, which would prevent us from achieving our financial and business goals for the business. If we are not successful in completing acquisitions or combinations that we may pursue in the future, we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a successful result. In addition, future acquisitions could require use of substantial portions of our available cash or result in the incurrence of debt or dilutive issuances of securities. If we were to incur additional debt in the future in connection with an acquisition, or otherwise, it may contain covenants restricting our future activities, may incur significant interest rates or penalties for breach and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash to pay the principal or interest. Also, any issuance of equity securities may be dilutive. Acquisitions and combinations also frequently require the acquiring company to recognize significant amounts of intangible assets, such as goodwill, patents and trademarks and customer lists, in an acquisition, which amounts may be subject to a future impairment if we are unable to successfully implement the operating strategy for the acquired company or acquired assets. We may, in the future, make investments in third party businesses or enter into joint development or similar agreements with third parties and these may require significant expenses and may not result in any technological or financial benefits. We may in the future enter into arrangements in which we invest in another business without owning all of the voting control of the entity or without the ability to control the decision-making of the entity or we may enter into joint development or similar arrangements for the development of technology or sale of products. We have entered into a joint development agreement with respect to HVPE equipment. Investments of this nature can require a significant commitment of our time, attention, cash and financial resources and technology sharing. If we do not have a controlling stake in these companies, it is likely that such entities may make their own business decisions that may not always align with our interests. In addition, some of the entities that we invest in, or enter into development projects with, will very likely have the right to manufacture or distribute their own products or certain products of our competitors. If we are unable to provide an appropriate mix of incentives to the companies that we invest in or in which we enter joint venture or similar arrangements, these other parties, through a combination of pricing and marketing and advertising support or otherwise, may take actions that, while maximizing their own short-term profits, may be detrimental to us or our brands, or they may devote more of their energy and resources to business opportunities or products other than those that generate a return for us. Such actions could, in the long run, have an adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, these types of investments may 39 Table of Contents not ultimately generate the returns that we expect when we entered into the arrangements, which could result in a decrease in our anticipated liquidity and loss of our entire investment. Our ability to supply a sufficient number of products to meet demand could be severely hampered by natural disasters or other catastrophes. Currently, a portion of our operations are located in Asia and we increased our presence in Asia with our global operations center in Hong Kong. Additionally, a significant portion of our revenue is generated from customers that install our equipment in Asia and many of our suppliers are also located in Asia. In addition, we will have a sapphire material manufacturing operation at one location in Arizona. These areas are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, drought and hazardous weather conditions. A significant catastrophic event such as earthquakes, floods, war, acts of terrorism or global threats, including, but not limited to, the outbreak of epidemic disease, could disrupt our operations and impair distribution of our products, damage inventory or facilities, interrupt critical functions, cause our suppliers to be unable to meet our demand for parts and equipment, reduce demand for our products, prevent our customers from honoring their contractual obligations to us or otherwise affect our business negatively. Any event that is significantly disruptive to the critical operations, such as our power supply, could impact our ability to meet our supply obligations under our sapphire materials contracts. To the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or our inability to fill orders (particularly to meet our obligations to provide sapphire material to our customer that purchases sapphire from our Arizona facility), causes cancellations of customer orders, or results in our inability to manufacture or ship our products, we may not be excused from performance under our supply or equipment agreements and our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Our level of indebtedness may limit our financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2013, our total consolidated indebtedness was approximately $456 million (which amount excludes the portion of our 2017 notes and 2020 notes allocated to the respective conversion features, and the debt discount on the Apple prepayment amount, both of which must also be repaid), or approximately $659 million after giving effect to the conversion features and debt discount described above. Our unrestricted cash was approximately $498 million at December 31, 2013. Our level of indebtedness affects our operations in several ways, including the following: a portion of our cash flows from operating activities must be used to service our indebtedness or our repayment obligations and is not available for other purposes; we may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to similar companies that have less debt; the covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness and future indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow additional funds, pay dividends and make certain investments and may also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry; and additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes may have higher costs and more restrictive covenants, or may not be available to us. Many of these factors are beyond our control. Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock, convertible debt or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions, the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital. In addition, our failure to comply with the financial and other covenants relating to our indebtedness (or Prepayment Agreement) could result in a default under that indebtedness (or Prepayment Agreement) and acceleration of amounts due, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 40 Table of Contents We may face significant warranty claims. All of our equipment and materials are sold with warranties. The warranty for our equipment is typically provided on a repair or replace basis, and is not limited to products or parts manufactured by us. As a result, we bear the risk of warranty claims on all products we supply, including equipment and component parts manufactured by third parties. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in claiming under any warranty or indemnity provided to us by our suppliers or vendors in the event of a successful warranty claim against us by a customer or that any recovery from such vendor or supplier would be adequate. There is a risk that warranty claims made against us will exceed our warranty reserve and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business and/or prospects. We have been subject to securities class action lawsuits. Potential similar or related litigation could result in substantial damages and may divert management's time and attention from our business. In 2008, the Company, its directors and certain affiliates were defendants in class action suits that alleged certain violations under various sections of the Securities Act of 1933, in connection with our initial public offering. In March 2011, these class actions were settled and we were required to pay $10.5 million into a settlement fund. Of this amount, we contributed $1.0 million and our liability insurers contributed the remaining $9.5 million. Our contribution represented the contractual indemnification obligation to the underwriters. As a publicly traded company, we may be subject to additional lawsuits relating to violations of the securities laws. Any such litigation would be expensive, time consuming to defend and, if we were unsuccessful in defending such claims, could result in the payments of significant sums. We do maintain insurance, but the coverage may not be sufficient and may not be available in all instances. Interpretations of existing accounting standards or the application of new standards could affect our revenue recognition and other accounting policies, which could have an adverse effect on the way we report our operating results. Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretations by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various other organizations formed to promulgate and interpret accounting principles. A change in these accounting principles or their interpretations could affect the reporting of transactions that were completed before the announcement of a change in principles or interpretations. As noted in Note 2 to our financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, under the current revenue guidance, for arrangements containing products considered to be "established," the majority of our revenue is recognized upon delivery of the product. For arrangements containing products considered to be "new," or containing customer acceptance provisions that are deemed more than perfunctory, revenue is recorded upon customer acceptance. If we make incorrect estimates or judgments in applying our revenue recognition policies, for example, if we incorrectly classify a product as "established" when it should have been "new," it may impact the timing of recognizing that revenue and may result in failing to meet guidance provided by us or require that we restate our prior financial statements. Additional errors in applying estimates or judgments in accounting policies may also adversely impact our operating results and may, in certain cases, require us to restate prior financial statements. If we are unable to adopt and implement adequate data security procedures, we could lose valuable proprietary information, third parties may be able to access information about our operations and employee data, any of the foregoing may harm our reputation and our results of operations. While we have implemented data security measures, a third party may gain unauthorized access to our servers, laptops or employee mobile devices. We store our important proprietary information on 41 Table of Contents our servers, including equipment specifications, and our employees may access this data remotely. This information is also shared via e-mail and we rely on industry standard encryption tools for transmitting data (which has been attacked in the past). If a competitor were able to access this information, we would lose the competitive advantages we believe we have and we could also lose the benefits that are or could be realized from our research and development efforts. Access to this information may be the result of a third-party by-passing our security measures, third-party encryption tools not providing adequate protection or inadvertent error by an employee that results in this information being accessed by unauthorized users. In addition, if a third party were to access our databases they may access sensitive business information about our operations in Mesa, including manufacturing output. In addition, the risks of unintended disclosure of information, proprietary or otherwise, following an acquisition is increased until such time as we can implement proper protection measures at the acquired sites. During the time, prior to implementing safeguards, third parties may be able to obtain information about the acquired entity or about our business technology and operations. Some of our servers containing our proprietary and confidential product and customer information are located in foreign jurisdictions, such as China and Hong Kong, and the governments in these jurisdictions may be able to access, review, retain and use the information contained on these servers without any legal recourse on our part or the right to compensation. Finally, we also store financial reporting information and employee data on our computer systems. If our financial information were tampered with, the results we report may not be accurate and/or we may be required to re-state previous released financial results and investors could lose confidence in our reported financial results. If our employee information were accessed, our employees may lose confidence in our operations, we may confront challenges attracting new employees and may face government penalties if we were found to have taken inadequate measures to protect employee information. We could be adversely affected by violations of applicable anti-corruption laws or violations of our internal policies designed to ensure ethical business practices. We operate in a number of countries throughout the world, including in countries that do not have as strong a commitment to anti-corruption and ethical behavior that is required by U.S. laws or by corporate policies. We are subject to the risk that we, our U.S. employees or our employees located in other jurisdictions or any third parties that we engage to do work on our behalf in foreign countries may take action determined to be in violation of anti-corruption laws in any jurisdiction in which we conduct business, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (or the "FCPA"). In addition, we operate in certain countries in which the government may take an ownership stake in an enterprise and such government ownership may not be readily apparent (thereby increasing potential FCPA violations). Any violation of the FCPA or any similar anti-corruption law or regulation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions and might adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, we have internal ethics policies that we require our employees to comply with in order to ensure that our business is conducted in a manner that our management deems appropriate. If these anti-corruption laws or internal policies were to be violated, our reputation and operations could also be substantially harmed. Further, detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management. The market for polysilicon has been cyclical, resulting in periods of insufficient or excess production capacity and could result in variation in demand for our products. The market for polysilicon has been cyclical. In the recent past, polysilicon supply had increased due principally to expansion by existing manufacturers. This factor, among others, resulted in increased supply and declining prices in polysilicon. An excess in production capacity for polysilicon has, and in 42 Table of Contents the future may, adversely affect demand for our SDR reactors. There can be no certainty that the increased demand during the periods of expansion in polysilicon manufacturing capacity will persist for an extended period of time, or at all. A lack of demand for our SDR reactors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business and/or prospects. Conversely, if there are shortages of polysilicon in the future, the PV industry may be unable to continue to grow and/or may decline, and, as a result, demand for our PV products may decrease or may be eliminated. We license and do not own certain components of the technology underlying our SDR reactor and STC converter products. Certain components of the technology underlying our SDR reactor and STC converter products are not owned by us, but are licensed under a ninety-nine year license agreement that could be terminated in the event of a material breach by us of such agreement that remains uncured for more than thirty days, or upon our bankruptcy or insolvency. To the extent such components are deemed to be incorporated into our current or future products, any termination of our rights to use such technology could have a material adverse effect on our ability to offer our polysilicon products and therefore on our financial condition, results of operations, business and/or prospects if we were unable to secure these rights in a different manner or from an alternative arrangement. Government subsidies and economic incentives for on-grid solar electricity applications could be reduced or eliminated. Demand for PV equipment, including on-grid applications, has historically been dependent in part on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives. Currently, the cost of solar electricity exceeds the retail price of electricity in most major markets in the world. As a result, federal, state and local governmental bodies in many countries, most notably Germany, Italy, Spain, South Korea, Japan, China and the United States, have provided subsidies in the form of feed-in tariffs, rebates, tax write-offs and other incentives to end-users, distributors, systems integrators and/or manufacturers of PV products to promote the use of solar energy in on-grid applications and to reduce dependency on other forms of energy. Many of these government incentives have expired or are due to expire in time, phase out over time, cease upon exhaustion of the allocated funding and/or are subject to cancellation or non-renewal by the applicable authority. The reduction, expiration or elimination of relevant government subsidies or other economic incentives may result in the diminished competitiveness of solar energy relative to conventional and other renewable sources of energy, and adversely affect demand for PV equipment (and polysilicon equipment) or result in increased price competition, all of which could cause our sales and revenue to decline and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business and/or prospects. Further, any government subsidies and economic incentives could be reduced or eliminated altogether at any time and for any reason. We believe that government subsidies and incentives will be eliminated in the near future. Also, relevant statutes or regulations may be found to be anti-competitive, unconstitutional or may be amended or discontinued for other reasons. Some government subsidies and incentives have been subject to challenge in courts in certain foreign jurisdictions. New proceedings challenging minimum price regulations or other government incentives in countries in which we conduct our business or in which our customers conduct business, may be initiated, and if successful, could cause a decrease in demand for our polysilicon and PV equipment products. Existing regulations and policies and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of photovoltaic products. The market for electricity generation products is heavily influenced by government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities. These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of user-owned electricity generation. In the United States and in a number of other countries, these 43 Table of Contents regulations and policies are currently being modified and may be modified again in the future. These regulations and policies could deter end-user purchases of PV products (and polysilicon products) and investment in the research and development of PV technology. For example, without a mandated regulatory exception for PV systems, utility customers are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid. These fees could increase the cost to end-users of PV systems and make such systems less attractive to potential customers, which may have a material adverse effect on demand for our polysilicon and PV products and our financial condition, results of operations, business and/or prospects. The photovoltaic industry may not be able to compete successfully with conventional power generation or other sources of renewable energy. The PV industry comprises a relatively small component of the total power generation market and competes with other sources of renewable energy, as well as conventional power generation. Many factors may affect the viability of widespread adoption of PV (and polysilicon) technology and thus demand for solar wafer manufacturing equipment, including the following: cost-effectiveness of solar energy compared to conventional power generation and other renewable energy sources; performance and reliability of solar modules compared to conventional power generation and other renewable energy sources and products; availability and size of government subsidies and incentives to support the development of the solar energy industry; success of other renewable energy generation technologies such as hydroelectric, wind, geothermal and biomass; and fluctuations in economic and market conditions that affect the viability of conventional power generation and other renewable energy sources, such as increases or decreases in the prices of oil, natural gas and other fossil fuels. As a result of any of the foregoing factors, our financial condition, results of operations, business and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock Future sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, could depress our stock price. Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. In addition, future equity financings could also result in dilution to our stockholders and new securities could have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our common shares. Our certificate of incorporation currently authorizes us to issue up to 500 million shares of common stock, and as of December 31, 2013, we had approximately 134.5 million shares of common stock outstanding. All of these shares are freely tradable in the public market under a registration statement or an exemption under the securities laws. Moreover, at December 31, 2013, 10.1 million shares of our common stock were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding vested and unvested options and upon vesting of outstanding restricted stock units. 44 Table of Contents Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. It is possible that companies in our industries or certain other investors may consider making a friendly or hostile attempt to gain control of a majority (or all) of our common stock. Some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may have the effect of delaying, discouraging or preventing a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders may receive a premium for their shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include: the removal of directors only by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the shares of our capital stock entitled to vote; any vacancy on our board of directors, however occurring, including a vacancy resulting from an enlargement of the board, may only be filled by vote of the directors then in office; inability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders or take action by written consent; advance notice requirements for board nominations and proposing matters to be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and authorization of the issuance of "blank check" preferred stock without the need for action by stockholders. In addition, we are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. We are a technology-oriented company and, as such, we expect that the price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially. We operate in industries where there are rapid changes in technologies and product offerings. Broad market, industry and economic factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Factors that could cause fluctuations in our stock price may include, among other things: actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results; changes in market prices for our products or for raw materials; changes in our financial guidance or estimates made by us or by any securities analysts who may cover our stock or our failure to meet the estimates made by securities analysts; changes in the market valuations of other companies operating in our industry; announcements by us or our competitors of, or developments relating to, significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, customer contracts or arrangements, divestitures or other significant contracts; changes in governmental policies with respect to energy; additions or departures of key personnel; and sales of our common stock, including sales of our common stock by our directors and officers or by our larger stockholders. 45 Table of Contents Announcements of contract awards or bankruptcies of solar-related companies could have a significant impact on our stock price. It is common for equipment manufacturers in the business segments in which we operate to enter into contracts for the sale and delivery of substantial amounts of equipment, involving highly competitive bidding situations. Public announcements of contract awards often cause a reaction in the stock market and affect, sometimes significantly, the trading price of the stock of the manufacturer that received a contract award. It could also have a negative effect on the trading price of stock of competitors that did not receive such contract. This reaction may be unrelated to the historical results of operations or financial condition of the affected companies or, in the case of unsuccessful competitors, any guidance they may have provided with respect to their future financial results. An announcement that a competitor of ours was awarded a significant customer contract could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our stock. In addition, there have been announcements that companies offering solar power related services and materials have filed or will file for bankruptcy. For example, Solyndra filed for bankruptcy in August 2011. Such announcements, and future similar announcements, will likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. This will likely be the case even if such companies do not utilize the output for the equipment we sell. The derivative transactions related to our common stock in connection with our 2017 notes and 2020 notes and the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions entered into in connection with our 2017 notes could depress our stock price. In September 2012, we issued $220 million aggregate principal amount of our 2017 notes. In December 2013, we issued $214 million aggregate principal amount of our 2020 notes. Upon conversion of the 2017 notes and 2020 notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. The 2017 notes may be converted, under certain conditions specified in the indenture entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2017 notes, based on an initial conversion rate of 129.7185 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2017 notes (which represents an initial effective conversion price of the 2017 notes of $7.71 per share), subject to adjustment as described in the indenture. The 2020 Notes may be converted, under certain conditions specified in the Indenture entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes, based on an initial conversion rate of 82.5764 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (which represents an initial effective conversion price of the Notes of $12.11 per share), subject to adjustment as described in the Indenture for the 2020 Notes. It is likely that some or all of the holders of the 2017 notes and 2020 notes have entered into and may unwind various derivative transactions that involve trading in our common stock or in other instruments, such as options or swaps, based upon our common stock. Such derivative transactions could adversely affect the value of our common stock and, consequently, the value of the notes. In connection with issuing the 2017 notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with certain option counterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the 2017 notes. We also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties. We believe that the option counterparties or their affiliates entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the 2017 notes. The option counterparties or their affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 2017 notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the 2017 notes). 46 Table of Contents This derivative transaction activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock, the 2017 notes or the 2020 notes, and to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to the conversion of the applicable notes, it could affect the number of shares and value of the consideration to be issued upon the conversion of the applicable notes. In addition, if any such convertible note hedge and warrant transaction is unwound early, such action could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the 2017 notes and 2020 notes. We currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and as a result, the only opportunity to achieve a return on an investment in our common stock is if the price appreciates. We currently do not expect to declare or pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, the only opportunity to achieve a return on an investment in our common stock will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and the shares are sold at a profit. We cannot assure our investors that the market price for our common stock will ever exceed the price that was paid. Our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect that our quarterly results will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. Our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect that our quarterly results will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. Future quarterly fluctuations may result from a number of factors, including: the size of new contracts and when we are able to recognize the related revenue, especially with respect to our polysilicon products; requests for delays in deliveries by our customers; delays in customer acceptances of our products; delays in deliveries from our vendors; our rate of progress in the fulfillment of our obligations under our contracts; the degree of market acceptance of our products and service offerings; the mix of products and services sold; budgeting cycles of our customers; product lifecycles; changes in demand for our products and services; the level and timing of expenses for product development and sales, general and administrative expenses; competition by existing and emerging competitors, including in the PV, polysilicon and sapphire industry; announcements by our competitors or customers of the awarding of a significant contract; termination of or removal of contracts in our reported order backlog; our success in developing and selling new products and services, controlling costs, attracting and retaining qualified personnel; changes in government subsidies and economic incentives for on-grid solar electricity applications; 47 Table of Contents announcements regarding litigation or claims against us or others in the PV, polysilicon or sapphire industries; changes in export licensing or export restrictions with respect to our products; changes in our strategy; the extent our sapphire materials are used in products by Apple and sales of Apple products; negative announcements regarding solar and sapphire industry participants, such as the bankruptcies of Evergreen Solar and Solyndra, as well as government investigations of Solyndra operations; foreign exchange fluctuations; and general economic conditions. Based on these factors, we believe our future operating results will vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. As a result, quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful nor do they indicate what our future performance will be. Our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance. From time to time, we release guidance in our quarterly or annual earnings releases, quarterly or annual earnings conference calls or otherwise, regarding our future performance that represent our management's estimates as of the date of release. This guidance, which includes forward-looking statements, is based on projections prepared by our management. These projections are not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our registered public accountants nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the projections and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. Projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions and conditions, some of which will change. We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons. Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results will vary from our guidance and the variations may be material. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged not to rely upon, or otherwise consider, our guidance in making an investment decision in respect of our common stock. 48 Table of Contents Item 1B.
