ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial performance, and results of operations. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K, as the forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, and actual results and conditions could differ materially from the current expectations. Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk, and before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider these risk factors as well as other information we include or incorporate by reference in the other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Risk Factors Regarding Our Business: Our Industrial Segment (discontinued operations) has sustained losses for the past eight years, including 2007. Our Industrial Segment has sustained losses in each year since 2000. On May 18, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized management to sell all, or a part of, our Industrial Segment. During the first quarter of 2008, we completed the sale of PFMD and sale of PFD and are negotiating the sale of PFSG within our Industrial Segment. We are also attempting to sell the remaining operations within the Industrial Segment. If we fail to divest the majority of our remaining facilities within our Industrial Segment and the majority of our Industrial Segment facilities fails to become profitable on an annualized basis in the foreseeable future, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and our potential growth. The inability to maintain existing government contracts or win new government contracts over an extended period could have a material adverse effect on our operations and adversely affect our future revenues. A material amount of our Nuclear Segment's revenues are generated through various U.S. government contracts or subcontracts involving the U.S. government. Our revenues from government sources were approximately $30,000,000 and $33,226,000, representing 55.5% and 63.0%, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues from continuing operations for 2007 and 2006. Most of our government contracts or our subcontracts granted under government contracts are awarded through a regulated competitive bidding process. Some government contracts are awarded to multiple competitors, which increase overall competition and pricing pressure and may require us to make sustained post-award efforts to realize revenues under these government contracts. In addition, government clients can generally terminate or modify their contracts at their convenience. If we fail to maintain or replace these relationships, our revenues and future operations could be adversely affected. 12 If we cannot maintain our governmental permits or cannot obtain required permits, we may not be able to continue or expand our operations. We are a waste management company. Our business is subject to extensive, evolving, and increasingly stringent federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Such federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations govern our activities regarding the treatment, storage, recycling, disposal, and transportation of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and low-level radioactive waste. We must obtain and maintain permits or licenses to conduct these activities in compliance with such laws and regulations. Failure to obtain and maintain the required permits or licenses would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. If any of our facilities are unable to maintain currently held permits or licenses or obtain any additional permits or licenses which may be required to conduct its operations, we may not be able to continue those operations at these facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Loss of certain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on us. Our success depends on the contributions of our key management, environmental and engineering personnel, especially Dr. Louis F. Centofanti, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of Dr. Centofanti could have a material adverse effect on our operations, revenues, prospects, and our ability to raise additional funds. Our future success depends on our ability to retain and expand our staff of qualified personnel, including environmental specialists and technicians, sales personnel, and engineers. Without qualified personnel, we may incur delays in rendering our services or be unable to render certain services. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain qualified personnel as their availability is limited due to the demand for hazardous waste management services and the highly competitive nature of the hazardous waste management industry. We do not maintain key person insurance on any of our employees, officers, or directors. We believe our proprietary technology is important to us. We believe that it is important that we maintain our proprietary technologies. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary technologies will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these technologies by third parties. Misappropriation of our proprietary technology could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Changes to current environmental laws and regulations also could limit the use of our proprietary technology. Changes in environmental regulations and enforcement policies could subject us to additional liability and adversely affect our ability to continue certain operations. We cannot predict the extent to which our operations may be affected by future governmental enforcement policies as applied to existing laws, by changes to current environmental laws and regulations, or by the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations. Any predictions regarding possible liability under such laws are complicated further by current environmental laws which provide that we could be liable, jointly and severally, for certain activities of third parties over whom we have limited or no control. The refusal to accept our waste for disposal by, or a closure of, the end disposal site that our Nuclear Segment utilizes to dispose of its waste could subject us to significant risk and limit our operations. Our Nuclear Segment has limited options available for disposal of its waste. If this disposal site ceases to accept waste or closes for any reason or refuses to accept the waste of our Nuclear Segment, for any reason, we could have nowhere to dispose of our Nuclear waste or have significantly increased costs from disposal alternatives. With nowhere to dispose of our nuclear waste, we would be subject to significant risk from the implications of storing the waste on our site, and we would have to limit our operations to accept only waste that we can dispose of. Our Nuclear Segment and Industrial Segment (discontinued operations) subject us to substantial potential environmental liability. Our business of rendering services in connection with management of waste, including certain types of hazardous waste, low-level radioactive waste, and mixed waste (waste containing both hazardous and low- 13 level radioactive waste), subjects us to risks of liability for damages. Such liability could involve, without limitation: · claims for clean-up costs, personal injury or damage to the environment in cases in which we are held responsible for the release of hazardous or radioactive materials; · claims of employees, customers, or third parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations; and · claims alleging negligence or professional errors or omissions in the planning or performance of our services. Our operations are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations. We have in the past, and could in the future, be subject to substantial fines, penalties, and sanctions for violations of environmental laws and substantial expenditures as a responsible party for the cost of remediating any property which may be contaminated by hazardous substances generated by us and disposed at such property, or transported by us to a site selected by us, including properties we own or lease. As our operations expand, we may be subject to increased litigation, which could have a negative impact on our future financial results. Our operations are highly regulated and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations regarding procedures for waste treatment, storage, recycling, transportation, and disposal activities, all of which may provide the basis for litigation against us. In recent years, the waste treatment industry has experienced a significant increase in so-called “toxic-tort” litigation as those injured by contamination seek to recover for personal injuries or property damage. We believe that, as our operations and activities expand, there will be a similar increase in the potential for litigation alleging that we have violated environmental laws or regulations or are responsible for contamination or pollution caused by our normal operations, negligence or other misconduct, or for accidents, which occur in the course of our business activities. Such litigation, if significant and not adequately insured against, could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to fund our operations. Protracted litigation would likely cause us to spend significant amounts of our time, effort, and money. This could prevent our management from focusing on our operations and expansion. If we cannot maintain adequate insurance coverage, we will be unable to continue certain operations. Our business exposes us to various risks, including claims for causing damage to property and injuries to persons that may involve allegations of negligence or professional errors or omissions in the performance of our services. Such claims could be substantial. We believe that our insurance coverage is presently adequate and similar to, or greater than, the coverage maintained by other companies in the industry of our size. If we are unable to obtain adequate or required insurance coverage in the future, or if our insurance is not available at affordable rates, we would violate our permit conditions and other requirements of the environmental laws, rules, and regulations under which we operate. Such violations would render us unable to continue certain of our operations. These events would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Breach of financial covenants in existing credit facility could result in a default, triggering repayment of outstanding debt under the credit facility. Our credit facility with our bank contains financial covenants. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facility triggering our lender to immediately require the repayment of all outstanding debt under our credit facility and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. In the past, none of our covenants have been restrictive to our operations; however, in 2007, our fixed charge coverage ratio fell below the minimum requirement pursuant to the covenant. We have obtained a waiver from our lender for this non-compliance as of December 31, 2007. We do not expect to be in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio as of the end of the first and second quarters of 2008 and, as a result, we were required under generally accepted accounting principles to reclassify the long term portion of this debt to current. Furthermore, we have a cross default provision on our 8.625% promissory note with a separate bank and have reclassified the long term portion of that debt to current as well. If we are unable to 14 meet the fixed charge coverage ratio, we believe that our lender will waive this non-compliance or will revise this covenant so that we are in compliance, but there is no assurance that we will be able to secure a waiver or revision from our lender. If we fail to meet our fixed charge coverage ratio in the future and our lender does not waive the non-compliance or revise this covenant so that we are in compliance, our lender could accelerate the repayment of borrowings under our credit facility. In the event that our lender accelerates the payment of our borrowing, we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay our debt under our credit facility and other indebtedness. In addition to the waiver that we have obtained from our lender for our non-compliance of our fixed charge coverage ratio as of December 31, 2007, our lender has amended our present covenant to exclude certain allowable charges in determining our minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. This amendment may improve our ability to maintain compliance of the fixed charge coverage ratio in the future. Due to our inability to demonstrate that we will comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio in our loan agreement as of the end of the first and second quarters of 2008, resulting in the long-term portion of our indebtedness to certain of our lenders of approximately $11.4 million being reclassified to current, our working capital deficit of approximately $17.2 million and certain of our lenders’ ability to accelerate our indebtedness under our credit facilities, there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Consequently, our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph addressing this uncertainty in their report. Although we believe our lender will waive our failure or potential failure to meet this financial covenant or revise the covenant so that we are in compliance, as of the date of this report our lender has not issued this waiver or revision. There are no assurances that our lender will waive or revise this covenant. Failure of our Nuclear Segment to be profitable could have a material adverse effect. Our Nuclear Segment has historically been profitable. With the divestiture and impending divestiture of certain facilities within our Industrial Segment and the acquisition of our PFNWR facility in June 2007, the Nuclear Segment represents the Company’s largest revenue segment. The Company’s main objectives are to increase focus on the efficient operation of our existing facilities within our Nuclear Segment and to further evaluate strategic acquisitions within the Nuclear Segment. If our Nuclear Segment fails to continue to be profitable in the future, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, liquidity and our potential growth. Our operations are subject to seasonal factors, which cause our revenues to fluctuate. We have historically experienced reduced revenues and losses during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal years due to a seasonal slowdown in operations from poor weather conditions, overall reduced activities during these periods resulting from holiday periods, and finalization of government budgets during the fourth quarter of each year. During our second and third fiscal quarters there has historically been an increase in revenues and operating profits. If we do not continue to have increased revenues and profitability during the second and third fiscal quarters, this will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. If environmental regulation or enforcement is relaxed, the demand for our services will decrease. The demand for our services is substantially dependent upon the public's concern with, and the continuation and proliferation of, the laws and regulations governing the treatment, storage, recycling, and disposal of hazardous, non-hazardous, and low-level radioactive waste. A decrease in the level of public concern, the repeal or modification of these laws, or any significant relaxation of regulations relating to the treatment, storage, recycling, and disposal of hazardous waste and low-level radioactive waste would significantly reduce the demand for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. We are not aware of any current federal or state government or agency efforts in which a moratorium or limitation has been, or will be, placed upon the creation of new hazardous or radioactive waste regulations that would have a material adverse effect on us; however, no assurance can be made that such a moratorium or limitation will not be implemented in the future. 15 Our amount of debt and floating rates of interest could adversely affect our operations. At December 31, 2007, our aggregate consolidated debt was approximately $18.8 million. If our floating rates of interest experienced an upward increase of 1%, our debt service would increase by approximately $189,000 annually. Our secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) provides for an aggregate commitment of $25 million, consisting of an $18 million revolving line of credit and a term loan of $7 million. The maximum we can borrow under the revolving part of the Credit Facility is based on a percentage of the amount of our eligible receivables outstanding at any one time. The Credit Facility is due September 30, 2009. As of December 31, 2007, we have borrowings under the revolving part of our Credit Facility of $6.9 million and borrowing availability of up to an additional $5.7 million based on our outstanding eligible receivables. A forecast of our first quarter and second quarter 2008 results indicates the possibility that we could be in default of our fixed charge coverage ratio covenant. We expect that this will place us in “technical default” of our covenant and thus our debt under our credit facility has been classified as current. If we become in default under this covenant, our lenders could accelerate approximately $14.4 million of indebtness. See “Risk Factor - Breach of financial covenants in existing credit facility could result in a default, triggering repayment of outstanding debt under the credit facility.” A lack of operating results could have material adverse consequences on our ability to operate our business. Our ability to make principal and interest payments, or to refinance indebtedness, will depend on both our and our subsidiaries' future operating performance and cash flow. Prevailing economic conditions, interest rate levels, and financial, competitive, business, and other factors affect us. Many of these factors are beyond our control. We may be unable to utilize loss carryforwards in the future. We have approximately $22.7 million in net operating loss carryforwards which will expire from 2008 to 2024 if not used against future federal income tax liabilities. Our net loss carryforwards are subject to various limitations. We anticipate the net loss carryforwards will be used to reduce the federal income tax payments which we would otherwise be required to make with respect to income, if any, generated in future years. We and our customers operate in a politically sensitive environment, and the public perception of nuclear power and radioactive materials can affect our customers and us. We and our customers operate in a politically sensitive environment. Opposition by third parties to particular projects can limit the handling and disposal of radioactive materials. Adverse public reaction to developments in the disposal of radioactive materials, including any high profile incident involving the discharge of radioactive materials, could directly affect our customers and indirectly affect our business. Adverse public reaction also could lead to increased regulation or outright prohibition, limitations on the activities of our customers, more onerous operating requirements or other conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our customers’ and our business. We may not be successful in winning new business mandates from our government and commercial customers. We must be successful in winning mandates from our government and commercial customers to replace revenues from projects that are nearing completion and to increase our revenues. Our business and operating results can be adversely affected by the size and timing of a single material contract. The elimination or any modification of the Price-Anderson Acts indemnification authority could have adverse consequences for our business. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or the AEA, comprehensively regulates the manufacture, use, and storage of radioactive materials. The Price-Anderson Act supports the nuclear services industry by offering broad indemnification to DOE contractors for liabilities arising out of nuclear incidents at DOE nuclear facilities. That indemnification protects DOE prime contractor, but also similar companies that work under contract or subcontract for a DOE prime contract or transporting radioactive material to or from a site. The indemnification authority of the DOE under the Price-Anderson Act was extended through 2025 by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. 16 The Price-Anderson Act’s indemnification provisions generally do not apply to our processing of radioactive waste at governmental facilities, and do not apply to liabilities that we might incur while performing services as a contractor for the DOE and the nuclear energy industry. If an incident or evacuation is not covered under Price-Anderson Act indemnification, we could be held liable for damages, regardless of fault, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If such indemnification authority is not applicable in the future, our business could be adversely affected if the owners and operators of new facilities fail to retain our services in the absence of commercial adequate insurance and indemnification. Our existing and future customers may reduce or halt their spending on nuclear services from outside vendors, including us. A variety of factors may cause our existing or future customers to reduce or halt their spending on nuclear services from outside vendors, including us. These factors include, but are not limited to: · accidents, terrorism, natural disasters or other incidents occurring at nuclear facilities or involving shipments of nuclear materials; · failure of the federal government to approve necessary budgets, or to reduce the amount of the budget necessary, to fund remediation of DOE and DOD sites; · civic opposition to or changes in government policies regarding nuclear operations; or · a reduction in demand for nuclear generating capacity. These events also could adversely affect us to the extent that they result in the reduction or elimination of contractual requirements, lower demand for nuclear services, burdensome regulation, disruptions of shipments or production, increased operational costs or difficulties or increased liability for actual or threatened property damage or personal injury. Economic downturns and reductions in government funding could have a negative impact on our businesses. Demand for our services has been, and we expect that demand will continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control, including economic conditions, inability of the federal government to adopt its budget or reductions in the budget for spending to remediate federal sites. During economic downturns, the ability of private and government entities to spend on nuclear services may decline significantly. We cannot be certain that economic or political conditions will be generally favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting our industry as a whole. In addition, our operations depend, in part, upon government funding, particularly funding levels at the DOE. Significant changes in the level of government funding (for example, the annual budget of the DOE) or specifically mandated levels for different programs that are important to our business could have an unfavorable impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The loss of one or a few customers could have an adverse effect on us. One or a few governmental customers have in the past, and may in the future, account for a significant portion of our revenue in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. Because customers generally contract with us for specific projects, we may lose these significant customers from year to year as their projects with us are completed. Our inability to replace the business with other projects could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. As a government contractor, we are subject to extensive government regulation, and our failure to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to penalties that may restrict our ability to conduct our business. Our government contracts, which are primarily with the DOE, are a significant part of our business. Allowable costs under U.S. government contracts are subject to audit by the U.S. government. If these audits result in determinations that costs claimed as reimbursable are not allowed costs or were not allocated 17 in accordance with applicable regulations, we could be required to reimburse the U.S. government for amounts previously received. Government contracts are often subject to specific procurement regulations, contract provisions and a variety of other requirements relating to the formation, administration, performance and accounting of these contracts. Many of these contracts include express or implied certifications of compliance with applicable regulations and contractual provisions. If we fail to comply with any regulations, requirements or statutes, our existing government contracts could be terminated or we could be suspended from government contracting or subcontracting. If one or more of our government contracts are terminated for any reason, or if we are suspended or debarred from government work, we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenues and profits. Furthermore, as a result of our government contracting, claims for civil or criminal fraud may be brought by the government or violations of these regulations, requirements or statutes. We are engaged in highly competitive businesses and typically must bid against other competitors to obtain major contracts. We are engaged in highly competitive business in which most of our government contracts and some of our commercial contracts are awarded through competitive bidding processes. We compete with national and regional firms with nuclear services practices, as well as small or local contractors. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, which can give them a competitive advantage. In addition, even if we are qualified to work on a new government contract, we might not be awarded the contract because of existing government policies designed to protect certain types of businesses and underrepresented minority contractors. Competition also places downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins. Intense competition is expected to continue for nuclear service contracts. If we are unable to meet these competitive challenges, we could lose market share and experience on overall reduction in our profits. Our failure to maintain our safety record could have an adverse effect on our business. Our safety record is critical to our reputation. In addition, many of our government and commercial customers require that we maintain certain specified safety record guidelines to be eligible to bid for contracts with these customers. Furthermore, contract terms may provide for automatic termination in the event that our safety record fails to adhere to agreed-upon guidelines during performance of the contract. As a result, our failure to maintain our safety record could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have a material weakness in our Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (“ICFR”) as of December 31, 2007. During our evaluation of our ICFR, we noted that the monitoring of pricing, invoicing, and the corresponding inventory for transportation and disposal process controls at certain facilities within the Company's Industrial Segment were ineffective and were not being applied consistently, which resulted in a material weakness to our ICFR, and could result in sales being priced and invoiced at amounts which were not approved by the customer, or the appropriate level of management, and inaccurate, corresponding transportation and disposal expense. This has resulted in our disclosure that our ICFR were ineffective as of December 31, 2007. Although this material weakness did not result in an adjustment to our quarterly or annual financial statements, if we are unable to remediate this material weakness, there is a reasonable possibility that a misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Delaware law, certain of our charter provisions, our stock option plans and outstanding warrants and our preferred stock may inhibit a change of control under circumstances that could give you an opportunity to realize a premium over prevailing market prices. We are a Delaware corporation governed, in part, by the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, an anti-takeover law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a Delaware public corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of 18 three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. As a result of Section 203, potential acquirers may be discouraged from attempting to effect acquisition transactions with us, thereby possibly depriving our security holders of certain opportunities to sell, or otherwise dispose of, such securities at above-market prices pursuant to such transactions. Further, certain of our option plans provide for the immediate acceleration of, and removal of restrictions from, options and other awards under such plans upon a “change of control” (as defined in the respective plans). Such provisions may also have the result of discouraging acquisition of us. We have authorized and unissued 21,295,484 shares of Common Stock and 2,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock as of December 31, 2007. These unissued shares could be used by our management to make it more difficult, and thereby discourage, an attempt to acquire control of us. Risk Factors Regarding our Common Stock: The significant amount of outstanding options could affect our stock performance. As of December 31, 2007, we had outstanding options to purchase 2,590,026 shares of Common Stock at exercise prices from $1.22 to $2.98 per share. The existence of this quantity of rights to purchase our Common Stock could result in a significant dilution in the percentage ownership interest of our stockholders and the dilution in ownership value. Future sales of the shares issuable could also depress the market price of our Common Stock. The price of our Common Stock is volatile. The trading price of our Common Stock has historically been volatile, and subject to large swings over short periods of time. As a result of the volatility of our Common Stock, an investment in our stock holds significant risk. We do not intend to pay dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Since our inception, we have not paid cash dividends on our Common Stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our credit facility prohibits us from paying cash dividends on our Common Stock. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None ITEM
