Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe and our subsidiaries are subject to certain risks and uncertainties in our business operations, including, but not limited to, those described below. Careful consideration of these risks, together with all of the other information included in this Form 10-K and the other public information filed by us, should be made before making an investment decision. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or which we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.Our Corporate and Financial Structure RisksWe are a holding company and depend on distributions from subsidiaries, including joint ventures, to meet our obligations.We are a holding company with no material assets other than the ownership interests in our subsidiaries and joint ventures, collectively referred to as our subsidiaries. Accordingly, cash flows and the ability to meet our obligations are largely dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment of such earnings to us in the form of dividends or other distributions. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay directly, or to make funds available, whether by dividends or other payments, for the payment of amounts due pursuant to our senior debt or our other obligations, and do not guarantee the payment of any of our obligations. Distributions from subsidiaries may also be limited by:•their respective earnings, capital requirements, and required debt and preferred stock payments;•the satisfaction of certain terms contained in financing, ring-fencing or organizational documents; and•regulatory restrictions that limit the ability of our regulated utility subsidiaries to distribute profits.We are substantially leveraged, the terms of our senior and junior subordinated debentures do not restrict the incurrence of additional debt by us or our subsidiaries, and our senior debt is structurally subordinated to the debt of our subsidiaries, each of which could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.A significant portion of our capital structure is comprised of debt, and we expect to incur additional debt in the future to fund items such as, among others, acquisitions, capital investments and the development and construction of new or expanded facilities at our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2013, we had the following outstanding obligations:•senior unsecured debt of $6.6 billion;•junior subordinated debentures of $2.6 billion;•commitments to provide equity contributions in support of the construction of certain solar projects totaling $3.0 billion; and •guarantees and letters of credit in respect of subsidiary and equity method investments aggregating $202 million.Our consolidated subsidiaries also have significant amounts of outstanding debt, which totaled $22.8 billion as of December 31, 2013. These amounts exclude (a) trade debt, (b) preferred stock obligations, (c) letters of credit in respect of subsidiary debt, and (d) our share of the outstanding debt of our own or our subsidiaries' equity method investments. 39Given our substantial leverage, we may not have sufficient cash to service our debt, which could limit our ability to finance future acquisitions, develop and construct additional projects, or operate successfully under difficult conditions, including those brought on by adverse national and global economies, unfavorable financial markets or growth conditions where our capital needs may exceed our ability to fund them. Our leverage could also impair our credit quality or the credit quality of our subsidiaries, making it more difficult to finance operations or issue future debt on favorable terms, and could result in a downgrade in debt ratings by credit rating agencies.The terms of our senior debt do not limit our ability or the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt or issue preferred stock. Accordingly, we or our subsidiaries could enter into acquisitions, new financings, refinancings, recapitalizations, capital leases or other highly leveraged transactions that could significantly increase our or our subsidiaries' total amount of outstanding debt. The interest payments needed to service this increased level of debt could adversely affect our consolidated financial results. Many of our subsidiaries' debt agreements contain covenants, or may in the future contain covenants, that restrict or limit, among other things, such subsidiaries' ability to create liens, sell assets, make certain distributions, incur additional debt or miss contractual deadlines or requirements, and our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. Further, if an event of default accelerates a repayment obligation and such acceleration results in an event of default under some or all of our other debt, we may not have sufficient funds to repay all of the accelerated debt, and the other risks described under "Our Corporate and Financial Structure Risks" may be magnified as well.Because we are a holding company, the claims of our debt holders are structurally subordinated with respect to the assets and earnings of our subsidiaries. Therefore, the rights of our creditors to participate in the assets of any subsidiary in the event of a liquidation or reorganization are subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors and preferred shareholders, if any. In addition, pursuant to separate financing agreements, substantially all of PacifiCorp's electric utility properties and MidAmerican Energy's electric utility properties in the state of Iowa, the equity interest of MidAmerican Funding, LLC's subsidiary, substantially all of Nevada Power's and Sierra Pacific's properties in the state of Nevada, the long-term customer contracts of Kern River and substantially all of the assets of subsidiaries of MidAmerican Renewables, LLC that are direct or indirect owners of generation projects, is directly or indirectly pledged to secure their financings and, therefore, may be unavailable as potential sources of repayment of our senior debt.A downgrade in our credit ratings or the credit ratings of our subsidiaries could negatively affect our or our subsidiaries' access to capital, increase the cost of borrowing or raise energy transaction credit support requirements.Our senior unsecured debt is rated by various rating agencies. We cannot assure that our senior unsecured debt rating will not be reduced in the future. Although none of our outstanding debt has rating-downgrade triggers that would accelerate a repayment obligation, a credit rating downgrade would increase our borrowing costs and commitment fees on our revolving credit agreements and other financing arrangements, perhaps significantly, and would cause our obligations under commitments to provide equity contributions in support of the construction of solar projects by certain of our indirect subsidiaries to be supported by cash collateral or letters of credit. In addition, we would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings, and the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease. Further, access to the commercial paper market, our principal source of short-term borrowings, could be significantly limited, resulting in higher interest costs.Similarly, any downgrade or other event negatively affecting the credit ratings of our subsidiaries could make their costs of borrowing higher or access to funding sources more limited, which in turn could cause us to provide liquidity in the form of capital contributions or loans to such subsidiaries, thus reducing our and our subsidiaries' liquidity and borrowing capacity.Most of our subsidiaries' large wholesale customers, suppliers and counterparties require our subsidiaries to have sufficient creditworthiness in order to enter into transactions, particularly in the wholesale energy markets. If the credit ratings of our subsidiaries were to decline, especially below investment grade, financing costs and borrowings would likely increase because certain counterparties may require collateral in the form of cash, a letter of credit or some other form of security for existing transactions and as a condition to entering into future transactions with our subsidiaries. Such amounts may be material and may adversely affect our subsidiaries' liquidity and cash flows.Our majority shareholder, Berkshire Hathaway, could exercise control over us in a manner that would benefit Berkshire Hathaway to the detriment of our creditors.Berkshire Hathaway is our majority owner and has control over all decisions requiring shareholder approval. In circumstances involving a conflict of interest between Berkshire Hathaway and our creditors, Berkshire Hathaway could exercise its control in a manner that would benefit Berkshire Hathaway to the detriment of our creditors. 40Our Business RisksMuch of our growth has been achieved through acquisitions, including the NV Energy Transaction, and additional acquisitions may not be successful.Much of our growth has been achieved through acquisitions. Future acquisitions may range from buying individual assets to the purchase of entire businesses. On December 19, 2013, we completed the NV Energy Transaction, and we will continue to investigate and pursue opportunities for future acquisitions that we believe, but cannot assure you, may increase value and expand or complement existing businesses. We may participate in bidding or other negotiations at any time for such acquisition opportunities which may or may not be successful.Completion of any acquisition entails numerous risks, including, among others, the:•failure to complete the transaction for various reasons, such as the inability to obtain the required regulatory approvals, materially adverse developments in the potential acquiree's business or financial condition or successful intervening offers by third parties;•failure of the combined business to realize the expected benefits or to meet regulatory commitments; and •need for substantial additional capital and financial investments.An acquisition could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of our businesses. The diversion of management's attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the approval and integration of the acquired operations could adversely affect our combined businesses and financial results and could impair our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. We cannot assure you that future acquisitions, if any, or any integration efforts, including those related to the NV Energy Transaction, will be successful, or that our ability to repay our obligations will not be adversely affected by any future acquisitions.Our subsidiaries are subject to operating uncertainties and events beyond our control that impact the costs to operate, maintain, repair and replace utility and interstate natural gas pipeline systems, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.The operation of complex utility systems or interstate natural gas pipeline systems that are spread over large geographic areas involves many operating uncertainties and events beyond our control. These potential events include the breakdown or failure of our thermal, nuclear, hydroelectric and other electricity generating facilities and related equipment, compressors, pipelines, transmission and distribution lines or other equipment or processes, which could lead to catastrophic events; unscheduled outages; strikes, lockouts or other labor-related actions; shortages of qualified labor; transmission and distribution system constraints; terrorist activities or military or other actions, including cyberattacks; fuel shortages or interruptions; unavailability of critical equipment, materials and supplies; low water flows and other weather-related impacts; performance below expected levels of output, capacity or efficiency; operator error; third party excavation errors; unexpected degradation of our pipeline systems; design, construction or manufacturing defects; and catastrophic events such as severe storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, explosions, landslides, wars, terrorism, embargoes and mining accidents. A catastrophic event might result in injury or loss of life, extensive property damage or environmental or natural resource damages. For example, in the event of an uncontrolled release of water at one of our high hazard potential hydroelectric facilities, it is probable that loss of human life, disruption of lifeline facilities and property damage could occur in the downstream population and civil or other penalties could be imposed by the FERC. Any of these events or other operational events could significantly reduce or eliminate our subsidiaries' revenue or significantly increase their expenses, thereby reducing the availability of distributions to us. For example, if our subsidiaries cannot operate their electricity or natural gas facilities at full capacity due to damage caused by a catastrophic event, their revenue could decrease and their expenses could increase due to the need to obtain energy from more expensive sources. Further, we and our subsidiaries self-insure many risks, and current and future insurance coverage may not be sufficient to replace lost revenue or cover repair and replacement costs. The scope, cost and availability of our and our subsidiaries' insurance coverage may change, including the portion that is self-insured. Any reduction of our subsidiaries' revenue or increase in their expenses resulting from the risks described above, could adversely affect our consolidated financial results. 41We and our businesses are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign legislation and regulation, including numerous environmental, health, safety, reliability and other laws and regulations that affect us and our businesses' operations and costs. These laws and regulations are complex, dynamic and subject to new interpretations or change. In addition, new laws and regulations are continually being proposed and enacted that impose new or revised requirements or standards on us and our businesses.We and our businesses are required to comply with numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations as described in Item 1 of this Form 10-K that have broad application to us and our subsidiaries and limit our ability to independently make and implement management decisions regarding, among other items, constructing, acquiring or disposing of operating assets; acquiring businesses; operating and maintaining generating facilities and transmission and distribution system assets; complying with pipeline safety and integrity and environmental requirements; setting rates charged to customers; establishing capital structures and issuing debt or equity securities; transacting between subsidiaries and affiliates; and paying dividends or similar distributions. These laws and regulations are followed in developing our safety and compliance programs and procedures and are implemented and enforced by federal, state and local regulatory agencies, such as, among others, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the FERC, the EPA, the DOT, the NRC, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration and various state regulatory commissions in the United States, and foreign regulatory agencies, such as GEMA, which discharges certain of its powers through its staff within Ofgem, in Great Britain.Compliance with applicable laws and regulations generally requires our subsidiaries to obtain and comply with a wide variety of licenses, permits, inspections, audits and other approvals. Further, compliance with laws and regulations can require significant capital and operating expenditures, including expenditures for new equipment, inspection, cleanup costs, removal and remediation costs, damages arising out of contaminated properties and refunds, fines, penalties and injunctive measures affecting operating assets for failure to comply with environmental regulations. Compliance activities pursuant to existing or new laws and regulations could be prohibitively expensive or otherwise uneconomical. As a result, we could be required to shut down some facilities or materially alter their operations. Further, our subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental or other regulatory approvals and permits for their operating assets or development projects. Delays in, or active opposition by third parties to, obtaining any required environmental or regulatory authorizations or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the authorizations may increase costs or prevent or delay our subsidiaries from operating their facilities, developing or favorably locating new facilities or expanding existing facilities. If our subsidiaries fail to comply with any environmental or other regulatory requirements, they may be subject to penalties and fines or other sanctions, including changes to the way our electricity generating facilities are operated that may adversely impact generation or how the Pipeline Companies are permitted to operate their systems that may adversely impact throughput. The costs of complying with laws and regulations could adversely affect our consolidated financial results. Not being able to operate existing facilities or develop new generating facilities to meet customer electricity needs could require our subsidiaries to increase their purchases of electricity on the wholesale market, which could increase market and price risks and adversely affect our consolidated financial results.Existing laws and regulations, while comprehensive, are subject to changes and revisions from ongoing policy initiatives by legislators and regulators and to interpretations that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. For example, changes in laws and regulations could result in, but are not limited to, increased competition within our subsidiaries' service territories; new environmental requirements, including the implementation of RPS and GHG emissions reduction goals; the issuance of new or stricter air quality standards; the implementation of energy efficiency mandates; the issuance of regulations governing the management and disposal of coal combustion byproducts; changes in forecasting requirements; changes to our subsidiaries' service territories as a result of condemnation or takeover by municipalities or other governmental entities, particularly where they lack the exclusive right to serve their customers; the inability of our subsidiaries' to recover their costs; new pipeline safety requirements; or a negative impact on our subsidiaries' current transportation and cost recovery arrangements. In addition to changes in existing legislation and regulation, new laws and regulations are likely to be enacted from time to time that impose additional or new requirements or standards on our businesses. Implementing actions required under, and otherwise complying with, new federal and state laws and regulations and changes in existing ones are among the most challenging aspects of managing utility operations. We cannot accurately predict the type or scope of future laws and regulations that may be enacted, changes in existing ones or new interpretations by agency orders or court decisions nor can we determine their impact on us at this time; however, any one of these could adversely affect our consolidated financial results through higher capital expenditures and operating costs or restrict or otherwise cause an adverse change in how we operate our businesses. To the extent that our regulated subsidiaries are not allowed by their regulators to recover or cannot otherwise recover the costs to comply with new laws and regulations or changes in existing ones, the costs of complying with such additional requirements could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results. Additionally, even if such costs are recoverable in rates, if they are substantial and result in rates increasing to levels that substantially reduce customer demand, this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results. 42Recovery of costs by our regulated subsidiaries is subject to regulatory review and approval, and the inability to recover costs may adversely affect our consolidated financial results.State Rate ProceedingsThe Utilities establish rates for their regulated retail service through state regulatory proceedings. These proceedings typically involve multiple parties, including government bodies and officials, consumer advocacy groups and various consumers of energy, who have differing concerns but generally have the common objective of limiting rate increases while also requiring the Utilities to ensure system reliability. Decisions are subject to judicial appeal, potentially leading to further uncertainty associated with the approval proceedings.States set retail rates based in part upon the state regulatory commission's acceptance of an allocated share of total utility costs. When states adopt different methods to calculate interjurisdictional cost allocations, some costs may not be incorporated into rates of any state. Ratemaking is also generally done on the basis of estimates of normalized costs, so if a given year's realized costs are higher than normalized costs, rates may not be sufficient to cover those costs. In some cases, actual costs are lower than the normalized or estimated costs recovered through rates and from time-to-time may result in a state regulator requiring refunds to customers. Each state regulatory commission generally sets rates based on a test year established in accordance with that commission's policies. The test year data adopted by each state regulatory commission may create a lag between the incurrence of a cost and its recovery in rates. Each state regulatory commission also decides the allowed levels of expense, investment and capital structure that it deems are just and reasonable in providing the service and may disallow recovery in rates for any costs that it believes do not meet such standard. Additionally, each state regulatory commission establishes the allowed rate of return the Utilities will be given an opportunity to earn on their sources of capital. While rate regulation is premised on providing a fair opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, the state regulatory commissions do not guarantee that we will be able to realize a reasonable rate of return.In certain states where energy cost adjustment mechanisms are in place, energy cost increases above the level assumed in establishing base rates may be subject to customer sharing, and in other states, the Utilities are currently not permitted to pass through such energy cost increases without a general rate case. Any significant increase in fuel costs for electricity generation or purchased electricity costs could have a negative impact on the Utilities, despite efforts to minimize this impact through the use of hedging contracts and sharing mechanisms or through future general rate cases. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.FERC JurisdictionThe FERC authorizes cost-based rates associated with transmission services provided by the Utilities' transmission facilities. Under the Federal Power Act, the Utilities may voluntarily file, or may be obligated to file, for changes, including general rate changes, to their system-wide transmission service rates. General rate changes implemented may be subject to refund. The FERC also has responsibility for approving both cost- and market-based rates under which the Utilities sell electricity at wholesale, has jurisdiction over most of PacifiCorp's hydroelectric generating facilities and has broad jurisdiction over energy markets. The FERC may impose price limitations, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility of these markets or could revoke or restrict the ability of the Utilities to sell electricity at market-based rates, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial results. The FERC also maintains rules concerning standards of conduct, affiliate restrictions, interlocking directorates and cross-subsidization. As a transmission owning member of the MISO, MidAmerican Energy is also subject to MISO-directed modifications of market rules, which are subject to FERC approval and operational procedures. The FERC may also impose substantial civil penalties for any non-compliance with the Federal Power Act and the FERC's rules and orders.The North American Electric Reliability Corporation ("NERC") has standards in place to ensure the reliability of the electric transmission grid and generation system. The Utilities are subject to the NERC's regulations and periodic audits to ensure compliance with those regulations. The NERC may carry out enforcement actions for non-compliance and administer significant financial penalties, subject to the FERC's review.The FERC has jurisdiction over, among other things, the construction, abandonment, modification and operation of natural gas pipelines and related facilities used in the transportation, storage and sale of natural gas in interstate commerce, including all rates, charges and terms and conditions of service. The FERC also has market transparency authority and has adopted additional reporting and internet posting requirements for natural gas pipelines and buyers and sellers of natural gas. 43Rates for our interstate natural gas transmission and storage operations at the Pipeline Companies, which include reservation, commodity, surcharges, fuel and gas lost and unaccounted for charges, are authorized by the FERC. In accordance with the FERC's rate-making principles, the Pipeline Companies' current maximum tariff rates are designed to recover prudently incurred costs included in their pipeline system's regulatory cost of service that are associated with the construction, operation and maintenance of their pipeline system and to afford our Pipeline Companies an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return. Nevertheless, the rates the FERC authorizes our Pipeline Companies to charge their customers may not be sufficient to recover the costs incurred to provide services in any given period. Moreover, from time to time, the FERC may change, alter or refine its policies or methodologies for establishing pipeline rates and terms and conditions of service. In addition, the FERC has the authority under Section 5 of the Natural Gas Act of 1938 ("NGA") to investigate whether a pipeline may be earning more than its allowed rate of return and, when appropriate, to institute proceedings against such pipeline to reduce rates. Any such proceedings, if instituted, could result in significantly adverse rate decreases.Under FERC policy, interstate pipelines and their customers may execute contracts at negotiated rates, which may be above or below the maximum tariff rate for that service or the pipeline may agree to provide a discounted rate, which would be a rate between the maximum and minimum tariff rates. In a rate proceeding, rates in these contracts are generally not subject to adjustment. It is possible that the cost to perform services under negotiated or discounted rate contracts will exceed the cost used in the determination of the negotiated or discounted rates, which could result either in losses or lower rates of return for providing such services. FERC policy allows interstate natural gas pipelines to design new maximum tariff rates to recover such costs under certain circumstances in rate cases. However, with respect to discounts granted to affiliates, the interstate natural gas pipeline must demonstrate that the discounted rate was necessary in order to meet competition.GEMA Jurisdiction The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies, as Distribution Network Operators ("DNOs") and holders of electricity distribution licenses, are subject to regulation by GEMA. Most of the revenue of a DNO is controlled by a distribution price control formula set out in the electricity distribution license. The price control formula does not directly constrain profits from year to year, but is a control on revenue that operates independently of most of the DNO's actual costs. A resetting of the formula does not require the consent of the DNO, but if a licensee disagrees with a change to its license it can appeal the matter to the United Kingdom's Competition Commission. GEMA is able to impose financial penalties on DNOs that contravene any of their electricity distribution license duties or certain of their duties under British law, or fail to achieve satisfactory performance of individual standards prescribed by GEMA. Any penalty imposed must be reasonable and may not exceed 10% of the DNO's revenue. During the term of any price control, additional costs have a direct impact on the financial results of the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies.Through our subsidiaries, we are actively pursuing, developing and constructing new or expanded facilities, the completion and expected costs of which are subject to significant risk, and our subsidiaries have significant funding needs related to their planned capital expenditures.Through our subsidiaries, we actively pursue, develop and construct new or expanded facilities. We expect that these subsidiaries will incur substantial annual capital expenditures over the next several years. Such expenditures include and may include in the future, among others, construction and other costs for new electricity generating facilities, electric transmission or distribution projects, environmental control and compliance systems, natural gas storage facilities, new or expanded pipeline systems, and continued maintenance and upgrades of existing assets.Development and construction of major facilities are subject to substantial risks, including fluctuations in the price and availability of commodities, manufactured goods, equipment, labor, siting and permitting and changes in environmental and operational compliance matters, load forecasts and other items over a multi-year construction period, as well as counterparty risk and the economic viability of our suppliers, customers and contractors. Certain of our construction projects are substantially dependent upon a single supplier or contractor and replacement of such supplier or contractor may be difficult and cannot be assured. These risks may result in the inability to timely complete a project or higher than expected costs to complete an asset and place it in-service and, in extreme cases, the loss of the power purchase agreements or other long-term off-take contracts underlying such projects. Such costs may not be recoverable in the regulated rates or market or contract prices our subsidiaries are able to charge their customers. Delays in construction of renewable projects may result in delayed in-service dates which may result in the loss of applicable income tax benefits. It is also possible that additional generation needs may be obtained through power purchase agreements, which could increase long-term purchase obligations and force reliance on the operating performance of a third party. The inability to successfully and timely complete a project, avoid unexpected costs or recover any such costs could adversely affect our consolidated financial results. 44Furthermore, our subsidiaries depend upon both internal and external sources of liquidity to provide working capital and to fund capital requirements. In some cases, like our solar projects, we have committed to provide significant amounts of equity to our subsidiaries that are engaged in construction projects. If we do not provide needed funding to our subsidiaries and the subsidiaries are unable to obtain funding from external sources, they may need to postpone or cancel planned capital expenditures, and in the case of our subsidiaries' solar projects for which we have provided equity commitment agreements, could result in a default by us.Failure to construct these planned projects could limit opportunities for growth, increase operating costs and adversely affect the reliability of electricity service to our customers. For example, if PacifiCorp is not able to expand its existing portfolio of generating facilities, it may be required to enter into long-term wholesale electricity purchase contracts or purchase wholesale electricity at more volatile and potentially higher prices in the spot markets to serve retail loads.A significant sustained decrease in demand for electricity or natural gas in the markets served by our subsidiaries would decrease our operating revenue and could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.A significant sustained decrease in demand for electricity or natural gas in the markets served by our subsidiaries would significantly reduce our operating revenue and could adversely affect our consolidated financial results. Factors that could lead to a decrease in market demand include, among others:•a depression, recession or other adverse economic condition that results in a lower level of economic activity or reduced spending by consumers on electricity or natural gas;•an increase in the market price of electricity or natural gas or a decrease in the price of other competing forms of energy;•shifts in competitively priced natural gas supply sources away from the sources connected to our Pipeline Companies' systems, including new shale gas sources;•efforts by customers, legislators and regulators to reduce the consumption of electricity generated or distributed by our subsidiaries through various conservation, energy efficiency and distributed generation measures and programs;•laws mandating or encouraging renewable energy sources, which may decrease the demand for natural gas;•higher fuel taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that increase, directly or indirectly, the cost of natural gas or other fuel sources for electricity generation or that limit the use of natural gas or the generation of electricity from fossil fuels;•a shift to more energy-efficient or alternative fuel machinery or an improvement in fuel economy, whether as a result of technological advances by manufacturers, legislation mandating higher fuel economy or lower emissions, price differentials, incentives or otherwise;•a reduction in the state or federal subsidies or tax incentives that are provided to agricultural, industrial or other customers, or a significant sustained change in prices for commodities such as ethanol or corn for ethanol manufacturers; and•sustained mild weather that reduces heating or cooling needs.Our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and may be adversely affected by weather.In most parts of the United States and other markets in which our subsidiaries operate, demand for electricity peaks during the hot summer months when irrigation and cooling needs are higher. Market prices for electricity also generally peak at that time. In other areas, demand for electricity peaks during the winter. In addition, demand for natural gas and other fuels generally peaks during the winter when heating needs are higher. This is especially true in Northern Natural Gas' traditional end-use and distribution market area and MidAmerican Energy's and Sierra Pacific's retail natural gas businesses. Further, extreme weather conditions, such as heat waves, winter storms or floods could cause these seasonal fluctuations to be more pronounced. Periods of low rainfall or snowpack may impact electricity generation at PacifiCorp's hydroelectric generating facilities, which may result in greater purchases of electricity from the wholesale market or from other sources at market prices. Additionally, PacifiCorp and MidAmerican Energy have added substantial wind-powered generating capacity, and our unregulated businesses are adding solar and wind-powered generating capacity, each of which is also a climate-dependent resource. 45As a result, the overall financial results of our subsidiaries may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal and quarterly basis. We have historically provided less service, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are mild. Unusually mild weather in the future may adversely affect our consolidated financial results through lower revenue or margins. Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could increase our costs to provide services and could adversely affect our consolidated financial results. The extent of fluctuation in our consolidated financial results may change depending on a number of factors related to our subsidiaries' regulatory environment and contractual agreements, including their ability to recover energy costs, the existence of revenue sharing provisions and terms of the wholesale sale contracts.Our subsidiaries are subject to market risk associated with the wholesale energy markets, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.In general, our primary market risk is adverse fluctuations in the market price of wholesale electricity and fuel, including natural gas, coal and fuel oil, which is compounded by volumetric changes affecting the availability of or demand for electricity and fuel. The market price of wholesale electricity may be influenced by several factors, such as the adequacy or type of generating capacity, scheduled and unscheduled outages of generating facilities, prices and availability of fuel sources for generation, disruptions or constraints to transmission and distribution facilities, weather conditions, demand for electricity, economic growth and changes in technology. Volumetric changes are caused by fluctuations in generation or changes in customer needs that can be due to the weather, electricity and fuel prices, the economy, regulations or customer behavior. For example, the Utilities purchase electricity and fuel in the open market as part of their normal operating businesses. If market prices rise, especially in a time when larger than expected volumes must be purchased at market prices, the Utilities may incur significantly greater expense than anticipated. Likewise, if electricity market prices decline in a period when the Utilities are a net seller of electricity in the wholesale market, the Utilities could earn less revenue. Although the Utilities have energy cost adjustment mechanisms in certain states, the risks associated with changes in market prices may not be fully mitigated.Potential terrorist activities and the impact of military or other actions, including cyberattacks, could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.The ongoing threat of terrorism and the impact of military or other actions by nations or politically, ethnically or religiously motivated organizations regionally or globally may create increased political, economic, social and financial market instability, which could subject our subsidiaries' operations to increased risks. Additionally, the United States government has issued warnings that energy assets, specifically pipeline, nuclear generation and other electric utility infrastructure are potential targets for terrorist attacks, including cyberattacks. Cyberattacks could adversely affect our subsidiaries' ability to operate their facilities, information technology and business systems, or compromise confidential customer and employee information. Political, economic, social or financial market instability or damage to or interference with the operating assets of our subsidiaries, customers or suppliers may result in business interruptions, lost revenue, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption and unstable markets, particularly with respect to electricity and natural gas, and increased security, repair or other costs, any of which may materially adversely affect us and our subsidiaries in ways that cannot be predicted at this time. Any of these risks could materially affect our consolidated financial results. Furthermore, instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, sustained or significant cyberattacks, or war could also materially adversely affect our and our subsidiaries' ability to raise capital. 46MidAmerican Energy is subject to the unique risks associated with nuclear generation.The ownership and operation of nuclear power plants, such as MidAmerican Energy's 25% ownership interest in Quad Cities Station, involves certain risks. These risks include, among other items, mechanical or structural problems, inadequacy or lapses in maintenance protocols, the impairment of reactor operation and safety systems due to human error, the costs of storage, handling and disposal of nuclear materials, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance coverage commercially available, and uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear facilities at the end of their useful lives. The prolonged unavailability of Quad Cities Station could have a materially adverse effect on MidAmerican Energy's financial results, particularly when the cost to produce power at the plant is significantly less than market wholesale prices. The following are among the more significant of these risks: •Operational Risk - Operations at any nuclear power plant could degrade to the point where the plant would have to be shut down. If such degradations were to occur, the process of identifying and correcting the causes of the operational downgrade to return the plant to operation could require significant time and expense, resulting in both lost revenue and increased fuel and purchased electricity costs to meet supply commitments. Rather than incurring substantial costs to restart the plant, the plant could be shut down. Furthermore, a shut-down or failure at any other nuclear plant could cause regulators to require a shut-down or reduced availability at Quad Cities Station.In addition, issues relating to the disposal of nuclear waste material, including the availability, unavailability and expense of a permanent repository for spent nuclear fuel could adversely impact operations as well as the cost and ability to decommission nuclear plants, including Quad Cities Station, in the future.•Regulatory Risk - The NRC may modify, suspend or revoke licenses and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with applicable Atomic Energy Act regulations or the terms of the licenses of nuclear facilities. Unless extended, the NRC operating licenses for Quad Cities Station will expire in 2032. Changes in regulations by the NRC could require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or result in increased operating or decommissioning costs.•Nuclear Accident and Catastrophic Risks - Accidents and other unforeseen catastrophic events have occurred at nuclear facilities other than Quad Cities Station, both in the United States and elsewhere, such as at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. The consequences of an accident or catastrophic event can be severe and include loss of life and property damage. Any resulting liability from a nuclear accident or catastrophic event could exceed MidAmerican Energy's resources, including insurance coverage.Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to the risk that customers will not renew their contracts or that our subsidiaries will be unable to obtain new customers for expanded capacity, each of which could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.Substantially all of the Pipeline Companies' revenues are generated under transportation and storage contracts that periodically must be renegotiated and extended or replaced, and the Pipeline Companies are dependent upon relatively few customers for a substantial portion of their revenue. If our subsidiaries are unable to renew, remarket, or find replacements for their customer agreements on favorable terms, our sales volumes and operating revenue would be exposed to reduction and increased volatility. For example, without the benefit of long-term transportation agreements, we cannot assure that the Pipeline Companies will be able to transport natural gas at efficient capacity levels. Similarly, without long-term power purchase agreements, we cannot assure that our unregulated power generators will be able to operate profitably. Failure to maintain existing long-term agreements or secure new long-term agreements, or being required to discount rates significantly upon renewal or replacement, could adversely affect our consolidated financial results. The replacement of any existing long-term agreements depends on market conditions and other factors that may be beyond our subsidiaries' control. Our subsidiaries are subject to counterparty credit risk, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.Our subsidiaries are subject to counterparty credit risk related to contractual payment obligations with wholesale suppliers, customers and, as is the case for MidAmerican Energy, other participants in organized RTO markets. Adverse economic conditions or other events affecting counterparties with whom our subsidiaries conduct business could impair the ability of these counterparties to meet their payment obligations. Our subsidiaries depend on these counterparties to remit payments on a timely basis. We continue to monitor the creditworthiness of our wholesale suppliers and customers in an attempt to reduce the impact of any potential counterparty default. If strategies used to minimize these risk exposures are ineffective or if any of our subsidiaries' wholesale suppliers' or customers' financial condition deteriorates or they otherwise become unable to pay, it could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial results. 47Transactional activities of MidAmerican Energy and other participants in organized RTO markets are governed by credit policies specified in each respective RTO's governing tariff and related business practices. Credit policies of RTO's, which have been developed through extensive stakeholder participation, generally seek to minimize potential loss in the event of a market participant default without unnecessarily inhibiting access to the marketplace. In the event of a default by an RTO market participant on its market-related obligations, losses are typically allocated among all other market participants in proportion to each participant's share of overall market activity during the period of time the loss was incurred. Because of this, MidAmerican Energy has potential indirect exposure with respect to the creditworthiness of every other market participant in the RTO markets where it actively participates, including the MISO, the PJM, Interconnection, L.L.C. and the ERCOT. Our subsidiaries are subject to counterparty performance risk, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.Our subsidiaries are subject to counterparty performance risk related to performance of contractual obligations by wholesale suppliers, customers, contractors and, as is the case for MidAmerican Energy, other participants in organized RTO markets. Each subsidiary relies on wholesale suppliers to deliver commodities, primarily natural gas, coal and electricity, in accordance with short- and long-term contracts. Failure or delay by suppliers to provide these commodities pursuant to existing contracts could disrupt the delivery of electricity and require the Utilities to incur additional expenses to meet customer needs. In addition, when these contracts terminate, the Utilities may be unable to purchase the commodities on terms equivalent to the terms of current contracts.Our subsidiaries rely on wholesale customers to take delivery of the energy they have committed to purchase. Failure of customers to take delivery may require these subsidiaries to find other customers to take the energy at lower prices than the original customers committed to pay. If our subsidiaries' wholesale customers are unable to fulfill their obligations, there may be a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial results.Generally, a single customer purchases the energy from our independent power projects in the United States and the Philippines pursuant to long-term power purchase agreements. Without performance by the counterparties under these agreements, we cannot assure that our unregulated power generators will be able to operate profitably.Inflation and changes in commodity prices and fuel transportation costs may adversely affect our consolidated financial results.Inflation and increases in commodity prices and fuel transportation costs may affect our businesses by increasing both operating and capital costs. As a result of existing rate agreements, contractual arrangements or competitive price pressures, our subsidiaries may not be able to pass the costs of inflation on to their customers. If our subsidiaries are unable to manage cost increases or pass them on to their customers, our consolidated financial results could be adversely affected.Poor performance of plan and fund investments and other factors impacting the pension and other postretirement benefit plans and nuclear decommissioning and mine reclamation trust funds could unfavorably impact our cash flows and liquidity.Costs of providing our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans depend upon a number of factors, including the rates of return on plan assets, the level and nature of benefits provided, discount rates, the interest rates used to measure required minimum funding levels, changes in benefit design, tax deductibility and funding limits, changes in laws and government regulation and our required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. Certain of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are in underfunded positions. Even if sustained growth in the investments over future periods increases the value of these plans' assets, we will likely be required to make significant cash contributions to fund these plans in the future. Additionally, our plans have investments in domestic and foreign equity and debt securities and other investments that are subject to loss. Losses from investments could add to the volatility, size and timing of future contributions. Furthermore, the Pension Protection Act of 2006, as amended, may result in more volatility in the amount and timing of future pension contributions.In addition, MidAmerican Energy is required to fund over time the projected costs of decommissioning Quad Cities Station, a nuclear power plant. Funds MidAmerican Energy has invested in a nuclear decommissioning trust are invested in debt and equity securities and poor performance of these investments will reduce the amount of funds available for their intended purpose, which could require MidAmerican Energy to make additional cash contributions. Such cash funding obligations, which are also impacted by the other factors described above, could have a material impact on MidAmerican Energy's liquidity by reducing its available cash. 48We own investments and projects located in foreign countries that are exposed to increased economic, regulatory and political risks. We own and may acquire significant energy-related investments and projects outside of the United States. In addition to any disruption in the global financial markets, the economic, regulatory and political conditions in some of the countries where we have operations or are pursuing investment opportunities may present increased risks related to, among others, inflation, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, currency repatriation restrictions, nationalization, renegotiation, privatization, availability of financing on suitable terms, customer creditworthiness, construction delays, business interruption, political instability, civil unrest, guerilla activity, terrorism, expropriation, trade sanctions, contract nullification and changes in law, regulations or tax policy. We may not be capable of either fully insuring against or effectively hedging these risks. We are exposed to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.Our business operations and investments outside the United States increase our risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the British pound. Our principal reporting currency is the United States dollar, and the value of the assets and liabilities, earnings, cash flows and potential distributions from our foreign operations changes with the fluctuations of the currency in which they transact. We may selectively reduce some foreign currency exchange rate risk by, among other things, requiring contracted amounts be settled in, or indexed to, United States dollars or a currency freely convertible into United States dollars, or hedging through foreign currency derivatives. These efforts, however, may not be effective and could negatively affect our consolidated financial results. We may not be able to obtain sufficient dollars or other hard currency or available dollars may not be allocated to pay such obligations, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.Cyclical fluctuations in the residential real estate brokerage and mortgage businesses could adversely affect HomeServices.The residential real estate brokerage and mortgage industries tend to experience cycles of greater and lesser activity and profitability and are typically affected by changes in economic conditions, which are beyond HomeServices' control. Any of the following, among others, are examples of items that could have a material adverse effect on HomeServices' businesses by causing a general decline in the number of home sales, sale prices or the number of home financings which, in turn, would adversely affect its financial results:•rising interest rates or unemployment rates, including a sustained high unemployment rate in the United States;•periods of economic slowdown or recession in the markets served;•decreasing home affordability; •lack of available mortgage credit for potential homebuyers, such as the reduced availability of credit, which may continue into future periods;•declining demand for residential real estate as an investment;•nontraditional sources of new competition; and•changes in applicable tax law.Disruptions in the financial markets could affect our and our subsidiaries' ability to obtain debt financing or to draw upon or renew existing credit facilities and have other adverse effects on us and our subsidiaries.Disruptions in the financial markets could affect our and our subsidiaries' ability to obtain debt financing or to draw upon or renew existing credit facilities and have other adverse effects on us and our subsidiaries. Significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the United States, Great Britain and global credit markets, such as those that occurred in 2008 and 2009, may materially impact liquidity in the bank and debt capital markets, making financing terms less attractive for borrowers that are able to find financing and, in other cases, may cause certain types of debt financing, or any financing, to be unavailable. Additionally, economic uncertainty in the United States or globally may adversely affect the United States' credit markets and could negatively impact our and our subsidiaries' ability to access funds on favorable terms or at all. If we or our subsidiaries are unable to access the bank and debt markets to meet liquidity and capital expenditure needs, it may adversely affect the timing and amount of our capital expenditures, acquisition financing and our consolidated financial results. 49We and our subsidiaries are involved in a variety of legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are uncertain and could adversely affect our consolidated financial results.We and our subsidiaries are, and in the future may become, a party to a variety of legal proceedings. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcome of individual matters with certainty. It is possible that the final resolution of some of the matters in which we and our subsidiaries are involved could result in additional material payments substantially in excess of established reserves or in terms that could require us or our subsidiaries to change business practices and procedures or divest ownership of assets. Further, litigation could result in the imposition of financial penalties or injunctions and adverse regulatory consequences, any of which could limit our ability to take certain desired actions or the denial of needed permits, licenses or regulatory authority to conduct our business, including the siting or permitting of facilities. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.Potential changes in accounting standards may impact our consolidated financial results and disclosures in the future, which may change the way analysts measure our business or financial performance.The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") and the SEC continuously make changes to accounting standards and disclosure and other financial reporting requirements. New or revised accounting standards and requirements issued by the FASB or the SEC or new accounting orders issued by the FERC could significantly impact our consolidated financial results and disclosures.Item 1B.Unresolved Staff CommentsNot applicable.
