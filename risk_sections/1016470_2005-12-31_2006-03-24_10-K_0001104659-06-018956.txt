Item 1A. Risk Factors We are exposed to risks in our licensing business related to product and customer concentration. Currently, our licensing revenue is concentrated in the home theater market with the majority of revenue generated from the inclusion of SRS technology inside televisions, DVD players and set-top boxes. We expect that the consumer home entertainment market will continue to account for a significant portion of our licensing revenues for the foreseeable future. While consumer spending in general on consumer electronic products has increased, retail prices for certain consumer electronics products that include our audio technology, such as DVD players, have decreased significantly. Indications are that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future. From time to time, certain of our OEM and semiconductor manufacturer customers may account for a significant portion of revenue from a particular product application, such as DVD players, set-top boxes or televisions. Consumer electronics products manufacturers could decide to exclude our audio rendering technology from their home theater products altogether in an effort to reduce cost. The loss of any such customer could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our business is highly dependent on the consumer electronics market, which is characterized by short product life cycles, fluctuations in demand and seasonality, and is subject to risks related to product transitions and supply of other components. The consumer electronics market is characterized by intense competition, rapidly evolving technology, and ever-changing consumer preferences. These factors result in the frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles and significant price competition. The dynamic nature of this market limits our, as well as our customers ability to accurately forecast quarterly and annual sales. If we, or our customers, are unable to manage product transitions, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected. Pricing pressures on the consumer electronics product manufacturers, who incorporate our technologies into their products, could limit the licensing fees we charge for our technologies, which could adversely affect our revenues. The markets for the consumer electronics products in which our technologies are incorporated are intensely competitive and price sensitive. Retail prices for consumer electronics products that include our technologies, such as DVD players and home theater systems, have decreased significantly, and we expect prices to continue to decrease for the foreseeable future. In response, manufacturers have sought to reduce their product costs, which can result in downward pressure on the licensing fees we charge our customers who incorporate our technologies. A decline in the licensing fees we charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results. We conduct operations in a number of countries and are subject to risks of international operations, particularly in Asia and the Peoples Republic of China. We have significant operations in Hong Kong, the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) and other parts of Asia that require refinement to adapt to the changing market conditions in those regions. Our 15 operations in Asia, and international operations in general, are subject to risks of unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements. Our customers geographically located in the Asia Pacific markets accounted for approximately 89%, 86%, and 91% of total Company sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively and are expected to continue to account for a substantial percentage of sales in the future. The economic climate in Asia continues to be impacted by increases in unemployment, declines in consumer spending, currency devaluation and bank failures. Any of these factors, should they continue, could significantly reduce the demand for the end user goods in which our products and technologies are used. The PRC economy has experienced significant growth in the past decade; but such growth has been uneven across geographic and economic sectors. There can be no assurance that such growth will continue or that any potential currency devaluation in the region will not have a negative effect on our business, including Valence. The PRC economy has also experienced deflation in the past, which may continue in the future. The current economic situation may adversely affect our profitability over time as expenditures for consumer electronics products and information technology may decrease due to the results of slowing domestic demand and deflation. Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of the PRC with its own government and legislature. Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy from the PRC under the principle of one country, two systems. It is possible that Hong Kong may not continue to enjoy autonomy from the PRC. The Hong Kong dollar has remained relatively constant due to the U.S. dollar peg and currency board system that has been in effect in Hong Kong since 1983. Since mid-1997, interest rates in Hong Kong have fluctuated significantly and real estate and retail sales have declined. It is possible that the Hong Kong economy may deteriorate or that the historical currency peg of the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar may not be maintained. Continued declining consumer spending in Hong Kong, deflation or the discontinuation of the currency peg could adversely affect our business. Our ability to generate revenues and meet with customers may be effected by widespread illness Widespread illnesses such as the SARS illness and the Avian Influenza, or Asia Bird Flu, could impact our operations or our consumer electronics licensees operations. For example, our ability to visit our customers, our ability to conduct sales meetings or presentations, and sell through rates of electronics products to end consumers may be dramatically effected by either widespread or perceived potential illnesses. We are uncertain of the total costs associated with the planned divestiture of Valence. In order for us to focus on our licensing business, our Board approved on February 23, 2006 the sale of our semiconductor business. In connection with such sale, the Company may incur cash and non-cash accounting charges, which at the present cannot be reasonably estimated. The timing and amount of the net charges may have a negative impact to the statement of operations. If the sale of consumer electronics products incorporating our technologies does not grow in emerging markets, our ability to increase our licensing revenue may be limited. We also expect that growth in our licensing revenue will depend, in part, upon the growth of sales of consumer electronics products incorporating our technologies in other countries, including China and India, as consumers in these markets have more disposable income and are increasingly purchasing entertainment products with surround sound capabilities. However, if our licensing revenue from the use of our technologies in these new markets or geographic areas does not expand, our prospects could be adversely affected. 16 We have a long and unpredictable sales cycle, which can result in uncertainty and delays in generating additional revenues. Historically, because of the complexity of our technologies, it can take a significant amount of time and effort to explain the benefits of our technologies and to negotiate a sale. For example, it typically takes six to nine months after our first contact with a prospective customer before we start licensing our technology to that customer. In addition, purchases of our products are usually made in connection with new design starts, the timing of which is outside of our control. Accordingly, we may be unable to predict accurately the timing of any significant future sales of our products. We may also spend substantial time and management attention on potential license agreements that are not consummated, thereby foregoing other opportunities. If our patents and other intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our products, we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably. Our ability to compete may be affected by our ability to protect our proprietary information. We have filed numerous U.S. and foreign patent applications and to date have a number of issued U.S. and foreign patents covering various aspects of our technologies. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent, as do the laws of the U.S. It is possible that third parties may assert claims or initiate litigation against us or our customers with respect to existing or future products. In addition, we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights. If we lose the services of our key personnel, or if we are unable to attract and retain other key personnel, we may not be able to manage our operations or meet our growth objectives. Our future success depends to a large extent upon the continued service of key personnel, including engineering, sales and marketing staff, and highly skilled semiconductor design staff. We anticipate that any future growth will require us to recruit and hire a number of new personnel in engineering, operations, finance, sales and marketing. Competition for such personnel can be intense, and it is possible that we may not be able to recruit and retain necessary personnel to operate our business and support future growth. The market price of our common stock is volatile and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value. The trading price of our common stock has been, and will likely continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in our operating results, announcements of new products or technological innovations by us or our competitors, strategic alliances between us and third parties, general market fluctuations and other events and factors. Changes in earnings estimates made by brokerage firms and industry analysts relating to the markets in which we do business, or relating to us specifically, have in the past resulted in, and could in the future result in, an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of the common stock. Even though our stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market, our stock has had and may continue to have low trading volume and high volatility. The historically low trading volume of our stock makes it more likely that a severe fluctuation in volume, either up or down, will significantly impact the stock price. Since our shares are thinly traded, our shareholders may have difficulty selling our common stock. 17 Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage transactions resulting in a change in control, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that might enable our management to discourage, delay or prevent change in control. In addition, these provisions could limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. We face intense competition from companies with greater brand recognition and resources. The digital audio, consumer electronics, and entertainment markets are intensely competitive, subject to rapid change, and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants Many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, including: · greater name recognition; · a longer operating history; · more developed distribution channels and deeper relationships with semiconductor and consumer electronics products manufacturers; · a more extensive customer base; · broader product and service offerings; · greater resources for competitive activities, such as research and development, strategic acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, sales and marketing, and lobbying industry and government standards; and · more technicians and engineers. As a result, these current and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or customer requirements.
