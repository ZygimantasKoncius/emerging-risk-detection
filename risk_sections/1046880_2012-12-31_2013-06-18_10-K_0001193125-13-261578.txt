Item 1A. Risk Factors. Risks Related to Our Business The Plan of Reorganization and the transactions related thereto, which included transactions that modified our capital structure, were based in large part upon assumptions and analyses developed by us. If these assumptions and analyses prove to be incorrect, our plan may be unsuccessful in its execution and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. The Plan of Reorganization and the transactions related thereto, included transactions that modified our capital structure, which were based upon assumptions and analyses based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we considered appropriate under the circumstances. Whether actual future results and developments will be consistent with our expectations and assumptions depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to: (i) our ability to obtain adequate liquidity and financing sources and establish an appropriate level of debt, (ii) our ability to restore customers confidence in our viability as a continuing entity and to attract and retain sufficient customers; (iii) our ability to retain key employees in those businesses that we intend to continue to emphasize; (iv) our ability to obtain local credit support for our non-U.S. operating subsidiaries, and (v) the overall strength and stability of general economic conditions, both in the United States and in global markets and the other matters referred to under Forward Looking Statements. The failure of any of these factors could materially adversely affect the successful execution of the restructuring of our businesses. In addition, the Plan of Reorganization relied upon financial forecasts, including with respect to revenue growth, improved earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, improved interest margins, and growth in cash flow. Financial forecasts are necessarily speculative, and it is likely that one or more of the assumptions and estimates that are the basis of these financial forecasts will not be accurate. Accordingly, we expect that our actual financial condition and results of operations will differ, perhaps materially, from what we have anticipated. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the results or developments contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization will occur or, even if they do occur, that they will have the anticipated effects on us and our subsidiaries or our businesses or operations. The failure of any such results or developments to materialize as anticipated could materially adversely affect the successful execution of the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization. We operate in highly competitive industries. The alcoholic beverages production and distribution industries in our markets are intensely competitive. The principal competitive factors in these industries include product range, pricing, distribution capabilities and responsiveness to consumer preferences, with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the market and the product. In Poland, we have seen significant growth of sales through the key account and discounters channels. These channels tend to operate on lower price levels from producers such as us and therefore can contribute to lower gross and operating profit margins. In Russia, hypermarket and large retail chains continue to grow their share of the trade. Traditional trade outlets typically provide us with higher margins from sales as compared to hypermarkets and large retail chains. There is a risk that the expansion of hypermarkets and large retail chains will continue to occur in the future, thus reducing the margins that we may derive from sales to wholesalers that primarily serve the traditional trade. Additionally as our discount structure is a percent of our sales price to the customers as our prices increase to offset higher excise taxes the amount of rebate paid to our customers may continue to grow greater than what we can recover from the price increase if we cannot get the full price increase in place to offset this. As a manufacturer of vodka in Poland and Russia, we face competition from other local producers. We compete with other alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages for consumer purchases in general, as well as shelf space in retail stores, restaurant presence and distributor attention. In addition, we compete for customers on the basis of the brand strength of our products relative to our competitors products. Our success depends on maintaining the strength of our consumer brands by continuously improving our offerings and appealing to the changing needs and preferences of our customers and consumers. While we devote significant resources to the continuous improvement of our products and marketing strategies, it is possible that competitors may make similar improvements more rapidly or effectively, thereby adversely affecting our sales, margins and profitability. 19 Table of Contents Changes in the prices of supplies and raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business. Prices for raw materials used for vodka production may take place in the future, and our inability to pass on these increases to our customers could reduce our margins and profits and have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot assure you that the price of raw spirits will not continue to increase and cannot assure you that we will not lose the ability to maintain our inventory of raw spirits, either of which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as we may not be able to pass this cost on to the consumers. Over the last two years spirit prices have increased significantly in Russia resulting in approximately $16.0 million of higher annual cost of goods sold. Reliance on single source suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial results. In Russia, because we purchase spirits primarily from a single source, we have increased risks for supply disruptions and price increases. If we experience supply disruptions, we may not be able to develop alternative sourcing in a timely manner. Any disruption of our production schedule caused by a shortage of raw materials could adversely affect our business. If raw material suppliers increase prices, we may not be able to find an economically feasible alternative. Any increased cost caused by an increase in raw materials could adversely affect our financial results. If we are not able to hire and retain managers with the experience we need to run our businesses, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have a management team that is limited in size, and in the event our financial condition does not improve, we may not have sufficient expertise or depth to address the issues that may arise in a timely manner or at all. In addition, we are seeking to fill important management vacancies in our Russian operations and we cannot assure you that we will be able to hire and retain managers and executives with the requisite experience and skills. Our inability to retain key management or fill important management vacancies, or to possess or obtain the requisite depth and experience necessary to confront the challenges we may face, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to run our business and execute our business plan. We are exposed to exchange rate and interest rate movements that could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and comparability of our results between financial periods. Our functional currencies are the Polish zloty, Russian ruble and Hungarian forint. Our reporting currency, however, is the U.S. dollar, and the translation effects of fluctuations in exchange rates of our functional currencies into U.S. dollars may materially impact our financial condition and net income and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods. In addition, our senior secured notes, our convertible senior notes as well as certain borrowings are denominated in euros and U.S. dollars and the proceeds of the note issuances have been on-lent to certain of our operating subsidiaries that have the Polish zloty and Russian ruble as their functional currency. Movements in the exchange rate of the euro and U.S. dollar to Polish zloty and Russian ruble could therefore increase the amount of cash, in Polish zloty and Russian ruble, that must be generated in order to pay principal and interest on our notes. The impact of translation of our notes could have a material adverse effect on our reported earnings. The table below summarizes the pre-tax impact of a one percent movement in each of the exchange rates which could result in a significant impact in the results of our operations as of December 31, 2012. Exchange Rate Value of notional amount with accrued interests Pre-tax impact of a 1%movement in exchange rate USD-Polish zloty $386.9 million $3.9 million gain/loss USD-Russian ruble $267.3 million $2.7 million gain/loss EUR-USD 433.2 million or approximately $571.3 million $5.7 million gain/loss EUR-Russian ruble 29.6 million or approximately $39.0 million $0.4 million gain/loss Foreign exchange rates may be influenced by various factors, including changing supply and demand for a particular currency; government monetary policies (including exchange control programs, restrictions on local exchanges or markets and limitations on foreign investment in a country or on investment by residents of a country in other countries); changes in trade balances; trade restrictions; and currency devaluations and revaluations. Additionally, governments from time to time intervene in currency markets, directly or by regulation, in order to influence prices. These events and actions are unpredictable and could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Weather conditions may have a material adverse effect on our sales or on the price of grain used to produce spirits. We operate in an industry where performance is affected by the weather. Extreme changes in weather conditions may result in lower consumption of vodka and other alcoholic beverages. In particular, unusually cold spells in winter or high temperatures in the summer can result in temporary shifts in customer preferences and impact demand for the alcoholic beverages we produce and distribute. Similar weather conditions in the future may have a material adverse effect on our sales which could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, inclement weather may affect the availability of grain used to produce raw spirit, which could result in a rise in raw spirit pricing that could negatively affect margins and sales. 20 Table of Contents We are subject to extensive government regulation and are required to obtain and renew various permits and licenses; changes in or violations of laws or regulations or failure to obtain or renew permits and licenses could materially adversely affect our business and profitability. Our business of producing, importing and distributing alcoholic beverages in Poland and Hungary is subject to regulation by national and local governmental agencies and European Union authorities. In addition, our business in Russia is subject to extensive regulation by Russian authorities. These regulations and laws address such matters as licensing and permit requirements, regarding the production, storage and import of alcoholic products; competition and anti-trust matters; trade and pricing practices; taxes; distribution methods and relationships; required labeling and packaging; advertising; sales promotion; and relations with wholesalers and retailers. Loss of production capacity due to regulatory issues can negatively affect our sales and increase our operating costs as we attempt to increase production at other facilities during that time to offset the lost production. It is possible that these and other similar issues will adversely impact our sales and operating costs. Additionally, new or revised regulations or requirements or increases in excise taxes, customs duties, income taxes, or sales taxes could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to numerous environmental and occupational, health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. We may incur significant costs to maintain compliance with evolving environmental and occupational, health and safety requirements, to comply with more stringent enforcement of existing applicable requirements or to defend against challenges or investigations, even those without merit. Future legal or regulatory challenges to the industry in which we operate or our business practices and arrangements could give rise to liability and fines, or cause us to change our practices or arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on us, our revenues and our profitability. Governmental regulation and supervision as well as future changes in laws, regulations or government policy (or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations) that affect us, our competitors or our industry generally, strongly influence our viability and how we operate our business. Complying with existing laws, regulations and government policy is burdensome, and future changes may increase our operational and administrative expenses and limit our revenues. Additionally, governmental regulatory and tax authorities have a high degree of discretion and may at times exercise this discretion in a manner contrary to law or established practice. Such conduct can be more prevalent in jurisdictions with less developed or evolving regulatory systems like Russia. Our business would be materially and adversely affected if there were any adverse changes in relevant laws or regulations or in their interpretation or enforcement. Our ability to introduce new products and services may also be affected if we cannot predict how existing or future laws, regulations or policies would apply to such products or services. We are subject to Russian regulatory requirements that we obtain bank guarantees for the payment of statutory excise duties, the loss of which would have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition. Under Russian law, Russian manufacturers of alcohol and excisable ethanol containing products, prior to purchasing the ethanol for the purposes of manufacturing of alcohol and excisable ethanol containing products, are required to make an advance payment of the applicable statutory excise duty to the state budget in the Russian Federation. The statutory excise duty is to be made on the basis of the total volume of the alcohol / ethanol containing products to be purchased (transferred) by the manufacturers within the tax period following the current tax period. In order to be exempted from making an advance payment of the applicable statutory excise duty, the manufacturers shall submit to the tax authority of the place of registration of the manufacturers a bank guarantee issued by the relevant bank on behalf of the manufacturer and notify such tax authority of the exemption from the obligation to make the advance payment of the applicable statutory excise duty. A bank guarantee and a notice of exemption from making an advance payment of excise duty, must be submitted to the tax authority not later than on the 18th day of the current tax period. A bank guarantee must satisfy the following requirements: 1. must be irrevocable and non-transferable; 2. the duration of a bank guarantee must expire, at the earliest, three to six months following the tax period in which ethyl alcohol was purchased. If the duration of a bank guarantee ends before the expiry of the above time period, (i) exemption from the payment of an advance payment of excise duty shall not be granted, (ii) a note proving exemption from making an advance payment of excise duty shall not be made by the tax authority on the notice, and (iii) a notice of exemption from making an advance payment of excise duty shall not be forwarded by the manufacturer of alcoholic and/or excisable alcohol-containing products to the producer of ethyl alcohol. In the event of the discharge by a taxpayer that has presented a bank guarantee the duty of paying excise duty on the alcoholic and/or alcohol-containing products sold in Russia in the amount of the advance payment of excise duty mentioned in the submitted bank guarantee, the tax authority at the latest on the date following the end day of a desk audit of the tax declaration for excise tax shall notify the bank that has issued the guarantee of exemption thereof from the obligations under this guarantee; 21 Table of Contents 3. the amount for which a bank guarantee is granted must secure the discharge of the obligation to pay in full the amount of excise duty in the amount of an advance payment; and 4. a bank guarantee must allow for direct debiting of monetary assets from the guarantors account in case of its failure to satisfy in due time the demand for paying the monetary sum under the bank guarantee (in full or in part) forwarded before the end of the bank guarantees validity. The loss of a bank guarantee to pay the statutory excise duty will prevent our ability to purchase ethanol, a key component of our manufactured products and, thus, would have a material adverse impact on our business operations and future prospects. We may lose excise guarantee exemption in Poland In order to be exempted from making an advance payment of the applicable statutory excise duty, the manufacturers shall submit to the tax authority a bank guarantee issued by the relevant bank on behalf of the manufacturer. We are currently exempt from providing bank guarantees up to the limit of 700 million PLN. To retain the exemption we are obliged to timely submit to the tax authority statutory financial statements of CEDC International Sp. z o.o. If we do not submit the financial statements on time we may have difficulties in obtaining required bank guarantees. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights. We own and license trademarks (for, among other things, our product names and packaging) and other intellectual property rights that are important to our business and competitive position, and we endeavor to protect them. However, we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken or will take will be sufficient to protect our intellectual property rights or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate our trademarks or block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others. In addition, we cannot assure you that third parties will not infringe on or misappropriate our rights, imitate our products, or assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of ours or in marks that are similar to ours or marks that we license or market. In some cases, there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to our marks or to similar marks. Moreover, Russia generally offers less intellectual property protection than in Western Europe or North America. We are currently involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to trademarks similar to some of our brands and other proceedings, both in the Poland and elsewhere. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights against infringement or misappropriation, or if others assert rights in or seek to invalidate our intellectual property rights, this could materially harm our future financial results and our ability to develop our business. We have incurred, and may in the future incur, impairment charges on our other trademarks and goodwill At December 31, 2012, the Company had goodwill and other intangible assets of $842.9 million which constituted 48% of our total assets. While we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that future impairment charges will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur, especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe, or if acquisitions made by the Company fail to achieve expected returns. We incurred impairment charges in 2011 and each of the preceding two years and we recognized a significant impairment of goodwill and of other intangible assets for the fourth quarter of 2012. Additional impairment charges related to our goodwill and other intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Our import contracts and agency brands contracts and licenses may be terminated. As a leading importer of major international brands of alcoholic beverages in Poland and Hungary, we have been working with the same suppliers in those countries for many years and either have verbal understandings or written distribution agreements with them. In addition, we have distribution contracts in Russia through Whitehall. Where a written agreement is in place, it is usually valid for between one and five years and is terminable by either party on three to six months notice. Although we believe we are currently in compliance with the terms and conditions of our import and distribution agreements, there is no assurance that all our import agreements will continue to be renewed on a regular basis, or that, if they are terminated, we will be able to replace them with alternative arrangements with other suppliers. Moreover, our ability to continue to distribute imported products on an exclusive basis depends on some factors which are out of our control, such as ongoing consolidation in the wine, beer and spirit industry worldwide, or producers decisions from time to time to change their distribution channels, including in the markets in which we operate. Additionally, following the effectiveness of the Plan of Reorganization and the resulting change in control of the Company, import contract counterparties with our subsidiaries may seek to terminate such contracts due to such change of control. 22 Table of Contents Further, following effectiveness of the Plan of Reorganization and the resulting change in control of the Company our agency brand contracts and licenses may be subject to termination by the counterparties. The termination of these agency brands contracts or licenses would have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate. At any particular time, we may be in various stages of assessment, discussion and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions, not all of which will be consummated. We make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations. Acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties. If we complete one or more acquisitions, our results of operations and financial condition may be affected by a number of factors, including the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the financial results we have projected in either the near or long term; the assumption of unknown liabilities; the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed; the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls; the challenges of preparing and consolidating financial statements of acquired companies in a timely manner; the difficulties in integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies; and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions. In addition, we may acquire a significant, but non-controlling, stake in a business, which could expose us to the risk of decisions taken by the acquired business controlling shareholder. Acquisitions in developing economies, such as Russia, involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned above, including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks and the particular economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. We have acquired businesses in Russia and have experienced some of these risks, including difficulties in obtaining relevant financial information, hiring and retaining key management, and incurring significant losses and impairment charges. We cannot assure you that we will not experience the same or similar issues in the future. Future acquisitions or mergers may result in a need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability. Sustained periods of high inflation in Russia may materially adversely affect our business Russia has experienced periods of high levels of inflation since the early 1990s. Despite the fact that inflation has remained relatively stable in Russia during the past few years, our profit margins from our Russian business could be adversely affected if we are unable to sufficiently increase our prices to offset any significant future increase in the inflation rate. The developing legal system in Russia creates a number of uncertainties that could have a materially adverse effect on our business Russia is still developing the legal framework required to support a market economy, which creates uncertainty relating to our Russian business. We have limited experience operating in Russia, which could increase our vulnerability to the risks relating to these uncertainties. Risks related to the developing legal system in Russia include:  inconsistencies between and among the constitution, federal and regional laws, presidential decrees and governmental, ministerial and local orders, decisions, resolutions and other acts;  conflicting local, regional and federal rules and regulations;  the lack of judicial and administrative guidance on interpreting legislation;  the relative inexperience of judges and courts in interpreting legislation;  the lack of an independent judiciary;  a high degree of discretion on the part of governmental authorities, which could result in arbitrary or selective actions against us, including suspension or termination of licenses we need to operate in Russia;  poorly developed bankruptcy procedures that are subject to abuse; and  incidents of crime or corruption that could disrupt our ability to conduct our business effectively. The recent nature of much of Russian legislation, the lack of consensus about the scope, content and pace of economic and political reform and the rapid evolution of this legal system in ways that may not always coincide with market developments place the enforceability and underlying constitutionality of laws in doubt and result in ambiguities, inconsistencies and anomalies. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our Russian business. The tax system in Russia is unpredictable and gives rise to significant uncertainties, which complicate our tax planning and decisions relating to our Russian businesses. Tax laws in Russia have been in force for a relatively short period of time as compared to tax laws in more developed market economies and we have less experience operating under Russian tax regulations than those of other countries. 23 Table of Contents Russian companies are subject to a broad range of taxes imposed at the federal, regional and local levels, including but not limited to value added taxes, excise duties, profit taxes, payroll-related taxes, property taxes, and taxes or other liabilities related to transfer pricing and other taxes. Russias federal and local tax laws and regulations are subject to frequent change, varying interpretations and inconsistent or unclear enforcement. During the peak of our 2010 Christmas production season, we were unable to obtain excise stamps from Russian authorities to be used at our largest production plant in Russia due to an administrative issue, over usage of old stamps, that blocked us from obtaining new excise stamps. Excise stamps are typically purchased every two to three weeks from the Russian authorities and are required to be purchased prior to the production of any vodka. Without these stamps, which must be affixed to each container of an alcoholic beverage exceeding 9% alcohol by volume produced in Russia, this plant was unable produce vodka during the peak of our production season. This loss of production capacity negatively affected our sales and increased our costs as we attempted to increase production at other facilities to offset the lost production. It is possible that we could have similar issues in the future that will adversely impact our sales and costs. In addition, it is not uncommon for differing opinions regarding legal interpretation to exist between companies subject to such taxes, ministries and organizations of the Russian government and different branches of the Russian government such as the Federal Tax Service and its various local tax inspectorates, resulting in uncertainties and areas of conflict. Tax declarations are subject to review and investigation by a number of tax authorities, which are enabled by law to impose penalties and interest charges. The fact that a tax declaration has been audited by tax authorities does not bar that declaration, or any other tax declaration applicable to that year, from a further tax review by a superior tax authority during a three-year period. As previous audits do not exclude subsequent claims relating to the audited period, the statute of limitations is not entirely effective. In some instances, even though it may potentially be considered unconstitutional, Russian tax authorities have applied certain taxes retroactively. Within the past few years the Russian tax authorities appear to be taking a more aggressive position in their interpretation of the legislation and assessments, and it is possible that transactions and activities that have not been challenged in the past may be challenged. As a result, significant additional taxes, penalties and interest may be assessed. In addition, our Russian business is and will be subject to periodic tax inspections that may result in tax assessments and additional amounts owed by us for prior tax periods. Uncertainty relating to Russian transfer pricing rules could lead tax authorities to impose significant additional tax liabilities as a result of transfer pricing adjustments or other similar claims, and could have a material adverse effect on our Russian businesses and our company as a whole. Frequent changes in Polish tax regulations may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions. The Polish tax system is characterized by instability. Tax regulations are frequently amended, often to the disadvantage of taxpayers. Tax laws in Poland may also need to be amended in order to implement new European Union legislation. These frequent changes in tax regulations have had and may in the future have negative effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Further, the lack of stability in the Polish tax regulations may hinder our ability to effectively plan for the future and to implement our business plan. The instability of the Polish tax system stems not only from changes in law but also from reliance by tax regulators on court implementations, which are also subject to potential changes and reversal. Continued significant increases in excise tax in Russia may either reduce overall demand for vodka or reduce our margins. In January 2013, excise taxes for above 9% alcohol in Russia were increased by 33%. Excise taxes are scheduled to be increased by an additional 25% in July 2014. Excise tax increases require us to raise prices which could in turn reduce demand for our products as price-sensitive consumers shift to lower cost products. In addition, because our rebates to customers are based on a percentage of gross sales revenue, an increase in excise tax without a corresponding price increase will negatively impact our gross margins. We may be required to seek additional financing to meet our future capital needs and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, our business may require additional capital. In the future, it is possible that we will be required to raise additional funds through public or private financings, collaborative relationships or other arrangements. Global credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil, characterized by the bankruptcy, failure or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the U.S. and other governments. These events have led to unparalleled levels of volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets and have significantly adversely impacted global economic conditions, resulting in additional, significant recessionary pressures and further declines in investor confidence and economic growth. Despite significant government intervention, global investor confidence remains low and credit remains relatively scarce. These disruptions in the financial markets, including the bankruptcy and restructuring of certain financial institutions, may adversely impact the current availability of credit and the availability and cost of credit in the future. Accordingly, if we need to seek additional funding, we may be significantly reduced in our ability to attract public or private financings or financial partners or relationships as a source of additional capital. In addition, this additional funding, if needed, may not be available on terms attractive to us, if at all. Furthermore, any additional debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that could restrict our ability to raise additional capital or operate our business. Our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations. 24 Table of Contents The Company and certain of its former officers and directors were named as parties in class action lawsuits which could be costly, protracted and divert managements attention, and harm our business. On October 24, 2011, a class action complaint titled Steamfitters Local 449 Pension Fund vs. Central European Distribution Corporation, et al., was filed in the United States District Court, District of New Jersey on behalf of a putative class of all purchasers of our common stock from August 5, 2010 through February 28, 2011 against us and certain of our officers. The complaint seeks unspecified money damages and alleges violations of federal securities law in connection with alleged materially false and misleading statements and/or omissions regarding our business, financial results and prospects in our public statements and public filings with the SEC for the second and third quarters of 2010, relating to declines in our vodka portfolio, our need to take an impairment charge relating to the deterioration in fair value of certain of our brands in Poland and negative financial results from the launch of Żubrówka Biała. Subsequent to the above complaint, a second, substantially similar class action complaint titled Tim Schuler v. Central European Distribution Corporation, et al., was filed in the same court. By court orders dated August 22, 2012, the Steamfitters action and the Schuler action were consolidated and are now proceeding in the District of New Jersey under the caption In re Central European Distribution Corp. Securities Litigation, 11-cv-6247 (JBS-KMW). The Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System and the Fresno County Employees Retirement Association have been named lead plaintiffs in this action. Pursuant to an Order of the Court, on February 19, 2013, Lead Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on behalf of a purported class of all purchasers of the Companys common stock between March 1, 2010, and February 28, 2011, advancing similar allegations to those contained in the original complaints concerning purported materially false and misleading statements and/or omissions relating principally to the purported negative financial results from the launch of Żubrówka Biała. On April 10, 2013, the Court stayed the action as to CEDC pursuant to section 362 of chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) as a result of its April 7, 2013 filing of a voluntary petition (the Petition) for relief under the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the Bankruptcy Court). On May 13, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court conducted a hearing (the Confirmation Hearing) on (i) the adequacy of the Amended and Restated Offering Memorandum, Consent Solicitation Statement and Disclosure Statement Soliciting Acceptances of a Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization, dated March 8, 2013, as supplemented by Supplement No. 1 to the Amended and Restated Offering Memorandum, Consent Solicitation, and Disclosure Statement Soliciting Acceptances of a Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization, dated March 18, 2013 (Docket No. 10) (the Disclosure Statement), and (ii) confirmation of the Companys Second Amended and Restated Joint Prepackaged Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization (Docket No. 126) (the Plan). After the Confirmation Hearing the Bankruptcy Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order (I) Approving (A) the Disclosure Statement Pursuant to Sections 1125 and 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, (B) the Prepetition Solicitation Procedures, and (C) the Forms of Ballots, and (II) Confirming the Second Amended and Restated Joint Prepackaged Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Central European Distribution Corporation et al. (Docket No. 166) (the Confirmation Order). Upon entry of the Confirmation Order by the Bankruptcy Court, the Companys obligations with respect to this action were discharged and pursuant to the Plan (as modified by the Confirmation Order) and section 524 of the Bankruptcy Code, continuation of this action is permanently enjoined as to the Company. On June 8, 2012, a purported securities fraud class action titled Grodko v. Central European Distribution Corporation, et al., was filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiff in the lawsuit, who is suing purportedly on behalf of a class of all purchasers of the Companys common stock between March 1, 2010 and June 4, 2012, alleges that the Company made false and/or misleading statements related to and/or failed to disclose that (1) the Companys reported net sales in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011 were materially inflated; (2) as a result of a failure to account for retroactive trade rebates provided to the customers of Russian Alcohol, the Company anticipates restating its reported consolidated net sales, operating profit and related accounts for these periods; and (3) as a result of the foregoing, the Companys statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On August 7, 2012 a second, substantially similar class action complaint titled Puerto Rico System of Annuities and Pension for Teachers v. Central European Distribution Corporation, et al., was filed in the same court. By court orders dated September 4, 2012, the Grodko action and the Puerto Rico System of Annuities and Pension for Teachers action were transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, where the actions have been consolidated and are proceeding under the caption Grodko v. Central European Distribution Corporation, et. al, No. 12-cv-5530 (JBS-KMW). The Puerto Rico System of Annuities and Pensions for Teachers has been named Lead Plaintiff in this Action. On February 15, 2013, the Lead Plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint on behalf of a purported class of all purchasers of the Companys common stock between March 1, 2010, and November 13, 2012, advancing similar allegations to those contained in the original complaints concerning purported materially false and misleading statements and/or omissions relating principally to accounting practices at CEDCs Russian subsidiary Russian Alcohol Group, and the Companys related restatements. On April 10, 2013, the Court stayed the action as to CEDC pursuant to section 362 the Bankruptcy Code, as a result of its April 7, 2013 filing of the Petition for relief under the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. Upon entry of the Confirmation Order by the Bankruptcy Court, the Companys obligations with respect to this action were discharged and pursuant to the Plan (as modified by the Confirmation Order) and section 524 of the Bankruptcy Code, continuation of this action is permanently enjoined as to the Company. By complaints dated December 13, 2012, a single plaintiff filed two separate derivative actions against seven current and former CEDC directors, and against CEDC as a nominal defendant. The seven current and former directors named as defendants are: William Carey, Christopher Biedermann, David Bailey, Marek E. Forysiak, Markus Sieger, N. Scott Fine, Robert P. Koch and William S. Shanahan. These two actions were filed in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Burlington County, Chancery Division. Both complaints allege breaches of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, and unjust enrichment. One complaint deals with alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The other complaint deals with alleged GAAP violations resulting from the Russian Alcohol Group trade rebate issue. Plaintiff is still in the process of attempting to effectuate service of the complaints by defendants. By orders dated April 30, 2013, the Court dismissed these derivative actions without prejudice and subject to reinstatement if the bankruptcy proceedings do not fully dispose of the issues between the parties. The Company intends to mount a vigorous defense to the claims asserted. Although we believe the allegations in the class and derivative complaints are without merit, these types of lawsuits can be protracted, time-consuming, distracting to management and expensive and, whether or not the claims are ultimately successful, could ultimately have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and cash flows. As noted in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2011, filed with the SEC on October 5, 2012, the Audit Committee, through its counsel, voluntarily notified the SEC of its internal investigation regarding the Companys retroactive trade rebates, trade marketing refunds and related accounting issues. The Company has subsequently been contacted by the Fraud Division of the Criminal Division of the US Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding the disclosure in the Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2011, filed with the SEC on October 5, 2012 that there has been a breach of the books and records provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of the United States and potentially other breaches of the FCPA. The Company has been asked to provide information about these matters on a voluntary basis to the SEC and DOJ. The Company is fully cooperating with the SEC and DOJ. Any action by the SEC or DOJ could result in criminal or civil sanctions against the Company and/or certain of its current or former officers, directors or employees. The Company cannot predict the duration, scope or ultimate outcome of the investigations and is unable to estimate the financial impact they may have, or predict the reporting periods in which any such financial impacts may be recorded. Our results are linked to economic conditions and shifts in consumer preferences, including a reduction in the consumption of alcoholic beverages, which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. Our results of operations are affected by the overall economic trends in Poland, Russia, Hungary and other regions in which we operate and sell our products, including the level of consumer spending, the rate of taxes levied on alcoholic beverages and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. The current market environment including consumer trends, raw spirit price increases, excise increases, volatility in energy costs, diminished liquidity and credit availability, weakened consumer confidence and falling consumer demand, have contributed to lower levels of consumer spending, including consumption of alcoholic beverages. The effects of the global recession in many countries, including Russia and Hungary, have been quite severe, and it is possible that an economic recovery in those countries, and a related increase in consumer spending, will take longer to develop. While Polands GDP has increased in each of 2011 and 2012, the Polish economy as well as the global economy continues to be volatile and forecasted growth in Poland may fail to materialize. 25 Table of Contents During the current period of volatility, reduced consumer confidence and spending may result in continued reduced demand for our products and may limit our ability to increase prices and finance marketing and promotional activities. These factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, during 2012 the Company observed an overall market environment of declining vodka consumption and significant price sensitivities in its core markets of Poland and Russia. Additionally the Company experienced other key changes in market conditions, including changing of sales channel and product mix. As such, the Company updated its goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter of 2012 and took a charge of $327.8 million for goodwill impairment in Poland and Russia for the year. We also experienced the related underperformance of certain brands in Russia, primarily Kaufman, Zhuravli and Parliament. As a result, the Company also took an impairment charge for certain Russian trademarks, due to the continued lower performance as compared to our expectations in 2012. We cannot assure you that we will not recognize further asset impairments or experience further declines in our financial performance in connection with continued market instability. A continued recessionary environment would likely make it more difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments, and a major shift in consumer preferences or a large reduction in sales of alcoholic beverages could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business is subject to seasonality that may affect our quarterly operating results. Our business is dependent on weather conditions and subject to seasonality. Lower demand for vodka occurs during the first three fiscal quarters, which can result in seasonal financial results in certain markets in which we operate. Historically, sales in the fourth quarter have been significantly higher than in the other quarters of the year due to higher demand for vodka during the Christmas season. Results of a single financial quarter might therefore not be a reliable basis for the expectations of a full fiscal year and may not be comparable with the results in the other financial quarters. Seasonality effects may also increase our working capital requirements. In addition, any interruptions during our peak production season, such as those interruptions we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2010 in obtaining excise stamps from Russian authorities to produce and sell our product in Russia for a 14-day period, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations if they occur with unusual intensity or last for an extended period of time. Risks related to Our Financial Reporting We have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. As a result of managements assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, management concluded that there were nine material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, specifically in relation to our financial statement closing process, the development of certain management estimates, our internal controls with respect to the recording of retroactive trade rebates and trade marketing refunds at Russian Alcohol Group, our internal control over financial reporting regarding the implementation of our policy on compliance with applicable laws, our internal control over the design of IT segregation of duties, our internal control over the proper design and communication of policies and procedures, our internal control over accounting for certain material executive compensations and over the contract management, controls over completeness and accuracy of the income tax calculation, tax provision and deferred income tax. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. While we have identified nine material weaknesses, we believe that our consolidated audited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. While we are taking action to remediate our identified material weaknesses, the decentralized nature of our operations and the manual nature of many of our controls increases our risk of control deficiencies. No evaluation can provide complete assurance that our internal controls will detect or uncover all failures of persons within our company to disclose material information otherwise required to be reported. The effectiveness of our controls and procedures could also be limited by simple errors or faulty judgments. We may in the future identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in connection with our internal controls over financial reporting. Any future material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Moreover, any future disclosures of additional material weaknesses, or errors as a result of those weaknesses, could result in a negative reaction in the financial markets if there is a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting. Management continues to devote significant time and attention to improving our internal controls, and we will continue to incur costs associated with implementing appropriate processes, which could include fees for additional audit and consulting services, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, is currently unable to inspect the audit work and practices of auditors operating in Poland, including our auditor. Auditors of U.S. public companies are required by law to undergo periodic PCAOB inspections that assess their compliance with U.S. law and professional standards in connection with performance of audits of financial statements filed with the SEC. Certain European Union, or EU, countries do not permit the PCAOB to conduct inspections of accounting firms established and operating in 26 Table of Contents EU countries, even if they are part of major international firms. Accordingly, because our auditor is located in Poland, the PCAOB is prevented from inspecting our auditor. As a result, unlike the stockholders of most U.S. public companies, our stockholders are deprived of the possible benefits of such inspections, including an evaluation of our auditors performance of audits and its quality control procedures. 27 Table of Contents Following the effectiveness of the Plan of Reorganization, our remaining indebtedness may impair our financial condition and our ability to grow and compete; we may also incur additional debt. As of December 31, 2012, our total consolidated debt was approximately $1.4 billion. After giving effect to the Plan of Reorganization, our total consolidated debt is approximately $798.7 million on a pro forma basis as of September 30, 2012. Though the Plan of Reorganization significantly lowered our consolidated debt, we still have substantial debt upon consummation of the Plan of Reorganization. Our debt has important consequences for our financial condition, including:  making it more difficult for us to satisfy the obligations under the New Notes;  making it more difficult to refinance our obligations as they come due;  having an inefficient tax structure;  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic, competitive and industry conditions;  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, execute our business strategy, acquisitions, operations and other general corporate requirements;  limiting our ability to make strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;  requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, execution of our business strategy, acquisitions, operations, working capital and general corporate requirements;  limiting our ability to purchase raw materials on satisfactory credit terms, thereby limiting our sources of supply or increasing cash required to fund operations;  limiting our ability to retain and attract customers;  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and  limiting our ability to receive trade credit from our vendors or otherwise placing us at a competitive disadvantage to other less-leveraged competitors. We may incur additional debt in the future. The terms of the indentures that govern the New Notes restrict our ability to incur, but will not prohibit us from incurring, additional debt. If we were to incur additional debt, the related risks we now face could become greater. Servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends upon many factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our debt, fund planned capital expenditures and execute our business strategy depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future. To some extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to meet our cash needs, including with respect to the repayment of our indebtedness, including any cash payments due upon the maturity of such indebtedness, including the New Notes. If we are unable to service our debt or experience a significant reduction in our liquidity, we could be forced to reduce or delay planned capital expenditures and other initiatives, sell assets, restructure or refinance our debt or seek additional equity capital, and we may be unable to take any of these actions on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner, or at all. Further, any of these actions may not be sufficient to allow us to service our debt obligations or may have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our existing debt agreements, and the indentures governing the New Notes, limit our ability to take certain of these actions. Our failure to generate sufficient operating cash flows to pay our debts or refinance our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, including the New Notes, we would be in default, and as a result, holders of such debt could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable and our existing and future lenders could, under certain circumstances, terminate their commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing our borrowings. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources. 28 Table of Contents We may not be able to raise additional capital in the future. We may need to obtain additional financing to fund our business, and we cannot assure you that such financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The current recessionary global market and economic conditions, as well as the continuing difficulties in the credit and capital markets, may make it even more difficult for companies to obtain additional financing in the future or refinance their obligations, particularly for companies with a credit profile similar to ours. The Plan of Reorganization, and the potential effects of this on our reputation could make it difficult or more expensive for us to raise additional funds. If we raise funds by incurring further debt, our operations and finances may become subject to further restrictions and we may be required to limit or cease our operations or capital expenditure activities, or otherwise modify our business strategy. If we fail to comply with financial or other covenants required in connection with any such financing or refinancing, our lenders may be able to exercise remedies that could substantially impair our ability to operate or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We have incurred significant costs in conducting the Plan of Reorganization. The Plan of Reorganization will result in significant costs to us, including advisory and professional fees paid in connection with evaluating our alternatives with respect to our capital structure and pursuing the Plan of Reorganization. 29 Table of Contents RTL is the controlling stockholder in CEDC. Upon effectiveness of the Plan of Reorganization, RTL became the beneficial owner of 100% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, RTL will possess significant influence, giving it the ability, among other things, to control the composition of our board of directors. RTLs ownership and control may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a future change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer. 30 Table of Contents
