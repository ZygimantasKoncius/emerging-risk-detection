Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) or more material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting that cannot be remediated in a timely manner, we may be unable to assert that our internal control is effective. While our assessment (as reported in Item 9A of this Report) is that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010, the effectiveness of our internal control in future periods cannot be assured, and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting may deteriorate. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of any future date, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
