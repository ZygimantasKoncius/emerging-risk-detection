Executive Officers are eligible for variable compensation under a bonus plan.

The amounts set aside or accrued by the Company in 2005 to provide pension, retirement or similar benefits totaled Ch$ 227 million. No severance indemnities were paid in 2005 to the companys Executive Officers. C. Board practices Corporate Governance Endesa Chile is managed by its Executive Officers under the direction of its Board of Directors which, in accordance with the estatutos, or articles of incorporation and bylaws, of Endesa Chile, consists of nine directors who are elected at the annual regular shareholders meeting. Each director serves for a three-year term and the term of each of the nine directors expires on the same day. Staggered terms are not permitted under Chilean law. If a vacancy occurs on the board during the three year term, the board of directors may appoint a temporary director to fill the vacancy. In addition, the vacancy will trigger an election for every seat on the board of directors at the next regular annual shareholders meeting. The current board of directors was elected in March 2004, nevertheless, in 108 2005 two vacancies occurred, and therefore, a new board of directors must be elected in the next annual regular shareholders meeting on 2006. See Item 6.ADirectors and Senior Management, for more details on the disclosure of the terms of the directorsoffices. The members of the board of directors do not have service contracts with Endesa Chile or any of its affiliates that provide benefits upon termination of employment. Chilean corporate law provides that a companys board of directors is responsible for the management, administration and representation of a company in all matters concerning its corporate purpose, subject to the provisions of the companys estatutos and the stockholders resolutions. In addition to the estatutos, the Board of Directors of Endesa Chile has adopted regulations and policies that guide our corporate governance principles. The most important of these regulations and policies are the following: The Internal Regulations on Conduct in Securities Markets was approved by the Board on June 2002, which determines the rules of conduct that must be followed by members of the Board of Directors, senior management and other managers and employees who, due to the nature of their job responsibilities, may have access to sensitive or confidential information, with a view to contributing to transparency and to the protection of investors. These regulations are based on the principles of impartiality, good faith, placing the companys interests before ones own, and care and diligence in using information and acting in the securities markets. The Charter Governing Executives (Estatuto del Directivo), approved by the Board in July 2003, and the Employees Code of Conduct, which develop our principles and values, establish the rules governing dealings with customers and suppliers, and establish the principles that should be followed by employees in their work: ethical conduct, professionalism and confidentiality. They also impose limitations on the activities our senior executives and other employees may undertake outside the scope of their employment with us, such as non-compete limitations. The above regulations and rules reflect our core principles of transparency, respect for stockholders rights, and the duty of care and loyalty of the directors imposed by Chilean law. Compliance with NYSE Listing Standards on Corporate Governance Following is a summary of the significant differences between our corporate governance practices and those applicable to domestic issuers under the corporate governance rules of the New York Stock Exchange. Independence and Functions of the Audit Committee Under the NYSE corporate governance rules, all members of the Audit Committee must be independent. We are subject to this requirement as of July 31, 2005. Under the NYSE corporate governance rules, the audit committee of a U.S. company must perform the functions detailed in the NYSE Listed Company Manual Rules 303A.06 and 303A.07. Non-U.S. companies have been required to comply with Rule 303A.06 beginning July 31, 2005. Non-U.S. companies are not required to comply with Rule 303A.07. As of July 31, 2005 we comply with both the independence and the functional requirements of Rule 303A.06. As required by the Sarbanes Oxley Act and the NYSE corporate governance rules, on June 29, 2005 the Board of Directors of Endesa Chile created an Audit Committee, composed of three directors meeting the independence requirements of the NYSE: Mr. José Fernandez O., Mr. Antonio Tuset J. and Mr. Enrique García A. Mr. José María Fernandez Olano, is relying on the exemption provided by Rule 10A-3(b)(1)(iv)(B). Mr. Fernandez Olano sits on the board of directors of Endesa Internacional, S.A., an affiliate of the Company. Mr. Fernandez Olano otherwise meets the independence requirements of Rule 10A-3(b)(1)(ii). As required by Chilean Law, Endesa Chile also has a Comité de Directores composed of three directors. Although Chilean Law requires that a majority of the Comité de Directores (two out of three members) must be composed of directors who were not nominated by the controlling shareholder and did not seek votes from the controlling shareholder (a non-control director), it permits the Comité de Directores to be composed of a majority or even a unanimity of control directors, if there are not sufficient non-control directors on the board to serve on the committee. Currently, our Comité de Directores is composed of one non-control director and of two directors appointed by the controlling shareholder. 109 Corporate Governance Guidelines The NYSEs corporate governance rules require U.S. listed companies to adopt and disclose corporate governance guidelines. Chilean law does not contemplate this practice, other than with respect to the codes of conduct described above. Committees and Other Advisory Bodies Directors Committee The Comité de Directores is composed of three members who are simultaneously directors of the Company. It performs the following functions:  examination of Annual Report, Financial Statements and the Reports of the External Auditors and Inspectors of the Accounts;  formulation of the proposal to the Board of Directors for the selection of external auditors and private rating agencies:  examination of information related to operations by the Company with related parties and/or related to operations in which the Company board members or relevant executive officers may have personal interest;  examination of the remuneration framework and compensation plans for managers and executive officers; and  any other function mandated to the committee by the estatutos, the board of directors or the shareholders of the company. The members of this Committee are Luis Rivera Novo, Jaime Bauzá Bauzá and Antonio Tuset Jorrat. D.
