1A. Risk Factors You should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this annual report could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In evaluating us, you should consider carefully, among other things, the factors and the specific risks set forth below, and in documents we incorporate by reference. This annual report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Because we have a limited operating history in certain of our operating areas, our future operating results are difficult to forecast, and our failure to sustain profitability in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We cannot assure you that we will maintain the current level of revenues, natural gas and crude oil reserves or production we now attribute to the properties contributed to us when we were formed and those developed and acquired since our formation. Any future growth of our natural gas and crude oil reserves, production and operations could place significant demands on our financial, operational and administrative resources. Our failure to sustain profitability in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Natural gas and crude oil prices fluctuate widely, and low prices could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend in part on prevailing natural gas and crude oil prices. Prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital. The amount we can borrow under our senior secured credit facilities is subject to periodic redetermination based in part on changing expectations of future prices. Lower prices may also reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can economically produce. While prices for natural gas and crude oil may be favorable at any point in time, they fluctuate widely. For example, the closing New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) wholesale price of natural gas was at a six-year low of approximately $1.83 per Mcf for October of 2001, reached an all-time high of approximately $13.91 per Mcf for October of 2005 and subsequently declined to $8.40 per Mcf for February of 2006. Among the factors that can cause these fluctuations are:  domestic and foreign demand for natural gas and crude oil;  the level of domestic and foreign natural gas and crude oil supplies;  the price and availability of alternative fuels;  weather conditions;  domestic and foreign governmental regulations;  political conditions in oil and gas producing regions; and  worldwide economic conditions. Due to the volatility of natural gas and crude oil prices and our inability to control the factors that affect natural gas and crude oil prices, we cannot predict whether prices will remain at current levels, increase or decrease in the future. 10 Table of Contents If natural gas or crude oil prices decrease or our exploration and development efforts are unsuccessful, we may be required to take writedowns. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The reported financial results and disclosures were developed using certain significant accounting policies, practices and estimates, which are discussed in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section in this annual report. We employ the full cost method of accounting whereby all costs associated with acquiring, exploring for, and developing natural gas and crude oil reserves are capitalized and accumulated in separate country cost centers. These capitalized costs are amortized based on production from the reserves for each country cost center. Each capitalized cost pool cannot exceed the net present value of the underlying natural gas and crude oil reserves. A write down of these capitalized costs could be required if natural gas and/or crude oil prices were to drop precipitously at a reporting period end. Future price declines or increased operating and capitalized costs without incremental increases in natural gas and crude oil reserves could also require us to record a write down. Reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate and any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves. The process of estimating natural gas and crude oil reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves disclosed in this annual report. In order to prepare these estimates, we and independent reserve engineers engaged by us must project production rates and timing of development expenditures. We and the engineers must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data, and the extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions with respect to natural gas and crude oil prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Therefore, estimates of natural gas and crude oil reserves are inherently imprecise. Actual future production, natural gas and crude oil prices and revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and crude oil reserves most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves disclosed in this annual report. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing natural gas and crude oil prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. At December 31, 2005, approximately 23% of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped. Undeveloped reserves, by their nature, are less certain. Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. Our reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves. Although we have prepared estimates of our natural gas and crude oil reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards and SEC requirements, we cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled or that actual results will be as estimated. You should not assume that the present value of future net revenues disclosed in this annual report is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and crude oil reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Any changes in consumption by natural gas and crude oil purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation will also affect actual future net cash flows. The timing of both the 11 Table of Contents production and the expenses from the development and production of natural gas and crude oil properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor. The effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with our business or the oil and gas industry in general will affect the accuracy of the 10% discount factor. Our production is concentrated in a small number of geographic areas. Approximately 57% of our 2005 production was from Michigan, approximately 29% was from Alberta, Canada and approximately 7% was from Texas. Because of our concentration in these geographic areas, any regional events that increase costs, reduce availability of equipment or supplies, reduce demand or limit production, including weather and natural disasters, may impact us more than if our operations were more geographically diversified. If our production levels were significantly reduced to levels below those for which we have entered into contractual delivery commitments, we would be required to purchase natural gas at market prices to fulfill our obligation under certain long-term contracts. This could adversely affect our cash flow to the extent any such shortfall related to our sales contracts with floor pricing. Our Canadian operations present unique risks and uncertainties, different from or in addition to those we face in our domestic operations. We conduct our Canadian operations through MGV. At December 31, 2005, our proved Canadian reserves were estimated to be 305 Bcf. Capital expenditures relating to MGVs operations are budgeted to be approximately $123 million in 2006, constituting approximately 22% of our total 2006 budgeted capital expenditures. If our revenues decrease as a result of lower natural gas or crude oil prices or otherwise, we may have limited ability to maintain this level of capital expenditures. While our results to date indicate that net recoverable reserves on CBM lands could be substantial, we can offer you no assurance that development will occur as scheduled or that actual results will be in accordance with estimates. Other risks of our operations in Canada include, among other things, increases in taxes and governmental royalties, changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies, currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations. Laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade and taxation may also adversely affect our Canadian operations. We may have difficulty financing our planned growth. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience substantial capital expenditure and working capital needs, particularly as a result of increases in our property acquisition and drilling activities. In the future, we will likely require additional financing in addition to cash generated from our operations to fund our planned growth. If revenues decrease as a result of lower natural gas or crude oil prices or otherwise, our ability to expend the capital necessary to replace our reserves or to maintain production of current levels may be limited, resulting in a decrease in production over time. If our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to satisfy our capital expenditure requirements, we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. In the event additional capital resources are unavailable, we may curtail our acquisition, development drilling and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis. We are vulnerable to operational hazards, transportation dependencies, regulatory risks and other uninsured risks associated with our activities. The oil and gas business involves operating hazards such as well blowouts, explosions, uncontrollable flows of crude oil, natural gas or well fluids, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, treatment plant downtime, 12 Table of Contents pipeline ruptures or spills, pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks, any of which could cause us to experience substantial losses. Also, the availability of a ready market for our natural gas and crude oil production depends on the proximity of reserves to, and the capacity of, natural gas and crude oil gathering systems, treatment plants, pipelines and trucking or terminal facilities. U.S. and Canadian federal, state and provincial regulation of oil and gas production and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce and market our natural gas and crude oil. In addition, we may be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners of properties purchased or leased by us. As a result of operating hazards, regulatory risks and other uninsured risks, we could incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities, the payment of which could reduce or eliminate funds available for exploration, development or acquisitions. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of such risks and losses in accordance with customary industry practice. Generally, environmental risks are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event that is not covered, or not fully covered, by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be unable to make additional acquisitions of producing properties or successfully integrate them into our operations. A portion of our growth in recent years has been due to acquisitions of producing properties. We expect to continue to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue acquisition opportunities on terms our management considers to be favorable to us. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions in the future, or that we will be able to finance these acquisitions on favorable terms or at all. In addition, we compete against other companies for acquisitions, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in the acquisition of any material producing property interests. Further, we cannot assure you that any future acquisitions that we make will be integrated successfully into our operations or will achieve desired profitability objectives. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of recoverable reserves, exploration potential, future natural gas and crude oil prices, operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities and other factors beyond our control. These assessments are inexact and their accuracy inherently uncertain and such a review may not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it necessarily permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their merits and deficiencies. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. In addition, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business depending upon the character of the acquired properties, which may be substantially different in operating and geological characteristics or geographic location than existing properties. While our current operations are located primarily in Michigan, Alberta, Canada, Texas, Indiana/Kentucky and the Rocky Mountains, we cannot assure you that we will not pursue acquisitions of properties in other locations. The failure to replace our reserves could adversely affect our production and cash flows. Our future success depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional natural gas and crude oil reserves that are economically recoverable. Our proved reserves, a majority of which are in the mature Michigan Basin, will generally decline as reserves are depleted, except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. In order to increase reserves and production, we must continue our development drilling and recompletion programs or undertake other replacement activities. Our current strategy is to maintain our focus on low-cost operations while increasing our reserve base, production and cash flow through development and exploration of our existing properties and acquisitions of producing properties. We cannot assure you, however, that our planned exploration and 13 Table of Contents development projects and acquisition activities will result in significant additional reserves or that we will have continuing success drilling productive wells. Furthermore, while our revenues may increase if prevailing natural gas and crude oil prices increase significantly, our finding costs for additional reserves also could increase. We cannot control the activities on properties that we do not operate. As of December 31, 2005, other companies operated properties that included approximately 29% of our proved reserves. As a result, we have a limited ability to exercise influence over operations for these properties or their associated costs. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities. As a result, the success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others depend upon a number of factors that are outside of our control, including:  timing and amount of capital expenditures;  the operators expertise and financial resources;  approval of other participants in drilling wells; and  selection of technology. We cannot control the operations of gas processing and transportation facilities we do not own or operate. At December 31, 2005, other companies owned processing plants and pipelines that delivered approximately 64% of our natural gas production to market in Michigan. Our Canadian production is delivered to market primarily by either the TransCanada or ATCO systems. We have no influence over the operation of these facilities and must depend upon the owners of these facilities to minimize any loss of processing and transportation capacity. This risk was highlighted in 2003 by the shutdown of CMS Energy Inc.s and Michigan Consolidated Gas Co.s processing plants in Michigan that resulted in an approximate 725 MMcf decrease in our 2003 production. The loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate. Our operations are dependent on a relatively small group of key management personnel, including our Chairman, our Chief Executive Officer and our other executive officers and key technical personnel. We cannot assure you that the services of these individuals will be available to us in the future. Because competition for experienced personnel in the oil and gas industry is intense, we cannot assure you that we would be able to find acceptable replacements with comparable skills and experience in the oil and gas industry. Accordingly, the loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us. Competition in our industry is intense, and we are smaller and have a more limited operating history than most of our competitors. We compete with major and independent oil and gas companies for property acquisitions. We also compete for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate these properties. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In addition, larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. These competitors may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive natural gas and crude oil properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can. Our ability to explore for natural gas and crude oil prospects and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend on our ability to conduct operations, to evaluate and select suitable properties and to complete transactions in this highly competitive environment. Furthermore, the oil and gas industry competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel needs of industrial, commercial, and other consumers. 14 Table of Contents Several companies have entered into purchase contracts with us for a significant portion of our production and if they default on these contracts, we could be materially and adversely affected. Our long-term natural gas contracts, which extend through March 2009, accounted for the sale of approximately 30% of our natural gas production and for a significant portion of our total revenues in 2005. We cannot assure you that the other parties to these contracts will continue to perform under the contracts. If the other parties were to default after taking delivery of our natural gas, it could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows for the period in which the default occurred. A default by the other parties prior to taking delivery of our natural gas could also have a material adverse effect on our cash flows for the period in which the default occurred depending on the prevailing market prices of natural gas at the time compared to the contractual prices. Hedging our production may result in losses. To reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and crude oil, we have entered into natural gas and crude oil hedging arrangements. These hedging arrangements tend to limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices of natural gas and crude oil. These hedging arrangements also expose us to risk of financial losses in some circumstances, including the following:  our production could be materially less than expected; or  the other parties to the hedging contracts could fail to perform their contractual obligations. The result of natural gas and crude oil market prices exceeding our swap prices requires us to make payment for the settlement of our hedge derivatives on the fifth day of the production month for natural gas hedges and the fifth day after the production month for crude oil hedges. We do not receive market price cash payments from our customers until 25 to 60 days after the end of the production month. This could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows for the period between hedge settlement and payment for revenues earned. If we choose not to engage in hedging arrangements in the future, we may be more adversely affected by changes in natural gas and crude oil prices than our competitors who engage in hedging arrangements. Delays in obtaining oil field equipment and increases in drilling and other service costs could adversely affect our ability to pursue our drilling program and our results of operations. Due to the recent record high oil and gas prices, there is currently a high demend for and a general shortage of drilling equipment and supplies. Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate increased demand and result in increased prices for drilling equipment, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services. We believe that these shortages could continue. In addition, the costs and delivery times of equipment and supplies are substantially greater now than in prior periods. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain necessary drilling equipment and supplies in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms, and we may experience shortages of, or material increases in the cost of, drilling equipment, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services in the future. Any such delays and price increases could adversely affect our ability to pursue our drilling program and our results of operations. Our activities are regulated by complex laws and regulations, including environmental regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business. Natural gas and crude oil operations are subject to various U.S. and Canadian federal, state, provincial and local government laws and regulations that may be changed from time to time in response to economic or political conditions. Matters that are typically regulated include:  discharge permits for drilling operations;  drilling permits and bonds;  reports concerning operations; 15 Table of Contents  spacing of wells;  unitization and pooling of properties;  environmental protection; and  taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of natural gas and crude oil wells below actual production capacity to conserve supplies of natural gas and crude oil. We also are subject to changing and extensive tax laws, the effects of which cannot be predicted. The development, production, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of natural gas and crude oil, by-products and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with natural gas and crude oil operations are also subject to laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment. The discharge of natural gas, crude oil or pollutants into the air, soil or water may give rise to significant liabilities on our part to the government and third parties and may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties or require us to incur substantial costs of remediation. Legal and tax requirements frequently are changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. We cannot assure you that existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or future laws or regulations, will not materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have a substantial amount of debt and the cost of servicing that debt could adversely affect our business; and such risk could increase if we incur more debt. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2005, we had total consolidated debt of $576.5 million, including $70.5 million in current liabilities. Subject to the limits contained in the loan agreements governing our senior secured revolving credit facilities and our second lien mortgage notes, we may incur additional debt. Our ability to borrow under our senior secured revolving credit facilities is subject to the quantity of proved reserves attributable to our natural gas and crude oil properties. One of our senior secured revolving credit facilities enables us to borrow significant amounts in Canadian dollars to fund and support our operations in Canada. Such indebtedness exposes us to currency exchange risk associated with the Canadian dollar. If we incur additional indebtedness or fail to increase the quantity of proved reserves attributable to our natural gas and crude oil properties, the risks that we now face as a result of our indebtedness could intensify. We have demands on our cash resources in addition to interest expense on our indebtedness, including, among others, operating expenses and interest and principal payments under our senior secured revolving credit facilities, our second lien mortgage notes and our convertible subordinated debentures. Our level of indebtedness relative to our proved reserves and these significant demands on our cash resources could have important effects on our business and on your investment in Quicksilver. For example, they could:  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt;  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt,  thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;  require us to make principal payments under our senior secured revolving credit facilities if the quantity of proved reserves attributable to our natural gas and crude oil properties are insufficient to support our level of borrowings under such credit facilities;  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the oil and gas industry;  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have lower debt service obligations and significantly greater operating and financing flexibility than we do; 16 Table of Contents  limit, our financial flexibility, including our ability to borrow additional funds;  increase our interest expense if interest rates increase, because certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;  increase our vulnerability to foreign exchange risk associated with Canadian dollar denominated indebtedness and international operations in Canada;  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and  result in an event of default upon a failure to comply with financial covenants contained in our senior secured revolving credit facilities or second lien mortgage notes which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our ability to pay principal and interest on our long-term debt and to satisfy our other liabilities will depend upon our future performance and our ability to refinance our debt as it becomes due. Our future operating performance and ability to refinance will be affected by economic and capital markets conditions, our financial condition, results of operations and prospects and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operating costs, we will be forced to adopt alternative strategies that may include:  reducing or delaying capital expenditures;  seeking additional debt financing or equity capital;  selling assets; or  restructuring or refinancing debt. There can be no assurance that any such strategies could be implemented on satisfactory terms, if at all. Our senior secured revolving credit facilities and second lien mortgage notes restrict our ability and the ability of some of our subsidiaries to engage in certain activities. The loan agreements governing our senior secured revolving credit facilities and second line mortgage notes restrict our ability to, among other things:  incur additional debt:  pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase capital stock;  make certain investments;  incur or permit to exist certain liens;  enter into transactions with affiliates;  merge, consolidate or amalgamate with another company;  transfer or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries; and  redeem subordinated debt. The loan agreements for our senior secured revolving credit facilities and second lien mortgage notes contain certain covenants, which, among other things, require the maintenance of a minimum current ratio, a minimum collateral coverage ratio, a minimum earnings (before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, non-cash income and expense, and exploration costs) to interest expense ratio, and a minimum earnings (before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization, non-cash income and expense and exploration costs) to fixed charges ratio. Our ability to borrow under our senior secured revolving credit facilities is dependent upon the quantity of proved reserves attributable to our natural gas and crude oil properties. Our ability to meet these covenants or requirements may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy such covenants and requirements. 17 Table of Contents The covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions. In addition, a breach of the restrictive covenants in our loan agreements, any instrument governing our future indebtedness or our inability to maintain the financial ratios described above could result in an event of default under the applicable instrument. Upon the occurrence of such an event of default, the applicable creditors could, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable instrument, elect to declare the outstanding principle of that debt, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. Moreover, any of our debt agreements that contain a cross-default or cross-acceleration provision that would be triggered by such default or acceleration would also be subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of such default or acceleration. If we were unable to repay amounts due under our senior secured revolving credit facilities, the creditors could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. If the payment of our indebtedness is accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full such indebtedness and our other indebtedness that would become due as a result of any acceleration. The above restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing and may prevent us from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. A small number of existing stockholders control our company, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of stockholder votes. Members of the Darden family, together with Mercury and Quicksilver Energy, L.P., entities primarily owned by members of the Darden family, beneficially own on the date of this annual report approximately 35% of our common stock. As a result, these entities and individuals will generally be able to control the outcome of stockholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, the adoption or amendment of provisions in our charter or bylaws and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions. A large number of our outstanding shares and shares to be issued upon exercise of our outstanding options may be sold into the market in the future, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well. Our shares that are eligible for future sale may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. There were 76,079,041 shares of our common stock outstanding at December 31, 2005. Approximately 48,611,279 of these shares are freely tradable without substantial restriction or the requirement of future registration under the Securities Act. In addition, at December 31, 2005 we had the following options outstanding to purchase shares of our common stock:  Options to purchase 45,903 shares at $3.27 per share;  Options to purchase 72,915 shares at $5.35 per share;  Options to purchase 1,698 shares at $5.50 per share;  Options to purchase 55,753 shares at $5.67 per share;  Options to purchase 65,052 shares at $7.36 per share;  Options to purchase 48,504 shares at $8.03 per share;  Options to purchase 656,962 shares at $11.01 per share;  Options to purchase 22,595 shares at $15.83 per share;  Options to purchase 1,775,135 shares at $20.85 per share;  Options to purchase 11,085 shares at $23.42 per share;  Options to purchase 82,637 shares at $23.83 per share; and  Options to purchase 2,456 shares at $33.09 per share. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or a perception that such sales could occur, and the existence of options to purchase shares of common stock at prices that may be below the then current market price of the common stock, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity securities. 18 Table of Contents Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, restated bylaws and stockholder rights plan contain provisions that could discourage an acquisition or change of control without our board of directors approval. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that could discourage an acquisition or change of control without our board of directors approval, such as:  our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;  our board of directors is classified; and  advance notice is required for director nominations by stockholders and actions to be taken at annual meetings at the request of stockholders. In addition, we have adopted a stockholder rights plan. The provisions, described above and the stockholder rights plan could impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to take control of us, even if that change of control might be beneficial to stockholders, thus increasing the likelihood that incumbent directors will retain their positions. In certain circumstances, the fact that corporate devices are in place that will inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock.

ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. ITEM 2. Properties We own significant natural gas and crude oil production interests in the following geographic areas: Michigan Producing Formation ProvedReserves (Bcfe) % Gas % ProvedDeveloped 2005 Production (MMcfed) Antrim Shale 503.5 100 % 92 % 59.7 Non-Antrim 78.0 62 % 82 % 21.0 All Formations 581.5 95 % 90 % 80.7 19 Table of Contents Michigan has favorable natural gas supply/demand characteristics as the state has been importing an increasing percentage of its natural gas and currently imports approximately 75% of its demand. This supply/demand situation generally allows Michigan producers to sell their natural gas at a slight premium to typical industry benchmark prices. The Antrim Shale underlies a large percentage of our Michigan acreage and is fairly homogeneous in terms of reservoir quality; wells tend to produce relatively predictable amounts of natural gas. Subsurface fracturing can increase reserves and production attributable to any particular well. On average, Antrim Shale wells have a total productive life of more than 20 years. As new wells produce and the de-watering process takes place, they tend to reach a maximum production level in six to 12 months, remaining at these levels for one to two years, and then declining at 8% to 10% per year thereafter. The wells tend to produce the best economic results when drilled in large numbers in a fairly concentrated area. This well concentration provides for a more rapid de-watering of a specific area, which decreases the time to natural gas production and increases the amount of natural gas production. It also enables us to maximize the use of existing production infrastructure, which decreases per unit operating costs. Since reserve quantities and production levels over a large number of wells are fairly predictable, maximizing per well recoveries and minimizing per unit production costs through a sizeable well-engineered drilling program are the keys to profitable Antrim development. At December 31, 2005, we owned working interests in 4,661 producing Antrim wells. Since 1998, we have drilled 543 Antrim wells and successfully completed 537 for a success rate of 99%. In 2005, we drilled and successfully completed or participated in a total of 67 (31.4 net) Antrim wells including 11 horizontal reentry wells. For 2006, we have budgeted for the drilling of 107 (60.8 net) Antrim wells, including 20 horizontal reentry wells. Our non-Antrim interests are located in several reservoirs including the Prairie du Chien (PdC), Richfield, Detroit River Zone III (DRZ3) and Niagaran pinnacle reefs. Our PdC wells produce from several Ordovician age reservoirs with the majority being in the 1,000 feet to 1,200 feet thick PdC Group that has three major sands: the Lower PdC, Middle PdC and Upper PdC. Depending upon the area and the particular zone, the PdC will produce dry gas, gas and condensate or oil with associated gas. Our PdC production is well established, and four development wells were drilled from 2003 through 2005 to increase production from existing fields. At year-end we had 42 gross (24.3 net) PdC wells producing. There are numerous proved non-producing zones in existing well bores that provide recompletion opportunities, allowing us to maintain or, in some cases, increase production from our PdC wells as currently producing reservoirs deplete. Our Richfield/Detroit River wells are located in Kalkaska and Crawford counties in the Garfield and Beaver Creek fields. The Richfield zone consists of seven dolomite reservoirs spread over a 200-foot interval. The Garfield Richfield has seven wells producing under primary solution gas drive. Potential exploitation of the Garfield Richfield either by secondary waterflood and/or improved oil recovery with CO2 injection is under evaluation and has not been included in our booked reserves. We had 89 producing wells producing from the Richfield zone at December 31, 2005. The DRZ3 at Beaver Creek lies approximately 200 feet above the Richfield. The DRZ3 is a six-foot dolomite zone that covers approximately 10,000 acres on the Beaver Creek structure. We had 27 producing wells as of December 31, 2005. While there is the opportunity for improving production and proved reserve quantities, we have determined that our resources are better allocated to continued development, exploitation and exploration of our many unconventional gas projects. Our Niagaran wells produce from numerous Silurian-age Niagaran pinnacle reefs located in nine counties in northern Michigan. The depth of these wells ranges from 3,400 feet to 7,800 feet with reservoir thickness from 300 feet to 600 feet. Depending upon the location of the specific reef in the pinnacle reef belt of the northern shelf area, the Niagaran reefs will produce dry gas, gas and condensate or oil with associated gas. At December 31, 2005, we had 67 (29.3 net) producing Niagaran wells. 20 Table of Contents Canada In 2000, we began to focus on the potential of Canadian CBM through MGV. In late 2000, we entered into a joint venture with EnCana to explore for and develop CBM reserves initially in the West Palliser block in Alberta. By January 2003, the joint venture had drilled 175 exploratory, pilot and development wells. In January 2003, we entered into an asset rationalization agreement with EnCana that divided the assets and rights subject to the joint venture and allowed us to pursue independent operations. During 2006, we expect to drill 451 (267 net) wells and install three new CBM processing facilities. Each plant will be capable of processing five to ten MMcfd of natural gas production. Approximately $70 million will be committed to CBM drilling including testing of the Mannville coals. Including its interests in other conventional natural gas properties located in southern Alberta, MGV held interests in 1,685 (778.2 net) productive wells at December 31, 2005. Our total Canadian proved reserves at December 31, 2005 were estimated to be 305 Bcf. Our average daily production in Canada for 2005 was 40.7 MMcfd. At December 31, 2005, however, our Canadian production was approximately 49.0 MMcfd. Texas During 2005, we drilled 36 (35.4 net) wells in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and completed construction of the first phase of our Cowtown Pipeline. At December 31, 2005, we had drilled a total of 44 (43.4 net) wells in the Barnett Shale and our production exit rate was approximately 23.0 MMcfd from 52 (37.8 net) producing wells. In June of 2005, we began processing our Barnett Shale natural gas through an interim gas processing facility. Our interests are spread over an area stretching from northwest Johnson County to southeastern Hood County, approximately 20 miles in a north-south direction. At December 31, 2005, we held approximately 255,000 net acres in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale play. Our plans for 2006 include increasing our pace of development and we anticipate drilling approximately 85 (84.6 net) wells in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale over the course of the year and expect our gas processing plant to begin operations during the first quarter. We have also planned to extend our gathering pipeline and construct additional gathering lines and gas processing facilities. Also during 2005, we acquired approximately 310,000 net acres in a contiguous block of west Texas. We plan to drill four resource assessment wells on that acreage to evaluate the Barnett and Woodford Shales in the Delaware Basin. Indiana/Kentucky We began our operations in the New Albany Shale of southern Indiana and north Kentucky in 2000 with the acquisition of 36 producing wells and the eight-mile 12-inch GTG gas pipeline that runs from southern Indiana to northern Kentucky. During 2005, we drilled 26 wells, gross and net. At December 31, 2005, we had approximately 219 producing wells in Indiana/Kentucky. Our New Albany production is transported through an extension of the GTG gas pipeline that we constructed in 2003 and connects to the Texas Gas Pipeline in northern Kentucky. At year-end, natural gas sales from our properties in the area averaged 5.4 MMcfd. Rocky Mountain Region Our Rocky Mountain properties are located in Montana and Wyoming. Production from those properties is primarily crude oil from well-established producing formations at depths ranging from 1,000 feet to 17,000 feet. At December 31, 2005, our Rocky Mountain proved reserves were 2.4 MMBbls of crude oil and 2.0 Bcfe of natural gas and NGLs for total equivalent reserves of 16.7 Bcfe. Our daily production averaged 3.2 MMcfed for 2005. Oil and Gas Reserves The following reserve quantity and future net cash flow information concerns our proved reserves that are located in the United States and Canada. Independent petroleum engineers with Schlumberger Data and 21 Table of Contents Consulting Services, LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd. and Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. prepared our reserve estimates. Proved oil and gas reserves, as defined by SEC Regulation S-X Rule 4-10(a) 2(i), 2(ii), 2(iii), (3) and (4), are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions (i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made). Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided by contractual arrangements, but not of escalations based upon expected future conditions. Prices do not include the effect of derivative instruments we have entered into. Future production and development costs include production and property taxes. Proved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Additional oil and gas expected to be obtained through the application of fluid injection or other improved recovery techniques for supplementing the natural forces and mechanisms of primary recovery are included as proved developed reserves only after testing by a pilot project or after the operation of an installed program has confirmed through production response that increased recovery will be achieved. Proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for re-completion. Reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units that are reasonably certain of production when drilled. Proved reserves for other undrilled units are claimed only where it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of production from the existing productive formation. The reserve data set forth in this document represents only estimates and is subject to inherent uncertainties. The determination of oil and gas reserves is based on estimates that are highly complex and interpretive. Reserve engineering is a subjective process that is dependent on the quality of available data and on engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Although we believe the reserve estimates contained in this document are reasonable, reserve estimates are imprecise and are expected to change as additional information becomes available. The following table summarizes our proved reserves and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows attributable to them at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Legal Proceedings In August 2001, a group of royalty owners, Athel E. Williams et al., brought suit against us and three of our subsidiaries in the Circuit Court of Otsego County, Michigan. The suit alleges that Terra Energy Ltd, one of our subsidiaries, underpaid royalties or overriding royalties to the 13 named plaintiffs and to a class of plaintiffs who have yet to be determined. The pleadings of the plaintiffs seek damages in an unspecified amount and injunctive relief against future underpayments. The court heard arguments on class certification on November 8, 2002, and on December 6, 2002 the court issued a memorandum opinion granting class certification in part and denying it in part. On December 20, 2002, we filed a motion for clarification and reconsideration of the courts order. That motion was denied on March 9, 2003. After an extended delay resulting from the retention of new counsel by the plaintiffs and the initiation of settlement discussions, on January 21, 2005, the Circuit Court issued an order certifying certain claims to proceed on behalf of a class. The Circuit Court also entered a scheduling order setting trial for January 2007, and denied Defendants request to stay proceedings in that court pending an appeal of the certification order. Defendants sought leave to appeal the certification order by filing an Application for Leave to Appeal on February 11, 2005 with the Michigan Court of Appeals. Defendants also requested that the Court of Appeals stay proceedings in the Circuit Court pending the consideration of its appeal, and requested that the Court of Appeals consider all matters in an expedited manner. On April 22, 2005, the Court of Appeals vacated the certification order and remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to address several particular issues by way of a new order. After limited discovery relating to those issues, the trial court held a follow-up certification hearing on June 1, 2005. In late July of 2005, it was announced that the trial court judge, Judge Alton Davis, had been appointed to a seat on the Michigan Court of Appeals. The parties have not been advised as to who will be the new trial court judge over the case. On August 18, 2005, shortly before ascending to the appellate court, Judge Davis entered new findings and conclusions again favoring certification. Defendants sought leave in the Court of Appeals Court to file a supplemental response to the trial courts new findings and conclusions. On January 20, 2006, the Court of 26 Table of Contents Appeals entered an order granting the application for leave to appeal and expediting appellate proceedings. The request to supplement the original appellate filings was denied, but a new briefing schedule was put into place. Defendants appellate brief is due by February 24, 2006, and Plaintiffs brief is due within 28 days after the filing of the Companys brief. The case (discovery and trial court proceedings) remains stayed pending the resolution of the appeal. Based on information currently available to us, we believe that the final resolution of this matter will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
