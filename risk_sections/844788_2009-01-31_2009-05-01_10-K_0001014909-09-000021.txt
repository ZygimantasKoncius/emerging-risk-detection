Item 1A. Risk Factors. This 10-K contains statements concerning our future performance, intentions, objectives, plans and expectations that are or may be deemed to be "forward-looking statements". Our ability to do this has been fostered by the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995, which provides a "safe harbor" for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the statement. In addition, the Company's status as an exploration and development company without any present revenue producing operations increases the risks involved in an investment in the Company. These factors affecting us include, but are not limited to, the following: · The worldwide economic situation; · Any change in interest rates or inflation; · Foreign government changes to laws or regulations related to Company activities; · The willingness and ability of third parties to honor their contractual commitments; · Our ability to raise additional capital, as it may be affected by current conditions in the stock market and competition in the gold mining industry for risk capital; · Our costs of production; Environmental and other regulations, as the same presently exist and may hereafter be amended; Our ability to identify, finance and integrate other acquisitions; and · Volatility of our stock price. 9 _____________________________________________________________________________________ We undertake no responsibility or obligation to update publicly these forward-looking statements, but may do so in the future in written or oral statements. Investors should take note of any future statements made by or on our behalf. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None.
