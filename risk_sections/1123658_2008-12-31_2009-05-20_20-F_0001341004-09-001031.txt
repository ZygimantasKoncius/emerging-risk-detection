IDENTITY OF DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORS Not applicable. ITEM 2. OFFER STATISTICS AND EXPECTED TIMETABLE Not applicable. ITEM 3. KEY INFORMATION A. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The selected consolidated income statement data and consolidated cash flow data for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, and the selected consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2007, and 2008 have been derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. The selected consolidated income statement data and consolidated cash flow data for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005 and the selected consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006 are derived from our audited consolidated financial statements which are not included elsewhere in this annual report and the financial statements of the acquired businesses described below. We acquired from Sinopec Group Company the operations of Sinopec Group Tianjin Petrochemical Company, Sinopec Group Luoyang Petrochemical General Plant, Zhongyuan Petrochemical Company Limited, Sinopec Group Guangzhou Petrochemical General Plant and certain catalyst plants (collectively, Petrochemical and Catalyst Assets) in 2004, the equity interests in Sinopec Hainan Refining and Chemical Company Limited (Sinopec Hainan) and certain oil and gas production companies (Oil Production Plants) in 2006, and the equity interests in Zhanjiang Dongxing Petroleum Company Limited, Sinopec Hangzhou Oil Refinery Plant, Yangzhou Petrochemical Plant, Jiangsu Taizhou Petrochemical Plant and Sinopec Qingjiang Petrochemical Company Limited (collectively, Refinery Plants) in 2007. As we and these companies are under the common control of Sinopec Group Company, our acquisitions are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as combination of entities under common control in a manner similar to a pooling-of-interests. Accordingly, the acquired assets and related liabilities have been accounted for at historical cost and our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the combinations have been restated to include the financial condition and the results of operation of these companies on a combined basis. Moreover, the selected financial data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects” included elsewhere in this annual report. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS. 6 Years Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 RMB RMB RMB RMB RMB (in millions, except per share and per ADS data) Consolidated Income Statement Data(1): Operating revenues 617,951 817,048 1,061,741 1,204,843 1,452,101 Other income - 9,777 5,161 4,863 50,342 Operating expenses (555,003) (758,848) (986,270) (1,123,842) (1,474,320) Operating income 62,948 67,977 80,632 85,864 28,123 Earnings before income tax 59,386 64,525 78,542 83,464 24,317 Tax (expense)/benefit (18,096) (19,872) (23,504) (24,721) 1,883 Net income attributable to equity shareholders of the Company 35,289 41,354 53,603 56,533 29,769 Basic earnings per share 0.41 0.48 0.62 0.65 0.34 Basic earnings per ADS(2) 40.70 47.70 61.82 65.20 34.33 Diluted earnings per share(2) 0.41 0.48 0.62 0.65 0.30 Diluted earnings per ADS(2) 40.70 47.70 61.82 65.20 30.29 Cash dividends declared per share 0.10 0.12 0.13 0.16 0.145 Segment results Exploration and production 26,397 48,334 63,182 48,766 66,569 Refining 4,917 (3,695) (25,710) (10,452) (61,538) Marketing and distribution 14,716 10,350 30,234 35,727 38,209 Chemicals 18,843 14,186 14,458 13,306 (13,102) Corporate and others (1,925) (1,198) (1,532) (1,483) (2,015) Operating income 62,948 67,977 80,632 85,864 28,123 As of December 31, 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 RMB RMB RMB RMB RMB (in millions) Consolidated Balance Sheet Data(1): Cash and cash equivalents 18,817 15,088 7,063 7,696 6,948 Total current assets 125,862 148,984 146,490 185,116 164,311 Total non-current assets 355,729 396,169 464,342 547,609 603,516 Total assets 481,591 545,153 610,832 732,725 767,827 Total current liabilities 151,361 177,706 216,372 265,355 274,537 Short-term debts and loans from Sinopec Group Company and its affiliates (including current portion of long-term debts) 45,231 46,674 63,480 60,494 98,483 Long-term debts and loans from Sinopec Group Company and its affiliates (excluding current portion of long-term debts) 95,784 103,408 100,637 120,314 127,144 Equity attributable to equity shareholders of the Company 195,239 226,099 264,334 307,433 328,669 Capital employed(³) 349,909 392,267 443,711 505,870 568,001 Years Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 RMB RMB RMB RMB RMB (in millions) Other Financial Data(1): Net cash generated from operating activities 68,076 78,663 92,507 119,594 67,712 Net cash used in investing activities (72,794) (78,113) (103,385) (113,587) (110,158) Net cash generated from/(used in) financing activities 6,250 (4,257) 2,878 (5,310) 41,777 7 Capital expenditure Exploration and production 23,199 25,479 35,198 54,498 57,646 Refining 15,789 20,270 22,587 22,763 12,491 Marketing and distribution 16,678 10,954 11,319 12,548 14,148 Chemicals 11,025 9,386 12,629 16,184 20,622 Corporate and others 1,550 1,164 2,170 3,289 2,393 Total 68,241 67,253 83,903 109,282 107,300 __________ (1) The acquisitions of Petrochemical and Catalyst Assets in 2004, the acquisitions of equity interests in Sinopec Hainan and Oil Production Plants in 2006 and the acquisitions of equity interests in the Refining Plants in 2007 from Sinopec Group Company are treated as “combination of entities under common control” which are accounted in a manner similar to a pooling-of-interests. Accordingly, the acquired assets and liabilities have been accounted for at historical cost and the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the combinations have been restated to include the financial condition and results of operation of these acquired companies on a combined basis. The considerations for these acquisitions were treated as equity transactions. (2) Basic earnings per share have been computed by dividing net income attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of shares in issue. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, diluted earnings per share and per ADS are calculated on the same basis as basic earnings per share and per ADS, respectively, since there were no dilutive potential ordinary shares during the years. The calculation of diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2008 is based on the diluted net income attributable to equity shareholders of the Company of RMB 26,592 million and the diluted weighted average number of the shares of 87,789,799,595. Basic and diluted earnings per ADS have been computed as if all of our issued or potential ordinary shares, including domestic shares and H shares, are represented by ADSs during each of the years presented. Each ADS represents 100 shares. (3) Capital employed is derived by the sum of short-term debts, long-term debts, loans from Sinopec Group Company and its affiliates and total equity less cash and cash equivalents. B. CAPITALIZATION AND INDEBTEDNESS Not applicable. C. REASONS FOR THE OFFER AND USE OF PROCEEDS Not applicable. D. RISK FACTORS Risks Relating to Our Business Operation Our business may be adversely affected by the fluctuation of crude oil and refined petroleum product prices. We currently consume a large amount of crude oil to produce our refined products and petrochemical products. While we try to adjust the sale price of our products to track international crude oil price fluctuations, our ability to pass on the increased cost resulting from crude oil price increases to our customers is dependent on international and domestic market conditions as well as the PRC government’s price control over refined petroleum products. For example, the international crude oil price reached its historically high level in July 2008, but we were not able to effectively pass the increased cost to our customers of refined petroleum products. Although the current price-setting mechanism for refined petroleum products in China allows the PRC government to adjust price in the PRC market when the average international crude oil price fluctuates beyond certain levels within a certain time period, the PRC government still retains discretion as to whether or when to adjust the refined petroleum products price. The PRC government will exercise certain price control over refined petroleum products once international crude oil price experiences sustained growth or becomes significantly volatile. As a result, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected by the fluctuation of crude oil and refined petroleum product prices. Our continued business success depends in part on our ability to replace reserves and develop newly discovered reserves. Our ability to achieve our growth objectives is dependent in part on our level of success in discovering or acquiring additional oil and natural gas reserves and further exploring our current reserve base. Our exploration and 8 development activities for additional reserves also expose us to inherent risks associated with drilling, including the risk that no economically productive oil or natural gas reservoirs might be discovered. Exploring for, developing and acquiring reserves is highly risky and capital intensive. Without reserve additions through further exploration and development or acquisition activities, our reserves and production will decline over time, which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We rely heavily on outside suppliers for crude oil and other raw materials, and we may even experience disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil and other raw materials. We purchase a significant portion of our crude oil and other feedstock requirements from outside suppliers located in different countries and areas in the world. In 2008, approximately 74% of the crude oil required for our refinery business was sourced from international suppliers, some of which are from countries or regions that are on the sanction list published and administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the US Department of Treasury. In addition, our development requires us to source an increasing amount of crude oil from outside suppliers. We are subject to the political, geographical and economic risks associated with these countries and areas. If one or more of our material supply contracts were terminated or disrupted due to any natural disasters or political events, it is possible that we would not be able to find sufficient alternative sources of supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms. As a result, our business and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. Our business faces operation risks and natural disasters that may cause significant property damages, personal injuries and interruption of operations, and we may not have sufficient insurance coverage for all the financial losses incurred by us. Exploring for, producing and transporting crude oil and natural gas and producing and transporting refined and petrochemical products involve a number of operating hazards. Significant operating hazards and natural disasters may cause interruption to our operations, property or environmental damages as well as personal injuries, and each of these incidents could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have been paying high attention to the safety of our operation and implemented Health, Safety and Environment Management System within our company with the view to preventing accident, and reducing personal injuries, property losses and environment pollution. We also maintain insurance coverage on our property, plant, equipment and inventory. However, our preventative measures may not be effective and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all the financial losses caused by the operation risks and natural disasters. Losses incurred or payments required to be made by us due to operating hazards or natural disasters, which are not fully insured, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The oil and natural gas reserves data in this annual report are only estimates, and our actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves may differ materially from these estimates. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves, and in the timing of development expenditures and the projection of future rates of production. The reserve data set forth in this annual report represent estimates only. Adverse changes in economic conditions may render it uneconomical to develop certain reserves. Our actual production, revenues, taxes and fees payable and development and operating expenditures with respect to our reserves may likely vary from these estimates. The reliability of reserves estimates depends on: · the quality and quantity of technical and economic data; · the prevailing oil and gas prices applicable to our production; · the production performance of the reservoirs; · extensive engineering judgments; and · consistency in the PRC government's oil policies. 9 In addition, new drilling, testing and production following the estimates may cause substantial upward or downward revisions in the estimates. Our operations may be adversely affected by the global and domestic economic conditions. Our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions in China and elsewhere around the world. Concerns over stability of the global financial market, inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit and commodities have contributed to unprecedented levels of market volatility and diminished expectations for the global economy and the markets in the future. These factors, combined with declining business, consumer confidence and market demand, have precipitated an economic slowdown or even a recession. If the current market fluctuation continues and the global economy, particularly the Chinese economy and other markets where our products are sold, experiences significant or continuous slowdown or downturn, our business, financial condition, results of operations would be adversely affected. Our operations may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the market. Most of our revenues are attributable to sales of refined petroleum products and petrochemical products, and certain of these businesses and related products have historically been cyclical and sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control. These factors include the availability and prices of feedstock and general economic conditions, such as changes in industry capacity and output levels, cyclical changes in regional and global economic conditions, prices and availability of substitute products and changes in consumer demand. With the further reduction of tariffs and other import restrictions in the PRC on refined petroleum products and petrochemical products, many of our products have become increasingly subject to the cyclicality of global markets, and hence, our operations may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the market. We face strong competition from domestic and foreign competitors. Among our competitors, some are major integrated petroleum and petrochemical companies within and outside the PRC, which have recently become more significant participants in the petroleum and petrochemical industry in China. On December 4, 2006, Ministry of Commerce of the PRC promulgated the “Administrative Rules for Crude Oil Market” and “Administrative Rules for Refined Petroleum Products Market” to open the wholesale market of crude oil and refined petroleum products to new market entrants. As a result, we expect to face more competition in both crude oil and refined petroleum product markets. We believe such trend will continue. Increased competition may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our financing costs are subject to change in interest rates. Changes in the interest rate in China, which is subject to governmental control, have affected and will continue to affect our financing costs and our results of operations. The People’s Bank of China, or the PBOC, adjusts the benchmark interest rate according to China’s macroeconomic conditions. In 2008, the PBOC reduced the benchmark interest rate five times, and the benchmark one-year lending rate was reduced from 7.47% to 5.31%. There is no assurance that the PBOC will further reduce the benchmark interest rate or keep it at the current level. Any increase in the benchmark interest rate by the PBOC will result in an increase in the financing costs on our debt financing activities, and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to Our Controlling Shareholder Related party transactions. We have engaged from time to time and will continue to engage in a variety of transactions with Sinopec Group, which provides to us a number of services, including, but not limited to, ancillary supply, engineering, maintenance, transport, lease of land use right, lease of buildings, as well as educational and community services. The nature of our transactions with Sinopec Group is governed by a number of service and other contracts between Sinopec Group and us. We have established various schemes in those agreements so that these transactions would be entered into under terms at arm’s length. However, we cannot assure you that Sinopec Group Company or any of its members would not take actions that may favor its interests or its other subsidiaries' interests over ours. 10 Non-competition. Sinopec Group Company has interests in certain businesses, such as oil refining, petrochemical producing and retail service stations, which compete or are likely to compete, either directly or indirectly, with our businesses. To avoid the adverse effects brought by the competition between us and Sinopec Group Company to the maximum extent possible, we and Sinopec Group Company have entered into a non-competition agreement whereby Sinopec Group Company has agreed to: refrain from operating new businesses which compete or could compete with us in any of our domestic or international markets; grant us an option to purchase Sinopec Group Company's operations that compete or could compete with our businesses; operate its sales enterprises and service stations in a manner uniform to our sales and service operations; and appoint us as sales agent for certain of its products which compete or could compete with our products. Notwithstanding the foregoing contractual arrangements, because Sinopec Group Company is our controlling shareholder, Sinopec Group Company may take actions that may conflict with our own interests. Risks Relating to the PRC Government regulations may limit our activities and affect our business operations. The PRC government, though gradually liberalizing its regulations on entry into the petroleum and petrochemical industry, continues to exercise certain controls over the petroleum and petrochemical industry in China. These control mechanisms include granting the licenses to explore and produce crude oil and natural gas, granting the licenses to market and distribute crude oil and refined petroleum products, setting the pricing policy for the refined petroleum products, collecting special gain levies, assessing taxes and fees payable, deciding import and export quotas and procedures for the oil and gas industry, and setting safety, environmental and quality standards. As a result, we may face constraints on our flexibility and ability to expand our business operations or to maximize our profitability. Our business operations may be adversely affected by present or future environmental regulations. As an integrated petroleum and petrochemical company, we are subject to extensive environmental protection laws and regulations in China. These laws and regulations permit: · the imposition of fees for the discharge of waste substances; · the levy of fines and payments for damages for serious environmental offenses; and · the government, at its discretion, to close any facility which fails to comply with orders and require it to correct or stop operations causing environmental damage. Our production operations produce substantial amounts of waste water, gas and solid waste materials. In addition, our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal, modification and revocation. We have established a system to treat waste materials to prevent and reduce pollution. The PRC government has moved, and may move further, toward more rigorous enforcement of applicable laws, and toward the adoption of more stringent environmental standards, which, in turn, would require us to incur additional expenditures on environmental matters. Some of our development plans require compliance with state policies and regulatory confirmation and registration. We are currently engaged in a number of construction, renovation and expansion projects. Some of our large construction, renovation and expansion projects are subject to governmental confirmation and registration. The timing and cost of completion of these projects will depend on numerous factors, including when we can receive the required confirmation and registration from relevant PRC government authorities and the general economic condition in China. If any of our important projects required for our future growth are not confirmed or registered, or not confirmed or registered in a timely manner, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. 11 Foreign enterprise holders of H shares may be subject to PRC taxation. In accordance with the new Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules that became effective on January 1, 2008, dividends derived from the revenues accumulated from January 1, 2008 and are paid by PRC companies to non-resident enterprises, which are established under the laws of non-PRC jurisdictions and have no establishment or place of business in China or whose dividends from China do not relate to their establishment or place of business in China, are generally subject to a PRC withholding tax levied at a rate of 10% unless exempted or reduced pursuant to an applicable double-taxation treaty or other exemptions. Under the notice issued by the State Administration of Taxation of the PRC on November 6, 2008, we are required to withhold PRC income tax at the rate of 10% on dividends paid for 2008 and later years payable to our H Share investors that are “non-resident enterprises”. Accordingly, the investors of our American Depositary Shares representing our H Shares will be subject to such withholding of the PRC income tax at the rate of 10%. Government control of currency conversion and exchange rate fluctuation may adversely affect our operations and financial results. We receive substantially all of our revenues in Renminbi. A portion of such revenues will need to be converted into other currencies to meet our foreign currency needs, which include, among other things: · import of crude oil and other materials; · debt service on foreign currency-denominated debt; · purchases of imported equipment; · payment of the principals and interests of bonds issued overseas; and · payment of any cash dividends declared in respect of the H shares (including ADS). The existing foreign exchange regulations have significantly reduced government foreign exchange controls for transactions under the current account, including trade and service related foreign exchange transactions and payment of dividends. Foreign exchange transactions under the capital account, including principal payments in respect of foreign currency-denominated obligations, continue to be subject to significant foreign exchange controls and require the approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. These limitations could affect our ability to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financing, or to obtain foreign exchange for capital expenditures. The PRC government has stated publicly that it intends to make the Renminbi freely convertible in the future. However, we cannot predict whether the PRC government will continue its existing foreign exchange policy and when the PRC government will allow free conversion of Renminbi. The exchange rate of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies fluctuates and is affected by, among other things, the foreign exchange control policies of the PRC government and the changes in the PRC’s and international political and economic conditions. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government introduced a floating exchange rate system to allow the value of the Renminbi to fluctuate within a regulated band based on market supply and demand and by reference to a basket of foreign currencies. From July 21, 2005 to December 31, 2008, the value of the Renminbi has appreciated by approximately 21% against the U.S. dollar. We purchase a significant portion of the crude oil from international suppliers, and the purchase price are benchmarked to US dollar-denominated international prices. Fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Renminbi against the US dollars and certain other foreign currencies may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Risks relating to enforcement of shareholder rights; Mandatory arbitration. Currently, the primary sources of shareholder rights are our articles of association, the PRC Company Law and the Listing Rules of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which, among other things, impose certain standards of conduct, fairness and disclosure on us, our directors and our controlling shareholder. In general, their provisions for protection of shareholder's rights and access to information are different from those applicable to companies incorporated in the United States, the United Kingdom and other Western countries. In addition, the mechanism for enforcement of rights under the corporate framework to which we are subject may also be relatively undeveloped and untested. To our knowledge, there has not been any published report of judicial enforcement in the PRC by H share shareholders of their rights under constituent documents of joint stock limited companies or the PRC Company Law or 12 in the application or interpretation of the PRC or Hong Kong regulatory provisions applicable to PRC joint stock limited companies. We cannot assure you that our shareholders will enjoy protections that they may be entitled in other jurisdictions. China does not have treaties providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts with the United States, the United Kingdom or most other Western countries, and therefore recognition and enforcement in China of judgments of a court in any of these jurisdictions in relation to any matter not subject to a binding arbitration provision may not be assured. Our articles of association as well as the Listing Rules of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange provide that most disputes between holders of H shares and us, our directors, supervisors, officers or holders of domestic shares, arising out of the articles of association or the PRC Company Law concerning the affairs of our company or with respect to the transfer of our shares, are to be resolved through arbitration by arbitration organizations in Hong Kong or China, rather than through a court of law. On June 18, 1999, an arrangement was made between Hong Kong and the PRC for the mutual enforcement of arbitral awards. This new arrangement was approved by the Supreme People's Court of the PRC and the Hong Kong Legislative Council, and became effective on February 1, 2000. So far as we are aware, no action has been brought in China by any shareholder to enforce an arbitral award, and we are uncertain as to the outcome of any action brought in China to enforce an arbitral award granted to shareholders. ITEM
