Risk Factors of this report. Our internal risk management and control systems make use of various measures including: · Annual strategic evaluations of our business; · Periodical operational review meetings of the Management Board with the Management Committee; · Quarterly financial planning meetings of the Management Board with the Supervisory Board; · A planning and control cycle performed consisting of annual, quarterly and monthly procedures, including subsequent follow-up on achievements of targets set; 118 Management Report Corporate Governance · Advice of Crucells Disclosure committee to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer with respect to the timely review, disclosure and evaluation of periodical (financial) reports as well as with respect to the maintenance and evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures; · Letters of representation that are signed by selected key-management members on a quarterly basis in which they confirm that for their responsible area based upon their knowledge: - An effective system of internal controls and procedures is maintained and - The financial reports fairly present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows; · Management letters and audit reports provided by our external auditor; · Crucells standardized and formalized working practices, including the Biological Safety Manual which was developed in-house to meet the specific needs of Crucells working environment; · The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (Code of Conduct) of Crucell. The Management Board has discussed the internal risk management and control system with the Audit committee and the Supervisory Board. As a result of its listing at Nasdaq, Crucell is also obliged to comply with Section 404 of the American Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations (Section 404). Section 404 addresses the responsibility of the Management Board for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with the accounting policies of the Company. The Company has established a Steering committee, which governs the annual evaluation of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting. Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures We have evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2007. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2007 were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: · Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the assets of the Company; · Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 119 Management Report Corporate Governance of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only by authorized employees in accordance with documented authorizations; and · Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment and those criteria, Management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. Deloitte Accountants B.V., the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financials statements included in this Annual Report, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 as stated in their report beginning on page 121 of this report. Changes in internal control over financial reporting There has not been any change in the internal controls over financial reporting of the Company that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, such internal controls over financial reporting. 120 Management Report Corporate Governance Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting firm To the Supervisory Board and Shareholders of Crucell N.V. Leiden, the Netherlands We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Crucell N.V. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 of the Company and our report dated May 6, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Deloitte Accountants B.V. Amsterdam, the Netherlands, May 6, 2008 121 Management Report Articles of Association and Share Capital Articles of Association and Share Capital Memorandum and Articles of Association Set out below is a summary of material information concerning our shares, which are our ordinary shares together with our preference shares, and related material provisions of our articles of association and of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code (Boek 2 van het Burgerlijk Wetboek). This summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our articles of association and to Dutch law. General We were incorporated as a limited liability company (naamloze vennootschap) on October 9, 2000 by deed executed before Mr. R.J.J. Lijdsman, civil law notary. Our corporate seat is in Leiden, the Netherlands, and we have offices at Archimedesweg 4-6, 2333 CN Leiden, the Netherlands. We are registered in the trade register of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry for Leiden under number 28087740. The statement of no objection of the Minister of Justice in respect of our deed of incorporation was issued on October 9, 2000 under number N.V. 1133178. Our agent in the U.S. is CT Corporation, 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10011. Corporate purpose Our objects include acquiring, establishing and managing companies in our field, controlling and using intellectual property, and funding our operations. Limitation of liability and indemnification matters Pursuant to Dutch law, each member of our Supervisory and Management Boards is responsible to us for the proper performance of his or her assigned duties. They are also responsible for taking measures to prevent the consequences of any improper performance of duties by another member of our Supervisory Board or our Management Board. Our articles of association provide that our Management Board members and our Supervisory Board members are discharged from liability for their actions as board members, if our general meeting of shareholders adopts a resolution to that effect. This discharge extends only to actions or omissions disclosed in or apparent from the adopted annual accounts or otherwise communicated to our general meeting of shareholders. This discharge of liability may be limited by mandatory provisions of Dutch law, such as in the case of bankruptcy. Under Dutch law, our Supervisory Board members and members of our Management Board generally cannot be held personally liable for decisions made exercising their reasonable business judgment. Our articles of association provide that we shall generally indemnify any person who is or was a member of our Supervisory Board or our Management Board or one of our employees, officers or agents, and suffers any loss as a result of any action in connection with their service to us, provided they acted in good faith in carrying out their duties. This indemnification generally will not be available if the person seeking indemnification acted with gross negligence or wilful misconduct in the performance of their duties to us. A court in which an action is brought may, however, determine that indemnification is appropriate nonetheless. Share capital Our authorized share capital amounts to  40.8 million divided into: 85,000,000 ordinary shares and 85,000,000 preference shares, each with a par value of  0.24. At December 31, 2007, there were 65,348,796 ordinary shares issued and outstanding. No preference shares are currently issued and outstanding. The ordinary shares can be issued in bearer or registered form. The preference shares can only be issued in registered form. Only bearer ordinary shares can trade on NYSE Euronext Amsterdam. The preference shares can only be issued in registered form. No share certificates will be issued for shares in registered form. Ordinary shares Our ordinary shares may be in registered or bearer form and will be in bearer form unless the shareholder indicates otherwise in writing. Only bearer ordinary shares can trade on NYSE Euronext Amsterdam. 122 Management Report Articles of Association and Share Capital Bearer ordinary shares All of our bearer ordinary shares are embodied in a single global share certificate which will not be exchanged for single or multiple physical securities and which we will deposit with NECIGEF for safekeeping on behalf of the parties entitled to the ordinary shares in bearer form. The ordinary shares represented by the single global share certificate may only be transferred through the book-entry system maintained by NECIGEF. A participant in the collective deposit (verzameldepot) of a securities institution admitted to NECIGEF may, at his own expense, require conversion of one or more of his bearer ordinary shares into ordinary shares in registered form. Registered ordinary shares We enter holders of registered ordinary shares in the register of shareholders. We do not issue share certificates. However, the shareholder may request an extract from the shareholders register regarding the ordinary shares registered in his name. We are required to provide this free of charge. Dutch law requires that transfers of registered ordinary shares be recorded in a written instrument to which we are a party or which is served on us, or that the transaction be acknowledged by us. Preference shares As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not issued any preference shares. On October 25, 2000, we established a foundation called Stichting Preferente Aandelen Crucell, also referred to as the Preferred Foundation. The Preferred Foundations objective is to safeguard our interests, our business and parties connected therewith by blocking any influences that may threaten these interests, which interests may include the continuity, identity of the proposed acquirer or identity of us, our business and the parties connected therewith. The Preferred Foundation can safeguard these interests through acquiring and managing our preference shares and by exercising the rights attaching to these shares, in particular, the voting rights. The Preferred Foundation has an option to acquire preference shares up to 100% of the number of our outstanding shares, necessary to match the total number of statutory votes on all of the ordinary shares outstanding at the time of an acquisition. The Preferred Foundation must pay at least 25% of the nominal value of the preference shares it acquires from us. If we acquire any preference shares, they may be cancelled. A board of governors of up to five persons directs the Preferred Foundation. Jan Oosterveld, in his capacity as chairman of our Supervisory Board, and Pieter Bouw, Mick W. den Boogert, Sweder van Wijnbergen and Gerard P. Krans, have been appointed to the board of governors. A majority of these members may not be members or former members of our Management or Supervisory Board, or an employee of any of our advisers, any of our banks or us. These independent members are appointed by the board of governors. The non independent members are appointed by our Supervisory Board after consultation with our Management Board. Membership of the board of governors of the Preferred Foundation terminates upon: · Voluntary retirement, reaching the age of 72, death or bankruptcy; · For our non independent members, resignation, or dismissal by the members of our Supervisory Board; · For our independent members, if they cease to be independent; · Dismissal by the complete board of the Preferred Foundation; or · Periodic retirement in accordance with a rotation plan to be drawn up by the Preferred Foundations board of governors, however, these members may be reappointed. 123 Management Report Articles of Association and Share Capital Issue of shares and pre-emptive rights Our general meeting of shareholders, or our Management Board if the general meeting of shareholders has delegated the power to it, has the authority to decide on any further issuance of shares or rights to subscribe for shares and on the terms and conditions of such issuance. Our Management Board is the authorized corporate body (orgaan) for this purpose until November 21, 2008 and this authorization may at any time be extended for periods of up to five years. Our Management Boards authority to issue shares is limited to our authorized share capital. Our Management Board can issue shares of any class if it has the approval of our Supervisory Board. Without specific authorization from our general meeting of shareholders our Management Board may not issue preference shares or grant options for such shares if, as a result, more preference shares than other shares will or could become outstanding. Each holder of ordinary shares has pre-emptive rights to subscribe for any ordinary shares that we issue and has pre-emptive rights to subscribe if we grant rights to subscribe for ordinary shares. Pre-emptive rights are in proportion to the percentage of our outstanding ordinary shares that the holder owns. Pre-emptive rights do not apply to ordinary shares issued for a non-cash contribution, to ordinary shares issued to our employees or ordinary shares issued to a person who exercises a previously acquired right to subscribe for ordinary shares. Holders of preference shares do not have pre-emptive rights if we issue ordinary shares, and holders of ordinary shares have no pre-emptive rights to purchase preference shares if we issue preference shares. If our Management Board has been delegated the authority to issue shares, it can limit or exclude any pre-emptive rights as long as the general meeting of shareholders has granted it that power and our Supervisory Board approves. At present, our Management Board is authorized to do this. This authorization is valid until November 21, 2008 and the general meeting of shareholders may at any time extend this authorization for periods of up to five years. Our shares cannot be issued below par. The ordinary shares must be fully paid up upon issue. Preference shares may be issued without being fully paid up, but at least one-quarter of the nominal amount must be paid up upon subscription, and each issue of preference shares must have the same amount paid up. Our Management Board may determine the day and the amount of a further call for payment on preference shares. Acquisition by us of shares in our own capital We may acquire our own shares if the following conditions are met: · Our general meeting of shareholders has authorized our Management Board to acquire the shares; · The authorization specifies the number of shares that we may acquire, the manner in which they may be acquired and the limits within which the price must be set; · Our shareholders equity, after deduction of the price of acquisition, is not less than the sum of the paid and called up portion of the share capital and the reserves that provisions of Dutch law or our articles of association require us to maintain; and · The aggregate par value of the shares to be acquired, together with the shares in our share capital that we already hold directly, indirectly or as pledgee, does not equal more than one-tenth the aggregate par value of our total issued share capital. We may not acquire our own shares if they have not been fully paid-up. The authorization by the general meeting of shareholders may be for a term of up to 18 months. We and our subsidiaries may not vote shares that we or they hold. We may acquire shares to transfer them to our employees or the employees of our group companies under designated stock option plans without authorization. 124 Management Report Articles of Association and Share Capital Capital reduction If our Management Board proposes, our Supervisory Board approves and Dutch law permits, the general meeting of shareholders can reduce our issued share capital by cancellation of shares or reduction of the nominal value of shares. Other key provisions of our articles of association Voting rights and shareholders meetings We must hold annual general meetings of shareholders within six months of the end of our fiscal year. The annual meeting is held, among other things, to adopt our annual accounts. We must hold extraordinary general meetings of shareholders whenever: · Shareholders and holders of depositary receipts for shares together representing at least one-tenth of our outstanding share capital request it in writing, listing the topics to be discussed; and · Our Management Board or our Supervisory Board deems appropriate. General meetings of shareholders may only be held in the municipalities of Leiden, Amsterdam, Haarlemmermeer (including Schiphol Airport and Schiphol-Rijk), Utrecht, Rotterdam and The Hague. Each shareholder can attend general meetings in person or by proxy, address the meeting and vote. Each share, whether ordinary or preference, confers one vote on the shareholder. The Management Board must be notified in writing of a registered shareholders intention to attend the general meeting of shareholders. The holders of bearer ordinary shares can vote if a NECIGEF participant sends a written statement as to their shareholdings to our offices. Resolutions are passed by absolute majority of votes cast unless stated otherwise in Dutch law and our articles of association. The general meeting of shareholders can amend our articles of association, dissolve us, merge us or demerge us only if proposed by the Supervisory Board. Dutch law and our articles of association do not impose any limitations on non Dutch ownership or voting of our ordinary shares. Annual report We have a calendar fiscal year. Dutch law requires that within five months after the end of our fiscal year, unless the general meeting of shareholders has extended this period for a maximum of six months, our Management Board must make available to the shareholders a report with respect to that fiscal year. This report must include the financial statements and a report of an independent accountant. The Annual Report is submitted to the annual general meeting of shareholders for adoption. See Management  Limitation of Liability and Indemnification Matters. Dividends Annual dividends may only be paid out of profits as shown in the adopted annual financial statements. We may not make distributions if the distribution would reduce our shareholders equity below certain reserves required by Dutch law or our articles of association. The profits must first be used to set up and maintain reserves required by Dutch law and must then be set off against certain financial losses. The preference shares will be paid their dividends, which will be a certain percentage of their nominal value, first. With Supervisory Board approval, our Management Board then decides whether and how much of the remaining profit they will reserve. Any profits remaining shall be paid as a dividend on the ordinary shares, if the retained earnings are negative or are to be used to form a statutory reserve no dividend will be paid out. With the approval of our Supervisory Board and subject to Dutch law, our Management Board can pay an interim dividend. We can make distributions to shareholders at the charge of one or more of our reserves. Holders of shares are entitled to the full dividend for the fiscal year 2000 and subsequent fiscal years. Any dividends that are not claimed within five years of their declaration revert to us. 125 Management Report Articles of Association and Share Capital Amendment of our articles of association and liquidation rights The general meeting of shareholders may only resolve to amend our articles of association or to dissolve, merge or demerge us on the proposal of our Supervisory Board. The class of shareholders affected must approve a resolution to amend the articles of association to change the rights of the class. If we are dissolved and liquidated, after we pay all debts and liquidation expenses, the holders of preference shares have first rights to payment of any dividends not fully paid to them in previous years and of the nominal value of their preference shares. Any remaining assets will be distributed to the holders of ordinary shares. Enforcement of civil liabilities We are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, and the majority of the members of our Supervisory Board, all of the members of our Management Board and management team and all of the experts named in this document are residents of, and most of our and their assets are in, jurisdictions outside the U.S. As a result, it may not be possible for you to effect service of process within the U.S. upon us or these persons, or to enforce against us or these persons in courts in the U.S., judgments of these courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. securities laws. In addition, it is not clear whether a Dutch court would impose civil liability on us, members of our Management Board or Supervisory Board or management team or any of the experts named in this document in an original action based solely upon the federal securities laws of the U.S. brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the Netherlands. Dutch law, furthermore, does not recognize a shareholders right to bring a derivative action on behalf of a corporation. Our legal counsel in the Netherlands, Allen & Overy, has advised us that because there is no treaty on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters between the U.S. and the Netherlands, courts in the Netherlands will not automatically enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court. In order to obtain a judgment enforceable in the Netherlands, claimants must litigate the relevant claim again before a Dutch court of competent jurisdiction. Under current practice, however, a Dutch court will recognize a final and conclusive judgment rendered by a U.S. court if the Dutch court finds that: · The U.S. court assumed jurisdiction on grounds that are acceptable from an international law perspective; · The final judgment results from proceedings compatible with Dutch concepts of due process; and · The final judgment does not contravene public policy of the Netherlands. If the Dutch court recognizes the final judgment, that court generally will grant the same judgment without litigating again on the merits. Obligations of shareholders to disclose holdings under Dutch law Under the Financial Supervision Act any person who, directly or indirectly, acquires, or disposes of, an interest in the capital and/or the voting rights of a public limited liability company incorporated under Dutch law with an official listing on a stock exchange within the European Economic Area must immediately give written notice to the Dutch securities regulator AFM by means of a standard form, of such acquisition or disposal if, as a result of such acquisition or disposal, the percentage of capital interest and/or voting rights held by such person meets, exceeds or falls below the following thresholds: 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75% and 95%. The notification requirement also applies if a persons capital interest or voting right meets, exceeds or falls below the abovementioned thresholds as a result of a change in the share capital or voting rights, and the notification must be made no later than the fourth trading day after the AFM has published the notification as described in the following sentence. Crucell is required to notify the AFM immediately if its share capital or voting rights change by 1% or more since the previous notification. Other changes must be notified periodically. 126 Management Report Articles of Association and Share Capital In addition, the members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board are required to immediately notify the AFM of any change in the number of Crucell shares or options they hold or voting rights in respect of these shares. The AFM will disclose this information in a public register on its website. Non-compliance with the obligations of the Financial Supervision Act can lead to criminal prosecution. In addition, a civil court can issue orders against any person who fails to notify or incorrectly notifies in accordance with the Financial Supervision Act, including suspension of the voting rights in respect of such persons ordinary shares. 127 Management Report 128 Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 130 Financial Statements Consolidated Income Statements 132 Consolidated Balance Sheets 133 Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity 134 Consolidated Cash flow Statements 135 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 136 Company Financial Statements 174 Notes to the Company Financial Statements 175 Other Information Other information 177 Information for Shareholders and Investors 179 Cross-reference to Form 20-F 189 Exhibits 191 129 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Supervisory Board and Shareholders of Crucell N.V. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Crucell N.V. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2007. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. The consolidated financial statements of the Company, for the year ended December 31, 2005 were audited by other auditors whose reports dated April 18, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on these statements. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Crucell N.V. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated May 6, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte Accountants B.V.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of income, changes in equity and cash flows of Crucell N.V. for the year ended December 31, 2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (U.S.). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of Crucell N.V. for the year ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. /s/ Ernst & Young Accountants Amsterdam, the Netherlands April 18,

(Crucell or the Company) is incorporated and domiciled in Leiden, the Netherlands. Its shares are publicly traded at NYSE Euronext Amsterdam (CRXL), and SWX Swiss Exchange Zurich (CRX). Its American Depositary Shares (ADSs) are publicly traded at Nasdaq New York (CRXL). Crucell and its subsidiaries together constitute the Crucell Group, or the Group. The Company has subsidiaries in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Sweden, Korea and the U.S. Crucell employed 1,126 people at December 31, 2007 (2006: 1,073). Crucell is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company, focused on developing, producing and marketing products to combat infectious diseases. Its core vaccine portfolio includes Inflexal V, a vaccine against influenza, paediatric vaccines Hepavax-Gene and Quinvaxem and travel vaccines Vivotif, Dukoral, and Epaxal. In addition to these portfolio vaccines, the Company has a broad pipeline of new potential vaccines and proteins. The Company has developed various proprietary technologies such as PER.C6, MAbstract, AdVac, STAR and virosome-adjuvanted technologies. Crucell licenses these proprietary technologies to others in the biopharmaceutical industry. Changes in the scope of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the results of the acquired companies for the period from the date of acquisition unless mentioned otherwise. There have been no changes in the scope of consolidation in 2007. In 2006 the most significant changes in the scope of consolidation were due to: · the acquisition of the shares of Berna Biotech AG (February 2006); · the establishment of Crucell Vaccines Inc. followed by the acquisition of the assets and liabilities of Berna Products Corporation (October 2006) and · the acquisition of the shares of SBL Vaccin Holding AB (November 2006). Further details on these acquisitions are provided in note 5.8.1.

There are no differences between IFRS applied by the Group and IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. As permitted by article 362 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code, the Company financial statements have been prepared applying the same IFRS accounting policies as used in the consolidated financial statements. In conformity with article 402, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, the Company income statement is presented in abbreviated form. The consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007 were authorized for issue in accordance with a directors resolution on April 29, 2008. Certain prior year figures were restated to confirm with the current years classification. Foreign currency translation The functional and presentation currency of the Group is the Euro. All values are rounded to the nearest thousand ( 000) unless indicated otherwise. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency based on the primary economic environment in which it operates. Items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. At the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with different functional currencies are translated into Euro at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and their income statements and cash flow statements are translated into Euro at the weighted average exchange rates for the year. The exchange differences arising on the translation are taken directly to the translation reserve, a separate component of equity. 1.3 Use of estimates and judgments The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and use of critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amount recognized in the financial statements are described in the following notes: · note 2.1 Revenue recognition · note 5.8 Accounting for business combinations · note 5.4 Utilization of tax carry forward losses · note 5.6/ 5.7/ 5.8 Impairment reviews of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill · note 5.10 Valuation of defined benefit plans · note 5.14 Valuation of inventories · note 5.17 Valuation of share-based-payments · note 5.18 Recognition of provisions for litigations and claims 1.4 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and for the period then ended. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company, using consistent accounting policies. All intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated in full. Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operational policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, which is the date on which the Company obtains control and continue to be consolidated until the date such control ceases. 137 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Minority interests represent the portion of profit or loss for the year and net assets at the end of the year not held by the Company and are presented separately in the consolidated income statement and within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from the equity attributable to equity holders of the parent. Joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control. A jointly controlled entity is a joint venture that involves the establishment of a separate entity in which each venturer has an interest. The Company recognizes its interest in joint ventures using the equity method, under which the investment in the joint venture is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Companys share of net assets of the joint venture. The income statement reflects the share of the results of operations of the joint venture. Periodically the Company determines whether it is necessary to recognize an impairment loss with respect to the Companys net investment in the joint venture. The reporting dates of the joint ventures are the same as those of the Company and the accounting policies of the joint ventures conform to those used by the Company. Associates The Companys investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. An associate is an entity in which the Company has significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture. The reporting dates of the associates are the same as those of the Company. If an associate uses accounting policies other than those of the Company for like transactions and events in similar circumstances, adjustments are made to conform the associates accounting policies to the Companys accounting policies.

Adoption of these revised standards and interpretations did not have any significant effect on the Groups consolidated financial statements or on the Companys financial statements. They did however give rise to additional disclosures. The following standard and interpretations are effective as of 2007 and have been adopted: · IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures, and the complementary amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements  Capital disclosures, introduces new disclosures relating to financial instruments and does not have any impact on the classification and valuation of the Companys financial instruments, or the disclosures relating to taxation and trade and other payables. · IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2, requires consideration of transactions involving the issuance of equity instruments, where the identifiable consideration received is less than the fair value of the equity instruments issued in order to establish whether or not they fall within the scope of IFRS 2. This interpretation does not have any impact on the financial statements. · IFRIC 10, Interim financial reporting and impairment, prohibits the impairment losses recognized in an interim period on goodwill and investments in equity instruments and in financial assets carried at cost to be reversed at a subsequent balance sheet date. This interpretation does not have any impact on the financial statements. · IFRIC 11, IFRS 2  Group and treasury share transactions. IFRIC 11 provides guidance on whether share-based transactions involving treasury shares or involving group entities (for example, options over a parents shares) should 138 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements be accounted for as equity settled or cash-settled share-based payment transactions in the stand-alone accounts of the parent and group companies. This interpretation does not have an impact on the financial statements. The following standard was not yet effective as December 31, 2007, but has been early adopted: · IFRS 8, Operating segments (effective from 1 January 2009). IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14 and aligns segment reporting with the requirements of the U.S. standard SFAS 131, Disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information. The new standard requires a management approach, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes. The Group applied IFRS 8 starting January 1, 2007. The impact of the early adoption is described in note 4 Segment information. The following amendment and interpretation were not yet effective as per balance sheet date and were not early adopted by the Company: · IAS 23 (Amendment), Borrowing costs (effective from 1 January 2009). The amendment to the standard is still subject to endorsement by the European Union. It requires an entity to capitalize borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset (one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale) as part of the cost of that asset. The option of immediately expensing those borrowing costs will be removed. The Company will apply IAS 23 (Amended) from 1 January 2009, but adoption will have no impact on the Companys financial statements as borrowing costs directly attributable to qualifying assets are already capitalized in line with the allowed alternative treatment of IAS 23. · IFRIC 14, IAS 19  The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction (effective from 1 January 2008). IFRIC 14 provides guidance on assessing the limit in IAS 19 on the amount of the surplus that can be recognized as an asset. It also explains how the pension asset or liability may be affected by a statutory or contractual minimum-funding requirement. The Company will apply IFRIC 14 from 1 January 2008 and currently assesses the impact of the interpretation. This interpretation is still subject to endorsement by the European Union. The following interpretations to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Companys accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008 or later periods but are not relevant for the Companys operations: · IFRIC 12, Service concession arrangements (effective from 1 January 2008). IFRIC 12 applies to contractual arrangements whereby a private sector operator participates in the development, financing, operation and maintenance of infrastructure for public sector services. IFRIC 12 is not relevant to the Companys operations because none of the Companys companies provides for public sector services. This interpretation is still subject to endorsement by the European Union. · IFRIC 13, Customer loyalty programmes (effective from 1 July 2008). IFRIC 13 clarifies that where goods or services are sold together with a customer loyalty incentive (for example, loyalty points or free products), the arrangement is a multiple-element arrangement and the consideration receivable from the customer is allocated between the components of the arrangement in using fair values. IFRIC 13 is not relevant to the Companys operations because none of the Companys companies operate any loyalty programmes. This interpretation is still subject to endorsement by the European Union. 139 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2 Summary of significant accounting policies 2.1 Revenue recognition General In general, revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue and the cost (to be) incurred in the transaction can be measured reliably. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received excluding discounts, rebates, value added taxes and duties. Revenues are recognized on a gross basis when the Group acts as the principal in an arrangement, and recognized on a net basis when the Group acts as agent. Goods or services traded for items of a similar nature are not regarded as transactions that generate revenue. Goods or services traded for dissimilar items are regarded as transactions that generate revenue. Product sales Revenue from product sales is recognized when: · the significant risk and rewards of ownership of the products have passed to the buyer, · the Group does not retain either managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership or effective control over the goods sold, · the amount of revenue and the cost (to be) incurred in the transaction can be measured reliably and · it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity. Licence revenues The Group recognizes initial fees to the licensing of the technology as revenues over the period of the significant continuing performance obligations, if any, and upon transfer of the significant risks and rewards to the buyer. Under certain arrangements, the Group has no continuing performance obligations after delivery of the associated technology under the license agreement or any other arrangement with the licensee. In such arrangements, initial license fees are recognized as revenue when significant risks and rewards pass to the buyer, which is the moment the transfer of developed technology is completed. The Groups arrangements provide for continuing support of its technology at standard consulting rates. Revenues derived from consulting services that are not essential to licensees ability to use the Groups technology, are recognized as earned during the period that the consulting services are performed. In certain arrangements, the Group collaborates with third parties to develop novel products or processes using its proprietary technology. These arrangements generally include an initial license fee upon the delivery of the proprietary technology and additional fees for providing ongoing research and development activities. The research and development activities performed are substantive and critical to the licensees exploitation of the delivered technology. When significant risks and rewards pass to the buyer, initial fees from these arrangements are recognized as revenues over the period of continuing performance obligations. Additional fees from research and development activities are recognized as revenues earned over the period of the development collaboration or the manufacturing obligation. All fees received under collaboration agreements are non-refundable. Certain of the Groups license agreements provide for additional non-refundable fees to be paid to the Group upon the achievement of milestones by the licensee. These milestone payments may be included in license agreements regardless of whether the Group has continuing performance obligations under a particular agreement. For license agreements where there are no continuing performance obligations, milestone revenue is recognized when those amounts become due and payable upon achievement of the milestone. The licensee has to confirm the achievement of a milestone in writing before the revenue is recognized. The Group also has license agreements with continuing performance obligations. License revenues from the achievement of these research and development milestones, if deemed substantive (as described below), are recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved, and the milestone payments are due and collectible under the terms of the agreement. 140 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Milestones are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met: · The milestone payments are non-refundable under the terms of the agreement; · Achievement of the milestone involved a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement; · Substantial effort involved in achieving the milestone; · The amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone; and · A reasonable amount of time passed between the upfront license payment and the first milestone payment as well as between each subsequent milestone payment. If any of these conditions are not met, the Group would recognize the proportionate amount of the milestone payment upon receipt as revenue that corresponds with the percentage of work already completed. The remaining portion of the milestone payment would be deferred and recognized as revenue as performance obligations are completed. In addition to the initial fee, the Groups arrangements generally provide that the licensee makes semi-annual or annual payments (called license maintenance fees) to maintain the license for a subsequent term. Generally, licensees may terminate the license and related maintenance fees upon 30 days to 90 days notice. License maintenance fees are recognized as revenues when the amounts become fixed and payable. The aggregate of license maintenance fees paid are generally deductible from any earned royalty payments which may be due on future product sales of the licensee, if any, under the license agreement. Royalties are recognized as revenue when they become fixed and payable. Service fees As part of various collaboration agreements, the Group receives service fees for work performed under such agreements. Revenues and related costs associated with completing performance services are recognized when the service is completed and the collectibility of the receivable is deemed probable. Revenues associated with time and material performance contracts are recognized when the costs incurred and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured reliably. 2.2 Cost of product sales and cost of service fees Cost of product sales and cost of service fees both comprise direct labour, materials, and overhead costs, incurred in performing work under various collaboration agreements that directly relate to revenues earned. 2.3 Other operating income Government grants The Group receives certain government grants that support research efforts in defined projects. These grants generally provide for reimbursement of approved costs incurred as defined in various grants. Income associated with these grants is recognized when costs under each grant are incurred in accordance with the terms and conditions of the grant and the collectibility of the receivable is deemed probable and all attaching conditions will be achieved. Where the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognized as income over the period necessary to match the grant on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended to compensate. Other income Other income results from non-core business transactions and mainly consists of the sale of tangible and intangible assets incidental to the business, reimbursement of development costs and sublet of premises. 2.4 Research and Development expenses Expenditure on research activities is recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Internally generated intangible assets arising from the Groups development activities are recognized if all of the recognition criteria for internally generated intangible assets are met, meaning: · an asset is created that can be identified; · it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and · the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Product registration fees will, in principle, meet these recognition requirements. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognized, development expenditure is recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Research and development expenses are comprised 141 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the following types of costs when incurred in performing research and development activities: · Salaries and benefits paid to research and development employees, · Allocated overhead and facility costs, · Pre-clinical study costs, · Clinical trial costs, · Amortization of intangible assets, · Contract services and · Other outside costs. 2.5 Taxes Current tax Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted at the balance sheet date. Current income tax relating to items recognized directly in equity is recognized in equity and not in the income statement. Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to offset the recognized amounts and the Group intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Deferred tax Deferred income tax is calculated using the asset and liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts under IFRS. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except: · where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and · in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences and carry-forwards of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forwards of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized. The unrecognized deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted at the balance sheet date. Income tax relating to items recognized directly in equity is recognized in equity and not in the income statement. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. 2.6 Net loss per share Basic net loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, including the dilutive effect of stock options, if any. 2.7 Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, which are convertible to a known amount of cash and bear an insignificant risk of change in value, to be cash equivalent. 2.8 Financial assets Trade accounts receivable Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are recognized and carried at original nominal invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts. Allowance is made when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect the debts. Bad debts are written off when identified. Available-for-sale investments Available-for-sale investments are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale. After initial measurement, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at 142 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements fair value with unrealized gains or losses being recognized directly in equity in the net unrealized gains reserve. When the investment is disposed of, the cumulative gain or loss previously recorded in equity is recognized in the income statement. Other financial assets Other financial assets are valued at their nominal value less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts. Derecognition of financial assets A financial asset is derecognized when: · The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; · The Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a pass through arrangement; or · The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. 2.9 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of inventories includes expenditures for materials acquired, directly attributable costs and related production overhead expenses. Net realizable value is determined using the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Allowances are made for obsolete inventory. 2.10 Other current assets Other current assets are stated at amortized cost, which generally corresponds with face value, less an adjustment for bad debts. 2.11 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, excluding the costs of day-to-day servicing, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment in value. The cost of replacing a part of a plant or equipment is capitalized if the recognition criteria are met. Where an item of property, plant and equipment comprises major components having different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment. Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets: · Freehold land is not depreciated; · Buildings: 20 to 50 years; · Computer equipment: three years; · Furniture and laboratory equipment: five years; · Leasehold improvements: the shorter of the lease term and ten years. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset is included in the income statement. The assets residual values, useful lives and methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year-end. Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets are added to the cost of these assets until they are substantially ready for their intended use. Qualifying assets are those assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to be completed for their intended use. All other borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the income statement when incurred. 2.12 Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired are measured at cost on initial recognition. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is the fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated intangible assets are not capitalized if the recognition requirements are not met; in which case the expenses associated with generating the intangible asset are recognized in the income statement. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the useful life. The amortization period and the amortization method are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortization period or method, and 143 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in the income statement consistent with the function of the intangible asset. The estimated useful life of the assets is as follows: · Patents and licenses: one year to 20 years; · Customer lists: three years; · Developed technology: five years to 20 years; · In-process R&D is not depreciated until completion of the asset. 2.13 Goodwill and business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. This involves recognizing identifiable assets (including previously unrecognized intangible assets) and liabilities (including contingent liabilities, but excluding future restructuring) of the acquired business at fair value. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially measured at cost, which is the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill includes intangible assets that were identified in a business combination, but not valued separately because the assets were either not separable or could not be measured reliably. Assets identified and included as part of goodwill can be specific customer relationships or supply contracts not meeting the requirements for separate recognition and the workforce acquired. Assigning fair values to the assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination inherently requires the use of estimates. Under IFRS 3 Business Combinations, these fair values can be adjusted up to one year after the acquisition date, which can affect the amount recognized as goodwill. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated from the acquisition date to each of the Groups cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the Group are assigned to those units or groups of units. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and, if necessary, translated into Euro at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 2.14 Impairment of non-financial assets The Group assesses non-financial assets at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the assets recoverable amount. An assets recoverable amount is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment, annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, to which the goodwill has been allocated. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated, an impairment loss is recognized. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods. 2.15 Employee benefits Pensions The Group operates both defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. For defined contribution plans, obligations for contributions are recognized as an expense when they are due. The Group has no obligation to pay further contributions into a defined contribution plan if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all plan benefits. Under defined benefit plans, the pension entitlements are calculated using the projected unit credit actuarial method. The pension liability recognized in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of the plan assets after adding or subtracting unrecognized actuarial gains or losses and past-service costs. 144 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The defined benefit obligation is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value and any unrecognized past-service costs and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted. For each plan the recognized assets are limited to the net total of any cumulative unrecognized net actuarial losses and past-service costs and the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan (the asset ceiling). Actuarial gains and losses in excess of a threshold of the higher of 10% of the pension liabilities and 10% of the fair value of the plan assets are charged or credited to the income statement over the employees expected average remaining working lives. Share-based payment transactions Stock option plans Certain employees receive a portion of their remuneration in the form of stock options, which are treated as share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments (equity-settled transactions). The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which the options are granted, determined using the Black-Scholes stock option pricing model, as described in note 5.17. The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognized, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (the vesting date). The cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Groups best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognized as at the beginning and end of that period with the offsetting entry recorded in share premium in equity. Short-term incentive plans The fair value of share grants under these plans is estimated on the date of grant by multiplying the number of shares available to be granted by the fair value of the Companys shares on the grant date. Management assumes any performance goals required by the short-term incentive plan will be achieved and the award will vest in full. Long-term incentive plans The fair value of share grants under these plans is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-based option valuation model. The model calculates the likelihood of achievement of the market-based measures at various levels and, once a value is determined for the shares, compensation cost is recognized over the measurement period of three years regardless of whether those market-based targets are achieved. Key assumptions for the lattice-based option valuation model include expected volatilities, expected term, dividend yield and risk-free interest rates. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of the Companys stock measured over a period commensurate with the expected term of the grants. The expected term used is the three-year measurement period. Dividend yields used were based on historical information as to dividends declared by the Company. Risk-free interest rates used were equal to the implied yield available on zero-coupon Dutch government bonds with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the share-based instrument. Options granted to non-employees The cost of options granted to non-employees is recognized at the fair value of the goods or services received, together with a corresponding increase in equity, unless that fair value of the goods or services received cannot be estimated reliably, in which case, the fair value is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. 2.16 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Short-term financial liabilities consist of all liabilities with maturities up to one year. Long-term financial liabilities are liabilities with maturities over one year. All loans and borrowings are initially recognized at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognized in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the amortization process. A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation underlying the liability is discharged, cancelled or expired. 145 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2.17 Derivative financial instruments and hedging Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. The Company does not apply formal hedge accounting and consequently any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives are taken directly to net profit or loss for the year. 2.18 Provisions Provisions are recognized when there is a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the income statement net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is significant, provisions are discounted. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a financial expense. 2.19 Leases Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalized at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income. Capitalized leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or, over the lease term, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will own the leased property by the end of the lease term. Leases where the Group does not assume substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases, and are recognized as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. 146 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 3 Financial risk management 3.1 Risk management policies Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern. The Group does not have a target debt-to-equity ratio, but is committed to funding of the majority of the operations with equity. The Group may choose to renew any loan that becomes payable. As part of its overall working capital management efforts, the Group agreed with Novartis to extend payment terms on the supply of Quinvaxem antigens. These transactions were secured by a bank guarantee issued by a third party bank. The capital structure of the Company consists of financial liabilities, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings. Compared to last year there have been no significant changes in our risk management policies. Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognized, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2. Financial risk management objectives The objective of the Groups Corporate Treasury function is to provide financing services to the business, reduce the currency exposures in the Income Statement, optimize return on investments in cash deposits and monitor the financial risks relating to the Groups operations. Risks include market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk and security price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group does not apply formal hedge accounting. 3.2 Foreign currency risk Crucell is exposed to transaction currency risk as well as translation currency risk. The Company has significant transactional currency exposures because the majority of the Groups sales are denominated in currencies other than the Groups functional currency the Euro. Specifically, movements in the U.S. Dollar/Euro exchange rate affect the results of operations because a significant portion of sales are denominated in U.S. Dollars. As a result of significant operations in Switzerland and Korea, movements in the Swiss Franc and the Korean Won compared to the Euro can also significantly affect results of operations because the balance sheet and the income statement of the Swiss and Korean subsidiaries are translated into Euro, the Groups functional currency. The Group only engages on a limited basis in derivative transactions to hedge its currency exposure. The Group did not apply formal hedge accounting in 2007 but tries to realize economic hedging in its currency exposures. Foreign currency risk sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to U.S. Dollar, Swiss Franc, Korean Won, Swedish Crown and Australian dollar. The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10 percent strengthening of these currencies. The sensitivity analysis includes outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation as at December 31, 2007 for a 10 percent change in foreign currency rates. A positive amount indicates an increase in income before income tax and equity. In thousands of Euro 2007 2006 Impact on Loss Impact Loss before tax on equity before tax Equity U.S. Dollar 1,876 517 321 538 Swiss Franc (4,950 ) 19,706 (1,180 ) 20,595 Korean Won 860 8,055 1,113 8,320 Swedish Crown (486 ) 3,825 (33 ) 4,029 Australian Dollar 882    For a 10 percent weakening of the foreign currencies against the Euro, there would be approximately an equal and opposite effect on the income before income tax and equity. The revaluation effects of investments in foreign entities are recognized in equity. As we have significant operations denominated in other currencies then the Euro, the movements of currency exchange rates show a significant effect on equity. It is the Groups policy to limit the currency effects through the income statement. The effect on income before income tax as 147 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in 2007 and 2006 is mainly attributable to timing differences between the arising of exposures and the settlement thereof. 3.3 Interest rate risk The Company is exposed to interest rate risks as a result of changes in the market interest rates compared to loans with fixed rates. The Group has several loans with fixed interest rates, which total  45,795 (2006:  46,413). Details on the interest rates and maturity of these loans are provided in note 5.19. Except for cash and cash equivalents, the Group does not have any interest bearing financial instruments that have a floating rate. The Group had cash balances of  177,644 of which  14,396 is restricted. (2006:  172,233 of which  14,396 is restricted.) There are no other receivables that generate interest. Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date and the stipulated change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period. The effect of a 1% increase in interest rates on the Groups loss before tax would be a positive result of  1,100 (2006:  1,152). For a 1% decrease in interest rates there would approximately be an equal and opposite effect on the loss before tax. A change in the interest rate does not have an impact on the equity of the Company. The positive effect of a 1% increase of interest on loss before tax is mainly attributable to the Companys interest income generating assets, which are higher than its interest bearing liabilities. 3.4 Credit risk Credit risk represents the risk of financial loss caused by default of the counter party. The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits and trade and other receivables and they represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets. The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade accounts receivable and other receivables. The Group normally trades only with recognized, creditworthy third parties. It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. Where considered appropriate, the Group requires issuance of letters of credit to mitigate credit risk. Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and the Group tracks the payment history of its customers to identify any payment issues that have to be resolved before entering into any new transactions. Allowances are recognized for receivable balances deemed uncollectible upon identification. In determining the recoverability of a trade accounts receivable, the Group considers changes in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The customer base consists mainly of well-respected companies in the field of medicine and non-governmental organizations. While the Group does have concentrations of trade accounts receivable outstanding to supranational organizations, Management has determined the risk of default by these organizations is limited and therefore considers the credit risk to be within acceptable boundaries. Management believes that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts. The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents, and short-term deposits is limited because the counter parties are financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. Furthermore the Group currently invests in liquid securities and money market transactions. Management does not expect any counter party to fail to meet its obligations. The carrying value of these financial assets represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk. The maximum exposure at reporting date amounts to  248,850 (2006:  256,921). 3.5 Security price risk The Groups security price risk is limited to its investment in Galapagos valued at  10,009 (2006:  12,339), which is classified as an available-for-sale investment. The fair value is based on the market quotation of Galapagos. The Group does not actively trade in available-for-sale investments. 148 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Security price risk sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to the security price risks at the reporting date. If the Galapagos share price had been 10% higher/lower: · Loss for the year ended 31 December 2007 would have been unaffected as the investments are classified as available-for-sale and no investments were disposed of or impaired; and · Net unrealized gains reserve would increase/decrease by  1,001 (2006: increase/decrease by  1,234) for the Company as a result of the changes in the fair value of the available-for-sale investment. The Groups sensitivity to security prices did not change significantly from the prior year. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk represents the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities. Prudent liquidity risk management implies ensuring sufficient availability of cash resources for funding of the operations. The Group aims to maintain a solid cash base. The current liquidity risk is considered to be limited because the Group has sufficient funding to meet its obligations in the foreseeable future. Reference is made to note 5.19 Short and long-term financial liabilities for an analysis of the most significant financial liabilities. The Group has a total cash balance of  163,248 as per December 31, 2007 (2006:  157,837). 3.6 Financial instruments by category Financial assets In thousands of Euro December 31 2007 2006 Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss Derivative financial instruments 29 68 Available-for-sale investments carried at fair value Investment Galapagos 10,009 12,339 Loans and receivables Other financial assets 16,153 16,430 Cash and cash equivalents 163,248 157,837 Trade accounts receivable 47,563 58,563 Other current assets 11,848 11,684 238,812 244,514 248,850 256,921 The carrying value of the financial assets approximates the fair value.

The fair value of this loan is estimated to be  4,353 at December 31, 2007. The fair value of the loan is lower than the carrying value due to an increase in the interest rate since inception of the loan. · A mortgage loan related to the new production facility in Leiden, the Netherlands with a carrying value of  16,811. The fair value of the mortgage loan is estimated to be  16,710. The fair value of the loan is lower than the carrying value due to an increase in the interest rate since inception of the mortgage loan. The fair values of the loans have been calculated by discounting the face values with the interest rate of financial instruments with a similar risk profile and term. The fair values of the forward exchange contracts were calculated making use of the spot rate of the underlying exchange rates as per December 31, 2007. 3.7 Derivative financial instruments The Company only engaged in forward foreign exchange contracts. The Company did not have any additional derivative financial instruments that required recognition on the balance sheet. The terms of the forward foreign exchange contracts are as follows: In thousands of Euro Expiry date Exchange rate Assets Liabilities Forward foreign exchange contracts  purchase AUD 1,300 February 26, 2008 CHF/ AUD 1.00 12 AUD 4,500 June 16, 2008 CHF/ AUD 0.99 4 AUD 4,500 July 15, 2008 CHF/ AUD 0.99 4 AUD 4,500 August 15, 2008 CHF/ AUD 0.98 14 Forward foreign exchange contracts  sale USD 5,500 January 31, 2008 CHF/USD 1.13 11 The Company chose not to apply formal hedge accounting. The total positive fair value of the financial instruments amounts to  13 (2006:  57). The derivative financial instruments assets of  29 (2006:  68) are included in the other current assets. The derivative financial instruments liabilities of  16 (2006:  11) are included in the other current liabilities. The notional principal amounts of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts amount to the purchase of AUD 14,800 and the sale of $ 5,500. 150 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 4 Segment information 4.1 General From January 1, 2007 Crucell early adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments, which replaces IAS 14, Segment reporting. The new standard requires segment reporting to be based on the internal management reporting provided to the Management Board. The Companys segmentation is based on our internal management reporting, which was changed in 2007 to distinguish the following two segments: · Vaccines: developing, producing and marketing vaccines worldwide to combat infectious diseases; · Proteins: leverage Crucells novel, proprietary technologies to develop monoclonal antibodies to combat infectious diseases. In thousands of Euro Vaccines Proteins Total Product sales 173,544 4,025 177,569 License revenues 8,680 3,531 12,211 Service fees 12,916 1,090 14,006 Total revenue 195,140 8,646 203,786 Cost of product sales (121,779 ) (2,778 ) (124,557 ) Cost of service fees (7,488 ) (2,839 ) (10,327 ) Total cost of goods sold (129,267 ) (5,617 ) (134,884 ) Gross margin 65,873 3,029 68,902 Government grants 5,934 1,152 7,086 Other income 2,243 1 2,244 Total other operating income 8,177 1,153 9,330 Research and development (48,019 ) (15,976 ) (63,995 ) Selling, general and administrative (54,574 ) (11,047 ) (65,621 ) Impairment (171 )  (171 ) Total other operating expenses (102,764 ) (27,023 ) (129,787 ) Operating loss (28,714 ) (22,841 ) (51,555 ) Total assets 549,784 75,136 624,920 Revenue reported is revenue generated from external customers. There were no inter-segment sales in 2007 (2006: Nil). The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Groups accounting policies described in note 2. Segment operating loss represents the loss earned by the segments without allocation of financial income and expenses, results of investments associates and joint ventures, gain on the sale of investments and income tax. This is the measure reported to the Management Board for the assessment of the segments performance. This segmentation was not applicable throughout 2006 and comparative data cannot be produced without significant arbitrary allocations. 4.2 Information about major products The breakdown of the Companys revenues from its product sales was as follows: In thousands of Euro Year ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Paediatric vaccines 77,371 35,933  Respiratory vaccines 33,188 40,386  Travel vaccines 47,282 23,072  Other vaccines 15,703 3,933  Vaccines 173,544 103,324  Proteins 4,025 594  177,569 103,918  4.3 Information about major customers In 2007, sales to our two largest customers, which are in the paediatric vaccines area, amounted to  45.5 million or 25.6% and  23.4 million or 13.2% of net product sales.

In the Netherlands, anti-abuse laws are applicable that may limit the ability to offset tax losses against future profits when the beneficial ownership of a company changes. This law could limit our ability to realize the benefits of our tax loss by an amount of  26,170. The unrecognized carry forward losses expire as follows: 2009  3,062 2010  4,086 2011  81,744 After 2011  163,198 Unlimited  2,421 Total  254,511 The Company has evaluated evidence impacting the recoverability of its deferred tax assets, which consist principally of tax loss carry forwards. We recognized a deferred tax asset of  678 for the carry forward losses of SBL. Tax rate changes The Netherlands maximum domestic statutory corporate income tax rate is 25.5% for 2007 (a 20% tax rate applies to the first  25 of profit, and a 23% tax rate applies to profits from  25 up to  60), which is reduced from 29.6% for 2006 and 31.5% for 2005. As of January 1, 2008, the Netherlands maximum statutory corporate income tax rate will remain 25.5%, although a 20% tax rate will apply to the first  40 of profit, and a 23% tax rate will apply to profits from  40 up to  200. In Korea, the tax holiday granted by the government is decreasing over time. From financial year 2007 to financial year 2009 the applicable tax rate will be 16.5%. As of 2010 the tax rate will be the regular statutory income tax rate of 27.5%. The Spanish domestic statutory corporate income tax rate amounts to 32.5% in 2007 and will be decreased to 30% in 2008. The Italian domestic statutory corporate income tax rate amounts to 33% in 2007 and will be decreased to 27.5% in 2008. 5.5 Net loss per share In thousands of Euro Year ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders (45,947 ) (87,565 ) (15,578 ) Weighted average number of ordinary shares Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the year 65,102,801 57,064,034 39,852,064 Net loss per share  basic (0.71 ) (1.53 ) (0.39 ) Net loss per share  diluted (0.71 ) (1.53 ) (0.39 ) 154 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Because the effect of issuing potential ordinary shares under stock options plans, stock plans and warrants is anti-dilutive, these shares do not have an impact on the calculation of diluted net loss per share. 5.6 Property, plant and equipment Amounts in thousands of Euro Cost Freehold Land and buildings Plant and equipment Assets under construction Total At January 1, 2006 5,704 16,118 14,478 36,300 Additions 1,902 6,318 12,117 20,337 Acquisition of subsidiaries 63,753 55,639 9,261 128,653 Disposals (149 ) (2,188 )  (2,337 ) Reclassifications 417 939 (1,356 )  Effect of movements in exchange rates (1,880 ) (1,736 ) (202 ) (3,818 ) At December 31, 2006 69,747 75,090 34,298 179,135 Additions 245 5,913 20,998 27,156 Disposals (147 ) (995 )  (1,142 ) Effect of movements in exchange rates (4,238 ) (5,299 ) (412 ) (9,949 ) At December 31, 2007 65,607 74,709 54,884 195,200 Depreciation and impairment At January 1, 2006 (1,773 ) (9,898 )  (11,671 ) Depreciation charge for the year (3,836 ) (10,439 )  (14,275 ) Impairment (7,746 ) (11,822 )  (19,568 ) Disposals 33 2,060  2,093 Effect of movements in exchange rates 956 1,348  2,304 At December 31, 2006 (12,366 ) (28,751 )  (41,117 ) Depreciation charge for the year (4,490 ) (9,963 )  (14,453 ) Impairment (171 )   (171 ) Disposals 144 935  1,079 Effect of movements in exchange rates 2,105 2,882  4,987 At December 31, 2007 (14,778 ) (34,897 )  (49,675 ) Net book value At December 31, 2007 50,829 39,812 54,884 145,525 At December 31, 2006 57,381 46,339 34,298 138,018 Depreciation is included in the cost of goods sold for  11,176 (2006:  8,995), research and development costs for  2,353 (2006:  4,448) and selling, general and administrative costs for  924 (2006:  832). Impairment In the year ended December 31, 2006, an impairment loss of  19,568 was recognized for two buildings, including installed equipment that were acquired in the business combination with Berna Biotech. Both buildings are located in Switzerland. Berna performed contract manufacturing and conducted a candidate vaccine development program in those buildings. The development of the candidate vaccine and the contract manufacturing were phased out during 2006. The buildings are specially configured for biotechnology purposes and it is impracticable to separate the equipment from the buildings. Since there 155 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements was no direct use for these buildings for any of the Companys other activities, no market for the sale of the buildings to third parties and no expectation that these buildings could be utilized in the foreseeable future, an impairment was recorded for the total carrying amount of  19,568 as at December 31, 2006. On March 3, 2008 the Group entered into an exclusive agreement with Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, pursuant to which the Group will manufacture certain vaccine components for use by Wyeth in clinical studies. The contract manufacturing will take place in one of the two buildings that was impaired in 2006. This is an indication that the impairment loss recognized in 2006 no longer exists or may have decreased. The Group will estimate the recoverable amount, if any, of that asset as of the first subsequent reporting date after entry into the contract and will reverse the previous impairment loss, to the extent of any such recoverable amount. This is because the agreement with Wyeth is a subsequent event that arose after the December 31, 2007 balance sheet date. Lease and borrowing costs At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company held laboratory equipment under finance leases with a cost of  11,137 and 10,912, respectively and a net book value of  11,137 and  7,291. The laboratory equipment is used in the new production facility in Leiden, the Netherlands, and is not yet depreciated as the asset is still under construction. These leases are secured by the value of the underlying assets and a compensating cash balance. At December 31, 2007 an amount of  1,516 of borrowing costs related to the construction of a new production facility in Leiden, the Netherlands, has been capitalized (2006:  744). The borrowing costs are capitalized at a capitalization rate of 4.55%. Commitments The remaining contractual commitments amount to  4,696 (2006:  11,693, 2005:  10,500) for purchases of property, plant and equipment, mainly related to the new GMP production facility in Leiden, the Netherlands. 5.7 Intangible assets In thousands of Euro Customer Patents and Developed In-process Cost lists licenses technologies R&D Total At January 1, 2006   10,669  10,669 Additions 8,316    8,316 Disposals  (19 )   (19 ) Acquisition of subsidiaries  26,771 34,729 60,788 122,288 Transfer in process R&D   42,838 (42,838 )  Effect of movements in exchange rates (104 ) (613 ) (1,022 ) (257 ) (1,996 ) At December 31, 2006 8,212 26,139 87,214 17,693 139,258 Effect of movements in exchange rates (302 ) (865 ) (6,378 ) (1,500 ) (9,045 ) At December 31, 2007 7,910 25,274 80,836 16,193 130,213 Amortization and impairment At January 1, 2006   (8,092 )  (8,092 ) Amortization (693 ) (3,704 ) (3,163 )  (7,560 ) Impairment    (10,848 ) (10,848 ) Disposals  19   19 Effect of movements in exchange rates 6 139 38 117 300 At December 31, 2006 (687 ) (3,546 ) (11,217 ) (10,731 ) (26,181 ) Amortization (2,657 ) (4,030 ) (5,207 )  (11,894 ) Effect of movements in exchange rates 48 232 332 1,295 1,907 At December 31, 2007 (3,296 ) (7,344 ) (16,092 ) (9,436 ) (36,168 ) Net book value At December 31, 2007 4,614 17,930 64,744 6,757 94,045 At December 31, 2006 7,525 22,593 75,997 6,962 113,077 156 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Amortization of intangible assets is included in the cost of goods sold for  131 (2006:  nil, 2005: nil), research and development costs for  8,939 (2006:  6,858, 2005:  1,470) and selling, general and administrative costs for  2,824 (2006:  702, 2005: nil). Impairment The impairment loss of  10,848 in 2006 relates to the in process research and development of the Tetra vaccine which was acquired in February 2006 when Crucell acquired Berna Biotech. Management decided to stop the development of Tetra after Quinvaxem received approval by the WHO. Consequently the carrying value of Tetra was impaired for the total amount of  10,848. The following individual intangible assets are considered material to Crucells financial statements: In thousands of Euro Carrying Carrying Remaining amortization value value period at December 31, December 31, December 31, 2007 (in years) 2007 2006 Developed technology Quinvaxem 18.7 34,778 41,671 Developed technology Epaxal 18.2 10,410 11,318 Manufacturing contract 3.2 10,391 14,090 Developed technology Inflexal 10.2 7,052 7,982 In-process R&D Flavimun 6,756 6,962 Developed Technology Vivotif 18.2 5,315 5,778 Brand name Berna Biotech 18.2 3,945 4,289 5.8 Business combinations and goodwill 5.8.1 Business combinations Acquisition of Berna Biotech AG On February 22, 2006, Crucell acquired approximately 97 percent of the outstanding common shares of Berna Biotech AG (Berna Biotech). The Company issued 16,691,492 ordinary shares with a fair value of  20.90 each, which was the published price of the shares of Crucell at the date of exchange to acquire Berna. On March 31, 2006 the Company purchased an additional 1.4% of the issued shares of Berna Biotech, for which the Company issued 239,270 ordinary shares with a fair value of  23.25. The consolidated financial statements include the results of Berna Biotech since March 1, 2006. There were no significant transactions between February 22, 2006 and March 1, 2006. In September 2006 the Company was able to squeeze out the remaining 1.6% minority interest of Berna Biotech. With the squeeze-out, the delisting of Berna Biotech shares was approved and effected by the SWX Swiss Exchange on September 18, 2006. Acquisition of the assets and liabilities of Berna Products Corp. In October 2006, the Company purchased, via its subsidiary Crucell Vaccines Inc. the assets and liabilities of the Florida-based Berna Products Corp. (BPC) from Acambis plc for  13,806, excluding acquisition costs. BPC was originally established in 1990 by Berna Biotech to market Vivotif, Bernas oral typhoid fever vaccine, in the U.S. and Canada and was acquired by Acambis plc in 2003. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of identifiable net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. Assigning fair values to the net assets acquired requires the use of estimates. In accordance with IFRS 3, upon completing the valuation of the net assets acquired, the Company adjusted the provisional values for certain deferred tax liabilities that related to the customer lists acquired resulting in a  1,277 increase of goodwill compared to the amount previously reported at 31 December 2006. Acquisition of SBL Vaccin Holding AB On November 23, 2006 the Group acquired the shares of Stockholm-based SBL Vaccin Holding AB (SBL) from 3i and SEB for a total consideration of  39,341 in cash, excluding acquisition costs. SBL is a fully integrated independent Swedish biotechnology company employing 120 people. SBLs main product is Dukoral, an oral vaccine that protects against cholera and is registered in more than 50 countries excluding the U.S. In addition SBL has a sales and distribution organization for vaccines in Scandinavia. SBL markets a broad range of vaccines sourced from global vaccine companies. 157 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of identifiable net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. Assigning fair values to the net assets acquired requires the use of estimates. In accordance with IFRS 3, upon completing the valuation of the net assets acquired, the Company adjusted the provisional values for certain deferred tax assets that related to property, plant and equipment resulting in a  580 decrease of goodwill compared to the amount previously reported at 31 December 2006. 5.8.2 Goodwill In thousands of Euro Goodwill Cost At January 1, 2006  Acquisition of subsidiaries 47,419 December 31, 2006 47,419 Additions  Adjustments to provisional values 697 Effect of movements in exchange rates (3,739 ) At December 31, 2007 44,377 Net book value At December 31, 2007 44,377 At December 31, 2006 47,419 No impairment losses were recognized on the acquired goodwill. Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated as follows: In thousands of Euro December 31, 2007 2006 Berna Biotech AG 29,970 Berna Biotech Korea Corp. 6,702 Crucell Vaccines Inc. 4,165 SBL Vaccin AB 6,582 Vaccines segment 44,377 Proteins segment  Total goodwill 44,377 47,419 Allocation of goodwill to the vaccines and proteins segments In 2007 Crucell established two segments, a vaccines segment and a proteins segment, and therefore changed its reporting structure. This change also affected the composition of units to which goodwill had previously been allocated. Management exercised significant judgment in determining the segments and the subsequent reallocation of the goodwill. Normally a reallocation is performed using a relative value approach, unless some other method better reflects the goodwill associated with the reporting units. Management demonstrated that an alternative allocation better reflected the goodwill and accordingly, the Group allocated all goodwill to the vaccines segment and no goodwill to the proteins segment based on the following considerations. · The vast majority of the acquired entities is part of the vaccines segment; · During the purchase price allocation process in 2006, goodwill recognized was mostly attributed to the acquired workforce, the vast majority of which still operates in the vaccines segment. Vaccines segment The recoverable amount of the vaccines segment was determined based on a value in use calculation using the traditional discounted cash flow model with a terminal value after the last planning year in 2017. The Group uses a planning period longer than five years, which is a commonly used approach for biotechnology companies as the development and life cycle of a single product can be substantially longer than the five years. Using a period of only five years would not lead to a fair valuation of the vaccines segment. Sensitivities to changes in assumptions Management believes that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions would not decrease the value in use to the extent that the related goodwill would exceed the recoverable amount. Reference is made to the key assumptions below as these have a significant impact on the calculated recoverable amount. The recoverable amount for the goodwill of the vaccines segment exceeds its carrying amount by  177.0 million. The implications of the key assumptions are discussed below: · The recoverable goodwill amount of the vaccines segment was determined on the basis of a pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 13.8%. A higher WACC percentage would reduce the recoverable amount of the vaccines segment; · Expected cash flows for clinical programs that were included in the discounted cash flow analysis were risk adjusted. A higher risk adjustment would reduce the recoverable amount of goodwill; · The discounted cash flow model used did not assign any value to our pre-clinical programs. 158 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 5.9 Investments in associates and joint ventures 5.9.1 Associated companies Kenta Biotech AG, Switzerland In February, 2006, Kenta Biotech AG was founded with a capital of  9,061 (CHF 14,290).

These plans comply with local regulations and practices in the countries in which they operate and differ based on legal requirements, tax legislation, local customs and economic conditions in the countries. While the nature of the plans varies by country, in general, the benefits provided depend on remuneration and years of service. Most of these benefits are administrated by insurance companies or pension funds.

As a result of the acquisitions, the Company now operates defined benefit plans in Switzerland, Korea and Sweden. The pension asset of  2,479 (2006:  2,555) relates to the Swiss pension fund while the pension liability of  3,466 (2007:  3,919) relates to the Swedish and the Korean pension funds. In total, 96% (2006: 97%) of the plan assets and 90% (2006: 89%) of the defined benefit obligation relates to the Swiss pension fund. The weighted average of the principal assumptions used in determining the employee benefit obligations for the defined benefit plans of the Company are shown below: In percent 2007 2006 Discount rate 3.40 3.32 Expected return on plan assets 4.53 4.55 Future salary increases 1.22 1.19 Future pension increases 0.78 0.66 Changes in these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the defined benefit obligations, funding requirements and periodic costs incurred. The Group consults at least annually with external actuaries regarding these assumptions. Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation are as follows: In thousands of Euro 2007 2006 Opening defined benefit obligation, January 1 (72,679 )  Acquisition of subsidiaries  (72,703 ) Interest cost (2,363 ) (2,012 ) Current service cost (3,369 ) (3,105 ) Benefits paid 2,450 2,535 Actuarial (gains)/losses (934 ) 834 Exchange differences 2,389 1,772 Closing defined benefit obligation, December 31 (74,506 ) (72,679 ) Changes in the fair value of plan assets are as follows: In thousands of Euro 2007 2006 Opening fair value of plan assets, January 1 102,306  Acquisition of subsidiaries  100,677 Expected return on plan assets 4,528 3,758 Contributions by employer 2,338 2,137 Contributions by participants 984 981 Benefits paid (2,208 ) (2,355 ) Actuarial gains/(losses) (5,727 ) (211 ) Exchange differences (3,189 ) (2,681 ) Closing fair value of plan assets, December 31 99,032 102,306 160 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements In 2008, the Company expects to contribute an amount similar to the amount contributed in 2007 to its defined benefit pension plans.

As of December 31, 2007, there were 65,348,796 ordinary shares issued and outstanding (2006: 64,802,325). No preference shares are issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2007. On October 25, 2000, the Company established a foundation called Stichting Preferente Aandelen Crucell, also referred to as the Preferred Foundation. The Preferred Foundations object is to safeguard the interests of Crucell, its business and parties connected therewith by blocking any influences that may threaten these interests, which interests may include the continuity, independence or identity of Crucell, its business and parties connected therewith. The Preferred Foundation can safeguard the interests through acquiring and managing the preference shares and by exercising the rights attaching to these shares, in particular, the voting rights. The agreement between the Company and the Preferred Foundation grants an option to the Preferred Foundation to acquire preference shares up to 100% of the number of our outstanding shares, necessary to match the total number of statutory votes on all of the ordinary shares outstanding at the time of a acquisition. The Preferred Foundation must pay at least 25% of the nominal value of the preference shares it acquires from the Company. If the Company acquires any preference shares, they may be cancelled. A board of governors of up to five persons directs the Preferred Foundation. Mr J.P. Oosterveld, in his capacity as chairman of our Supervisory Board, and Mr P. Bouw, Mr M.W. den Boogert, Mr S. van Wijnbergen and Mr G.P. Krans, have been appointed to the board of governors. A majority of these members may not be members or former members of the Management or Supervisory Board of the Company, or an employee of any of our advisers, any of our banks or us. The board of governors appoints these independent members. The Supervisory Board appoints the non-independent members after consultation with the Management Board.

Translation reserve The translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and the translation of goodwill on foreign operations. 5.17 Share-based payment plans Stock-based compensation Stock option plans The Group maintains stock option plans whereby the Remuneration committee of the Supervisory Board may grant options to employees, directors and members of the Supervisory Board. The compensation cost included in operating expenses for those plans was  5,048,  4,000 and  2,349 in 2007, 2006 and 2005 respectively. 163 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements In December 2004, the Supervisory Board approved a new option plan (the 2005 Plan) providing for the grant of stock options to non-Management Committee members of up to 1% of issued ordinary shares. Options granted under this stock option plan are exercisable once vested. Granted options vest straight line over a period of four years. Compensation costs are recognized in accordance with the accelerated method. The options expire five years after date of grant. Upon termination of employment with Crucell, options must be exercised within 90 days. Options granted under the stock option plan are granted at exercise prices, which equal the fair value of the ordinary shares of the Company at the date of grant. All options granted under previous stock option plans (the Prior Plans) are exercisable immediately upon grant. Upon exercise of the options, employees are subject to profit re-distribution provisions. Such provisions entitle the Company to receive a portion of the profits upon the sale of the shares, calculated as the difference between the total proceeds from the sale of shares and the aggregate exercise price. The portion of the profits payable to the Company decreases ratably over one to three years. The relevant portion of any profits derived by the employee from the sale of shares received on exercise of options must be remitted to the Company if the employee terminates employment prior to the end of the relevant period. The options expire four to eight years from the date of grant, or earlier upon termination of employment with the Company. Except as set out below, upon termination of employment, options must be exercised within 90 days. Compensation costs for Prior Plans are recognized in accordance with the accelerated method. Generally, options granted under the Prior Plans are granted at exercise prices, which exceed the fair value of the Companys ordinary shares at the date of grant. No further grants are to be made under the Prior Plans. The Company accounts for its employee stock options under the fair value method. The fair value of options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following weighted average assumptions: In percent Year ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Risk-free interest rate 4.1 3.6 4.1 Expected dividend yield    Expected volatility 33.3 41.8 52.8 Expected life (years) 4.25 4.25 4.31 The risk-free interest rate is based on Dutch treasury securities in effect at the time of grant. In determining the expected volatility, we take into account the historical volatility of the Companys stock over a period commensurate with the expected term of the employee stock options. When establishing the expected life, we take into account the contractual term of the options and historical employee exercise behaviour. The weighted average fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was  16.97,  6.96 and  9.03, respectively. A summary of the stock option activity for the outstanding plans is as follows: Number of options Weighted average exercise price Balance at January 1, 2005 4,819,011 6.42 Granted 123,000 19.45 Exercised (887,182 ) 8.09 Forfeited (25,325 ) 9.07 Balance at December 31, 2005 4,029,504 6.43 Granted 953,466 18.76 Exercised (1,284,655 ) 4.16 Forfeited (12,875 ) 19.40 Balance at December 31, 2006 3,685,440 10.36 Granted 1,514,165 16.97 Exercised (301,475 ) 6.45 Forfeited (237,447 ) 19.15 Balance at December 31, 2007 4,660,683 12.31 Included in the options outstanding as of December 31, 2007 are options to acquire ordinary shares held by former employees and consultants. These individuals have been permitted to continue vesting in these options for services rendered. 164 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The following table summarizes information about the Companys stock options outstanding at December 31, 2007: Exercise price Outstanding Options at December 31, 2007 Weighted average exercise price Weighted average remaining contractual life (years) Exercisable options Weighted average exercise price- exercisable options  2.35   4.99 604,995 3.29 3.14 604,995 3.29  5.00   9.99 1,545,104 7.96 2.34 1,545,104 7.96  10.00   14.99 795,500 13.64 4.06 185,000 11.54  15.00   19.99 1,355,526 18.33 3.94 168,467 17.19  20.00   22.22 359,558 20.59 3.16 108,162 20.81 Total 4,660,683 12.31 3.02 2,611,728 8.26 As of December 31, 2007, a total of 9,720,349 ordinary shares, representing 15% (2006: 15%) of the issued share capital, have been reserved for issuance under the option plan, of which 4,660,683 (2006: 3,785,440) are subject to outstanding options. Warrants In 2003, Crucell granted warrants to acquire 250,000 ordinary shares at an exercise price of  3.00 per share to a consultant in exchange for services. The consultant earned the warrants over the service period that ended in 2004. As at the end of 2006, 100,000 warrants were outstanding and exercisable; these were all exercised during 2007. Share-based incentive plans Under its Short-term Incentive Plan (the STI Plan), Crucell granted executives share awards with vesting contingent upon meeting various Company-wide, departmental and individual performance goals in fiscal 2007. The employees granted shares under the STI Plan were allowed to elect to receive either cash (at a 25% discount from the total award) or shares if the performance criteria were met. As such, grants under the STI Plan are accounted for as liabilities and included in accrued compensation and related benefits in the accompanying balance sheets. In 2007, executives were entitled to a total of 15,544 STI Plan shares, after deduction of income tax. Shares granted under the STI Plan were issued to the executives in the first quarter of 2008. Crucell also has a 2005 Long-term Incentive Plan (the LTI Plan), which allowed for the issuance for up to 36,842 shares of common stock to be granted to executives with vesting contingent upon meeting various market-based goals. Depending on the level of achievement of these market measures, at the end of three years, the number of shares vesting could be 0%-200% of the number of shares originally allowed for issuance. Shares granted in 2005 under the LTI Plan were granted at the share price at the beginning of the year of  10.10, which was lower than the fair value of the shares on the date of grant which was  21.10. The date of grant is the measurement date for the awards. In December 2005, all 36,842 LTI Plan shares were conditionally granted to executives. There were no forfeitures of the LTI Plan grants through December 31, 2007. The conditionally granted shares vested on December 31, 2007 and were issued to the executives in the first quarter of 2008. Executives were entitled to a total of 22,257 LTI Plan shares after deduction of income tax. As of December 31, 2007, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the LTI Plan, which will be recognized in 2007. Compensation cost recognized during the year ended December 31, 2007 related to the LTI Plan amounted to  532 (2006:  531, 2005:  44). Stock option grants to non-employees Crucell has issued stock options to various non-employees in connection with consulting agreements over the years. These non-employee stock options included exercise prices greater than or equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The exercise prices range from  3.49 to  21.38 per share and the stock options expire on dates ranging from May 2010 through December 2011. During 2007, the Company issued stock options to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock to a consultant with an exercise price of  14.58 and expiration date in August 2012. Crucell can terminate the consulting agreements at any time and only those stock options vested as of the date of termination are exercisable. As of December 31, 2007, total options to purchase 67,604 shares of common stock (2006: 57,604) related to consulting agreements were outstanding with an average exercise price of  13.76 and expiration dates ranging from May 2010 through August 2012. The Company recorded compensation expense 165 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements associated with these stock options of  11,  295 and  2,800 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Stock option grants to non-employees are made pursuant to approved stock option plans and activity related thereto is included in the tables above with the employee grants of the approved plans. 5.18 Provisions, commitments and contingencies In thousands of Euro Restructuring Litigation Employee benefits Other Total At January 1, 2006      Acquisition of subsidiaries 71 1,180 3,918 999 6,168 Arising during the year 3,120 259 71 1,145 4,595 Utilized (1,147 ) (212 ) (10 ) (6 ) (1,375 ) Unused amounts reversed (393 ) (215 ) (66 ) (678 ) (1,352 ) Exchange adjustment (5 ) (12 ) 6 (19 ) (30 ) At December 31, 2006 1,646 1,000 3,919 1,441 8,006 Current 2006 1,646 52  1,176 2,874 Non-current 2006  948 3,919 265 5,132 At January 1, 2007 1,646 1,000 3,919 1,441 8,006 Arising during the year    657 657 Utilized (1,364 ) (77 )  (752 ) (2,193 ) Unused amounts reversed (276 ) (50 )  (290 ) (616 ) Movement defined benefit liability   (267 )  (267 ) Exchange adjustment (6 ) (18 ) (186 ) (43 ) (253 ) At December 31, 2007  855 3,466 1,013 5,334 Current 2007    761 761 Non-current 2007  855 3,466 252 4,573 Restructuring In 2006, a restructuring charge was recognized in relation to centralization of R&D functions in Leiden and phasing out R&D projects in Switzerland. The decision to concentrate R&D in Leiden was made to increase efficiency in R&D spending and will result in a reduction in the number of staff employed, which was effectuated in the first quarter of 2007. Legal proceedings The Group is subject to certain lawsuits and other legal proceedings. The current status of any pending proceedings has been reviewed with a legal counsel. Upon consideration of known relevant facts and circumstances, provisions are recognized for losses that are considered to be probable and that can be reasonably estimated at balance sheet date. Complaint filed by Korean landlord The Group leases the property on which the Korean factory is built from Green Cross Holdings Corp under a lease that expires in 2010, and which can be extended for an additional five years. The Group is the only party entitled to terminate the lease. Over a somewhat longer term the Group intends to relocate its operations to another site in Korea. The landlord plans to surrender a portion of the land on which the Korean facility sits, to the local and regional authorities due to construction of a light railway and a subway line extension along with the potential urban development associated therewith. In 2007, the Group demolished a warehouse that was directly in the path of the construction of the subway line. Currently, none of the Groups property is in the way of the construction projects. The landlord has advised the Group it will stop providing utilities in early 2009. Furthermore, the landlord filed a complaint against the Group in November 2007, seeking the demolition of two more buildings at the Korean facility and delivery to them of the land on which those buildings are located. The suit alleges that there is an implied lease agreement for those buildings and the land on which they sit, which automatically terminated upon commencement of the subway line extension project. In January 2008, the Group submitted its answer to the Court, denying the landlords allegations on the grounds that there was no new (whether implied or express) agreement to demolish the buildings and deliver the relevant land. Such an agreement would be inconsistent with the long-term lease agreement which the Group and the landlord executed in April 2000. The Group expects this court case to last several years. 166 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements An unfavourable outcome of the court case may have a material adverse effect on the Groups business, financial condition and results of operations. No provision was recognized for the Korean factory, because the Group considers it more likely than not that the court case will be won and the Group will be able to continue to produce in the Korean factory until the moment of the planned relocation. Deductibility of research and development costs In Italy, Berna Biotech Italia Srl. was subject to a tax audit for fiscal years 2001 and 2002. For the year 2001, a settlement was reached with the Italian tax authorities in 2007. For the year 2002, no settlement is reached. The tax authorities issued an assessment that deviates from the assessment in the tax return filed. The Group is challenging this assessment in court. The Group made a provision for the costs of additional taxes, penalties and interest, as well as lawyers fees, which the Group expects it will have to pay as a result. One of the items in dispute is the deductibility of the research and development costs the Group makes in Italy. In the event that the Group loses the court case on this subject, the Italian tax authorities may challenge the deductibility of research and development costs for the years 2003 up until 2007. Because the Group considers it more likely than not that the research and development cost will be tax deductible, no additional provision was recognized. Employee benefits Further reference is made to retirement benefit obligations. See note 5.10. Other Other provisions mainly relate to asset retirement obligations and warranties. Contingent liability STAR technology The Company acquired STAR technology in 2004 through the purchase of ChromaGenics B.V., a privately held biotechnology company based in Amsterdam. In connection with the purchase, we also entered in a contingent payment agreement that could result in additional payments of up to  7.0 million to former ChromaGenics shareholders upon receipt of revenues and royalties generated from the STAR technology. In connection with this agreement, we paid  2.0 million in 2007. The expense was recognized in the cost of goods sold. Guarantees Total guarantees issued by the Company amount to  2.5 million, which included a letter of credit issued by the Company for an amount of $ 1.6 million which will expire on April 14, 2013 for the benefit of the Percivia Development Center. The Company has a guarantee facility for an amount of  10.0 million with a third-party bank. As part of the overall working capital management efforts, the Group agreed with Novartis to extend payment terms on the supply of Quinvaxem antigens. These transactions were secured by a third-party bank guarantee in favour of Novartis. 5.19 Short and long-term financial liabilities This note provides information about the contractual terms of the Groups loans and borrowings as at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

In 2006, interest was accrued to the loan and no payments of principal or interest were required. Beginning January 1, 2007, the loan is being repaid through monthly payments over 15 years. A balloon repayment of  10,000 will be made at the end of the 15 years. The loan matures on December 31, 2021. The loan bears interest at 4.55 percent for the first five years. After this period the rates will be renegotiated. The land, building, part of the equipment and a compensating cash balance arrangement with a bank in the amount of  10,000 secure the loan. The carrying amount of the underlying secured assets is  26,946. Loan Berna Biotech Korea Corp. Berna Biotech Korea Corp. has entered into an unsecured Euro loan that bears interest at 2.48% and matures on August 1, 2010. Finance lease liabilities Finance leases mainly relate to equipment for the new production facility in Leiden. The vast majority of the finance lease liabilities are denominated in Euro. All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and interest rates are fixed at the contract date. For further information see note 5.22. Privately placed bond Berna Biotech Korea Corp. Berna Biotech Korea Corp (Berna Biotech Korea) issued a Korean Won denominated bond with an interest rate of 6.73%. The bond matures June 13, 2008, and contains covenants that require Berna Biotech Korea to maintain certain profit and liquidity ratios as of January 1, 2006. In 2006, these covenants were not met, meaning bondholders could have accelerated maturity; consequently the bond is presented as a short-term bond. At December 31, 2007 the Company does not have any indications that the bond has to be repaid before the end of its term. Factoring liabilities In December 2007 the Company factored trade accounts receivable for a total amount of  5.7 million with an external party in Italy. The Company did not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards associated with ownership of the transferred trade accounts receivable, specifically the credit risk, and consequently the cash payments received are accounted for as a financial liability. No interest is charged on the factoring liabilities. 5.20 Other liabilities and deferred income  current and non-current In thousands of Euro Current Non-Current 2007 Total Current Non-Current 2006 Total Deferred income 7,921 11,594 19,515 3,221  3,221 Accrued salary expenses and payroll taxes 10,318  10,318 8,200  8,200 Accrued expenses 14,684  14,684 14,567  14,567 Derivative financial instruments 16  16 11  11 Other liabilities 4,958 529 5,487 3,133  3,133 37,897 12,123 50,020 29,132  29,132 5.21 Trade accounts payables In thousands of Euro Year ended December 31, 2007 2006 Trade accounts payables to third parties 50,970 38,360 Trade accounts payables to joint ventures  152 50,970 38,512 Trade accounts payables are generally paid under the payment terms, which vary by company and region.

Board of Supervisory Directors Due to the fact that Crucell operates on a global scale with many of its directors used to the international arena, Crucell offers compensation to its supervisory directors in accordance with customary practice in the biotechnology sector. For 2005 and onwards, compensation of all Supervisory Board members consists of a fixed fee in cash and an annual share grant. The fixed fee in cash amounts to  25 per Supervisory Board member. The Chairman will receive a fixed fee of  40. The annual share grant awarded to each member of the Supervisory Board shall equal 2,500 ordinary shares. This amount will be revised on a tri-annual basis. The shares should be held for as long as an individual is a member of the Supervisory Board. Instead of the share grant, a Supervisory Board member may also choose to receive a cash amount equalling the value of 2,500 shares at the date of grant minus 25%. The shares (or cash equivalent minus 25%) were awarded in 2006 for the first time. In 2005 stock options were awarded to the Supervisory Board. A net allowance of  10 that is grossed up for taxation purposes is awarded annually to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board.

They are also responsible for taking measures to prevent the consequences of any improper performance of duties by another member of Crucells Supervisory Board or Crucells Management Board. The Companys Articles of Association provide that Crucells Management Board members and Crucells Supervisory Board members are discharged from liability for their actions as board members, if Crucells general meeting of shareholders adopts a resolution to that effect. This discharge extends only to actions or omissions disclosed in or apparent from the adopted annual accounts or otherwise communicated to the Companys general meeting of shareholders. Mandatory provisions of Dutch law may limit this discharge of liability, for example in the case of bankruptcy. Under Dutch law, the Companys Supervisory Board members and members of the Companys Management Board generally cannot be held personally liable for decisions made exercising their reasonable business judgment. The Companys articles of association provide that the Company shall generally indemnify any person who is or was a member of the Companys Supervisory Board or of the Companys Management Board or one of the Companys employees, officers or agents, and suffers any loss as a result of any action in connection with their service to the Company, provided they acted in good faith in carrying out their duties. This indemnification generally will not be available if the person seeking indemnification acted with gross negligence or wilful misconduct in the performance of his or her duties to the Company. A court in which an action is brought, may however determine that indemnification is appropriate nonetheless. 173 Financial Statements Company Financial Statements Company Financial Statements 6 Balance sheet (After appropriation of result) (Amounts in thousands of Euro, except per share data) Notes 2007 2006 Assets Non-current assets Investments in subsidiaries 9.1 303,494 318,393 Other long-term receivables 9.2 87,680 141,089 391,174 459,482 Current assets Short-term receivables 2,175 1,218 Cash and cash equivalents 54,997 38,094 57,172 39,312 Total assets 448,346 498,794 Liabilities and shareholders equity Shareholders equity Issued capital 15,685 15,553 Share premium 735,578 726,869 Translation reserve (legal reserve) (28,542 ) (7,920 ) Available-for-sale reserve 8,340 10,670 Accumulated deficit (293,819 ) (247,872 ) 9.3 437,242 497,300 Non-current liabilities Provision for financial fixed assets 9.4  1,341 Liabilities to related parties 142 132 142 1,473 Current liabilities Accrued compensation and related benefits 927 21 Liability to related parties 10,035  10,962 21 Total equity and liabilities 448,346 498,794 7 Income statement (After appropriation of result) In thousands of Euro For the year ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Result from subsidiaries (49,981 ) (89,965 ) (21,787 ) Other income 4,034 2,652 6,209 Net loss for the year (45,947 ) (87,313 ) (15,578 ) 174 Financial Statements Notes to the Company Financial Statements Notes to the Company Financial Statements 8 General The description of the Groups activities and the Group structure as included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements also apply to the Company financial statements (see note 1.1).

Koechlin 176 Other Information Other Information Result treatment Annual dividends may only be paid out of profits as shown in the adopted annual financial statements. We may not make distributions if the distribution would reduce our shareholders equity below certain reserves required by Dutch law or our articles of association. The profits must first be used to set up and maintain reserves required by Dutch law and must then be set off against certain financial losses. The preference shares will be paid their dividends, which will be a certain percentage of their nominal value, first. With Supervisory Board approval, our Management Board then decides whether and how much of the remaining profit they will reserve. Any profits remaining shall be paid as a dividend on the ordinary shares. If the retained earnings are negative or are to be used to form a statutory reserve no dividend will be paid out. The loss for the year 2007 has been separately presented in shareholders equity, as net result for the year. The loss for the year 2006 was charged to the accumulated deficit. Preference shares On October 25, 2000, the Company established a foundation called Stichting Preferente Aandelen Crucell, also referred to as the Preferred Foundation. The Preferred Foundations object is to safeguard the interests of Crucell, its business and parties connected therewith by blocking any influences that may threaten these interests, which interests may include the continuity, independence or identity of Crucell, its business and parties connected therewith. The Preferred Foundation can safeguard the interests through acquiring and managing the preference shares and by exercising the rights attaching to these shares, in particular, the voting rights. The Preferred Foundation has an option to acquire preference shares up to 100% of the number of our outstanding shares, necessary to match the total number of statutory votes on all of the ordinary shares outstanding at the time of an acquisition. The Preferred Foundation must pay at least 25% of the nominal value of the preference shares it acquires from us. If we acquire any preference shares, they may be cancelled. A board of governors of up to five persons directs the Preferred Foundation. Mr J.P. Oosterveld, in his capacity as chairman of our Supervisory Board, and Mr P. Bouw, Mr M.W. den Boogert, Mr S. van Wijnbergen and Mr G.P. Krans, have been appointed to the board of governors. A majority of these members may not be members or former members of our management or Supervisory Board, or an employee of any of our advisers, any of our banks or us. The board of governors appoints these independent members. Our Supervisory Board appoints the non-independent members after consultation with our Management Board. 177 This page has been intentionally left blank 178 Information for shareholders and investors Information for shareholders and investors Investor relations approach Crucell maintains an active and transparent approach to relations with shareholders and investors whom we inform regularly about the companys strategy and developments.

Taxation The following is a summary of the material Dutch and U.S. tax consequences of an investment in ordinary shares or ADSs. This summary does not discuss every aspect of taxation that may be relevant to a particular investor who is subject to special treatment under any applicable law, and is not intended to be applicable in all respects to all categories of investors. This summary also assumes that our business will be conducted in the manner outlined in this document. Changes in our organizational structure or the manner in which we conduct our business may invalidate this summary. The laws upon which this summary is based are subject to change, perhaps with retroactive effect. A change to these laws may invalidate the contents of this summary, which will not be updated to reflect changes in the laws. Prospective investors should consult their professional tax advisors regarding their particular personal tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of our ordinary shares or ADSs. Certain Dutch tax consequences for holders of ordinary shares or ADSs This summary describes the principal tax consequences that will generally apply in the case of an investment in the ordinary shares or ADSs under Dutch tax laws in force and in effect as of the date hereof, and is subject to changes in Dutch law, including changes that could have retroactive effect. Not every potential tax consequence of such investment under the laws of the Netherlands will be addressed. Dutch taxation of resident shareholders The summary of certain Dutch taxes set out in this section Dutch Taxation of Resident Shareholders is only intended for the following investors: · Individuals who are resident or deemed to be resident or who have opted to be resident in the Netherlands for purposes of Dutch taxation and who invest in the ordinary shares or ADSs, excluding individuals who invest in the ordinary shares or ADSs that form part of a substantial interest (as described below) or deemed substantial interest in us and excluding individuals who are our employees or who are deemed to be our employees or employees of any entity related to us (the Dutch Individuals); and · Corporate entities (including associations which are taxable as corporate entities) that are resident or deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for purposes of Dutch taxation and who invest in the ordinary shares or ADSs, excluding: 181 Information for Shareholders and Investors · Corporate entities that are not subject to Dutch corporate income tax; · Pension funds (pensioenfondsen) and other entities that are wholly or partly exempt from Dutch corporate income tax; · Corporate entities that hold ordinary shares or ADSs that qualify for application of the participation exemption (as laid down in the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act 1969); and · Investment institutions (beleggingsinstellingen) and tax exempt investment institutions (vrijgestelde beleggingsinstellingen) as defined in the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act 1969; (the Dutch Corporate Entities). Generally, a holder of ordinary shares or ADSs will not have a substantial interest if he, his spouse, certain other relatives (including foster children) or certain persons sharing his household, do not hold, alone or together, whether directly or indirectly, the ownership of, or certain other rights over, ordinary shares representing 5% or more of our total issued and outstanding capital (or the issued and outstanding capital of any class of shares), or rights to acquire ordinary shares, whether or not already issued, that represent at any time 5% or more of our total issued and outstanding capital (or the issued and outstanding capital of any class of shares) or the ownership of certain profit participating certificates that relate to 5% or more of our annual profit and/or to 5% or more of our liquidation proceeds. Individual and corporate income tax Dutch Individuals not engaged or deemed to be engaged in an enterprise and Dutch individuals for whom the benefits derived from the ordinary shares or ADSs are not treated as result from other activities. The taxable benefit from a Dutch Individuals savings and investments (sparen en beleggen) is set annually at 4% of the average of the so-called yield basis (rendementsgrondslag) at the beginning and at the end of a year, insofar as the average exceeds the exempt net asset amount (heffingvrij vermogen). Such taxable benefit is reduced by such portion of the personal allowance as has not been taken into account in respect of certain other types of income. This benefit is taxed at the rate of 30%. For Dutch Individuals who invest in the ordinary shares or ADSs, the ordinary shares or ADSs will form part of the yield basis. The ordinary shares or ADSs will be taken into account in the yield basis at their fair market value. The actual benefits from the ordinary shares or ADSs do not influence the taxable benefit, even if they exceed, or are lower than, 4% of the yield basis. Dutch Individuals engaged or deemed to be engaged in an enterprise, Dutch Individuals for whom the benefits derived from the ordinary shares or ADSs are treated as result from other activities, and Dutch Corporate Entities. Any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from the ordinary shares or ADSs (including any capital gains realized on the disposal thereof) that are attributable to an enterprise carried on in the Netherlands by a Dutch Individual or to an enterprise effectively managed in the Netherlands in which he has an interest, are generally subject to income tax charged at progressive rates in his hands. The same applies to a Dutch Individual for whom the benefits derived from the ordinary shares or ADSs are treated as result from other activities. Any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from the ordinary shares or ADSs (including any capital gains realized on the disposal thereof) that are held by a Dutch Corporate Entity are generally subject to corporate income tax in its hands. Withholding tax Dividends we distribute are generally subject to a withholding tax imposed by the Netherlands at a rate of 15%. The concept dividends we distribute used in this section includes, but is not limited to: · Distributions in cash or in kind, deemed and constructive distributions and repayments of paid-in capital not recognized for Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes; · Liquidation proceeds, proceeds of redemption of the ordinary shares or ADSs or, as a rule, consideration for the repurchase of the ordinary shares or ADSs by us in excess of the average paid-in capital recognized for Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes; · The par value of the ordinary shares or ADSs issued to a holder of the ordinary shares or ADSs or an increase of the par value of the ordinary shares or ADSs, as the case may be, to the extent that it does not appear that a contribution, recognized for Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes, has been made or will be made; and · Partial repayment of paid-in capital, recognized for Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes, if and to the extent that there are net profits (zuivere winst), unless: 182 Information for Shareholders and Investors · The general meeting of our shareholders has resolved in advance to make such repayment; and · The par value of the ordinary shares or ADSs concerned has been reduced by an equal amount by way of an amendment of the articles of association. Dutch Individuals and Dutch Corporate Entities generally can credit the dividend withholding tax against their income tax or corporate income tax liability and will be entitled to a refund of dividend withholding tax insofar as such tax, together with any other creditable domestic and/or foreign taxes, exceeds their aggregate income tax or corporate income tax liability. A condition to avoid dividend stripping is that the recipient of proceeds from the ordinary shares or ADSs qualifies as the beneficial owner thereof. A recipient of proceeds from the ordinary shares or ADSs is not considered to be the beneficial owner thereof if the amount of dividend, following a set of transactions, is ultimately wholly or partly received by another person, if this other person also retains, directly or indirectly, an interest in the ordinary shares or ADSs and the recipient is entitled to a (partial) refund or exemption to which the other person is not entitled to. Gift and inheritance taxes A gift tax liability will arise in the Netherlands with respect to an acquisition of the ordinary shares or ADSs by way of a gift made by a Dutch individual or a Dutch corporate entity. An inheritance tax liability will arise in the Netherlands with respect to an acquisition or deemed acquisition of the ordinary shares or ADSs on the death of a Dutch individual. For purposes of Dutch gift and inheritance taxes, an individual who holds Dutch nationality will be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands if he has been resident in the Netherlands at any time during the ten years preceding the date of the gift or his death. For purposes of the Dutch gift tax, an individual not holding Dutch nationality will be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands if he has been resident in the Netherlands at any time during the 12 months preceding the date of the gift. Dutch taxation of Non-Resident Shareholders This section Dutch taxation of Non-Resident Shareholders describes certain Dutch tax consequences for a holder of the ordinary shares or ADSs who is neither resident, nor deemed to be resident, and who has not opted to be treated as a resident in the Netherlands for purposes of Dutch taxation (a Non-Resident Shareholder). Withholding tax Dividends we distribute are generally subject to a withholding tax imposed by the Netherlands at a rate of 15%. Reference is made to the section Dutch Taxation of Resident Shareholders  Withholding Tax for a description of the concept dividends we distribute. If a double tax convention is in effect between the Netherlands and the country of residence of a Non-Resident Shareholder, such Non-Resident Shareholder may, depending on the terms of that double taxation convention, be eligible for a full or partial exemption from, or refund of, Dutch dividend withholding tax. See  Taxation of Dividends for a discussion of the partial exemption available under the convention with the U.S. A further condition to avoid dividend stripping is that the Non-Resident Shareholder qualifies as the beneficial owner of the dividend. A Non-Resident Shareholder is not considered to be the beneficial owner of the dividend, if the amount of this dividend, following a set of transactions, is ultimately wholly or partly received by another person and this other person also maintains, directly or indirectly, an interest in the ordinary shares or ADSs and the recipient is entitled to a (partial) refund or exemption to which the other person is not entitled to. Taxes on income and capital gains A Non-Resident Shareholder will not be subject to any Dutch taxes on income or capital gains in respect of dividends we distribute (other than the withholding tax described above) or in respect of any gain realized on the disposal of the ordinary shares or ADSs, provided that: · Such Non-Resident Shareholder does not have an enterprise or an interest in an enterprise that is, in whole or in part, carried on through a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in the Netherlands and to which enterprise or part of an enterprise, as the case may be, the ordinary shares or ADSs are attributable; · Such Non-Resident Shareholder does not have a substantial interest or a deemed substantial interest in us (if a double tax convention does not refrain the Netherlands from taxation of income or capital gains from the substantial interest); 183 Information for Shareholders and Investors Further, if such Non-Resident Shareholder is an individual: · The benefits derived from the ordinary shares or ADSs are not taxable in the hands of such holder as a benefit from other activities in the Netherlands; · Such Non-Resident Shareholder is not entitled to a share in the profits of an enterprise effectively managed in the Netherlands, other than by way of the holding of securities or through an employment contract, to which enterprise the ordinary shares or ADSs or payments in respect of the ordinary shares or ADSs are attributable; and · Such Non-Resident Shareholder does not carry out and has not carried out employment activities in the Netherlands with which the holding of or income derived from the ordinary shares or ADSs is connected. Reference is made to the section Dutch Taxation of Resident Shareholders for a description of the concept substantial interest. Gift and inheritance taxes No liability for gift or inheritance taxes will arise in the Netherlands with respect to an acquisition of the ordinary shares or ADSs by way of a gift made by, or on the death of, a Non-Resident Shareholder, unless: · Such Non-Resident Shareholder at the time of the gift has or at the time of his death had an enterprise or an interest in an enterprise that is or was, in whole or in part, carried on through a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in the Netherlands and to which enterprise or part of an enterprise, as the case may be, the ordinary shares or ADSs are or were attributable; or · In the case of a gift of the ordinary shares or ADSs by an individual who at the time of the gift was a Non-Resident Shareholder, such individual dies within 180 days after the date of the gift, while (at the time of his death) being resident or deemed to be resident in the Netherlands. For purposes of Dutch gift and inheritance tax, an individual who holds Dutch nationality will be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands if he has been resident in the Netherlands at any time during the ten years preceding the date of the gift or his death. For purposes of the Dutch gift tax, an individual not holding Dutch nationality will be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands if he has been resident in the Netherlands at any time during the 12 months preceding the date of the gift. Other taxes and duties No Dutch registration tax, transfer tax, stamp duty or any other similar documentary tax or duty will be payable in the Netherlands in respect of or in connection with the subscription, issue, placement, allotment or delivery of the ordinary shares or ADSs. Taxation of U.S. investors The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations regarding the purchase, ownership and disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs to an eligible U.S. holder. You are an eligible U.S. holder if you are a resident of the U.S. for purposes of the tax treaty between the Netherlands and the U.S. (the tax treaty) and are fully eligible for benefits under the tax treaty. You generally will be entitled to the benefits of the tax treaty if you are: · The beneficial owner of ordinary shares or ADSs (and of the dividends paid with respect to such ordinary shares or ADSs); · An individual resident of the U.S., a U.S. corporation, or a partnership, estate or trust to the extent your income is subject to taxation in the U.S. as the income of a resident, in your hands or in the hands of your partners or beneficiaries; · Not resident in the Netherlands for Dutch tax purposes; and · Not subject to an anti-treaty shopping rule. You generally will not be eligible for the benefits of the tax treaty, and therefore will not be an eligible U.S. holder, if you hold ordinary shares or ADSs in connection with the conduct of business through a permanent establishment, or the performance of services through a fixed base in the Netherlands, or you are not resident in the U.S. for U.S. tax purposes. The summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to your decision to purchase ordinary shares or ADSs. In particular, the summary does not address considerations that may be applicable to you if you will not hold ordinary shares or ADSs as capital assets, or if you are a taxpayer subject to special tax rules, such as a bank, tax-exempt entity, insurance company, 184 Information for shareholders and investors a regulated investment company, a pension fund, a real estate investment trust, a dealer in securities or currencies, a person that holds ordinary shares or ADSs as part of an integrated investment (including a straddle) comprised of ordinary shares or ADSs and one or more other positions, and a person who owns or is deemed to own 10% or more of any class of our stock. The summary is based on laws, treaties and regulatory interpretations in effect on the date of this document, all of which are subject to change. You should consult your own advisers regarding the tax consequences of an investment in the ordinary shares or ADSs in light of your particular circumstances, including the U.S. tax considerations discussed below and the effect of any state, local or other national laws. Based on our audited financial statements and relevant market data, we believe that we were not treated as a passive foreign investment company or PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the year 2007. In addition, based on our current expectations regarding the value and nature of our assets, the sources and nature of our income, and relevant market data, we do not anticipate becoming a PFIC in the year 2008 or thereafter. We believe, however, that we were or may have been a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the years before 2005. In order to avoid being subject to unfavourable U.S. federal income tax rules applicable to PFICs (the PFIC rules) with respect to our ordinary shares or ADSs in the future, U.S. holders that held our ordinary shares or ADSs at any time before 2005 may wish to make a deemed sale election with respect to their ordinary shares or ADSs. See Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules. For U.S. federal income tax purposes and for purposes of the tax treaty between the Netherlands and the U.S., beneficial owners of ADSs will be treated as the owners of the underlying ordinary shares represented by those ADSs. Taxation of dividends Subject to the discussion below under Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules, the gross amount of dividends distributed by us (including amounts withheld in respect of Dutch withholding tax) generally will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation as foreign source dividend income, and will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Subject to certain exceptions for positions that are hedged or held for less than 60 days, an individual U.S. holder generally will be subject to U.S. taxation at a maximum rate of 15% in respect of dividends received after 2002 and before 2011, unless we were in the year prior to the year in which the dividend was paid, and are, in the year in which the dividend is paid, a PFIC. As described above, we believe that we were not a PFIC for U.S. tax purposes with respect to the year 2007, and also do not anticipate becoming a PFIC with respect to the year 2008. Dividends paid in Euro will be included in income in a U.S. dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt by you (or by the depositary in the case of ADSs). If such dividends are converted into U.S. dollar on the date of receipt, you generally should not be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the dividend income. If you receive a refund of Dutch withholding tax under the tax treaty between the Netherlands and the U.S., you may be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss to the extent the amount of the tax treaty refund (in dollars) received by you differs from the U.S. dollar equivalent of the refund amount on the date the dividends were received. You may claim the benefit of the reduced withholding rate of 15 percent that is available under the tax treaty between the Netherlands and the U.S. by submitting a duly completed Form IB 92 (USA) that has been certified by a financial institution (typically the entity that holds the ordinary shares or ADSs as custodian for the holder). If we receive the required documentation prior to the relevant dividend payment date, we may apply the reduced withholding rate at source. If you fail to satisfy these requirements prior to the payment of a dividend, you may claim a refund of the excess of the amount withheld over the tax treaty rate by filing Form IB 92 (USA) together with a supplemental statement with the Dutch tax authorities. Pension funds and tax-exempt organizations qualifying for a complete exemption from tax are not entitled to claim tax treaty benefits at source, and instead must file claims for refund by filing Form IB 95 (USA). Subject to applicable limitations and to the special considerations discussed below, Dutch withholding tax at the 15% tax treaty rate will be treated as a foreign income tax that is eligible for credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability or, at your election, may be deducted in computing taxable income. Foreign tax credits will not be allowed for withholding taxes imposed in respect of certain short-term or hedged positions and may not be allowed in respect of arrangements in which your 185 Information for Shareholders and Investors expected economic profit, after non-U.S. taxes, is insubstantial. You should consult your own advisers concerning the implications of these rules in light of your particular circumstances. Taxation of capital gains Subject to the discussion below under Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules, gain or loss realized by you on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs will be capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between your basis in the ordinary shares or ADSs and the amount realized on the disposition (or its dollar equivalent, determined at the spot rate on the date of disposition, if the amount realized is denominated in a foreign currency). The gain or loss will be long-term gain or loss if the ordinary shares or ADSs were held for more than one year. The net amount of long-term capital gain recognized by an individual U.S. holder generally is subject to taxation at a maximum rate of 20%; however, net long-term capital gain recognized by an individual U.S. holder after May 5, 2003 and before January 1, 2011 generally is subject to taxation at a maximum rate of 15%. Passive foreign investment company rules Unfavourable U.S. tax rules (the PFIC rules) apply to companies that are considered passive foreign investment companies (PFICs). We will be classified as a PFIC in a particular taxable year if either: · 75% or more of our gross income is treated as passive income for purposes of the PFIC rules; or · The average percentage of the value of our assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income is at least 50%. Based on our audited financial statements and relevant market data, we believe that we were not treated as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the year 2007. In addition, based on our current expectations regarding the value and nature of our assets, the sources and nature of our income, and relevant market data, we do not anticipate becoming a PFIC in the year 2008 or thereafter. We believe, however, that we were or may have been a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the years before 2005. If we are classified as a PFIC in any year, then a U.S. holder who holds shares during that year and does not make a mark-to-market election or a qualified electing fund (QEF) election will be subject to a special tax at ordinary income tax rates on certain dividends that we pay and on gains realized on the sale of ordinary shares or ADSs (excess distributions) in all subsequent years, without regard to whether we were a PFIC in the year the excess distribution was received. The amount of this tax will be increased by an interest charge to compensate for tax deferral, calculated as if the excess distributions had been earned ratably over the period the U.S. holder held its ordinary shares or ADSs. Classification as a PFIC may also have other adverse tax consequences, including the denial of a step-up in the basis of ordinary shares and ADSs at death. If we were a PFIC in the past, U.S. holders that held our ordinary shares or ADSs at any time during the years when we were a PFIC and did not make a mark-to-market election or a QEF election will generally continue to be subject to the PFIC rules described above, even though we later ceased to qualify as a PFIC. You can generally avoid the future application of the PFIC rules by making a deemed sale election with respect to your ordinary shares or ADSs for your taxable year that includes the last day of our last taxable year during which we qualified as a PFIC (the termination date). If you make the deemed sale election with respect to our ordinary shares or ADSs, you generally will be treated as having sold all your ordinary shares or ADSs for their fair market value on the termination date. The deemed sale generally will be taxed to you as an excess distribution. Any loss realized on the deemed sale will not be recognized. If you made a mark-to-market election or a QEF election with respect to your ordinary shares or ADSs in the past, you will not be required to include any mark-to-market gain or loss with respect to our ordinary shares or ADSs (in the case of the mark-to-market election) or to include your pro rata share of our ordinary earnings and net capital gain (in the case of the QEF election) for the years during which we do not qualify as a PFIC. The PFIC rules are extremely complex, and you should consult your own tax advisers regarding the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed above and the desirability of making a deemed sale election. 186 Information for shareholders and investors U.S. backup withholding tax and information reporting Payments in respect of the ordinary shares or ADSs that are made in the U.S. or by a U.S. related financial intermediary will be subject to information reporting and may be subject to backup withholding unless you: · Are a corporation or other exempt recipient; or · Provide an IRS Form W-9 or an acceptable substitute form, certifying your taxpayer identification number and that no loss of exemption from backup withholding has occurred. If you are not a U.S. person, you generally are not subject to these rules, but may be required to provide certification of non-U.S. status in order to establish that you are exempt.

Limitation of liability and indemnification matters Pursuant to Dutch law, each member of our Supervisory and Management Boards is responsible to us for the proper performance of his or her assigned duties. They are also responsible for taking measures to prevent the consequences of any improper performance of duties by another member of our Supervisory Board or our Management Board. Our articles of association provide that our managing board members and our Supervisory Board members are discharged from liability for their actions as board members, if our general meeting of shareholders adopts a resolution to that effect. This discharge extends only to actions or omissions disclosed in or apparent from the adopted annual accounts or otherwise communicated to our general meeting of shareholders. This discharge of liability may be limited by mandatory provisions of Dutch law, such as in the case of bankruptcy. Under Dutch law, our Supervisory Board members and members of our Management Board generally cannot be held personally liable for decisions made exercising their reasonable business judgment. Our articles of association provide that we shall generally indemnify any person who is or was a member of our Supervisory Board or our Management Board or one of our employees, officers or agents, and suffers any loss as a result of any action in connection with their service to us, provided they acted in good faith in carrying out their duties. This indemnification generally will not be available if the person seeking indemnification acted with gross negligence or wilful misconduct in the performance of their duties to us. A court in which an action is brought may, however, determine that indemnification is appropriate nonetheless. 188 Cross-reference to Form 20-F Cross-reference to Form 20-F Part I 1 Identity of directors, senior management and advisers n/a 2 Offer statistics and expected timetable n/a 3 Key information 3A Selected financial data 8-9 Five-year financial summary Exchange rate information 181 3B Capitalization and indebtedness n/a 3C Reasons for the offer and use of proceeds n/a 3D Risk factors 72-84
