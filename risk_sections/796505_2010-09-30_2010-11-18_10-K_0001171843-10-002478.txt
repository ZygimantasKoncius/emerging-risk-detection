ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The impact and the timing of the impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on our business are uncertain. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), widely known as the “Stimulus Bill,” was enacted in February 2009. The ARRA allocates $7.2 billion in grants, loans and loan guarantees for broadband/wireless initiatives for rural unserved and underserved geographies across the country, with these initiatives administered by several federal agencies. This funding is available to a wide variety of organizations, including our customers and prospective customers, to purchase and implement network infrastructure and services to improve broadband coverage. As part of the criteria established by the federal agencies administering these programs, the projects to be funded through the new federal stimulus plan must be approved by the state or states in which the projects will be located. Currently, a limited portion of the funding allocated by the ARRA for these broadband/wireless initiatives has been distributed to awarded applicants. Our customers and prospective customers may postpone projects involving telecommunications equipment such as ours until the availability and amount of 4 stimulus funds for a particular project is known or awarded. Accordingly, they may experience significant delays in the funding of projects through the ARRA, which, in turn, will delay their purchase of equipment for their projects. We cannot be assured to what extent the ARRA will impact demand for our products, our results of operations or the timing of purchases by customers. A large percentage of our sales have been made to a small number of customers, and the loss of a major customer would adversely affect us. In fiscal years 2010 and 2009, one distributor customer accounted for 20% and 32% of our revenue, respectively. In addition, another end-user customer accounted for 8% and 8% of our revenue in fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively. If there is a loss of one or more of these major customers or a significant decline in sales to either of these major customers, it would have a material adverse effect on our results from operations. Intense competition in our industry may result in price reductions, lower gross profits and loss of market share. Competition in the telecommunications equipment and services industry is intense. Our competitors may have or could develop or acquire marketing, financial, development and personnel resources that exceed ours. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on whether we can continue to advance the technology of our products and develop new products, the acceptance of our products among our customers and prospective customers and our ability to anticipate customer needs in product development, as well as the price, quality and reliability of our products, our delivery and service capabilities, and our control of operating expenses. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors. Increased competition from manufacturers of telecommunications equipment such as ours may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins, and increased discounts to customers and loss of market share and could require increased spending by us on research and development, sales and marketing and customer support. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on our customers’ businesses. Adverse changes in economic conditions, including the recent recession in the United States, have resulted and may continue to result in lower spending among our customers and contribute to decreased sales to our distributors and customers. Further, our business may be adversely affected by factors such as downturns in economic activity in specific geographic areas or in the telecommunications industry; social, political or labor conditions; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, tax rates, or regulations. These factors are beyond our control, but may result in further decreases in spending among customers and softening demand for our products. Declines in demand for our products will adversely affect our revenue. Further, challenging economic conditions also may impair the abi lity of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, our cash flow may be negatively impacted and our allowance for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. Our operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, which may make budgeting for expenses difficult and may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Because many purchases by customers of our products relate to a specific customer project, the short-term demand for our products can fluctuate significantly and our ability to forecast sales accurately from quarter to quarter is limited. This fluctuation can be further affected by the long sales cycles necessary to obtain contracts to supply equipment for these projects, the availability of capital to fund our customers’ 5 projects, and the impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on customer buying patterns. These long sales cycles may result in significant effort expended with no resulting sales or sales that are not made in the anticipated quarter. Demand for our projects will also depend upon the extent to which our customers and prospective customers initiate these projects and the extent to which we are selected to provide our equipment in these projects, neither of which can be assured. These factors generally result in fluctuations, sometimes significant, in our operating results. Other factors that may affect our quarterly operating results including: · the volume and timing of orders from and shipments to our customers; · work stoppages and other developments affecting the operations of our customers; · the timing of and our ability to obtain new customer contracts and the timing of revenue recognition; · the timing of new product and service announcements; · the availability of products and services; · market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products and services; · variations in the mix of products and services we sell; · the utilization of our production capacity and employees; and · the availability and cost of key components of our products. Further, we budget our expenses based in part on expectations of future revenues. If revenue levels in a particular quarter are lower than expected, our operating results will be affected adversely. Because of these factors, our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and are likely to vary in the future. If our operating results are below financial analysts’ or investors’ expectations, the market price of our common stock may fall abruptly and significantly. To compete effectively, we must continually improve existing products and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance. The telecommunications equipment industry is characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, changing market conditions and frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements. The introduction of products using new technologies or the adoption of new industry standards can make our existing products, or products under development, obsolete or unmarketable. In order to remain competitive and increase sales, we will need to anticipate and adapt to these rapidly changing technologies, enhance our existing products and introduce new products to address the changing demands of our customers. Many of our competitors have greater engineering and product development resources than we have. Although we expect to continue to invest substantial resources in product development activities, our efforts to achieve and maintain profitability will require us to be selective and focused with our research and development expenditures. Further, our existing and development-stage products may become obsolete if our competitors introduce newer or more appealing technologies. If these technologies are patented or proprietary to our competitors, we may not be able to access these technologies. 6 If we fail to anticipate or respond in a cost-effective and timely manner to technological developments, changes in industry standards or customer requirements, or if we experience any significant delays in product development or introduction, our business, operating results and financial condition could be affected adversely. We may face circumstances in the future that will result in impairment charges, including, but not limited to, significant goodwill impairment charges. If the fair value of any of our long-lived assets decreases as a result of an economic slowdown, a downturn in the markets where we sell products and services or a downturn in our financial performance and/or future outlook, we may be required to record an impairment charge on such assets, including goodwill. We are required to test intangible assets with indefinite life periods for potential impairment annually and on an interim basis if there are indicators of a potential impairment. We also are required to evaluate amortizable intangible assets and fixed assets for impairment if there are indicators of a possible impairment. One potential indicator of impairment is the value of our market capitalization compared to our net book value. Significant declines in our market capitalization could require us to record material goodwill and other impairment charges. Impairment charges could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial position, as well as on the market price of our common stock. We rely on single-source suppliers, which could cause delays, increases in costs or prevent us from completing customer orders, all of which could materially harm our business. We assemble our products using materials and components supplied by various subcontractors and suppliers. We purchase critical components for our products, including injected molded parts and connectors from third parties, some of whom are single- or limited-source suppliers. If any of our suppliers are unable to ship critical components, we may be unable to manufacture and ship products to our distributors or customers. If the price of these components increases for any reason, or if these suppliers are unable or unwilling to deliver, we may have to find another source, which could result in interruptions, increased costs, delays, loss of sales and quality control problems. Further, the costs to obtain certain raw materials and supplies are subject to price fluctuations, which may be substantial, because of global market demands. Many companies utilize the same raw materials and supplies in the production of their products as we use in our products. Companies with more resources than us may have a competitive advantage in obtaining raw materials and supplies due to greater purchasing power. Some raw materials or supplies may be subject to regulatory actions, which may affect available supplies. Furthermore, due to general economic conditions in the United States and globally, our suppliers may experience financial difficulties, which could result in increased delays, additional costs, or loss of a supplier. The termination or interruption of any of these relationships, or the failure of these manufacturers or suppliers to supply components or raw materials to us on a timely basis or in sufficient quantities, likely would cause us to be unable to meet orders for our products and harm our reputation and our business. Identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers would take time, involve significant additional costs and may delay the production of our products. Further, if we obtain a new supplier or assemble our product using an alternative source of supply, we may need to conduct additional testing of our products to ensure the product meets our quality and performance standards. Any delays in delivery of our product to distributors or customers could be extended, and our costs associated with the change in product manufacturing could i ncrease. The failure of our third-party manufacturers to manufacture the products for us, and the failure of our suppliers of components and raw materials to supply us consistent with our requirements as to quality, 7 quantity and timeliness could materially harm our business by causing delays, loss of sales, increases in costs and lower gross profit margins. We lack experience manufacturing our products at high volumes and we may be required to rapidly increase our manufacturing capacity to deliver our products to our customers in a timely manner. We manufacture and assemble our products at our facility in Plymouth, Minnesota. Our success will depend upon our ability to cost-effectively manufacture a reliable product and deliver that product in a timely manner. Because we lack experience manufacturing our products in large quantities, we may encounter difficulties in maintaining production efficiencies, quality control and assurance, component supply and qualified personnel. Our success depends upon adequate protection of our patent and intellectual property rights. Our future success depends in part upon our proprietary technology. We attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. However, these legal means afford us only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or remedies to gain or keep any advantages we may have over our competitors. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether these protections will be adequate, or whether our competitors will develop similar technology independently, without violating our proprietary rights. Our competitors, who may have or could develop or acquire significant resources, may make substantial investments in competing technologies, or may apply for and obtain patents that will prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to manufacture or market our products. Further, although we do not believe that any of our products infringe the rights of others, third parties may in the future claim, our products infringe on their rights, and these third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future. We may litigate to enforce patents issued to us and to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the ownership, scope, or validity of our proprietary rights and the rights of others. Any claim of infringement against us could involve significant liabilities to third parties, could require us to seek licenses from third parties, and could prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using our products. The occurrence of this litigation, or the effect of an adverse determination in any of this type of litigation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further consolidation among our customers may result in the loss of some customers and may reduce revenue during the pendency of business combinations and related integration activities. We believe consolidation among our customers in the future will continue in order for them to increase market share and achieve greater economies of scale. Consolidation has impacted our business as our customers focus on completing business combinations and integrating their operations. In connection with this merger and acquisition activity, our customers may postpone or cancel orders for our product based on revised plans for technology or network expansion pending consolidation activity. Customers integrating large-scale acquisitions may also reduce their purchases of equipment during the integration period, or postpone or cancel orders. The impact of significant mergers among our customers on our business is likely to be unclear until sometime after such transactions are completed. After a consolidation occurs, a customer may choose to reduce the number of vendors from which it purchases equipment and may choose one of our competitors 8 as its preferred vendor. There can be no assurance that we will continue to supply equipment to the surviving communications service provider after a business combination is completed. We are dependent on key personnel. Our failure to attract and retain skilled personnel could hinder the management of our business, our research and development, our sales and marketing efforts, and our manufacturing capabilities. Our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued services of key senior management personnel, including Cheryl P. Beranek, our Chief Executive Officer and John P. Hill, our Chief Operating Officer. We have employment agreements with Ms. Beranek and Mr. Hill that provides that if we terminate the employment of either executive without cause or if the executive terminates her or his employment for good reason, we would be required to make specified payments to them as described in their employment agreement. We have key person life insurance on Ms. Beranek or Mr. Hill. Further, our future success also depends on our continui ng ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified managerial, technical and sales personnel. Our inability to retain or attract qualified personnel could have a significant negative effect and thereby materially harm our business and financial condition. Product defects or the failure of our products to meet specifications could cause us to lose customers and revenue or to incur unexpected expenses. If our products do not meet our customers’ performance requirements, our customer relationships may suffer. Also, our products may contain defects or fail to meet product specifications. Any failure or poor performance of our products could result in: · lack of or delayed market acceptance of our products; · delayed product shipments; · unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to replace defective products or identify and correct the source of errors; · damage to our reputation and our customer relationships; · delayed recognition of sales or reduced sales; and · product liability claims or other claims for damages that may be caused by any product defects or performance failures. Our products are often critical to the performance of telecommunications systems. Many of our supply agreements contain limited warranty provisions. If these contractual limitations are unenforceable in a particular jurisdiction or if we are exposed to product liability claims that are not covered by insurance, a claim could harm our business. Our stock price has been volatile historically and may continue to be volatile. The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as quarterly variations in operating results, announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors, changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us, and new reports relating to trends in our markets or general economic conditions. 9 In addition, the stock market is subject to price and volume fluctuations that affect the market prices for companies in general, and small-capitalization, high-technology companies like us in particular. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Further, any failure by us to meet or exceed the expectations of financial analysts or investors is likely to cause a decline in our common stock price. Further, recent economic conditions have resulted in significant fluctuations and significant declines in stock prices for many companies, including Clearfield. We cannot predict when the stock markets and the market for our common stock may stabilize. Future sales of shares of our common stock in the public market may negatively affect our stock price. Future sales of our common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, could have a significant negative effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon exercise of outstanding options, the number of shares outstanding of our common stock could increase substantially. This increase, in turn, could dilute future earnings per share, if any, and could depress the market value of our common stock. Dilution and potential dilution, the availability of a large amount of shares for sale, and the possibility of additional issuances and sales of our common stock may negatively affect both the trading price of our common stock and the liquidity of our common stock. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we would deem appropriate. Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents, our shareholder rights agreement, Minnesota law and other agreements could prevent or delay a change in control of our company. Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, our shareholder rights agreement (also known as a “poison pill”), Minnesota law and other agreements may make it more difficult for a third- party to acquire, or discourage a third-party from attempting to acquire, control of our company, including: · the provisions of our bylaws regarding the business properly brought before shareholders; · the right of our board of directors to establish more than one class or series of shares and to fix the relative rights and preferences of any such different classes or series; · our shareholder rights agreement, which would cause substantial dilution to any person or group attempting to acquire our company on terms not approved in advance by our Board of Directors; · the provisions of Minnesota law relating to business combinations and control share acquisitions; and · the provisions of our stock option plans allowing for the acceleration of vesting or payments of awards granted under the plans in the event of specified events that result in a “change in control” and provisions of agreements with certain of our executive officers requiring payments if their employment is terminated and there is a “change in control.” These measures could discourage or prevent a takeover of us or changes in our management, even if an acquisition or such changes would be beneficial to our shareholders. This may have a negative effect on the price of our common stock. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 10
