Item 1A. Risk Factors We face a variety of significant and diverse risks, many of which are inherent in our business. Described below are certain risks that we currently believe could materially affect us. Other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently consider to be material or of which we are not presently aware may become important factors that affect us in the future. The occurrence of any of the risks discussed below could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. Risks Related To Our Business We depend on Messrs. Briger, Edens, Kauffman, Nardone and Novogratz, and the loss of any of their services would have a material adverse effect on us. The success of our business depends on the efforts, judgment and personal reputations of our principals, Peter Briger, Wesley Edens, Robert Kauffman, Randal Nardone and Michael Novogratz. Our principals’ reputations, expertise in investing, relationships with our investors and relationships with members of the business community on whom our funds depend for investment opportunities and financing, are each critical elements in operating and expanding our businesses. We believe our performance is strongly correlated to the performance of these individuals. Accordingly, the retention of our principals is crucial to our success. In addition, if any of our principals were to join or form a competitor, some of our investors could choose to invest with that competitor rather than in our funds. The loss of the services of any of our principals would have a material adverse effect on us, including our ability to retain and attract investors and raise new funds, and the performance of our funds. Two or more of our principals occasionally fly together, which concentrates the potential impact of an accident on our company. We do not carry any ‘‘key man’’ insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of the death or disability of any of our principals. 6 Table of Contents Each of our principals has entered into an employment agreement with us. The initial term of these agreements is five years from the date of our initial public offering in February 2007, with automatic one-year renewals until a non-renewal notice is given by us or the principal. If a principal terminates his employment voluntarily or we terminate his employment for cause (as defined in the agreement), the principal will be subject to eighteen-month post-employment covenants requiring him not to compete with us. However, if we terminate a principal’s employment without cause, the principal will not be subject to the non-competition provisions. The principals have also entered into an agreement among themselves, which provides that, in the event a principal voluntarily terminates his employment with us for any reason prior to the fifth anniversary of the consummation of our initial public offering, the principal may be required to forfeit a portion of his Fortress Operating Group units (and the corresponding Class B shares) to the other principals who continue to be employed by the Fortress Operating Group. However, this agreement may be amended by the principals who are then employed by the Fortress Operating Group. We, our shareholders and the Fortress Operating Group have no ability to enforce any provision of this agreement or to prevent the principals from amending the agreement or waiving any of its obligations. There is no guarantee that our principals will not resign, join our competitors or form a competing company, or that the non-competition provisions in the employment agreements would be upheld by a court. If any of these events were to occur, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operation would be materially adversely affected. Several of our funds have ‘‘key man’’ provisions pursuant to which the failure of one or more of our principals to be actively involved in the business provides investors with the right to redeem from the funds or otherwise limits our rights to manage the funds. The loss of the services of any one of Messrs. Briger, Edens or Novogratz, or both of Mr. Kauffman and Mr. Nardone, would have a material adverse effect on certain of our funds and on us. Investors in most of our hedge funds may generally redeem their investment without paying redemption fees if the relevant principal ceases to perform his functions with respect to the fund for 90 consecutive days. In addition, the terms of certain of our hedge funds’ financing arrangements contain ‘‘key man’’ provisions, which may result, under certain circumstances, in the acceleration of such funds’ debt or the inability to continue funding certain investments if the relevant principal ceases to perform his functions with respect to the fund and a replacement has not been approved. The loss or inability of Mr. Novogratz to perform his services for 90 days could result in substantial withdrawal requests from investors in our Drawbridge Global Macro funds (which as of December 31, 2007, had MAUM of approximately $8.1 billion) and, in the event that a replacement is not approved, the termination of a substantial portion of the funds’ financing arrangements. Such withdrawals and terminations would have a material adverse effect on the Drawbridge Global Macro funds by reducing our management fees from those funds and, since the funds would have fewer assets, such withdrawals would reduce the amount of incentive income potential of those funds. Further, such withdrawals and terminations could lead possibly to the liquidation of the funds and a corresponding elimination of our management fees and potential to earn incentive income from those funds. The loss of Mr. Novogratz could, therefore, ultimately result in a loss o f substantially all of our earnings attributable to our liquid hedge fund business segment. The loss or inability of Mr. Briger to perform his services for 90 days could result in substantial withdrawal requests from investors in our Drawbridge Special Opportunities funds (which as of December 31, 2007, had MAUM of approximately $6.8 billion) and, in the event that a replacement for him is not approved, the termination of a substantial portion of the funds’ financing arrangements. Such withdrawals and terminations would have a material adverse effect on the Drawbridge Special Opportunities funds by reducing our management fees from those funds and, since the funds would have fewer assets, such withdrawals would reduce the amount of incentive income potential of those funds. Further, such withdrawals and terminations could lead possibly to the eventual liquidation of the funds and a corresponding elimination of our management fees and potential to earn incentive income from those funds. The loss or inability of Mr. Briger to pe rform his services or devote an 7 Table of Contents appropriate portion of his business time to the long dated value funds for 90 days would (unless approved by a majority of fund investors) prevent the Drawbridge long dated value funds from making additional investments. This could have a material adverse effect on the long dated value funds, resulting in us receiving reduced management fees and incentive income. The loss of Mr. Briger could, therefore, ultimately result in a loss of substantially all of our earnings attributable to our hybrid hedge fund business segment with respect to the Drawbridge Special Opportunities funds, and a relatively small loss of earnings attributable to our private equity fund business segment with respect to the long dated value funds. If either Mr. Edens or both of Mr. Kauffman and Mr. Nardone cease to devote certain minimum portions of their business time to the affairs of certain of our private equity funds, the funds will not be permitted to make further investments, and then-existing investments may be liquidated if investors vote to do so. Our ability to earn management fees and realize incentive income from our private equity funds therefore would be adversely affected if we cannot make further investments or if we are required to liquidate fund investments at a time when market conditions result in our obtaining less for investments than could be obtained at later times. In addition, we may be unable to raise additional private equity funds if existing private equity fund key-man provisions are triggered. The loss of either Mr. Edens or both of Mr. Kauffman and Mr. Nardone could, therefore, ultimately result in a loss of substantially all of our earnings a ttributable to our private equity funds, which as of December 31, 2007, had MAUM of approximately $16.6 billion. Any such events would have a direct material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings, and would likely harm our ability to maintain or grow fee paying assets under management in existing funds or raise additional funds in the future. Our ability to retain our managing directors is critical to our success and our ability to grow depends on our ability to attract additional key personnel. Our success depends on our ability to retain our managing directors and the other members of our investment management team and recruit additional qualified personnel. We collectively refer to these key employees (other than our principals) as our investment professionals. We anticipate that it will be necessary for us to add investment professionals as we pursue our growth strategy. However, we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or retaining current personnel, as the market for qualified investment professionals is extremely competitive. Our investment professionals possess substantial experience and expertise in investing, are responsible for locating and executing our funds’ investments, have significant relationships with the institutions which are the source of many of our funds’ investment opportunities, and in certain cases have strong relationships with our investors. Therefore, if our investment professionals join competitors or form competing companies it could result in the loss of significant investment opportunities and certain existing investors. As a result, the loss of even a small number of our investment professionals could jeopardize the performance of our funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations as well as our ability to retain and attract investors and raise new funds. Also, while we have non-competition and non-solicitation agreements with certain investment professionals, there is no guarantee that the agreements to which our investment professionals are subject, together with our other arrangements with them, will prevent them from leaving us, joining our competitors or otherwise competing with us or that these agreements will be enforceable in all cases. In addition, these agreements will expire after a certain period of time, at which point each of our investment professionals would be free to compete against us and solicit investors in our funds, clients and employees. Efforts to retain or attract investment professionals may result in significant additional expenses, which could adversely affect our profitability, and changes in law could hamper our recruitment and retention efforts. For example, we might not be able to provide future investment professionals with equity interests in our business to the same extent or with the same tax consequences as our existing investment professionals. Therefore, in order to recruit and retain existing and future investment professionals, we may need to increase the level of compensation that we pay to them. Accordingly, as we promote or hire new investment professionals over time, we may increase the level of compensation we pay to our investment professionals, which would cause our total employee 8 Table of Contents compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of our total revenue to increase and adversely affect our profitability. Also, if legislation were to be enacted by the U.S. Congress to treat carried interest as ordinary income rather than as capital gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such legislation would materially increase the amount of taxes that we and possibly our equityholders would be required to pay, thereby adversely affecting our ability to recruit, retain and motivate our current and future professionals. See ‘‘— Our structure involves complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. Our structure also is subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.’’ Lastly, issuance of certain equity interests in our business to future investment professionals would dilute Class A shareholders. We have experienced rapid growth, which may be difficult to sustain and which may place significant demands on our administrative, operational and financial resources. Our fee paying assets under management have grown from approximately $20.9 billion as of December 31, 2006 to $33.2 billion as of December 31, 2007. Our rapid growth has caused, and if it continues will continue to cause, significant demands on our legal, accounting and operational infrastructure, and increased expenses. The complexity of these demands, and the expense required to address them, is a function not simply of the amount by which our fee paying assets under management have grown, but of significant differences in the investing strategies of our different funds. In addition, we are required to continuously develop our systems and infrastructure in response to the increasing sophistication of the investment management market and legal, accounting and regulatory developments. Moreover, the strains upon our resources caused by our growth are compounded by the additional demands imposed upon us now that we are a public company wit h shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange and, thus, subject to an extensive body of regulations that did not apply to us prior to our initial public offering. Our future growth will depend, among other things, on our ability to maintain an operating platform and management system sufficient to address our growth and will require us to incur significant additional expenses and to commit additional senior management and operational resources. As a result, we face significant challenges: • in maintaining adequate accounting, financial, compliance, trading and other business controls, • implementing new or updated information, financial and disclosure systems and procedures, and • in recruiting, training, managing and appropriately sizing our work force and other components of our business on a timely and cost-effective basis. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our expanding operations effectively or that we will be able to continue to grow, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and control our expenses. Operational risks may disrupt our businesses, result in losses or limit our growth. We face operational risk from errors made in the execution, confirmation or settlement of transactions. We also face operational risk from transactions not being properly recorded, evaluated or accounted for in our funds. In particular, our liquid and hybrid hedge fund businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and evaluate, on a daily basis, transactions across markets and geographies in a time-sensitive, efficient and accurate manner. Consequently, we rely heavily on our financial, accounting and other data processing systems. In addition, new investment products we introduce create (and recently introduced products created) a significant risk that our existing systems may not be adequate to identify or control the relevant risks in the investment strategies employed by such new investment products. If any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to our fu nds, regulatory intervention and reputational damage. 9 Table of Contents In addition, we operate in an industry that is highly dependent on its information systems and technology. We believe that we have designed, purchased and installed high-quality information systems to support our business. There can be no assurance, however, that our information systems and technology will continue to be able to accommodate our growth, or that the cost of maintaining such systems will not increase from its current level. Such a failure to accommodate growth, or an increase in costs related to such information systems, could have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, we depend on our headquarters, which is located in New York City, for the operation of our business. A disaster or a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses, including a disruption involving electronic communications or other services used by us or third parties with whom we conduct business, or directly affecting our headquarters, may have an adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Although we have disaster recovery programs in place, there can be no assurance that these will be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption. In addition, insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses. Finally, we rely on third party service providers for certain aspects of our business, including certain financial operations of our hedge funds. Any interruption or deterioration in the performance of these third parties could impair the quality of the funds’ operations and could impact our reputation and adversely affect our business and limit our ability to grow. The historical and unaudited pro forma financial information included in this report is not necessarily indicative of our future performance. The historical combined financial information through March 31, 2007, included in this report is not necessarily indicative of our future financial results. Such historical combined financial information consolidated a large number of our significant funds, which were not consolidated after that date as a result of the consummation of the deconsolidation of such funds on March 31, 2007. In addition, such historical combined financial information included in this report does not reflect the added costs that we now incur as a public company or the impact of changes in our structure that we implemented immediately after the consummation of our initial public offering in February 2007, for periods prior to that date. Moreover, because we operated through limited liability companies prior to our initial public offering, we paid little or no taxes on profits. However, we are now subject to certain taxation on our profits as a result of the cha nges we made to our structure in connection with our initial public offering. The results of future periods are likely to be materially different as a result of: • the impact of transactions occurring in connection with our initial public offering in relation to the size of the company during earlier periods; • fund performance in the future which differs from the historical performance reflected in our financial information for earlier periods; and • the pace of growth of our business in the future, including the formation of new funds, which differs from the historical growth reflected in our financial information for earlier periods. Accordingly, our historical combined financial information is not intended to be, and should not be regarded as, indicative of our future performance. In addition, we have provided in this report pro forma financial information regarding the impact of the deconsolidation of a number of Fortress Funds, which took place on March 31, 2007, on our historical combined financial information as of December 31, 2006 and for the year ended December 31, 2007. The pro forma adjustments, which are based on available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable, have been applied to this historical combined financial information. The pro forma financial information is provided for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent or be indicative of the results that actually would have been obtained had the deconsolidation occurred on December 31, 2006 or January 1, 2007, or that may be obtained for any future period. See Note 13 to Part II, Item 8, ‘‘Financial Statements — Pro Forma Financial Information (Unaudited).’&rs quo; 10 Table of Contents We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from funds managed pursuant to management agreements that may be terminated or fund partnership agreements that permit investors to request liquidation of investments in our funds on short notice. The terms of our funds generally give either the general partner of the fund or the fund’s board of directors the right to terminate our investment management agreement with the fund. However, insofar as we control the general partner of our funds which are limited partnerships, the risk of termination of investment management agreement for such funds is limited, subject to our fiduciary or contractual duties as general partner. This risk is more significant for our offshore hedge funds where we do not serve as the general partner, which represent a significant portion of our hedge fund MAUM. With respect to our private equity funds formed as registered investment companies, each fund’s investment management agreement must be approved annually by the independent members of such fund’s board of directors and, in certain cases, by its members, as required by law. Termination of these agreements would reduce the fees we earn from the relevant funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, following the deconsolidation, investors in any private equity fund and certain hedge funds have the ability to act, without cause, to accelerate the date on which the fund must be wound down. Our ability to realize incentive income from such funds therefore would be adversely affected if we are required to liquidate fund investments at a time when market conditions result in our obtaining less for investments than could be obtained at later times. In addition, management agreements of our funds that are registered investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940 would terminate if we were to experience a change of control without obtaining investor consent. Such a change of control could be deemed to occur in the event our principals exchange enough of their interests in the Fortress Operating Group into our Class A shares such that our principals no longer own a controlling interest in us. We cannot be certain that consents required for the assignment of our investment management agreements will be obtained if such a deemed change of control occurs. In addition, the board of directors of certain hedge funds have the right under certain circumstances to terminate the investment management agreements with the applicable fund. Termination of these agreements would affect the fees we earn from the relevant funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We are subject to third-party litigation risk that could result in significant liabilities and reputational harm, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In general, we will be exposed to risk of litigation by our investors if our management of any fund is alleged to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct. Investors could sue us to recover amounts lost by our funds due to our alleged misconduct, up to the entire amount of loss. Further, we may be subject to litigation arising from investor dissatisfaction with the performance of our funds or from allegations that we improperly exercised control or influence over companies in which our funds have large investments. By way of example, we, our funds and certain of our employees, are each exposed to the risks of litigation relating to investment activities in our funds and actions taken by the officers and directors (some of whom may be Fortress employees) of portfolio companies, such as risks relating to a funds’ high-yield lending activities and the risk of shareholder litigation by other shareholders of public companies in which our funds have lar ge investments. In addition, we are exposed to risks of litigation or investigation relating to transactions which presented conflicts of interest that were not properly addressed. In such actions we would be obligated to bear legal, settlement and other costs (which may be in excess of available insurance coverage). In addition, although we are indemnified by the funds we manage, our rights to indemnification may be challenged. If we are required to incur all or a portion of the costs arising out of litigation or investigations as a result of inadequate insurance proceeds or failure to obtain indemnification from our funds, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. 11 Table of Contents In our liquid hedge funds, we are exposed to the risk of litigation if the funds suffer catastrophic losses due to the failure of a particular investment strategy or due to the trading activity of an employee who has violated market rules and regulations. Any litigation arising in such circumstances is likely to be protracted, expensive and surrounded by circumstances which are materially damaging to our reputation and our business. In addition, we face the risk of litigation from investors in our private equity funds and hybrid hedge funds if we violate restrictions in such funds’ organizational documents (for example, by failing to seek approval for related party transactions requiring approval or by exceeding the mandate of such funds). Our liquid hedge funds, our offshore hybrid hedge fund and many of our private equity funds are incorporated or formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Cayman Islands laws, particularly with respect to shareholders rights, partner rights and bankruptcy, may differ from the laws of the United States. Cayman Islands laws could change, possibly to the detriment of our funds and investment management subsidiaries. Also, as a public company, we are subject to the risk of investigation or litigation by regulators or our public shareholders arising from an array of possible claims, including investor dissatisfaction with the performance of our businesses or our share price, allegations of misconduct by our officers and directors or claims that we have inappropriately dealt with conflicts of interest or investment allocations. It is also possible that the public company may be brought into a lawsuit involving any of the fund-related litigation risks described above. As with the funds, while the public company maintains insurance, there can be no assurance that its insurance will prove to be adequate. If the public company is required to incur all or a portion of the costs arising out of litigation or investigations, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, any such litigation or investigation could be protracted, expensive and highly dama ging to the public company’s reputation, even if the underlying claims are without merit. In addition, we may participate in transactions that involve litigation (including the enforcement of property rights) from time to time, and such transactions may expose us to reputational risk and increased risk from countersuits. In addition, with a workforce consisting of many very highly paid investment professionals, we face the risk of lawsuits relating to claims for compensation, which may individually or in the aggregate be significant in amount. The cost of settling such claims could adversely affect our results of operations. Our reputation, business and operations could be adversely affected by regulatory compliance failures, the potential adverse effect of changes in laws and regulations applicable to our business and effects of negative publicity surrounding the alternative asset management industry in general. Potential regulatory action poses a significant risk to our reputation and thereby to our business. Our business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and in the other countries in which our investment activities occur. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, oversees our activities as a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. In addition, we are subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and various other statutes. We are subject to regulation by the Department of Labor under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or ERISA. We and our Castles, as public companies, are subject to applicable stock exchange regulations, and both we and Newcastle are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. A number of our investing activities, such as our lending business, are subject to regulation by various U.S. state regulators. In the United Kingd om, we are subject to regulation by the U.K. Financial Services Authority. Our other European operations, and our investment activities around the globe, are subject to a variety of regulatory regimes that vary country by country. Each of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with many aspects of financial services, including the authority to grant, and in specific circumstances to cancel, permissions to carry on particular businesses. A failure to comply with the obligations imposed by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 on investment advisers, including record-keeping, advertising and operating requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities, or by the 12 Table of Contents Investment Company Act of 1940, could result in investigations, sanctions and reputational damage. Our liquid hedge fund business, and, to a lesser degree, our hybrid hedge fund business, are involved regularly in trading activities which implicate a broad number of U.S. and foreign securities law regimes, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical trading requirements that implicate fundamental market regulation policies. Violation of such laws could result in severe restrictions on our activities and in damage to our reputation. Some of our private equity funds currently qualify as venture capital operating companies, or VCOC, and therefore are not subject to the fiduciary requirements of ERISA with respect to their assets. However, it is possible that the U.S. Department of Labor may amend the relevant regulations or the characteristics of our funds may change. If these funds fail to qualify as VCOCs or otherwise satisfy the requirements of ERISA, including the requirement of investment prudence and diversification or the prohibited transaction rules, it could materially interfere with our activities in relation to these funds or expose us to risks related to our failure to comply with such requirements. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, censure, suspensions of personnel or investing activities or other sanctions, including revocation of our registration as an investment adviser. The regulations that our businesses are subject to are designed primarily to protect investors in our funds and to ensure the integrity of the financial markets. They are not designed to protect our Class A shareholders. Even if a sanction imposed against us or our personnel by a regulator is for a small monetary amount, the adverse publicity related to such sanction against us by regulators could harm our reputation, result in redemptions by investors from our hedge funds and impede our ability to raise additional capital or new funds. As a result of recent highly-publicized financial scandals, investors have exhibited concerns over the integrity of the U.S. financial markets, and the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to heightened regulation. In recent years, there has been debate in both the U.S. and foreign governments about new rules or regulations to be applicable to hedge funds or other alternative investment products. For example, certain officials in Germany have called for implementing these types of additional regulations, which, if enacted, could potentially apply to our business activities throughout the European Union. We may be adversely affected if new or revised legislation or regulations are enacted, or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by the SEC, other U.S. or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets. Such changes could place li mitations on the type of investor that can invest in alternative asset funds or on the conditions under which such investors may invest. Further, such changes may limit the scope of investing activities that may be undertaken by alternative asset managers. Our results of operations may also be negatively impacted if the recently proposed tax legislation is enacted. If legislation were to be enacted by the U.S. Congress to treat carried interest as ordinary income rather than as capital gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such legislation would materially increase the amount of taxes that we and possibly our equityholders are required to pay, thereby reducing the value of our common units and adversely affecting our ability to recruit, retain and motivate our current and future professionals. See ‘‘— Our structure involves complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. Our structure also is subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis’’ and ‘‘— Legislation has been introduced that would, if enacted, preclude us fro m qualifying for treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the publicly traded partnership rules. Our structure also is subject to potential judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis. Any such changes could increase our costs of doing business or materially adversely affect our profitability.’’ Our failure to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business. As we have expanded the number and scope of our businesses, we increasingly confront potential conflicts of interest relating to our funds’ investment activities. Certain of our funds have overlapping 13 Table of Contents investment objectives, including funds which have different fee structures, and potential conflicts may arise with respect to our decisions regarding how to allocate investment opportunities among those funds. For example, a decision to acquire material non-public information about a company while pursuing an investment opportunity for a particular fund gives rise to a potential conflict of interest when it results in our having to restrict the ability of other funds to take any action. In addition, holders of Class A shares may perceive conflicts of interest regarding investment decisions for funds in which our principals, who have and may continue to make significant personal investments in a variety of Fortress Funds, are personally invested. Similarly, conflicts of interest may exist or develop regarding decisions about the allocation of specific investment opportunities between Fortress and the Fortress Funds. In addition, because the Operating Entities are held, in part, by FIG Corp., which is subject to tax, conflicts of interest may exist regarding decisions about which of Fortress’s holdings should be held by Operating Entities and which by Principal Holdings. Pursuant to the terms of our operating agreement, whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between any of the principals, one or more directors or their respective affiliates, on the one hand, and the company, any subsidiary of the company or any member other than a principal, on the other, any resolution or course of action by our board of directors shall be permitted and deemed approved by all shareholders if the resolution or course of action (i) has been specifically approved by a majority of the members of a committee composed entirely of two or more independent directors, or it is deemed approved because it complies with rules or guidelines established by such committee, (ii) has been approved by a majority of the total votes that may be cast in the election of directors that are held by disinterested parties, (iii) is on terms no less favorable to the company or shareholders (other than a principal) than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or (iv) is fair and reasonable to the company taking into account the totality of the relationships between the parties involved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is possible that potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to investor dissatisfaction or litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with one or more potential or actual conflicts of interest. Regulatory scrutiny of, or litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest would have a material adverse effect on our reputation, which would materially adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including as a result of redemptions by our investors from our hedge funds, an inability to raise additional funds and a reluctance of counterparties to do business with us. Employee misconduct could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain investors and by subjecting us to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm. Our reputation is critical to maintaining and developing relationships with the investors in our funds, potential investors and third-parties with whom we do business. In recent years, there have been a number of highly-publicized cases involving fraud, conflicts of interest or other misconduct by individuals in the financial services industry in general and the hedge fund industry in particular. There is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an employee were to engage in illegal or suspicious activities (such as improper trading, disclosure of confidential information or breach of fiduciary duties), we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position, investor relationships and ability to attract future investors. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not b e effective in all cases. Misconduct by our employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business. The investment management business is intensely competitive. Over the past several years, the size and number of hedge funds and private equity funds has continued to increase. If this trend continues, it is possible that it will become increasingly difficult for our funds to raise capital. More significantly, the allocation of increasing amounts of capital to alternative investment strategies by institutional and individual investors may lead to a reduction in 14 Table of Contents profitable investment opportunities, including by driving prices for investments higher and increasing the difficulty of achieving targeted returns. In addition, if interest rates were to rise or there were to be a prolonged bull market in equities, the attractiveness of our funds relative to investments in other investment products could decrease. Competition is based on a variety of factors, including: • investment performance; • investor perception of investment managers’ drive, focus and alignment of interest; • quality of service provided to and duration of relationship with investors; • business reputation; and • level of fees and expenses charged for services. We compete in all aspects of our business with a large number of investment management firms, private equity fund sponsors, hedge fund sponsors and other financial institutions. A number of factors serve to increase our competitive risks: • investors may develop concerns that we will allow a business to grow to the detriment of its performance; • some of our competitors have greater capital, a lower cost of capital, lower targeted returns or greater sector or investment strategy specific expertise than we do, which creates competitive disadvantages with respect to investment opportunities; • some of our competitors may have greater technical, marketing and other resources than we possess; • some of our competitors may perceive risk differently than we do, which could allow them either to outbid us for investments in particular sectors or, generally, to consider a wider variety of investments; • our competitors that are corporate buyers may be able to achieve synergistic cost savings in respect of an investment, which may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for an investment, particularly if conditions in the debt markets increase our financing costs; • some investors may prefer to invest with an investment manager that is not publicly traded; • there are relatively few barriers to entry impeding new private equity and hedge fund management firms, and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various lines of business, including former ‘‘star’’ portfolio managers at large diversified financial institutions as well as such institutions themselves, will continue to result in increased competition; and • other industry participants continuously seek to recruit our investment professionals, particularly our best and brightest, away from us. These and other factors could reduce our earnings and revenues and materially adversely affect our business. In addition, if we are forced to compete with other alternative asset managers on the basis of price, we may not be able to maintain our current management and performance fee structures. We have historically competed primarily on the performance of our funds, and not on the level of our fees relative to those of our competitors. However, there is a risk that fees in the alternative investment management industry will decline, without regard to the historical performance of a manager. Fee reductions on existing or future funds, without corresponding decreases in our cost structure, would adversely affect our revenues and profitability. The due diligence process that we undertake in connection with investments by our investment funds may not reveal all facts that may be relevant in connection with an investment. Before making investments, we conduct due diligence that we deem reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment. When conducting due diligence, we may be required to evaluate important and complex business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues. Outside consultants, legal advisors, accountants and investment banks 15 Table of Contents may be involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment, we rely on the resources available to us, including information provided by the target of the investment and, in some circumstances, third-party investigations. The due diligence investigation that we will carry out with respect to any investment opportunity may not reveal or highlight all relevant facts that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such investment opportunity. Moreover, such an investigation will not necessarily result in the investment being successful. Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. As a public company, we are required to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. While management has certified that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2007, because internal control over financial reporting is complex and may be revised over time to adapt to changes in our business, we cannot assure you that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in the future. If we are not able to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for future required dates (which begin with our fiscal 2008 annual report). Matters impacting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and thereby su bject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions or investigations by the SEC, or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules, and result in a breach of the covenants under our credit agreement. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements is also likely to suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm reports a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. This could materially adversely affect us and lead to a decline in our share price and impair our ability to raise capital. Our organizational documents do not limit our ability to enter into new lines of businesses, and we may enter into new businesses, make future strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into joint ventures, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our business. We intend, to the extent that market conditions warrant, to grow our business by increasing fee paying assets under management in existing businesses and creating new investment products. Our organizational documents, however, do not limit us to the investment management business. Accordingly, we may pursue growth through strategic investments, acquisitions or joint ventures, which may include entering into new lines of business, such as the insurance, broker-dealer or financial advisory industries, and which may involve assuming responsibility for the actual operation of assets or entire companies. In addition, we expect opportunities will arise to acquire other alternative or traditional asset managers. To the extent we make strategic investments or acquisitions, enter into joint ventures, or enter into a new line of business, we will face numerous risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with (i) the required investment of capital and other resourc es, (ii) the possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably or without incurring inappropriate amounts of risk, and (iii) combining or integrating operational and management systems and controls. Entry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar, or from which we are currently exempt, and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk and negative publicity. If a new business generates insufficient revenues or if we are unable to efficiently manage our expanded operations, our results of operations will be adversely affected. In the case of joint ventures, we are subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to, systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control. 16 Table of Contents Our revenue and profitability fluctuate, particularly inasmuch as we cannot predict the timing of realization events in our private equity business, which may make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis and may cause volatility in the price of our Class A shares. We experience significant variations in revenues and profitability during the year and among years because we are paid incentive income from certain funds only when investments are realized, rather than periodically on the basis of increases in the funds’ net asset values. The timing and receipt of incentive income generated by our private equity funds is event driven and thus highly variable, which contributes to the volatility of our segment revenue, and our ability to realize incentive income from our private equity funds may be limited. It takes a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities, to raise all the funds needed to make an investment and then to realize the cash value (or other proceeds) of an investment through a sale, public offering, recapitalization or other exit. Even if an investment proves to be profitable, it may be several years before any profits can be realized in cash (or other proceeds). We cannot pr edict when, or if, any realization of investments will occur, and the current challenging conditions in the financing markets have made it more difficult for potential buyers to finance purchases with third-party funds on favorable terms, thereby reducing the likelihood of investment realizations at favorable prices in the near term. If we were to have a realization event in a particular quarter, it may have a significant impact on our segment revenues and profits for that particular quarter which may not be replicated in subsequent quarters. In addition, our private equity investments are adjusted for accounting purposes to fair value at the end of each quarter, resulting in revenue (loss) attributable to our principal investments, even though we receive no cash distributions from our private equity funds, which could increase the volatility of our quarterly earnings. To the extent that our principal investments in our private equity funds (or direct investments in private equity transactions) are marked do wn, such mark downs will flow through our statements of operations as a GAAP loss, even in circumstances where we have a long investment horizon and have no present intention of selling the investment. With respect to our hedge funds, our incentive income is paid annually or quarterly if the net asset value of a fund has increased for the period. The amount (if any) of the incentive income we earn from our hedge funds depends on the increase in the net asset value of the funds, which is subject to market volatility. Our liquid hedge funds have historically experienced significant fluctuations in net asset value from month to month. Certain of our hedge funds also have ‘‘high water marks’’ whereby we do not earn incentive income for a particular period even though the fund had positive returns in such period if the fund had greater losses in prior periods. Therefore, if a hedge fund experiences losses in a period, we will not be able to earn incentive income from that fund until it surpasses the previous high water mark. These quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and profits in any of our businesses could lead to significant volatility in the price of our Class A shares. An increase in our borrowing costs may adversely affect our earnings and liquidity. On May 10, 2007, we refinanced our existing credit agreement with a new $1 billion credit agreement. Under the new credit agreement, we have a $200 million revolving credit facility, a $350 million term loan facility and a $450 million delayed term loan facility. As of December 31, 2007, we had a $350 million term loan outstanding, $185 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility (in addition, $11.1 million of letters of credit were outstanding under a letter of credit subfacility) and no amounts outstanding under our delayed term loan facility. The delayed term loan facility was subsequently fully drawn in 2008. Borrowings under the credit agreement mature on May 10, 2012. As our facilities mature, we will be required to either refinance them by entering into new facilities or issuing new debt, which could result in higher borrowing costs, or issuing equity, which would dilute exi sting shareholders. We could also repay them by using cash on hand (if available) or cash from the sale of our assets. No assurance can be given that we will be able to enter into new facilities, issue new debt or issue equity in the future on attractive terms, or at all. Our credit facility loans are typically LIBOR-based floating-rate obligations and the interest expense we incur will vary with changes in the applicable LIBOR reference rate. As a result, an 17 Table of Contents increase in short-term interest rates will increase our interest costs and will reduce the spread between the returns on our investments and the cost of our borrowings. An increase in interest rates would adversely affect the market value of any fixed-rate debt investments and/or subject them to prepayment or extension risk, which may adversely affect our earnings and liquidity. We have recently participated in large-sized investments, which involve certain complexities and risks that are not encountered in small- and medium-sized investments. Our private equity funds have recently participated in several large transactions. The increased size of these investments involves certain complexities and risks that may not be encountered in small- and medium-sized investments. For example, larger transactions may be more difficult to finance, and exiting larger deals may present challenges in many cases. In addition, larger transactions may entail greater scrutiny by regulators, labor unions, political bodies and other third parties. Recently, labor unions and members of Congress have been more active in opposing and investigating certain larger investments by private equity firms generally. Larger transactions may be structured as ‘‘consortium transactions’’ due to the size of the investment and the amount of capital required to be invested. A consortium transaction involves an equity investment in which two or more private equity firms serve together or collectively as equity sponsors. We may participate in a meaningful number of consortium transactions in the future. Consortium transactions generally entail a reduced level of control by Fortress over the investment because governance rights must be shared with the other private equity investors. Accordingly, we may not be able to control decisions relating to the investment, including decisions relating to the management and operation of the company and the timing and nature of any exit, which could result in the risks described in ‘‘— Our investment funds make investments in companies that we do not control’’. Any of these factors could increase the risk that our larger investments could be less successful. The consequences to our investment funds of an unsuccessful larger investment could be more severe given the size of the investment. Our investment funds often make investments in companies that we do not control. Investments by most of our investment funds will include debt instruments and equity securities of companies that we do not control. Such instruments and securities may be acquired by our investment funds through trading activities or through purchases of securities from the issuer. In addition, our private equity funds may possibly acquire minority equity interests (particularly in consortium transactions, as described in ‘‘— We have recently participated in large-sized investments, which involve certain complexities and risks that are not encountered in small- and medium-sized investments’’) and may also dispose of a portion of their majority equity investments in portfolio companies over time in a manner that results in the investment funds retaining a minority investment. Those investments will be subject to the risk that the company in which the investment is made may make business, financial or management decisions with which we do not agree or that the majority stakeholders or the management of the company may take risks or otherwise act in a manner that does not serve our interests. If any of the foregoing were to occur, the values of investments by our investment funds could decrease and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could suffer as a result. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing a market for our investment products in Asia or that our relationship with Nomura will yield profitable investment opportunities for the funds we manage. On December 18, 2006, our principals entered into an agreement with Nomura pursuant to which Nomura acquired a 15% stake in Fortress for $888.0 million on January 17, 2007. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the parties agreed that Nomura will work with us to develop a strategy to market and sell our investment products. We believe that a strategic relationship with Nomura, the largest leading Japanese financial institution, could provide us with access to Nomura’s distribution 18 Table of Contents capabilities in Asia. In addition, we believe that our relationship will provide us with potential investment opportunities for the funds we manage. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop a strategy and enter into a mutually satisfactory distribution agreement with Nomura, or that if reached, a market for our investment products will ever develop in Asia. Risks Related to Our Funds Our results of operations are dependent on the performance of our funds. Poor fund performance will result in reduced revenues, reduced returns on our principal investments in the funds and reduced earnings. Poor performance of our funds will also make it difficult for us to retain or attract investors to our funds and to grow our business. The performance of each fund we manage is subject to some or all of the following risks. The historical performance of our funds should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or of our future results or of any returns expected on our Class A shares. The historical and potential future returns of the funds we manage are not directly linked to returns on our Class A shares. Therefore, readers should not conclude that continued positive performance of the funds we manage will necessarily result in positive returns on our Class A shares. However, poor performance of the funds we manage will cause a decline in our revenue from such funds, and would therefore have a negative effect on our performance and the returns on our Class A shares. Moreover, with respect to the historical performance of our funds: • the historical performance of our funds should not be considered indicative of the future results that should be expected from such funds or from any future funds we may raise; • our private equity funds’ performance, which is calculated on the basis of net asset value of the funds’ investments, reflect unrealized gains that may never be realized; • our private equity funds’ performance has been positively influenced by a select number of investments that experienced rapid and substantial increases in value following the initial public offerings of the private equity portfolio companies in which those investments were made; • our funds’ returns have benefited from investment opportunities and general market conditions that may not repeat themselves, and there can be no assurance that our current or future funds will be able to avail themselves of profitable investment opportunities; and • several of our private equity portfolio companies have become public companies and have experienced significant subsequent increases in their public market value. There can be no assurance that we will be able to realize such investments at their current market prices, particularly if the market perceives that the companies will perform less well when Fortress reduces its investment in them. Poor performance of our funds would cause a decline in our revenue and results of operations, may obligate us to repay incentive income previously paid to us, and would adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future funds. Our revenue from the Fortress Funds is derived principally from three sources: (1) management fees, based on the size of our funds; (2) incentive income, based on the performance of our funds; and (3) investment income from our investments in the funds, which we refer to as our ‘‘principal investments.’’ In the event that any of our funds perform poorly, our revenue and results of operations will decline, and it will likely be more difficult for us to raise new capital. In addition, hedge fund investors may withdraw their investments in our funds, while investors in private equity funds may decline to invest in future funds we raise, as a result of poor performance of our funds or otherwise. Furthermore, if, as a result of poor performance of later investments in a private equity fund’s life, the fund does not achieve total investment returns that exceed a specified investment return threshold for 19 Table of Contents the life of the fund, we will be obligated to repay the amount by which incentive income that was previously distributed to us exceeds the amounts to which we are ultimately entitled. Our investors and potential investors continually assess our funds’ performance and our ability to raise capital. Difficult market conditions can adversely affect our funds in many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments made by our funds and reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, which could materially reduce our revenue and adversely affect results of operations. If economic conditions are unfavorable, our funds may not perform well, and we may not be able to raise money in existing or new funds. Our funds are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world. The global market and economic climate may deteriorate because of many factors beyond our control, including rising interest rates or inflation, deterioration in the credit and finance markets, terrorism or political uncertainty. In the event of a market downturn, each of our businesses could be affected in different ways. Our private equity funds may face reduced opportunities to sell and realize value from their existing investments, a lack of financing on acceptable terms, and a lack of suitable investments for the funds to make. In addition, adverse market or economic conditions as well as a slowdown of activities in a particular sector in which portfolio companies of these funds operate could have an adverse effect on the earnings of those portfolio companies, and therefore, our earnings. A general market downturn, or a specific market dislocation, may cause our revenue and results of operations to decline by causing: • MAUM to decrease, lowering management fees; • increases in costs of financial instruments; • lower investment returns, reducing incentive income; • reduced demand to purchase assets held by our funds, which would negatively affect the funds ability to realize value from such assets; • material reductions in the value of our private equity fund investments in portfolio companies which reduce our ‘‘surplus’’ and, therefore, our ability to realize incentive income from these investments; • investor redemptions, resulting in lower fees; and • decreases in the value of our principal investments. Furthermore, while difficult market conditions may increase opportunities to make certain distressed asset investments, such conditions also increase the risk of default with respect to investments held by our funds with debt investments, such as the hybrid hedge funds and the Castles. Our liquid hedge funds may also be adversely affected by difficult market conditions if they fail to predict the adverse effect of such conditions on particular investments, resulting in a significant reduction in the value of those investments. In addition, the Castles, as well as the publicly traded portfolio companies owned by our private equity funds, currently pay a material amount of dividends. This makes their share prices vulnerable to increases in interest rates, which would, by causing declines in the value of the share prices, in turn result in lower management fees and incentive income for us, as well as potential decreases in the value of Castle shares and options hel d as principal investments on our balance sheet. Changes in the debt financing markets may negatively impact the ability of our investment funds and their portfolio companies to obtain attractive financing for their investments, and may increase the cost of such financing if it is obtained, leading to lower-yielding investments and potentially decreasing our incentive income. Over the past several months, the markets for debt financing have contracted significantly, particularly in the area of acquisition financings for private equity and leveraged buyout transactions. 20 Table of Contents Large commercial banks, which have traditionally provided such financing, have demanded higher rates, more restrictive covenants and generally more onerous terms (including posting additional margin) in order to provide such financing, and in some cases are refusing, or reneging on existing commitments, to provide any financing for acquisitions which would have been readily financed under credit conditions present for the past several years. In the event that Fortress private equity funds are unable to obtain committed debt financing for potential acquisitions (including as a result of a default by our lenders on financing commitments they have provided to us) or can only obtain debt at an increased rate, this may prevent those funds from completing otherwise profitable acquisitions or may lower the profit that the funds would otherwise have achieved from such transactions, either of which could lead to a decrease in the incentive income earned by us. Similarly, the portfolio companies owned by the Fortress private equity funds regularly utilize the corporate debt markets, particularly the structured finance market, in order to obtain efficient financing for their operations. To the extent that the current credit markets have rendered such financing difficult to obtain or more expensive, this may negatively impact the operating performance of those portfolio companies and therefore the investme nt returns on our funds. Our Castles rely on the structured finance and mortgage markets in order to obtain leverage and therefore increase the yield on substantially all of their investments. To the extent that volatility in those credit markets leads to a situation where financing of that type is unavailable or limited (as has been the case for Newcastle since mid-2007), our Castles may be unable to make investments on an accretive basis. This could slow the rate of growth of our fee paying assets under management in those funds, and cause a commensurate decrease in the rate of growth of our management and incentive income fees. Furthermore, it could significantly reduce the yield available for reinvesting capital received from prior investments, thereby reducing profits which would lead to a decrease in the incentive income earned by us. As a result of impairments recorded in connection with this market disruption, we do not expect to earn incentive income from one of the C astles for an indeterminate period of time. Our hedge funds often utilize the structured finance markets in order to obtain leverage and therefore increase the yield on certain of their investments. To the extent that volatility in those credit markets leads to a situation where financing of that type is unavailable or limited, our hedge funds may be unable to make certain types of investments as the yield on those investments will be outside of the funds’ target range without leverage. This could lead to those hedge funds making fewer overall investments and slowing the rate of growth of the fee paying assets under management in those funds, and a commensurate decrease in the rate of growth of our management fees. We and our funds are subject to counterparty default risks. Our funds enter into numerous types of financing arrangements with a wide array of counterparties around the world, including loans, hedge contracts, swaps, repurchase agreements and other derivative and non-derivative contracts. The terms of these contracts are often customized and complex, and many of these arrangements occur in markets or relate to products that are not subject to regulatory oversight. In particular, some of our funds utilize prime brokerage arrangements with a relatively limited number of counterparties, which has the effect of concentrating the transaction volume (and related counterparty default risk) of these funds with these counterparties. Our funds are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these contracts defaults, either voluntarily or involuntarily, on its performance under the contract. Any such default may occur rapidly and without notice to us. Moreover, if a counterparty defaults, we may be unable to take action to cover our exposure, either because we lack the contractual ability or because market conditions make it difficult to take effective action. This inability could occur in times of market stress, which are precisely the times when defaults may be most like to occur. In addition, our risk-management models may not accurately anticipate the impact of market stress or counterparty financial condition, and as a result, we may not take sufficient action to reduce our risks effectively. Although each of our funds monitors its credit exposures, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect, foresee or evaluate. In addition, concerns 21 Table of Contents about, or a default by, one large participant could lead to significant liquidity problems for other participants, which may in turn expose us to significant losses. In the event of a counterparty default, particularly a default by a major investment bank, one or more of our funds could incur material losses, and the resulting market impact of a major counterparty default could harm our business, results of operation and financial condition. In the event that one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to eventually recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty’s default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable legal regime governing the bankruptcy proceeding. Because the public company is dependent on receiving cash from our funds, any loss suffered by a fund as a result of a counterparty default would also affect the results of the public company. In addition, the public company has no right to influence any fund’s choice of, or the size of a fund’s exposure to, any given counterparty. As a result, the public company may have concentrated exposure to one or more counterparties (due to the aggregation of counterparty risk across the underlying fund businesses) and thus be exposed to a heightened risk of loss if that counterparty defaults. Investors in our hedge funds may redeem their investments, and investors in our private equity funds may elect to dissolve the funds, at any time without cause. These events would lead to a decrease in our revenues, which could be substantial and lead, therefore, to a material adverse effect on our business. Investors in our hedge funds may generally redeem their investments on an annual or quarterly basis, subject to the applicable fund’s specific redemption provisions (e.g., a redeeming Drawbridge Special Opportunities Fund investor is not entitled to cash at the redemption date, but retains instead an interest in the investments as of the redemption date and receives monies from the fund only as and when such investments are realized). Investors may decide to move their capital away from us to other investments for any number of reasons in addition to poor investment performance. Factors that could result in investors leaving our funds include changes in interest rates that make other investments more attractive, the publicly traded nature of the indirect parent of their manager, changes in investor perception regarding our focus or alignment of interest, unhappiness with changes in or broadening of a fund’s investment strategy, changes in our reputat ion, and departures or changes in responsibilities of key investment professionals. In a declining financial market, the pace of redemptions and consequent reduction in our fee paying assets under management could accelerate. The decrease in our revenues that would result from significant redemptions in our hedge fund business would have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the investors in our private equity and domestic hedge funds may, subject to certain conditions, act at any time to accelerate the liquidation date of the fund without cause, resulting in a reduction in management fees we earn from such funds, and a significant reduction in the amounts of total incentive income we could earn from those funds. Incentive income could be significantly reduced as a result of our inability to maximize the value of a fund’s investments in a liquidation. The occurrence of such an event with respect to any of our funds would, in addition to the significant negative impact on our revenue and earnings, likely result in significant reputational damage as well. Many of our funds invest in relatively high-risk, illiquid assets that often have significantly leveraged capital structures, and we may fail to realize any profits from these activities for a considerable period of time or lose some or all of the principal amount we invest in these activities. Many of our funds invest in securities that are not publicly traded. In many cases, our funds may be prohibited by contract or by applicable securities laws from selling such securities for a period of time. Our funds will generally not be able to sell these securities publicly unless their sale is registered under applicable securities laws, or unless an exemption from such registration requirements is available. Accordingly, our funds may be forced to sell securities at a loss under certain conditions. The ability of many of our funds, particularly our private equity funds, to dispose of investments is heavily dependent on the public equity markets, inasmuch as our ability to realize any value from an investment may depend upon our ability to sell equity of the portfolio company in the public equity 22 Table of Contents markets through an initial public offering (an ‘‘IPO’’) of the portfolio company in which such investment is held. Furthermore, large holdings even of publicly traded equity securities can often be disposed of only over a substantial period of time, exposing the investment returns to risks of downward movement in market prices during the disposition period. In addition, many of our funds invest in businesses with capital structures that have significant leverage. The large amount of borrowing in the leveraged capital structure of such businesses increases the risk of losses due to factors such as rising interest rates, downturns in the economy or deteriorations in the condition of the investment or its industry. In the event of defaults under borrowings, the assets being financed would be at risk of foreclosure, and the fund could lose its entire investment. Our hedge funds are subject to risks due to potential illiquidity of assets. Our hedge funds may make investments or hold trading positions in markets that are volatile and which may become illiquid. Timely divestiture or sale of trading positions can be impaired by decreased trading volume, increased price volatility, concentrated trading positions, limitations on the ability to transfer positions in highly specialized or structured transactions to which we may be a party, and changes in industry and government regulations. When a fund holds a security or position it is vulnerable to price and value fluctuations and may experience losses to the extent the value of the position decreases and it is unable to timely sell, hedge or transfer the position. Therefore, it may be impossible or costly for our funds to liquidate positions rapidly, particularly if the relevant market is moving against a position or in the event of trading halts or daily price movement limits on the market or otherwise. Alternatively, it may not be possible in certa in circumstances for a position to be purchased or sold promptly, particularly if there is insufficient trading activity in the relevant market or otherwise. The hedge funds we manage may operate with a substantial degree of leverage. They may borrow, invest in derivative instruments and purchase securities using borrowed money, so that the positions held by the funds may in aggregate value exceed the net asset value of the funds. This leverage creates the potential for higher returns, but also increases the volatility of a fund, including the risk of a total loss of the amount invested. The risks identified above will be increased if a fund is required to rapidly liquidate positions to meet margin requests, margin calls or other funding requirements on that position or otherwise. The inability to rapidly sell positions due to a lack of liquidity has historically been the cause of substantial losses in the hedge fund industry. The ability of counterparties to force liquidations following losses or a failure to meet a margin call can result in the rapid sale of highly leveraged positions in declining markets, which would likely subject our hedge funds to substantial losses. We may fail to adequately predict the liquidity that our hedge funds require to address counterparty requirements due to falling values of fund investments being financed by such counterparties, which could result not only in losses related to such investments, but in losses related to the need to liquidate unrelated investments in order to meet the fund’s obligations. O ur hedge funds may incur substantial losses in the event significant capital is invested in highly leveraged investments or investment strategies. Such losses would result in a decline in MAUM, lead to investor requests to redeem remaining MAUM, and damage our reputation, each of which would materially and adversely impact our earnings. Valuation methodologies for certain assets in our funds can be subject to significant subjectivity and the values of assets established pursuant to such methodologies may never be realized, which could result in significant losses for our funds. There are no readily-ascertainable market prices for a very large number of illiquid investments in our private equity and hybrid hedge funds. The value of the investments of our funds is determined periodically by us based on the fair value of such investments. The fair value of investments is determined using a number of methodologies described in the funds’ valuation policies. These policies are based on a number of factors, including the nature of the investment, the expected cash flows from the investment, bid or ask prices provided by third parties for the investment, the length of time 23 Table of Contents the investment has been held, the trading price of securities (in the case of publicly traded securities), restrictions on transfer and other recognized valuation methodologies. The methodologies we use in valuing individual investments are based on a variety of estimates and assumptions specific to the particular investments, and actual results related to the investment therefore often vary materially as a result of the inaccuracy of such assumptions or estimates. In addition, because many of the illiquid investments held by our funds are in industries or sectors which are unstable, in distress, or undergoing some uncertainty, such investments are subject to rapid changes in value caused by sudden company-specific or industry-wide developments. In addition, in many markets, transaction flow is limited due to uncertainty about accurate asset valuations, which may cause hedge fund investors to become concerned about valuations of funds that have illiquid or hard-to-value assets. This concern may lead to incre ased redemptions by investors irrespective of the performance of the funds. In addition, uncertainty about asset values on redemptions from or investments in our hedge funds may lead to an increased risk of litigation by investors over net asset values. Because there is significant uncertainty in the valuation of, or in the stability of the value of, illiquid investments, the fair values of such investments as reflected in a fund’s net asset value do not necessarily reflect the prices that would actually be obtained by us on behalf of the fund when such investments are sold. Realizations at values significantly lower than the values at which investments have been reflected in fund net asset values would result in losses for the applicable fund, a decline in asset management fees and the loss of potential incentive income. Also, a situation where asset values turn out to be materially different than values reflected in fund net asset values will cause investors to lose confidence in us which would, in turn, result in redemptions from our hedge funds or difficulties in raising additional private equity funds. In some cases, the Fortress Funds realize value from an illiquid portfolio company when the portfolio company is able to sell equity in the public markets through an IPO. An IPO of a portfolio company increases the liquidity of the funds’ investment in the company and can create significant value when the dividend yield on the company’s shares after the IPO is lower than the return being generated by the company’s net assets, thereby increasing the value of its equity. Therefore, Fortress values illiquid portfolio companies for which an IPO is being contemplated, or is in process, at fair value without regard to the theoretical value which may be created by the IPO, and such theoretical value may never be realized if the IPO is never consummated. Certain of our funds utilize special situation and distressed debt investment strategies that involve significant risks. Our private equity and hybrid hedge funds invest in obligors and issuers with weak financial conditions, poor operating results, substantial financial needs, negative net worth, and/or special competitive problems. These funds also invest in obligors and issuers that are involved in bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings. In such situations, it may be difficult to obtain full information as to the exact financial and operating conditions of these obligors and issuers. Additionally, the fair values of such investments are subject to abrupt and erratic market movements and significant price volatility if they are publicly traded securities, and are subject to significant uncertainty in general if they are not publicly traded securities. Furthermore, some of our funds’ distressed investments may not be widely traded or may have no recognized market. A fund’s exposure to such investments may be substantial in relation to the market for those investment s, and the assets are likely to be illiquid and difficult to sell or transfer. As a result, it may take a number of years for the fair value of such investments to ultimately reflect their intrinsic value as perceived by us. A central feature of our distressed investment strategy is our ability to successfully predict the occurrence of certain corporate events, such as debt and/or equity offerings, restructurings, reorganizations, mergers, takeover offers and other transactions. If the corporate event we predict is delayed, changed or never completed, the market price and value of the applicable fund’s investment could decline sharply. In addition, these investments could subject our private equity and hedge funds to certain potential additional liabilities that may exceed the value of their original investment. Under certain 24 Table of Contents circumstances, payments or distributions on certain investments may be reclaimed if any such payment or distribution is later determined to have been a fraudulent conveyance, a preferential payment or similar transaction under applicable bankruptcy and insolvency laws. In addition, under certain circumstances, a lender that has inappropriately exercised control of the management and policies of a debtor may have its claims subordinated or disallowed, or may be found liable for damages suffered by parties as a result of such actions. In the case where the investment in securities of troubled companies is made in connection with an attempt to influence a restructuring proposal or plan of reorganization in bankruptcy, our funds may become involved in substantial litigation. If our risk management systems for our hedge fund business are ineffective, we may be exposed to material unanticipated losses. In our hedge fund business, we continue to refine our risk management techniques, strategies and assessment methods. However, our risk management techniques and strategies do not fully mitigate the risk exposure of our funds in all economic or market environments, or against all types of risk, including risks that we might fail to identify or anticipate. Some of our strategies for managing risk in our funds are based upon our use of historical market behavior statistics. We apply statistical and other tools to these observations to measure and analyze the risks to which our funds are exposed. Any failures in our risk management techniques and strategies to accurately quantify such risk exposure could limit our ability to manage risks in the funds or to seek adequate risk-adjusted returns. In addition, any risk management failures could cause fund losses to be significantly greater than the historical measures predict. Further, our mathematical modeling does not take all risks into account. Our more qualitative approach to managing those risks could prove insufficient, exposing us to material unanticipated losses. Some of our funds invest in foreign countries and securities of issuers located outside of the United States, which may involve foreign exchange, political, social and economic uncertainties and risks. Some of our funds invest a portion of their assets in the equity, debt, loans or other securities of issuers located outside the U.S. In addition to business uncertainties, such investments may be affected by changes in exchange values as well as political, social and economic uncertainty affecting a country or region. Many financial markets are not as developed or as efficient as those in the U.S., and as a result, liquidity may be reduced and price volatility may be higher. The legal and regulatory environment may also be different, particularly with respect to bankruptcy and reorganization, and may afford us less protection as a creditor than we may be entitled to under U.S. law. Financial accounting standards and practices may differ, and there may be less publicly available information in respect of such companies. Restrictions imposed or actions taken by foreign governments may adversely impact the value of our fund investments. Such restrictions or actions could include exchange controls, seizure or nationalization of foreign deposits and adoption of other governmental restrictions which adversely affect the prices of securities or the ability to repatriate profits on investments or the capital invested itself. Income received by our funds from sources in some countries may be reduced by withholding and other taxes. Any such taxes paid by a fund will reduce the net income or return from such investments. While our funds will take these factors into consideration in making investment decisions, including when hedging positions, no assurance can be given that the funds will be able to fully avoid these risks or generate sufficient risk-adjusted returns. Investments by our hedge funds will frequently rank junior to investments made by others in the same company. In most cases, the companies in which our investment funds invest will have indebtedness or equity securities, or may be permitted to incur indebtedness or to issue equity securities, that rank senior to our investment. By their terms, such instruments may provide that their holders are entitled to receive payments of dividends, interest or principal on or before the dates on which payments are to be made in respect of our investment. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, 25 Table of Contents reorganization or bankruptcy of a company in which an investment is made, holders of securities ranking senior to our investment would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before distributions could be made in respect of our investment. After repaying senior security holders, the company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying amounts owed in respect of our fund’s investment. To the extent that any assets remain, holders of claims that rank equally with our investment would be entitled to share on an equal and ratable basis in distributions that are made out of those assets. Also, during periods of financial distress or following an insolvency, the ability of our investment funds to influence a company’s affairs and to take actions to protect their investments may be substantially less than that of the senior creditors. Our hedge fund investments are subject to numerous additional risks. Our hedge fund investments, including investments by our funds of hedge funds in other hedge funds, are subject to numerous additional risks, including the following: • Certain of the funds are newly established funds without any operating history or are managed by management companies or general partners who do not have a significant track record as an independent manager. • Generally, there are few limitations on the execution of our hedge funds’ investment strategies, which are subject to the sole discretion of the management company or the general partner of such funds. The execution of a particular fund’s strategy — for example a strategy involving the enforcement of property rights through litigation — may negatively impact one or more other Fortress funds. • Hedge funds may engage in short-selling, which is subject to the theoretically unlimited risk of loss because there is no limit on how much the price of a security may appreciate before the short position is closed out. A fund may be subject to losses if a security lender demands return of the lent securities and an alternative lending source cannot be found or if the fund is otherwise unable to borrow securities that are necessary to hedge its positions. • Hedge funds are exposed to the risk that a counterparty will not settle a transaction in accordance with its terms and conditions because of a dispute over the terms of the contract (whether or not bona fide) or because of a credit or liquidity problem, thus causing the fund to suffer a loss. Counterparty risk is increased for contracts with longer maturities where events may intervene to prevent settlement, or where the fund has concentrated its transactions with a single or small group of counterparties. Generally, hedge funds are not restricted from dealing with any particular counterparty or from concentrating any or all of their transactions with one counterparty. Moreover, the funds’ internal consideration of the creditworthiness of their cou nterparties may prove insufficient. The absence of a regulated market to facilitate settlement may increase the potential for losses. • Credit risk may arise through a default by one of several large institutions that are dependent on one another to meet their liquidity or operational needs, so that a default by one institution causes a series of defaults by the other institutions. This ‘‘systemic risk’’ may adversely affect the financial intermediaries (such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges) with which the hedge funds interact on a daily basis. • The efficacy of investment and trading strategies depend largely on the ability to establish and maintain an overall market position in a combination of financial instruments. A hedge fund’s trading orders may not be executed in a timely and efficient manner due to various circumstances, including systems failures or human error. In such event, the funds might only be able to acquire some but not all of the components of the position, or if the overall position were to need adjustment, the funds might not be able to make such adjustment. As a result, the funds would not be able to achieve the market position selected by the management company or general partner of such funds, and might incur a loss in liquidating their position. 26 Table of Contents • Hedge fund investments are subject to risks relating to investments in commodities, futures, options and other derivatives, the prices of which are highly volatile and may be subject to the theoretically unlimited risk of loss in certain circumstances, including if the fund writes a call option. Price movements of commodities, futures and options contracts and payments pursuant to swap agreements are influenced by, among other things, interest rates, changing supply and demand relationships, trade, fiscal, monetary and exchange control programs and policies of governments and national and international political and economic events and policies. The value of futures, options and swap agreements also depends upon the price of the commodities underlying th em. In addition, hedge funds’ assets are subject to the risk of the failure of any of the exchanges on which their positions trade or of their clearinghouses or counterparties. Most U.S. commodities exchanges limit fluctuations in certain commodity interest prices during a single day by imposing ‘‘daily price fluctuation limits’’ or ‘‘daily limits,’’ the existence of which may reduce liquidity or effectively curtail trading in particular markets. We are subject to risks in using prime brokers and custodians. The funds in our liquid hedge funds business depend on the services of prime brokers and custodians to carry out certain securities transactions. In the event of the insolvency of a prime broker and/or custodian, the funds might not be able to recover equivalent assets in full as they will rank among the prime broker and custodian’s unsecured creditors in relation to assets which the prime broker or custodian borrows, lends or otherwise uses. In addition, the funds’ cash held with a prime broker or custodian will not be segregated from the prime broker’s or custodian’s own cash, and the funds will therefore rank as unsecured creditors in relation to the cash they have deposited. Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure Control by our principals of the combined voting power of our shares and holding their economic interest through Fortress Operating Group may give rise to conflicts of interests. Our principals control a majority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B shares. Accordingly, our principals have the ability to elect all of the members of our board of directors, subject to Nomura’s right to nominate one designee, and thereby to control our management and affairs. In addition, they are able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring shareholder approval and are able to cause or prevent a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our board of directors, and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of our company. The control of voting power by our principals could deprive Class A shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their Class A shares as part of a sale of our company, and might ultimately affect the market price of the Class A shares. In addition, the shareholders agreement among us and the principals provides the principals who are then employed by the Fortress Operating Group holding shares greater than 50% of the total combined voting power of all shares held by such principals, so long as the principals and their permitted transferees continue to hold more than 40% of the total combined voting power of our outstanding Class A and Class B shares, with approval rights over a variety of significant corporate actions, including: • ten percent indebtedness: any incurrence of indebtedness, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, by us or any of our subsidiaries in an amount in excess of approximately 10% of the then existing long-term indebtedness of us and our subsidiaries; • ten percent share issuance: any issuance by us, in any transaction or series of related transactions, of equity or equity-related securities which would represent, after such issuance, or upon conversion, exchange or exercise, as the case may be, at least 10% of the total combined voting power of our outstanding Class A and Class B shares other than (1) pursuant to transactions solely among us and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, or (2) upon conversion of convertible securities or upon exercise of warrants or options, which convertible securities, warrants or options are either outstanding on the date of, or issued in compliance with, the shareholders agreement; 27 Table of Contents • investment of $250 million or greater: any equity or debt commitment or investment or series of related equity or debt commitments or investments in an entity or related group of entities in an amount greater than $250 million; • new business requiring investment in excess of $100 million: any entry by us or any of our controlled affiliates into a new line of business that does not involve investment management and that requires a principal investment in excess of $100 million; • the adoption of a shareholder rights plan; • any appointment of a chief executive officer or co-chief executive officer; or • the termination of the employment of a principal with us or any of our material subsidiaries without cause. Furthermore, the principals have certain consent rights with respect to structural changes involving our company. In addition, our principals are entitled to a majority of our economic returns through their holdings of Fortress Operating Group units. Because they hold their economic interest in our business directly through Fortress Operating Group, rather than through the public company, our principals may have conflicting interests with holders of Class A shares. For example, our principals may have different tax positions from us which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when to dispose of assets, and whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the tax receivable agreement. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration the principals’ tax considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to us. Moreover, any distribution by the Fortress Operating Group to us to satisfy our tax obligations will result in a corresponding pro rata distribution to o ur principals. We intend to pay regular dividends but our ability to do so may be limited by our holding company structure; we are dependent on distributions from the Fortress Operating Group to pay dividends, taxes and other expenses. Our ability to pay dividends is also subject to not defaulting on our credit agreement. As a holding company, our ability to pay dividends is subject to the ability of our subsidiaries to provide cash to us. We intend to distribute quarterly dividends to our Class A shareholders. Accordingly, we expect to cause the Fortress Operating Group to make distributions to its unitholders, including our wholly-owned subsidiaries, pro rata in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay such dividends to our Class A shareholders; however, no assurance can be given that such distributions will or can be made. Our board can reduce or eliminate our dividend at any time, in its discretion. In addition, Fortress Operating Group is required to make minimum tax distributions to its unitholders. See also ‘‘— Risks Related to Taxation — There can be no assurance that amounts paid as dividends on Class A shares will be sufficient to cover the tax liability arising from ownership of Class A shares.’’ If Fortress Operating Group has insuf ficient funds, we may have to borrow additional funds or sell assets, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. In addition, Fortress Operating Group’s earnings may be insufficient to enable it to make required minimum tax distributions to unitholders. We are also subject to certain contingent repayment obligations that may affect our ability to pay dividends. We earn incentive income — generally 20% of the profits — from each of our private equity funds based on a percentage of the profits earned by the fund as a whole, provided that the fund achieves specified performance criteria. We generally receive, however, our percentage share of the profits on each investment in the fund as it is realized, before it is known with certainty that the fund as a whole will meet the specified criteria. As a result, the incentive income paid to us as a particular investment made by the funds is realized is subject to contingent repayment (or ‘‘clawback’’) if, upon liquidation of the fund, the aggregate amount paid to us as incentive income exceeds the amount actually due to us based upon the aggregate performance of the fund. If we are required to repay amounts to a fund in order to satisfy a clawback obligation, any such repayment will reduce the amount of cash available to distribute as a dividend to our Class A shareholders. 28 Table of Contents Moreover, we intend to distribute a portion of the incentive income that we receive as quarterly dividend payments to our Class A shareholders. Once we distribute such funds, we have no ability to recall the funds from our Class A shareholders and would, thus, be required to satisfy any subsequent clawback obligation using other sources. While the principals have personally guaranteed, subject to certain limitations, this ‘‘clawback’’ obligation, our shareholders agreement with them contains our agreement to indemnify the principals for all amounts which the principals pay pursuant to any of these personal guaranties in favor of our private equity funds. Consequently, any requirement to satisfy a clawback obligation could impair our ability to pay dividends on our Class A shares. There may also be circumstances under which we are restricted from paying dividends under applicable law or regulation (for example due to Delaware limited partnership or limited liability company act limitations on making distributions if liabilities of the entity after the distribution would exceed the value of the entity’s assets). In addition, under our credit agreement, we are permitted to make cash distributions subject to the following restrictions: (a) no event of default exists immediately prior to or subsequent to the distribution, (b) the amount of distributions over the prior 12 months do not exceed free cash flow (as defined in our credit agreement as net income plus (i) taxes, depreciation and private equity incentive income presented on an as-received basis less (ii) capital expenditures, permitted tax distributions and certain other adjustments) for the prior 12 month period, and (c) after giving effect to the distribution, we have cash on hand of not less than accrued but unpaid taxes (based on estimated entity level taxes due and payable by the Fortress Operating Group entities, primarily New York City unincorporated business tax) and amortization obligations (including scheduled principal payments) under the credit agreement which are required in the next 90 days. The events of default under the credit agreement are typical of such agreements and include payment defaults, failure to comply with credit agreement covenants, cross-defaults to material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency, change of control, and adverse events with respect to our material funds. Our lenders may also attempt to exercise their security interests over substantially all of the assets of the Fortress Operating Group upon the occurrence of an event of default. The cash reflected on our historical balance sheets for 2006 and earlier periods, which consolidates many of our funds, is not our cash and is not available to us; we depend on the cash we receive from the Fortress Operating Group. Our historical combined financial information for 2006 and earlier periods includes significant balances of cash and restricted cash held at consolidated funds as assets on our balance sheet. Although the cash and other assets of certain Fortress Funds have historically been included in our assets on a consolidated basis for financial reporting purposes, such cash is not available to us to pay dividends or for other liquidity needs but rather is property of the relevant fund. Following changes to our fund documents that became effective on March 31, 2007, these funds are no longer consolidated, and such cash amounts are no longer included in our balance sheet assets. We depend on distributions from the Fortress Operating Group for cash. Although the Fortress Operating Group may borrow under our credit facility, it depends primarily on the management fees and incentive income it receives from the Fortress Funds and its portion of the distributions made by the Fortress Funds, if any, for cash. Tax consequences to the principals may give rise to conflicts of interests. As a result of unrealized built-in gain attributable to the value of our assets held by the Fortress Operating Group entities at the time of our initial public offering, upon the sale or, refinancing or disposition of the assets owned by the Fortress Operating Group entities, our principals will incur different and significantly greater tax liabilities as a result of the disproportionately greater allocations of items of taxable income and gain to the principals upon a realization event. As the principals will not receive a corresponding greater distribution of cash proceeds, they may, subject to applicable fiduciary or contractual duties, have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing, timing and other material terms of any sale, refinancing, or disposition, or whether to sell such assets at all. Decisions made with respect to an acceleration or deferral of income or the sale or disposition of assets may also influence the timing and amount of paym ents that are received by an exchanging or 29 Table of Contents selling principal under the tax receivable agreement. All other factors being equal, earlier disposition of assets following a transaction will tend to accelerate such payments and increase the present value of the tax receivable agreement, and disposition of assets before a transaction will increase a principal’s tax liability without giving rise to any rights to receive payments under the tax receivable agreement. Decisions made regarding a change of control also could have a material influence on the timing and amount of payments received by the principals pursuant to the tax receivable agreement. We are required to pay our principals for most of the tax benefits we realize as a result of the tax basis step-up we receive in connection with taxable exchanges by our principals of units held in the Fortress Operating Group entities or our acquisitions of units from our principals. At any time and from time to time, each principal has the right to exchange his Fortress Operating Group units for our Class A shares in a taxable transaction. These taxable exchanges, as well as our acquisitions of units from our principals, may result in increases in the tax depreciation and amortization deductions, as well as an increase in the tax basis of other assets, of the Fortress Operating Group that otherwise would not have been available. These increases in tax depreciation and amortization deductions, as well as the tax basis of other assets, may reduce the amount of tax that FIG Corp. or FIG Asset Co. LLC and any other corporate taxpayers would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the IRS may challenge all or part of increased deductions and tax basis increase, and a court could sustain such a challenge. We have entered into a tax receivable agreement with our principals that provides for the payment by the corporate taxpayers to our principals of 85% of the amount of tax savings, if any, that the corporate taxpayers actually realize (or are deemed to realize in the case of an early termination payment by the corporate taxpayers or a change of control, as discussed below) as a result of these increases in tax deductions and tax basis of the Fortress Operating Group. The payments that the corporate taxpayers may make to our principals could be material in amount. Although we are not aware of any issue that would cause the IRS to challenge a tax basis increase, our principals will not reimburse the corporate taxpayers for any payments that have been previously made under the tax receivable agreement. As a result, in certain circumstances, payments could be made to our principals under the tax receivable agreement in excess of the corporate taxpayers’ cash tax savings. The corporate taxpayers’ ability to achieve benefits from any tax basis increase, and the payments to be made under this agreement, will depend upon a number of factors, including the timing and amount of our future income. In addition, the tax receivable agreement provides that, upon a merger, asset sale or other form of business combination or certain other changes of control, the corporate taxpayers’ (or their successors’) obligations with respect to exchanged or acquired units (whether exchanged or acquired before or after such change of control) would be based on certain assumptions, including that the corporate taxpayers would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement. If we were deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business and the price of our Class A shares. We do not believe that we are an ‘‘investment company’’ under the Investment Company Act of 1940 because the nature of our assets and the sources of our income exclude us from the definition of an investment company pursuant to Rule 3a-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940. In addition, we believe the company is not an investment company under Section 3(b)(1) of the Investment Company Act because it is primarily engaged in a non-investment company business. If one or more of the Fortress Operating Group entities ceased to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, our interests in those subsidiaries could be deemed an ‘‘investment security’’ for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Generally, a person is an ‘‘investment company’’ if it owns investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of 30 Table of Contents U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. However, if we were to be deemed an investment company, restrictions imposed by the Investment Company Act of 1940, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and would have a material adverse effect on our business and the price of our Class A shares. Risks Related To Our Class A Shares An active market for our Class A shares may not be sustained. Our Class A shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ‘‘FIG.’’ However, we cannot provide any assurance that a regular trading market of our Class A shares will be sustained on that exchange or elsewhere. Accordingly, we cannot provide any assurance of the liquidity of any trading market, holders’ ability to sell their Class A shares when desired, or at all, or the prices that they may obtain for their Class A shares. The market price and trading volume of our Class A shares may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our shareholders. The market price of our Class A shares may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in our Class A shares may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their Class A shares and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our Class A shares. If the market price of our Class A shares declines significantly, holders may be unable to resell their Class A shares at or above their purchase price, if at all. We cannot provide any assurance that the market price of our Class A shares will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our Class A shares or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our Class A shares include: • variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends; • failure to meet analysts’ earnings estimates or failure to meet, or the lowering of, our own earnings guidance; • publication of research reports about us or the investment management industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our Class A shares; • additions or departures of our principals and other key management personnel; • adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future; • actions by shareholders; • changes in market valuations of similar companies; • speculation in the press or investment community; • changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations thereof affecting our business or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters; • litigation or governmental investigations; • fluctuations in the performance or share price of other alternative asset managers; • adverse publicity about the asset management industry generally or individual scandals, specifically; and • general market and economic conditions. In addition, when the market price of a stock has been volatile in the past, holders of that stock have, at times, instituted securities class action litigation against the issuer of the stock. If any of our 31 Table of Contents shareholders brought a lawsuit against us, we may be required to incur substantial costs defending any such suit, even those without merit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business and lower our Class A share price. Our Class A share price may decline due to the large number of shares eligible for future sale and for exchange into Class A shares. The market price of our Class A shares could decline as a result of sales of a large number of our Class A shares or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. As of December 31, 2007, we had 406,571,900 outstanding Class A shares on a fully diluted basis, 52,534,503 restricted Class A share units granted to employees (net of forfeitures) and 97,296 restricted Class A shares granted to directors pursuant to our equity incentive plan, and 62,368,201 Class A shares and Fortress Operating Group units that remain available for future grant under our equity incentive plan. Beginning in 2008, the Class A shares reserved under our equity incentive plan will be increased on the first day of each fiscal year during the plan’s term by the lesser of (x) the excess of (i) 15% of the number of outstanding Class A and Class B shares of the company on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year over (ii) the number of shares reserved and available for issuance under our equity incentive plan as of such date or (y) 60,000,000 shares. We may issue and sell in the future additional Class A shares or any securities issuable upon conversion of, or exchange or exercise for, Class A shares (including Fortress Operating Group units) at any time. Our principals own an aggregate of 312,071,550 Fortress Operating Group units. Each principal has the right to exchange each of his Fortress Operating Group units for one of our Class A shares at any time, subject to the Principals Agreement. These Class A shares and Fortress Operating Group units are eligible for resale from time to time, subject to certain contractual restrictions and Securities Act limitations. Our principals and Nomura are parties to shareholders agreements with us. The principals have the ability to cause us to register the Class A shares they acquire upon exchange for their Fortress Operating Group units. Nomura has the ability to cause us to register any of its 55,071,450 Class A shares. Our principals’ beneficial ownership of Class B shares and anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control. Our principals beneficially own all of our Class B shares. The principals’ Class B shares will represent a majority of the total combined voting power of our outstanding Class A and Class B shares. As a result, if they vote all of their shares in the same manner, they will be able to exercise control over all matters requiring the approval of shareholders and will be able to prevent a change in control of our company. In addition, provisions in our operating agreement may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our shareholders. For example, our operating agreement provides for a staggered board, requires advance notice for proposals by shareholders and nominations, places limitations on convening shareholder meetings, and authorizes the issuance of preferred shares that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt. In addit ion, certain provisions of Delaware law may delay or prevent a transaction that could cause a change in our control. The market price of our Class A shares could be adversely affected to the extent that our principals’ control over us, as well as provisions of our operating agreement, discourage potential takeover attempts that our shareholders may favor. There are certain provisions in our operating agreement regarding exculpation and indemnification of our officers and directors that differ from the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) in a manner that may be less protective of the interests of our Class A shareholders. Our operating agreement provides that to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law our directors or officers will not be liable to us. However, under the DGCL, a director or officer would be 32 Table of Contents liable to us for (i) breach of duty of loyalty to us or our shareholders, (ii) intentional misconduct or knowing violations of the law that are not done in good faith, (iii) improper redemption of shares or declaration of dividend, or (iv) a transaction from which the director or officer derived an improper personal benefit. In addition, our operating agreement provides that we indemnify our directors and officers for acts or omissions to the fullest extent provided by law. However, under the DGCL, a corporation can only indemnify directors and officers for acts or omissions if the director or officer acted in good faith, in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation, and, in a criminal action, if the officer or director had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. Accordingly, our operating agreement may be less protective of the interests of our Class A shareholders, when compared to the DGCL, insofar as it relates to the exculpation and indemnification o f our officers and directors. Risks Related to Taxation Class A shareholders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on their share of our taxable income, regardless of whether they receive any cash dividends from us. So long as we are not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and 90% of our gross income for each taxable year constitutes ‘‘qualifying income’’ within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’), on a continuing basis, we will be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as a partnership and not as an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation. Class A shareholders may be subject to U.S. federal, state, local and possibly, in some cases, foreign income taxation on their allocable share of our items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit (including our allocable share of those items of any entity in which we invest that is treated as a partnership or is otherwise subject to tax on a flow through basis) for each of our taxable years ending with or within their taxable year, regardless of whether or no t they receive cash dividends from us. They may not receive cash dividends equal to their allocable share of our net taxable income or even the tax liability that results from that income. In addition, certain of our holdings, including holdings, if any, in a Controlled Foreign Corporation (‘‘CFC’’) and a Passive Foreign Investment Company (‘‘PFIC’’), may produce taxable income prior to the receipt of cash relating to such income, and holders of our Class A shares will be required to take such income into account in determining their taxable income. Under our operating agreement, in the event of an inadvertent partnership termination in which the Internal Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’) has granted us limited relief, each holder of our Class A shares also is obligated to make such adjustments as are required by the IRS to maintain our status as a partnership. Such adjustments may require persons who hold our Class A shares to recognize additio nal amounts in income during the years in which they hold such shares. We may also be required to make payments to the IRS. Our intermediate holding company, FIG Corp., is subject to corporate income taxation in the United States, and we may be subject to additional taxation in the future. A significant portion of our investments and activities may be made or conducted through FIG Corp. Dividends paid by FIG Corp. from time to time will, as is usual in the case of a U.S. corporation, then be included in our income. Income received as a result of investments made or activities conducted through FIG Asset Co. LLC (but excluding through its taxable corporate affiliates) is not subject to corporate income taxation in our structure, but we cannot provide any assurance that it will not become subject to additional taxation in the future, which would negatively impact our results of operations. There can be no assurance that amounts paid as dividends on Class A shares will be sufficient to cover the tax liability arising from ownership of Class A shares. Any dividends paid on Class A shares will not take into account a shareholder’s particular tax situation (including the possible application of the alternative minimum tax) and, therefore, because of the foregoing as well as other possible reasons, may not be sufficient to pay their full amount of tax 33 Table of Contents based upon their share of our net taxable income. In addition, the actual amount and timing of dividends will always be subject to the discretion of our board of directors and we cannot provide any assurance that we will in fact pay cash dividends as currently intended. In particular, the amount and timing of dividends will depend upon a number of factors, including, among others: • our actual results of operations and financial condition; • restrictions imposed by our operating agreement or applicable law; • restrictions imposed by our credit agreements; • reinvestment of our capital; • the timing of the investment of our capital; • the amount of cash that is generated by our investments or to fund liquidity needs; • levels of operating and other expenses; • contingent liabilities; or • factors that our board of directors deems relevant. Even if we do not distribute cash in an amount that is sufficient to fund a shareholder’s tax liabilities, they will still be required to pay income taxes on their share of our taxable income. Tax gain or loss on disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected. If a Class A shareholder sells common units, such shareholder will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the adjusted tax basis in those common units. Prior distributions to such common shareholder in excess of the total net taxable income allocated to such shareholder, which decreased the tax basis in its common units, will increase the gain recognized upon a sale when the common units are sold at a price greater than such shareholder’s tax basis in those common units, even if the price is less than the original cost. A portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may be ordinary income to such shareholder. We currently do not intend to make an election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code to adjust our asset basis, so a holder of common units could be allocated more taxable income in respect of those common units prior to disposition than if such an election were made. We currently do not intend to make an election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code to adjust our asset basis. If no Section 754 election is made, there will generally be no adjustment to the basis of our assets in connection with our initial public offering, or upon a subsequent transferee’s acquisition of common units from a prior holder of such common units, even if the purchase price for those interests or units, as applicable, is greater than the share of the aggregate tax basis of our assets attributable to those interests or units immediately prior to the acquisition. Consequently, upon our sale of an asset, gain allocable to a holder of common units could include built-in gain in the asset existing at the time such holder acquired such units, which built-in gain would otherwise generally be eliminated if a Section 754 election had been made. If we are treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the value of the Class A shares would be adversely affected. We have not requested, and do not plan to request, a ruling from the IRS on our treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or on any other matter affecting us. As of the date of the consummation of our initial public offering, under then current law and assuming full compliance with the terms of our operating agreement (and other relevant documents) and based upon factual statements and representations made by us, our outside counsel opined, as of that date, that we would be treated as a partnership, and not as an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, opinions of counsel are not binding upon the IRS or any court, and the IRS may challenge this conclusion and a court may 34 Table of Contents sustain such a challenge. The factual representations made by us upon which our outside counsel relied related to our organization, operation, assets, activities, income, and present and future conduct of our operations. In general, if an entity that would otherwise be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is a ‘‘publicly traded partnership’’ (as defined in the Code) it will be nonetheless treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, unless the exception described below, and upon which we intend to rely, applies. A publicly traded partnership will, however, be treated as a partnership, and not as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, so long as 90% or more of its gross income for each taxable year constitutes ‘‘qualifying income’’ within the meaning of the Code and it is not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. We refer to this exception as the &ls quo;‘qualifying income exception.’’ Qualifying income generally includes dividends, interest, capital gains from the sale or other disposition of stocks and securities and certain other forms of investment income. We expect that our income generally will consist of interest, dividends, capital gains and other types of qualifying income, including dividends from FIG Corp. and interest on indebtedness from FIG Corp. No assurance can be given as to the types of income that will be earned in any given year. If we fail to satisfy the qualifying income exception described above, items of income and deduction would not pass through to holders of the Class A shares and holders of the Class A shares would be treated for U.S. federal (and certain state and local) income tax purposes as shareholders in a corporation. In such a case, we would be required to pay income tax at regular corporate rates on all of our income. In addition, we would likely be liable for state and local income and/or franchise taxes o n all of such income. Dividends to holders of the Class A shares would constitute ordinary dividend income taxable to such holders to the extent of our earnings and profits, and the payment of these dividends would not be deductible by us. Taxation of us as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation could result in a material adverse effect on our cash flow and the after-tax returns for holders of Class A shares and thus could result in a substantial reduction in the value of the Class A shares. Our structure involves complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. Our structure also is subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis. The U.S. federal income tax treatment of holders of the Class A shares depends in some instances on determinations of fact and interpretations of complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. Readers should be aware that the U.S. federal income tax rules are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS, and the U.S. Treasury Department, frequently resulting in revised interpretations of established concepts, statutory changes, revisions to regulations and other modifications and interpretations. The IRS pays close attention to the proper application of tax laws to partnerships. The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of an investment in the Class A shares may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial interpretation at any time, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such action may affect investments and commitments previously made. For example , changes to the U.S. federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could make it more difficult or impossible to meet the qualifying income exception for us to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is not taxable as a corporation, affect or cause us to change our investments and commitments, change the character or treatment of portions of our income (including, for instance, treating carried interest as ordinary fee income rather than capital gain) affect the tax considerations of an investment in us and adversely affect an investment in our Class A shares. Our organizational documents and agreements permit the board of directors to modify our operating agreement from time to time, without the consent of the holders of Class A shares, in order to address certain changes in U.S. federal income tax regulations, legislation or interpretation. In some circumstances, such revisions could have a material adverse impact on some or all of the holders of our Class A shares. Moreover, we will apply certain assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with applicable rules and to report income, gain, deduction, loss and credit to holders in a manner that reflects such holders’ beneficial ownership of partnership items, taking into account variation in ownership interests during each taxable year because of trading activity. However, these 35 Table of Contents assumptions and conventions may not be in compliance with all aspects of applicable tax requirements. It is possible that the IRS will assert successfully that the conventions and assumptions used by us do not satisfy the technical requirements of the Code and/or Treasury regulations and could require that items of income, gain, deductions, loss or credit, including interest deductions, be adjusted, reallocated, or disallowed, in a manner that adversely affects holders of the Class A shares. Legislation has been introduced that would, if enacted, preclude us from qualifying for treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the publicly traded partnership rules. Our structure also is subject to potential judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis. On June 14, 2007, legislation was introduced in the Senate that would tax as corporations publicly traded partnerships that directly or indirectly derive income from investment adviser or asset management services. In addition, the Chairman and the Ranking Republican Member of the Senate Committee on Finance concurrently issued a press release stating that they do not believe that proposed public offerings of private equity and hedge fund management firms are consistent with the intent of the existing rules regarding publicly traded partnerships because the majority of their income is from the active provision of services to investment funds and limited partner investors in such funds. As explained in the technical explanation accompanying the proposed legislation: Under the bill, the exception from corporate treatment for a publicly traded partnership does not apply to any partnership that, directly or indirectly, has any item of income or gain (including capital gains or dividends), the rights to which are derived from services provided by any person as an investment adviser, as defined in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or as a person associated with an investment adviser, as defined in that Act. Further, the exception from corporate treatment does not apply to a partnership that, directly or indirectly, has any item of income or gain (including capital gains or dividends), the rights to which are derived from asset management services provided by an investment adviser, a person associated with an investment adviser, or any person related to either, in connection with the management of assets with respect to which investment adviser services were provided. If enacted in its proposed form, the transition rules of the proposed legislation would delay the application of these rules for five years. Legislation also has been introduced that is substantially similar to the proposed legislation introduced in the Senate that would apply the legislation to us with respect to our 2008 taxable year. In addition, legislation has been introduced in the House, and passed by the House Ways and Means Committee, that would have the effect of treating income recognized from ‘‘carried interests’’ as ordinary fee income, thereby effectively causing such income to be treated as nonqualifying income under the publicly traded partnership rules, which would preclude us qualifying for treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The proposal did not discuss transition relief. If any version of these legislative proposals were to be enacted into law, or if other similar legislation were to be enacted or any other change in the tax laws, rules, regulations or interpretations were to preclude us from qualifying for treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the publicly traded partnership rules, holders would be negatively impacted because we would incur a material increase in our tax liability as a public company from the date any such changes became applicable to us, which could result in a reduction in the value of our Class A shares. We cannot match transferors and transferees of common units, and we have therefore adopted certain income tax accounting positions that may not conform with all aspects of applicable tax requirements. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of our common units. Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units, we have adopted depreciation, amortization and other tax accounting positions that may not conform with all aspects of existing Treasury regulations. A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to our common unitholders. It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain on the sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audits of and adjustments to our common unitholders’ tax returns. 36 Table of Contents The sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profit interests will result in the termination of our partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We will be considered to have been terminated for U.S. federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a 12-month period. Our termination would, among other things, result in the closing of our taxable year for all common unitholders and could result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income. FIG Asset Co. LLC may not be able to invest in certain assets, other than through a taxable corporation. In certain circumstances, FIG Asset Co. LLC or one of its subsidiaries may have an opportunity to invest in certain assets through an entity that is characterized as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, where the income of such entity may not be ‘‘qualifying income’’ for purposes of the publicly traded partnership rules. In order to manage our affairs so that we will meet the qualifying income exception, we may either refrain from investing in such entities or, alternatively, we may structure our investment through an entity classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the entity were a U.S. corporation, it would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its operating income, including any gain recognized on its disposal of its interest in the entity in which the opportunistic investment has been made, as the case may be, and such income taxes would reduce the return on that investment. Complying with certain tax-related requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive business or investment opportunities or enter into acquisitions, borrowings, financings or arrangements we may not have otherwise entered into. In order for us to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and not as an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation, we must meet the qualifying income exception discussed above on a continuing basis and we must not be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. In order to effect such treatment we (or our subsidiaries) may be required to invest through foreign or domestic corporations, forego attractive business or investment opportunities or enter into borrowings or financings we may not have otherwise entered into. This may adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize our cash flow. Our structure also may impede our ability to engage in certain corporate acquisitive transactions because we generally intend to hold all of our assets through the Fortress Operating Group. In addition, we may be unable to participate in certain corporate reorganization tra nsactions that would be tax free to our holders if we were a corporation. To the extent we hold assets other than through the Fortress Operating Group, we will make appropriate adjustments to the Fortress Operating Group agreements so that distributions to principals and us would be the same as if such assets were held at that level. The IRS could assert that we are engaged in a U.S. trade or business, with the result that some portion of our income is properly treated as effectively connected income with respect to non-U.S. holders. Moreover, certain REIT dividends and other stock gains may be treated as effectively connected income with respect to non-U.S. holders. While we expect that our method of operation will not result in a determination that we are engaged in a U.S. trade or business, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert successfully that we are engaged in a U.S. trade or business, with the result that some portion of our income is properly treated as effectively connected income with respect to non-U.S. holders. Moreover, dividends paid by an investment that we make in a REIT that is attributable to gains from the sale of U.S. real property interests will, and sales of certain investments in the stock of U.S. corporations owning significant U.S. real property may, be treated as effectively connected income with respect to non-U.S. holders. To the extent our income is treated as effectively connected income, non-U.S. holders generally would be subject to withholding tax on their allocable shares of such income, would be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return for such year reporting their 37 Table of Contents allocable shares of income effectively connected with such trade or business, and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular U.S. tax rates on any such income. Non-U.S. holders may also be subject to a 30% branch profits tax on such income in the hands of non-U.S. holders that are corporations. An investment in Class A shares will give rise to UBTI to certain tax-exempt holders. We will not make investments through taxable U.S. corporations solely for the purpose of limiting unrelated business taxable income, or UBTI, from ‘‘debt-financed’’ property and, thus, an investment in Class A shares will give rise to UBTI to certain tax-exempt holders. For example, FIG Asset Co. LLC will invest in or hold interests in entities that are treated as partnerships, or are otherwise subject to tax on a flow-through basis, that will incur indebtedness. FIG Asset Co. LLC may borrow funds from FIG Corp. or third parties from time to time to make investments. These investments will give rise to UBTI from ‘‘debt-financed’’ property. However, we expect to manage our activities to avoid a determination that we are engaged in a trade or business, thereby limiting the amount of UBTI that is realized by tax-exempt holders of our Class A shares. We may hold or acquire certain investments through an entity classified as a PFIC or CFC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Certain of our investments may be in foreign corporations or may be acquired through a foreign subsidiary that would be classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such an entity may be a PFIC or a CFC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. holders of Class A shares indirectly owning an interest in a PFIC or a CFC may experience adverse U.S. tax consequences. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments We have no unresolved staff comments.
