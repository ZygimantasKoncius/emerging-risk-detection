Risk factors Chapter 10 The decision announced on 6 December 2005 to exit the logistics business has affected the potential scope of our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. It is possible that the logistics division will not be sold prior to the 31 December 2006. The announced sale of any business brings uncertainty and could negatively affect the resources dedicated to the implementation of Section 404 compliance. While we have dedicated a significant amount of time and resources to ensuring compliance, there can be no assurance that we or our auditors will complete the necessary work to comply with all aspects of Section 404 and related regulations in a timely manner. Although we have not to date identified any control deficiencies that could be classified as a material weakness, we have identified some significant deficiencies in areas such as our entity-level control framework and US GAAP knowledge in our local business entities, financial reporting on tax, and the use of electronic templates. These are described in chapter 7. Weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, may cause us to be unable to prevent or detect material misstatements in a timely manner. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting identifies material weaknesses that must be disclosed, we may receive an attestation with an adverse opinion from our auditors as to the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting. Furthermore, potential acquisitions of businesses that are currently not in compliance with Section 404 requirements could lead to disclosures on currently unforeseen deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. This could adversely affect our reputation and our financial results. Each of these consequences could reduce the markets confidence in our financial statements and negatively affect the price of our shares. There are numerous risks associated with our sale of our discontinued non-network logistics business (the discontinued logistics business). On 6 December 2005, we announced our intention to dispose of our non-network logistics business. There are numerous risks associated with this disposal. All of these may negatively affect our business and financial results. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL THE DISCONTINUED LOGISTICS BUSINESS OR THE PROCESS MAY BE DELAYED. Our decision to focus our strategy on networks requires us to achieve a quick and effective disposal of the discontinued logistics business. We may, however, be unable to effect a timely disposal as a result of an inability to come to commercially acceptable terms with an interested buyer or discussion with work councils. We may have difficulties effecting a disposal as a result of change of control provisions in various customer contracts and joint venture agreements. If we do not complete the sale in a timely manner, we could face difficulties regarding employee retention and relations, business continuity, investment decisions and the generation of new business within logistics, restrictions on our ability to invest in the remaining business and compliance issues regarding Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The discontinued logistics business currently operates at a net loss; if the sale is delayed, it is likely we will continue to experience losses related to our continued operation of the discontinued logistics business until the sale is completed. WE MAY BE FORCED TO RETAIN CERTAIN LIABILITIES, OR THEY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMMERCIAL TERMS OF THE DISPOSAL. The discontinued logistics business has liabilities including a €222 million syndicated facility, a put option granted to a minority shareholder, Ecotrans, and provisions for pensions and other employee benefits. All of these factors may make it difficult to dispose of the business. Even if the discontinued logistics business is successfully sold, some or all of these liabilities may not be entirely transferable to the buyer, or may negatively impact the terms of the disposal. THE SALE OF THE DISCONTINUED LOGISTICS BUSINESS MIGHT ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN KEY MANAGEMENT, PERSONNEL AND CUSTOMERS. The announcement and consummation of the proposed sale of our discontinued logistics business may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key management and personnel for the discontinued logistics business. The sale of the discontinued logistics business may result in a loss of customers not only in the discontinued logistics business, but also certain customers of our mail and express divisions who used these services as a result of our ability to provide a global solution. The sale may cause our existing customers to terminate or modify their relationships with us and may make it more difficult to attract new customer relationships. These difficulties include those that may result from potential negative reputational effects from the sale. WE MAY INCUR A FINANCIAL LOSS ON THE SALE OF THE DISCONTINUED LOGISTICS BUSINESS. We may not be able to sell the discontinued logistics business for a purchase price that reflects the book value of the discontinued logistics business, which would result in a loss. We expect to incur significant costs related to the sale of our discontinued logistics business. These expenses include financial advisory, legal and accounting fees and expenses, employee expenses, filing fees, printing expenses and other related charges. We may also incur additional unanticipated expenses in connection with the sale transactions. A portion of the costs related to the sale, such as legal, financial advisory and accounting fees, will be incurred regardless of whether it is completed. These expenditures will decrease the remaining cash available for eventual distribution to shareholders or for use in connection with any future strategic deployment. 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 91 Back to Contents 92 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Chapter 11 OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 93 Back to Contents Chapter 11 Other financial information on the company This chapter provides some other financial information on the company, in addition to the information set out in chapter 12, in particular with regard to cash flow, liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies. Until 2004, we prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with Dutch GAAP. As of 2005, all European listed companies are required to prepare their consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. For TNT, there are no differences between the IFRS as adopted by the European Union and the IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. As a result our 2005 consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and the comparative 2004 numbers have been adjusted. A detailed explanation of the transition to IFRS and the impact on our financial numbers is given in chapter 12. On 6 December 2005, we announced a strategy to focus on providing delivery services by expertly managing networks, in particular transportation, resulting in the decision to dispose of our non-network related logistics activities. Accordingly our logistics business is reported as discontinued operations/ assets held for sale. In our balance sheet as at 31 December 2005 we have grouped together all assets and liabilities relating to our discontinued logistics business. As prescribed by IFRS 5, Non current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, our 31 December 2004 balance sheet has not been adjusted. In our statement of income for 2005, we have presented the net result of our discontinued logistics business on a separate line. Our 2004 statement of income has been adjusted for comparable purposes. Our 2005 and 2004 cash flow statements include cash flows and cash balances of our continuing operations.

Profit before income taxes contributed €1,151 million, or €1,471 million if adjusted for the non-cash impact of depreciation, amortisation and impairments, an increase of €72 million or 5% compared to 2004 (€1,399 million). The changes in pension liabilities of €123 million reflect the total non-cash charges for the defined benefit pension schemes of €141 million, offset by our total cash contributions of €166 million to various pension funds, the majority of which for our Dutch employees, who fall under our collective labour agreement, plus our cash contributions of €98 million for pensions, which fall under the transitional plan of our Dutch collective labour agreement and which are directly paid by TNT (see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements). In total the cash contributions are €168 million lower than last year, mainly due to contributions of €142 million related to the Personal Senior Arrangement in 2004 and due to €32 million lower contributions as prescribed by the minimum funding requirements of De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), which amounted to €59 million in 2005. The non-cash impact of €52 million from other provisions included provisions related to employee benefits mainly in express, provisions taken for the uninsured part of the damage caused by major fires in three different warehouses in the United States, Spain and the United Kingdom, increased provisions for employer liability in the United Kingdom and reorganisation provisions, mainly in mail. Working capital increased by €180 million in 2005, compared to a decrease of €21 million in 2004. Most of the increase of the accounts receivable position related to an increase of trade receivables that moved unfavourably by €165 million due to a combination of additional revenue and increased debtor days. Trade payables negatively impacted the cash flow by €77 million as a result of a decrease of creditor days compared to last year. Other current liabilities moved favourably by €66 million, including higher accruals for subcontractors and claims. Interest and similar expenses amounted to €121 million, including non-cash hedge results of €21 million. The cash outflow for interest paid totalled €84 million. Income taxes paid was €130 million. The net amount of income taxes paid included €162 million repayments by the Dutch tax authority of taxes over previous years after it was concluded that preliminary payments were too high and due to a decrease of the Dutch statutory tax rate from 34.5% in 2004 to 31.5% in 2005. 2004 In 2004, net cash provided by operating activities was €708 million. Profit before income taxes contributed €1,096 million, or €1,399 million if adjusted for the non-cash impact of depreciation, amortisation and impairments. The changes in pension liabilities of €254 million reflect the total non-cash charges for the defined benefit pension schemes of €91 million, the non-cash costs related to the Personal Senior Arrangement of €87 million and total cash payments of €432 million. Cash contributions to various pension funds, the majority of which are for our Dutch employees who fall under our collective labour agreement, and the pension plan payments, which fall under the transitional plan, totalled €290 million, of which €91 million was contributed as prescribed by the minimum funding requirements of DNB. The remaining cash contribution of €142 million related to the Personal Senior Arrangement. The non-cash impact of €13 million from other provisions was primarily the result of additions, which were partly offset by releases and withdrawals. Working capital decreased by €21 million in 2004. The favourable movements of inventory, other current assets, trade payables and other current liabilities were partly offset by an increase of accounts receivable, due to an increase of trade receivables of €77 million. The cash outflow for interest paid totalled €87 million and income taxes paid was €404 million. 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 95 Back to Contents Chapter 11 Other financial information on the company NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES Net cash used for acquisitions and disposals 2005 In 2005, the total payments for acquisitions of group companies amounted to €36 million and no cash was acquired as part of the total acquisitions.

Express acquired for a total amount of €6 million, mainly related to Door-to-Door d.o.o. and Asinus d.o.o. and the remaining share of our business in Israel. During 2005 all proceeds or payments related to acquisitions were in cash. The investments in associated companies primarily related to additional capital contributions in one of our associates and amounted to €13 million. During 2005, we disposed our interest in Global Collect B.V. for a negative amount of €5 million, which consists of the total consideration received of €4 million and €9 million cash that was divested with the disposal. During 2005 all proceeds or payments related to disposals were in cash. The disposal of associated companies related to disposal of Postal Preference Service Limited in the mail segment and Mistral Air in the express segment. 2004 In 2004, we acquired group and associated companies for a total amount of €196 million, which consisted of total amounts paid of €206 million and €10 million cash acquired. The payments were primarily attributable to the acquisition of Wilson (€190 million). We also made several smaller acquisitions in our mail division for an amount of €14 million, including the remaining shares of Höfinger GmbH and the establishment of the joint venture Cendris BSC Customer Contact B.V., and in our express division for an amount of €2 million. During 2004 all proceeds or payments related to acquisitions were in cash.

In 2004 interest received amounted to €33 million and no dividends were received. NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES Net cash used for dividends and other changes in shareholders equity 2005 A final cash dividend for 2004, amounting to €168 million or €0.37 per ordinary share and a cash interim dividend for 2005 of €100 million or €0.22 per ordinary share were paid in 2005. The proposed final dividend for 2005 is estimated to result in an aggregate €172 million payment to be made in the second quarter of 2006. In 2005, a cash outflow of €259 million was included as consideration for the repurchase of 13.1 million shares from the State of the Netherlands. These shares were delivered by the State of the Netherlands as a result of a purchase agreement signed in September 2004. Under our share buy back programme announced on 6 December 2005 we purchased 9,020,000 of our ordinary shares for an amount of €231million. As at 31 December 2005, we paid €214 million relating to 8,372,000 shares with the remainder of the amount being paid in January 2006. An amount of €16 million was received as a result of the exercise of options and share grants. In 2005 the net cash flow used in financing our discontinued logistics business amounted to €28 million. 2004 A final cash dividend for 2003, amounting to €142 million, and a cash interim dividend for 2004 of €95 million were paid in 2004. The final dividend for 2004 of €0.37 per share resulted in an aggregate €168 million payment made in April 2005. In 2004, €151 million was paid as consideration for the repurchase of 7.6 million shares from the State of the Netherlands. An amount of €3 million was received as a result of the exercise of options and share grants. In 2004 the net cash flow provided by financing our discontinued logistics business amounted to €211 million. Net cash from debt financing activities 2005 Movements in long term borrowings resulted in a net cash inflow of €29 million. The total proceeds from long term borrowing of €35 million consist mainly of a €14 million additional issuance of the 3.875% 2015 Eurobond, a €13 million increase in bank loans, and a €7 million income from finance leases. A total of €6 million of repayments to long term borrowings related, amongst others, to a €4 million scheduled payment on aircraft leases and other leases, and to a €2 million repayment of bank loans. Movements in short term liabilities resulted in a net cash outflow of €55 million. The total repayments to short term borrowings mainly related to repayments on aircraft leases and other leases of €47 million and to a cash outflow of €20 million regarding hedge transactions, partly offset by a cash inflow relating to short term liabilities of €14 million. 2004 Movements in long term borrowings resulted in a net cash outflow of €62 million. The acquired long term liabilities of €16 million include €11 million of finance leases and €5 million of interest bearing liabilities. A total of €78 million in repayments of long term liabilities related, amongst others, to scheduled repayments on aircraft leases and other leases of €9 million, the repayment of Wilson (now called TNT Freight Management) bank loans (€53 million) and to various other movements in non-interest bearing liabilities. Changes in short term financing for 2004 resulted in a cash outflow of €48 million, mainly relating to the repayment of loans of €20 million existing within the Wilson group, a cash outflow of €8 million regarding hedge transactions and various other repayments of loans within our express and mail divisions. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The companys capital resources include funds provided by our operating activities and capital raised in the financial markets. As regards the former, the company generates strong cash flows from operating activities (€984 million in 2005, €708 million in 2004). As with any global organisation, these operating cash flows are affected by economic and business trends. The majority of our cash flows are derived from our mail division, particularly from operations in the Netherlands. Amongst other factors, the impact of electronic substitution on mail volumes, postal regulations in the Netherlands and the pace of postal liberalisation in Europe continue to affect those cash flows, although it is not possible to predict what the long term cash flow effects will be. Although cash requirements for capital expenditure fluctuate from year to year, depending on the extent of strategic capital projects, they have been well covered by operating cash flows and showed an improving trend for the most recent three financial years. Specifically, the ratio of operating cash flows to net capital expenditure was 3.7 in 2005 and 2.7 in 2004. This ratio is calculated as follows: net cash provided by operating activities divided by the sum of capital expenditure on other intangible assets, disposals of other intangible assets, capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and disposals of property, plant and equipment, all as stated in our consolidated cash flow statements. We expect operating cash flows to 98 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Other financial information on the company Chapter 11 continue to cover our capital expenditure requirements in the foreseeable future. We believe our working capital is sufficient for our present requirements. For buy back of shares and any acquisitions that exceed the companys immediate cash resources, the company would seek to raise capital in the financial markets by means of bank borrowings and private or publicly traded debt. For very substantial transactions, we would also consider issuing equity in order to protect our credit rating position. Given the strength of our financial position, credit ratings, and bank relationships, we do not foresee an inability to access a wide range of capital markets including equity, public debt, private debt and bank borrowing. We monitor and manage key financial ratios that are consistent with a strong credit rating. There are no aspects of our current capital structure that we believe would trigger a material increase in the cost of our debt or access to capital markets. For details on the interest rates charged on our more significant long term loans as well as the maturity of our long term loans and commitments, see notes 13 and 28 to our consolidated financial statements. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes, nor do we allow our subsidiaries to do so. For details on our use of financial derivatives for hedging purposes, see notes 3 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements. Off-balance sheet items Other than guarantees and other similar arrangements that could be considered off-balance sheets and that are disclosed in this annual report, we have no off-balance arrangements. CASH AND NET DEBT At 31 December 2005, our total cash position amounted to €559 million. Despite cash paid of €473 million relating to our share buy backs during the year, our cash as at 31 December 2005 was only €74 million lower than compared to year end 2004. Included in the €559 million of total cash was €140 million of restricted cash (2004: 171) held mainly by joint ventures and insurance captives. The cash held in joint ventures is considered to be restricted by virtue of the fact that we require the agreement of our joint venture partners before we are able to access this cash. Our total cash position was primarily denominated in euro. At 31 December 2005, our net debt position was €725 million (2004: 858). This consisted of €213 million of short term debt (2004: 51) and €1,071 million (2004: 1,440) of long term debt, offset by €559 million of cash and cash equivalents (2004: 633). At 31 December 2005, short term borrowings consisted of €65 million (2004: 36) of bank debt bearing variable interest rates, and €148 million (2004: 15) of numerous other liabilities at fixed and variable rates, including a €129 million bilateral loan agreement maturing in 2006 with a fixed interest of 2.54%. At 31 December 2005, long term debt consisted of a combination of two Eurobonds of €1,009 million (2004: 1,000), finance lease agreements of €24 million (2004: 86), €31 million of other long term liabilities at fixed and variable interest rates (2004: 354) and €7 million of interest rate swaps. On 5 December 2001, TNT N.V. issued a €1 billion Eurobond with an original maturity of seven years. The bond has a coupon of 5.125% and began paying interest annually in arrears on 5 December 2002. In May 2005, €354 million of the €1 billion 5.125% Eurobond 2008 was exchanged for €386 million of a new 10-year 3.875% Eurobond 2015. At the time of the exchange, the 2015 bond was increased with an additional €14 million to an outstanding total amount of €400 million. The total €1,046 million (2004: 1,000) of Eurobonds will be measured at amortised cost. The book value of the nominal €1,046 million of Eurobonds amounted to €1,009 million (2004: 1,000) as at 31 December 2005. We have a total €500 million (2004: 300) of interest rate swaps outstanding on which we receive fixed interest and pay floating interest. The market value of these instruments amounted to negative €2 million as at December 2005 (negative €1 million as at 31 December 2004). In December 2005, we entered into €500 million of forward starting interest rate swaps on which we receive floating interest and pay fixed interest. These flows of interest exchanges under the forward starting interest rate swaps will start in December 2008. Due to the June 2005 exchange for the new 3.875% 2015 Eurobond we have decided to unwind €400 million of outstanding forward starting interest rate swaps for which we paid the market value of €12 million. The market value of this long term €100 million outstanding forward starting interest rate swap amounted to €5 million as at 31 December 2005 (€0 million as at 31 December 2004). CREDIT FACILITIES We have successfully negotiated to extend and increase our Multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility of €600 million maturing in 2008 to €1 billion maturing in 2012. The €1 billion facility will be used for general funding purposes and serves as a back-up facility for our Euro Commercial Paper Programme. At 31 December 2005, our long term credit ratings were A (on CreditWatch with negative implications) by Standard & Poors and A2 (under review for further possible downgrade) by Moodys. 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 99 Back to Contents Chapter 11 Other financial information on the company CASH OBLIGATIONS At 31 December 2005, our gross interest bearing borrowings, including finance lease obligations, totalled €1,284 million (2004: 1,491), of which 94% (2004: 84%) was at fixed rates of interest and €1,071 million (2004: 1,440) represented long term debt. We had operating lease commitments of €1,251 million (2004: 1,675). The following table show the maturity of these amounts: Amounts of payments due by period Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 4 to 5 years After 5 years Total borrowings 1,284 213 655 10 406 Rent and operating lease commitments 1,251 229 392 245 385 Total contractual cash obligations 2,535 442 1,047 255 791 (in € millions) GUARANTEES Amounts of commitments expiration by period Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 4 to 5 years After 5 years Guarantees 267 11 71 10 175 (in € millions) Total financial guarantees at 31 December 2005 were €267 million (2004: 350) of which €99 million (2004: 164) amounted to corporate guarantees. These guarantees were mainly issued in connection with our obligations under lease contracts, custom duty deferment and local credit lines. The increase of corporate guarantees to banks was mainly due to local credit lines. Furthermore, banks and other financial institutions have issued guarantees to cover obligations of group companies up to an amount of €147 million (2004: 127). These guarantees were mainly issued in connection with our obligations under lease contracts, customs duty deferment and local credit lines. The obligations under the guarantees issued by banks and other financial institutions have been secured by TNT N.V. or by its subsidiaries. The €21 million (2004: 59) of remaining guarantees in 2005 relates to bank guarantees issued locally by group companies. CONTINGENCIES OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS Our total operating lease commitments at the end of the year were €1,251 million (2004: 1,675). The total commitments as at 31 December 2005 relating to capital expenditure were €16 million (2004: 33). SHARE BUY BACK On 6 December 2005, we announced to return capital to our shareholders by repurchasing ordinary shares. This share buy back programme started on 6 December 2005 and is expected to end 6 April 2006 unless prior to such date: (a) the aggregate value of shares acquired would exceed €1 billion; (b) 10% of the outstanding ordinary shares have been repurchased, including any ordinary shares already held by the company; or (c) if a cash or exchange offer with respect to our shares is publicly launched through the publication of an offer document. As at 31 December 2005, we repurchased 9,020,000 of our ordinary shares for a total amount of €231 million. Note 40 includes a table summarising our repurchases during December 2006. Under this repurchase programme we anticipate purchasing additional shares with a value of €769 million. It is our intention to cancel the repurchased ordinary shares and we intend to request for such cancellation to be approved by our shareholders. UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE COMMITMENTS At 31 December 2005 we had unconditional purchase commitments of €100 million (2004: 84), which were primarily related to various service and maintenance contracts. INCOME TAXES In 2005, TNT continued to investigate and analyse its global tax position. As a result we currently estimate the realistic range to reflect our total contingent liability in this regard is between €150 million and €550 million. In early 2004, our audit committee, on behalf of our Supervisory Board, conducted an independent investigation regarding representations made to the UK tax authorities and to our independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers, with respect to certain UK tax matters originally arising in the late 1990s relating to one of our UK subsidiaries. The 2004 investigation, concluded that not all relevant details in connection with these tax matters were adequately disclosed 100 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Other financial information on the company Chapter 11 to the UK tax authorities and PricewaterhouseCoopers. In addition to this investigation, in 2004 our audit committee, with the assistance of external legal and tax advisors, conducted a review of other UK tax matters that arose from the same period. In August 2004, we submitted a report to the UK tax authorities pursuant to a procedure under UK law designed to ensure full disclosure of all relevant information to the UK tax authorities. In the first quarter of 2005, we reached a settlement with the UK tax authorities in relation to those matters without any further negative impact on our tax position in 2005. As previously disclosed, since August 2004, we have been preparing an addendum to our original report to the UK tax authorities that will cover UK tax matters that were not the subject of the original investigation. We are in continuing discussions with the UK tax authorities in this connection, and we do not expect that these matters will be resolved with the UK tax authorities before the end of 2006. In late 2005 and early 2006 our audit committee conducted an independent investigation with respect to whether illegal acts occurred in connection with certain past tax matters. Although the investigation concluded that such acts had occurred, we have determined that no provision or contingent liability is required as a result of this investigation. We have also analysed and continue to analyse the tax positions of some of our subsidiaries with respect to other countries. Our investigations and analyses, which are ongoing, concern, among other things, the substance and implementation of tax structures set up in connection with the acquisition, in December 1996 (prior to our formation in 1998), by our former parent company of the Australian company TNT Limited through a UK subsidiary, and the integration and structuring of those and related businesses after our demerger in 1998. Some of these structures, which were set up in consultation with outside advisors, have been, or might be, challenged by various tax authorities. An item that will be addressed in the addendum to our report to the UK tax authorities concerns whether some of our subsidiaries might have been resident in the United Kingdom prior to the acquisition of TNT Limited in December 1996 and, if so, whether tax on capital gains would have been due when the tax residency of those subsidiaries later may have moved to another European country. We are still investigating the residency of the relevant subsidiaries, but even if they were UK resident, we believe that the imposition of such a tax on capital gains would be impermissibly discriminatory under EU law. The addendum will also deal among other things, with certain transfer pricing issues in respect of which on 9 February 2005 we made a payment on account to the UK tax authorities of €22 million. We charged this payment against a tax accrual that we recorded in 2004 in connection with this issue. As part of a pilot publicly announced to the Dutch parliament to which the Dutch Ministry of Finance and the Confederation of Netherlands Industry and Employers (VNO-NCW) are committed, we recently signed a compliance covenant with the Dutch tax authorities to self-assess and transparently discuss our past, present and future tax issues with the Dutch tax authorities. The Dutch tax authorities have agreed, in turn, to take a clear position on such issues swiftly. An example of what we expect to discuss is the group-wide finance structure we have applied in the past and the structure we intend to apply in the future. From the extensive review to date of our global tax position, on the basis of the facts and circumstances as currently known and advice received from external advisors, we currently believe that it is unlikely that we will incur an additional liability beyond what we have accrued to date, and thus we have not made any further provision in connection with these matters in our financial statements for 2005. To date no assessments relating to the items under investigation or analysis have been raised, and it is difficult to assess if and when, and if so, for what amount, any particular assessment might be raised. Our interpretation of past facts and circumstances and relevant tax laws and regulations may be open to challenge. However, our positions have been and are supported by strong external specialist advice, both contemporaneous and present, on the basis of which we have reached our estimates. Although we currently believe that it is unlikely that we will incur an additional liability beyond what we have accrued to date, we estimate that the realistic range to reflect our total contingent liability in this regard, including potential penalties and interest, is between €150 million and €550 million. This estimate incorporates our current assessment of the matters underlying the contingent liability disclosure in our audited financial statements for 2004. This estimate is based on a probability-weighted assessment of our estimated total theoretical liability. It has been tested against possible settlement negotiation scenarios. Altogether this estimate represents 25-30% of the non-probability weighted estimated theoretical maximum liability - in the highly unrealistic scenario where all of our tax positions under investigation or analysis were successfully challenged, we and all relevant tax authorities were unable to reach any settlement whatsoever, and all of our positions were rejected by all relevant courts. We believe this is highly unlikely. Our estimate of the realistic range of the total contingent liability of €150-€550 million involves a series of complex judgments about past and future events and relies on estimates and assumptions. Although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable and are supported by external advice, our ultimate liability in connection with these matters will depend upon the assessments raised, the result of any negotiations with the relevant tax authorities and the outcome of any related litigation. 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 101 Back to Contents Chapter 11 Other financial information on the company OTHER We are involved in several legal proceedings relating to the normal conduct of our business. We do not expect any liability arising from any of these legal proceedings to have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity, capital resources or financial position. We believe we have provided for all probable liabilities deriving from the normal course of business.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES PROJECTION FOR 2006 The total projected 2006 capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets for our divisions is estimated to be €400 million, which is expected to be spent on similar types of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets as in 2005. We believe that the net cash provided by our operating activities will be sufficient to fund these expenditures. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES Our group companies have trading relationships with a number of our partially consolidated joint ventures as well as with unconsolidated companies in which we only hold minority stakes. In some cases there are contractual arrangements in place under which our group companies source supplies from such undertakings, or such undertakings source supplies from our group companies. During 2005, sales made by our group companies to our joint ventures amounted to €42 million, compared to €24 million in 2004. Purchases from our joint ventures for 2005 amounted to €131 million, compared to €125 million in 2004. The net amounts due from joint venture entities as at 31 December 2005 totalled €49 million, compared to €49 million in 2004. Loans receivable from associated companies are disclosed in notes 3 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements. As at 31 December 2005, no material amounts were payable by TNT to associated companies. We believe that all transactions with joint ventures and associated companies are conducted in the ordinary course of business and under normal arms length commercial terms and conditions. For further disclosure of the related party transactions and balances we refer to note 32 to our consolidated financial statements. For information on our relationship with the State of the Netherlands see chapter 14 and note 32 to our consolidated financial statements. TRANSITION TO INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS The conversion from Dutch GAAP to IFRS is explained in detail in chapter 12, Note Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU. 102 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Other financial information on the company Chapter 11 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our reported financial condition and results of operations are sensitive to accounting policies, assumptions and estimates that underlie the preparation of our financial statements. The profile of critical accounting policies, the judgements and other uncertainties affecting application of those policies and the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions are factors to be considered, together with reviewing our financial statements and the discussion in this item. We make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are described below. We have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with our independent auditors. In addition, our financial statements contain a summary of our significant accounting policies. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER LONG LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS Under IFRS all of our business combinations are accounted for as purchases. The cost of an acquired company is assigned to the tangible and intangible assets purchased and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires us to make estimates and use valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. Under IFRS we evaluate our goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if specific events indicate that impairment in value may have occurred. Our goodwill impairment tests include judgements regarding assumptions relating to the level of testing, future cash flow and discount rates. The level we identify for impairment testing and the criteria we use to determine which groups should be aggregated also require judgement. A difference in testing levels could affect whether an impairment is recorded and the extent of impairment loss. Changes in our business activities or structure may result in changes to the level of testing in future periods. Additionally, the level of testing for IFRS may be lower than the level of testing for US GAAP, which adds another layer of complexity. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we use valuation techniques that involve estimating cash flows for future periods and discounting these cash flows to determine value in use. We have to make estimates regarding expected revenues and costs as well as capital expenditures. Due to the inherent nature of estimates, our actual experienced revenues, costs and capital expenditures in the past have varied, in some cases materially, from our expectations. The use of different assumptions for our cash flow estimates could affect the amount of any impairment losses recognised. We also use significant judgement to determine the discount rate. Under US GAAP, there is a two-step impairment test. In the first step, we are required to make estimates regarding the fair values of reporting units (assets and liabilities, including recorded and unrecorded intangible assets) in determining whether goodwill impairment might exist. To the extent the first step indicates a possible impairment of goodwill, the second test is performed and consists of comparing the fair values with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill in determining the amount of the impairment charge. We use valuation techniques to determine some of the fair values, which involve the same judgements as mentioned above regarding cash flows and discount rates. Under both IFRS and US GAAP, we review our tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable (a triggering event). The review for recoverability requires us to estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The determination of whether a triggering event has occurred as well as the development of the assumptions used to estimate future cash flows and determine fair value, requires the use of judgement, as mentioned above. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment is valued at historical cost using a component approach, less depreciation or at the recoverable amount whenever impairment has taken place. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life, taking into account any residual value. The assets residual values and useful lives are based on our best estimates, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. IMPAIRMENT OF RECEIVABLES The risk of uncollectibility of accounts receivable is primarily estimated based on prior experience with and the past due status of doubtful debtors, while large accounts are assessed individually based on factors that include ability to pay, bankruptcy and payment history. In addition, debtors in certain countries are subject to a higher collectibility risk, which is taken into account when assessing the overall risk of uncollectibility. Should the outcome differ from the assumptions and estimates, revisions to the estimated valuation allowances would be required. 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 103 Back to Contents Chapter 11 Other financial information on the company POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards As permitted under IFRS 1, at the date of transition to IFRS we have elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses and the unrecognised prior year service costs for all our defined benefit pension plans. For US GAAP purposes the actuarial gains and losses continue to be recognised under the corridor approach while unrecognised prior year service costs are recognised during the future service periods of the active employees. This has resulted in a difference in the pension expense and pension liability between IFRS and US GAAP. Under IFRS, we have accounted for certain defined benefit obligations in Italy by using the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which an employee is currently entitled, but based on the employees expected date of separation or retirement. For US GAAP purposes, we have accounted for these obligations using the nominal value of the vested benefits to which the employee is entitled to if an employee separates immediately. This option is permitted under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 88-1, Determination of Vested Benefit Obligation for Defined Benefit Plan. Pension cost Inherent to the valuation of our pension liabilities and the determination of our pension cost are key assumptions, which include employee turnover, mortality and retirement ages, discount rates, expected long term returns on plan assets, and future wage increases, which are usually updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each financial year. Actual circumstances may vary from these assumptions, giving rise to a different pension liability, which would be reflected as an additional profit or expense in our statement of income. Included in note 10 in chapter 12 is a table that indicates the change in employer pension expense with a 0.5% change in certain key assumptions. In 2005, our employer pension expense was €141 million (2004: 185). Total cash contributions in 2005 amounted to €264 million (2004: 437) and are expected to amount to approximately €222 million in 2006. Cash contributions to the various pension funds totalled €166 million. Of these payments €59 million was contributed as prescribed by the minimum funding requirements of the DNB. Our cash payments for pensions, which fall under the transitional plan for early retirement in the Netherlands and are directly paid by us (see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements), amounted to €98 million. RESTRUCTURING We periodically record restructuring charges resulting from restructuring operations, including consolidations and/or relocations of operations, changes in our strategic plan, or managerial responses to declines in demand, increasing costs or other market factors. Restructuring provisions reflect many estimates, including those pertaining to separation costs, consolidation of excess facilities, contract settlements and tangible asset impairments. Actual experience has been and may continue to be different from these estimates. As at 31 December 2005 and 2004, restructuring provisions were €43 million and €49 million, respectively. ACCRUED CURRENT LIABILITIES We also have to estimate the deferred revenues from stamps sold but not yet used by our customers. We use a seasonal model based on historical figures in order to account for the seasonal effects in sales to our customers (for example sales for Christmas greetings in November and December). INCOME TAXES We currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carry forwards and deductible temporary differences, which will reduce taxable income in future periods. We recognise deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. This is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which deferred tax assets are recoverable. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, and depending on the tax strategies that we may be able to implement, changes to the recognition of deferred tax assets could be required, which could impact our financial position and net income. ACCOUNTING FOR DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Accounting for discontinued operations requires the use of significant assumptions and estimates, such as the assumptions used in the fair value calculations as well as the estimated costs to sell. We have evaluated the assets held for sale of our discontinued logistics operations as a disposal group in performing our impairment analysis. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Legal proceedings and tax issues covering a range of matters are pending in various jurisdictions against us. Due to the uncertainty inherent in such matters, it is often difficult to predict the final outcome. The cases and claims against us often raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues which are subject to many uncertainties and complexities, including but not limited to the facts and circumstances of each particular case and claim, the jurisdiction and the differences in applicable law. In the normal course of business, we consult with legal counsel and certain other experts on matters related to litigation and taxes. We accrue a liability when it is determined that an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In the event an adverse outcome is possible or an estimate is not determinable, the matter is disclosed. 104 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Other financial information on the company Chapter 11 RECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO US GAAP Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS, which differ in certain respects from US GAAP. In the case that our IFRS accounting policies do not correspond with the required US GAAP accounting treatment and this is estimated to have a significant effect on our consolidated net income and shareholders equity, we have highlighted these differences in the reconciliation of our IFRS net income and shareholders equity to those under US GAAP, as presented in note 34 to our consolidated financial statements. Net income determined in accordance with US GAAP was €632 million in 2005 (2004: 714), which was €27 million lower than net income determined in accordance with IFRS in 2005 compared to €38 million lower in 2004. This difference mainly relates to employee benefits. As permitted under IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, at the date of transition to IFRS we have elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses and the unrecognised prior year service costs for all our defined benefit pension plans. For US GAAP purposes the actuarial gains and losses and unrecognised prior year service costs continue to be recognised under the corridor approach. This has resulted in a difference in the pension expense and pension liability between IFRS and US GAAP. The main differences in our 2004 net income relate to the unwinding of an insurance contract in the mail division with a remaining balance of €130 million at the moment of the termination of the contract, which was offset by lower pension costs under US GAAP, the realisation of gains on real estate sales and a positive tax effect on the reconciling items. Our shareholders equity determined in accordance with US GAAP was €2,757 million at 31 December 2005 (2004: 2,622), which was €505 million lower at 31 December 2005 and €703 million lower at 31 December 2004 than shareholders equity determined in accordance with IFRS. The lower equity under US GAAP was mainly caused by a direct equity movement related to a minimum pension liability of €587 million at 31 December 2005 (2004: 454), net of taxes. This was partly offset by differences relating to goodwill and employee benefits. Under US GAAP we are required to record a minimum pension liability in the event the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) exceeds the fair value of the pension plan assets with a corresponding reduction in shareholders equity net of deferred taxes. Under IFRS such a minimum pension liability is not required. As at 31 December 2005 and 2004, the ABO amounted to €5,194 million and €4,643 million, respectively. The increase in the ABO was mainly due to a decrease in interest rates from 4.8% in 2004 to 4.3% in 2005 (impact approximately €440 million). As at 31 December 2005 and 2004 the ABO for certain of our pension plans in the Netherlands, in Germany, and in the United States exceeded the plan assets, we were required to record a minimum pension liability of €843 million. As at 31 December 2004 our repurchase of shares, relating to the second tranche of our September 2004 share repurchase plan, amounting to €259 million qualified under US GAAP as financial liability rather than equity. As a result of our December 2005 announcement to focus on our core competency of providing delivery services, we have presented assets and liabilities of our discontinued logistics business as long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and have presented our profit (loss) for the period from our discontinued logistics business as profit (loss) from discontinued operations. As required under IFRS 5, Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, we have not depreciated or amortised, since 6 December 2005, our assets held for sale. IFRS 5, Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, requires us to classify non-current assets or a disposal group as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. For this to be the case, the assets or disposal group should meet the following criteria:  the asset or disposal group must be available for immediate sale in its present condition,  the sale must be highly probable, which requires appropriate level of management be committed to a plan to sell the assets or disposal group,  an active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan must have been initiated,  the asset or disposal group must be actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value,  the sale should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification and actions required to complete the plan should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. We have met all the criteria as required under IFRS 5. Our Board of Management is committed to a plan to sell the assets and as defined in the Dutch Civil Code, it can legally represent the company even in the event the general meeting of shareholders may not grant approval to certain resolutions. Furthermore, the Dutch Civil Code states that when a Board of Management commits a company in legally valid matters, the company is bound towards a third party. The logistics business is available for immediate sale in its present condition and we believe the sale of the business is highly probable. The position of the SEC is that in the event shareholder approval is required, management is not considered having authority. Accordingly, under US GAAP the criteria 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 105 Back to Contents Chapter 11 Other financial information on the company management having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the asset is not met. The French logistics business meets all criteria and has been presented as discontinued operations and the remainder of the logistics business has presented as part of continuing operations. Depreciation and amortisation from 6 December 2005 to 31 December 2005 for our discontinued logistics business other than the French activities that we sold during 2005 amounted to €8 million and is included as a reconciling item between IFRS and US GAAP. The following table indicates our 2005 operating income determined in accordance with IFRS, compared to that determined in accordance with US GAAP: Year ended at 31 December IFRS US GAAP Operating income 2005 % of total 2005 % of total US$ € US$ € Mail 920 777 67.0 904 763 60.1 Express 561 474 40.9 562 475 37.4 Freight management 13 11 0.9 13 11 0.9 Logistics 148 125 9.9 Non-allocated (122 ) (103 ) (8.8 ) (124 ) (105 ) (8.3 ) Total 1,372 1,159 100.0 1,503 1,269 100.0 (in millions, except percentages) In 2005 the IFRS operating income in the mail division was higher by €14 million as compared with the operating income under US GAAP. Certain employee benefit expenses related to payments expected to be made to certain employees on reaching a specific number of years of service. As permitted under IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, at the date of transition to IFRS, we recorded a liability with a corresponding adjustment to shareholders equity as at that date. For US GAAP purposes, we have included the amount in the income statement resulting in a difference in the profit for the period between IFRS and US GAAP. This was partly offset by higher pension expenses under IFRS. Operating income in our express and freight management businesses have no material differences between IFRS and US GAAP. Year ended at 31 December Operating income IFRS US GAAP 2004 % of total 2004 % of total Mail 806 72.2 747 61.4 Express 375 33.6 380 31.3 Freight management 6 0.5 6 0.5 Logistics 155 12.8 Non-allocated (71 ) (6.3 ) (73 ) (6.0 ) Total 1,116 100.0 1,215 100.0 (in € millions, except percentages) In 2004 the IFRS operating income in the mail division was higher than under US GAAP. This was caused by the unwinding of an insurance contract. The agreement with an insurance company related to settling future wage guarantees that was entered in 2001, was terminated in December 2004 following an unfavourable court decision with regard to the timing of the deductibility of the consideration for tax purposes. This higher result under IFRS was partly offset by higher pension charges. Within express the difference between IFRS and US GAAP operating income was primarily the result of amortisation of other long lived intangible assets recognised under US GAAP prior to 1 January 2004 and higher pension expenses and expenses relating to share based payments under IFRS. Freight management operating income has no material differences between IFRS and US GAAP. 106 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Other financial information on the company Chapter 11 RECENT US GAAP ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The Financial Accounting Standards Board in the United States (FASB) has issued certain Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS), each of which, when adopted, could affect our consolidated financial statements for US GAAP reporting. In December 2004, the FASB issued a revised version of SFAS 123, Share-based payments, Revised 2004 (SFAS 123(R)). The SEC has issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, relating to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). SFAS 123(R) requires us to measure all employee share based compensation awards using a fair value method, estimate award forfeitures, and record such expense in our consolidated statements of income. This statement supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock issued to Employees. The provisions of this statement were effective 1 January 2006. As permitted by FASB Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure, we have elected, effective 1 January 2005, to measure our share based payments using a fair value method under SFAS 123 using the transition provisions of SFAS 148. Accordingly, we do not expect the adoption of SFAS 123(R) to have a material impact on our financial statements. The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF 05-6, Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements Purchased after Lease Inception or Acquired in a Business Combination. This pronouncement requires that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased subsequent to the inception of the lease should be amortised over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the lease term that includes reasonably assured lease renewals as determined on the date of acquisition of the leasehold improvement. We are required to adopt this pronouncement effective 1 January 2006 and do not expect the adoption the EITF 05-6 to have a material impact on our financial statements. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks, such as market risks (including foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk. All of these risks arise in the normal course of business. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we utilise a variety of foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge certain exposures. We use derivative financial instruments solely for the purpose of hedging underlying exposures. We enter into contracts related to derivative financial instruments for periods commensurate with our underlying exposures and do not take positions independent of these exposures. None of these financial instruments are leveraged or used for trading purposes or to take speculative positions.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TNT N.V. and its subsidiaries as of 31 December 2005 and 2004 and the related consolidated statements of income, of cash flows and of changes in group equity for each of the two years in the period ended 31 December 2005, as set out on pages 112 to 182. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Board of Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of TNT N.V. and its subsidiaries at 31 December 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended 31 December 2005, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards. As discussed in the paragraph regarding the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on page 123 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, TNT N.V. changed its accounting for financial instruments effective 1 January 2005. International Financial Reporting Standards vary in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and as allowed by Item 18 to Form 20-F. Information relating to the nature and effect of such differences is presented in Note 34 to the consolidated financial statements. Amsterdam, 24 February 2006 PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V.

(formerly called TPG N.V.) is a public limited liability company domiciled in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of TNT N.V. and its consolidated subsidiaries (hereafter referred to as we, TNT, our or us). We changed our name from TNT Post Group N.V. to TPG N.V. on 6 August 2001 and we changed our name from TPG N.V. to TNT N.V. on 11 April 2005. TNT N.V. was incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands on 29 December 1997 and is listed on the Amsterdam, New York, London and Frankfurt stock exchanges. On 20 February 2006 we announced our intention to delist from the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges in the first half of 2006, as the costs and requirements for these listings are not justified by the low trading volume in our shares at both stock exchanges. In December 2005 we announced a strategy to focus on our core competency of providing delivery services by expertly managing delivery networks. Based on our refined strategy we will now manage our business through two divisions: mail and express, with the express division including both our express and our freight management businesses. The mail segment primarily provides services for collecting, sorting, transporting and distributing domestic and international mail. The express segment provides demand door-to-door express delivery services for customers sending documents, parcels and freight worldwide. The freight management segment provides air and sea freight transportations by acquiring cargo space from airline and shipping firms. The majority of our former logistics division is reported as discontinued operations/assets held for sale. Consequently, in our balance sheet as at 31 December 2005 we have grouped together all assets and all liabilities relating to our discontinued logistics business. As prescribed by IFRS 5, Non current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, our 31 December 2004 balance sheet has not been adjusted. In our statement of income for 2005, we have presented the net result of our discontinued logistics business on a separate line. Our 2004 statement of income has been adjusted for comparability purposes. Our 2005 and 2004 cash flow statements include cash flows and cash balances of our continuing operations. The consolidated financial statements have been authorised for issue by our Board of Management and our Supervisory Board on 24 February 2006 and are subject to adoption at the annual general meeting of shareholders on 20 April 2006. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU). IFRS includes the application of International Financial Reporting Standards including International Accounting Standards (IAS) and related Interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and Interpretations of the Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC). For TNT, there are no differences between the IFRS as adopted by the EU and the IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the years presented except for those relating to the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. We have made use of the exemption available under IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, to only apply IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, from 1 January 2005. The policies applied to financial instruments for 2004 and 2005 are disclosed separately below. Our consolidated financial statements until 31 December 2004 were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Netherlands (Dutch GAAP). Dutch GAAP differs in some areas from IFRS. In preparing our 2005 consolidated financial statements, management has amended certain accounting and valuation methods applied in the Dutch GAAP financial statements to comply with IFRS. The comparative figures for 2004 were adjusted to reflect these adjustments. Changes in accounting policies, reconciliations and descriptions of the effect of the transition from Dutch GAAP to IFRS on our balance sheet and on our statement of income for the period ended 31 December 2004 are included in the note Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards. All amounts included in the financial statements are presented in euros, unless indicated otherwise. Consolidation Consolidated financial information, including subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, has been prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. All significant intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions have been eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of TNT N.V. and its consolidated entities. A complete list of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures included in our consolidated financial statements is filed for public review at the Chamber of Commerce in Amsterdam. This list has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of article 379 (1) and article 414, book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. 116 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Financial statements Chapter 12 As the financial statements of TNT N.V. are included in the consolidated financial statements, the corporate statements of income are presented in an abridged form (article 402, part 9, book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code). SUBSIDIARIES A subsidiary is an entity controlled, directly or indirectly, by TNT N.V. Control is regarded as the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether we control another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to us and are de-consolidated from the date on which control ceases. We use the purchase method of accounting to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of our share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of our share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement. The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minoritys proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. Losses applicable to the minority in excess of the minoritys interest in the subsidiarys equity are allocated against our interests except to the extent that the minority has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses. Our subsidiaries accounting policies have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with our policies. ASSOCIATES An associate is an entity, including an unincorporated entity such as a partnership, that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture and over whose commercial and financial policy decisions TNT has the power to exert significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity but is not control or joint control over those policies. Our share in the results of all significant associates is included in the consolidated statements of income using the equity method. The carrying value of our share in associates includes goodwill on acquisition and includes changes to reflect our share in net earnings of the respective companies, reduced by dividends received. Our share in non-distributed earnings of associates is included in other reserves within shareholders equity. When our share of any accumulated losses exceeds the acquisition value of the shares in the associates the book value is reduced to zero and the reporting of losses ceases, unless we are bound by guarantees on other undertakings in relation to the associate. JOINT VENTURES A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby we and one or more parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control. Joint ventures in which we participate with other party(ies) are proportionately consolidated. In applying the proportionate consolidation method, our percentage share of the balance sheet and income statement items are included in our consolidated financial statements. Foreign currency translation The results and financial position of all group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet, income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates, and all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity (cumulative translation adjustment). FROM 1 JANUARY 2004 TO 31 DECEMBER 2004 Foreign currency transactions are translated into euros, the functional currency, using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions or at an average exchange rate for accounting purposes. Accounts receivable, liabilities, cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies are translated into euro at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date or at the forward exchange rate if a forward contract has been entered into. Exchange rate differences are included in the statements of income under interest and similar income or interest and similar expenses. FROM 1 JANUARY 2005 Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of transactions, including foreign currency transactions, and from the translation at the year end exchange rate of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except where hedge accounting is applied. Foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments are taken to the cumulative translation adjustment on consolidation. When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 117 Back to Contents Chapter 12 Financial statements Intangible assets GOODWILL The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of our share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries and joint ventures is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisition of associates is included in investments in associates. Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is impaired if the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which it is allocated is lower than its carrying value. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of cash generating units fair value less costs to sell and its value in use using the discounted cash flow method by including additions in property, plant and equipment to cover forecast growth. Impairments on goodwill recognised in prior periods can not be reversed. For the purpose of assessing impairment, corporate assets and liabilities are allocated to specific cash generating units before impairment testing. The basis for this allocation is to the extent in which those assets or liabilities contribute to the future cash flows of the unit under review. SOFTWARE AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Costs related to the development and installation of software for internal use are capitalised at historical cost and amortised over the estimated useful life. Other intangible assets mainly include customer lists, assets under development, licences and concessions. An asset is transferred to its respective intangible asset category at the moment it is ready for use and is amortised on a straight-line method over its estimated useful life. Other intangible assets are valued at the lower of historical cost less amortisation and impairment. An impairment review is performed whenever a triggering event occurs. An intangible asset is impaired if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. A triggering event is an event or change in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows being the cash generating units. Impairments are reversed if and to the extent that the impairment no longer exists. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is valued at historical cost using a component approach, less depreciation or at the recoverable amount whenever impairment has taken place. In addition to costs of acquisition, we also include costs of bringing the asset to working condition, handling and installation costs and the non-refundable purchase taxes. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life, taking into account any residual value. The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to us and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Land is not depreciated. System software is capitalised and amortised as a part of the tangible fixed asset for which it was acquired to operate, because the estimated useful life is inextricably linked to the estimated useful life of the associated asset. An impairment review is performed whenever a triggering event occurs. Property, plant and equipment is impaired if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. An impairment loss recognised in prior periods for an asset shall be reversed if, and only if, there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows being the cash generating units. Leases of property, plant and equipment, where we have substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the leases inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in long term debt. Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the shorter of the assets useful life and the lease term. Financial instruments FROM 1 JANUARY 2004 TO 31 DECEMBER 2004 We use derivative financial instruments as part of an overall risk-management strategy. When used, these instruments are applied as means of hedging exposure to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity risk connected to anticipated cash flows or existing assets and liabilities. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Gains and losses from foreign currency forward exchange contracts that are hedging anticipated cash flows are deferred in other assets or other liabilities and recognised in the statements of income, or as adjustments of carrying amounts, when the hedged transaction occurs. If an anticipated cash 118 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Financial statements Chapter 12 flow does not occur or is expected not to occur, the foreign currency forward exchange contract is terminated and any result is recognised in interest and similar income or interest and similar expenses. The net exposures of derivative financial instruments are revalued at the prevailing spot exchange rate. Realised and unrealised gains and losses resulting from hedges of on-balance sheet foreign currency exposure are included in interest and similar income or in interest and similar expenses offsetting the revaluation of the underlying on-balance sheet items. Foreign currency gains and losses on derivative financial instruments used to hedge our net investments in foreign operations are recorded in equity, net of taxes. Premium or discounts arising at the inception of foreign currency derivatives are amortised over the life of the contract and included in interest and similar income or interest and similar expenses. Payments and receipts on interest rate swaps are recorded on an accruals basis. If interest rate swaps are terminated early, the gain or loss on interest is recorded within interest and similar income or interest and similar expenses. FROM 1 JANUARY 2005 Financial instruments are accounted for in accordance with IAS 32 and IAS 39. We classify financial assets and liabilities into the following categories: derivatives, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets and liabilities not held for trading purposes. Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value on our balance sheets. Derivatives not designated as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If a derivative is designated as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in its fair value that are considered to be effective, as defined, either offset the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through income, or are recorded in a separate component in shareholders equity until the hedged item is recorded in income. Any portion of a change in a derivatives fair value that is considered to be ineffective, or is excluded from the measurement of effectiveness, is immediately recorded in income. We document at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. We also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit and loss (for example, when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gains or losses existing in equity at that time, remains in equity when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and for which we have no intention of trading. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are included in trade and other receivables in the balance sheet. Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities where we have the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories above. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade-date. The trade-date is the date on which we commit to purchase or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Investments are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and we have transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Available-for-sale financial assets are carried at fair value. Loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of securities classified as available-for-sale are recognised in equity. When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the consolidated statements of income as gains and losses from investment securities. The fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices. If the market for a financial asset is not active (and for unlisted securities), we establish fair value by using 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 119 Back to Contents Chapter 12 Financial statements valuation techniques. These include the use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, and discounted cash flow analysis refined to reflect the issuers specific circumstances. We assess at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. In the case of equity securities classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered in determining whether the securities are impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss  measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss  is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement. Inventories Inventories of raw materials and finished goods are valued at the lower of historical cost or net realisable value less any provision required for obsolescence. Historical cost is based on weighted average prices. Accounts receivable FROM 1 JANUARY 2004 TO 31 DECEMBER 2004 Accounts receivable are stated at nominal value net of an allowance for doubtful receivables. Loans receivable from associated companies due within one year are included in accounts receivable. FROM 1 JANUARY 2005 Accounts receivable are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of accounts receivable is established when there is objective evidence that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at cost. Cash and cash equivalents include cash at hand, bank account balances, bills of exchange and cheques (only those which can be cashed in the short term). All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale are classified as assets held for sale and stated at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amount is recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Assets held for sale are no longer amortised or depreciated from the time they are classified as such. Operations that represent a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, or is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale and either have been disposed of or have been classified as held for sale, are presented as discontinued operations in our statements of income. Shareholders equity Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Where any group company purchases the companys equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the companys shareholders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the companys shareholders. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options for the acquisition of business combinations are included in the cost of acquisition as part of the purchase consideration. Employee benefit obligations POST-EMPLOYMENT OBLIGATIONS The obligation for all pension and other post-employment plans that qualify as defined benefit obligation is determined by calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligation and deducting the fair value of the plan assets. We use actuarial calculations (projected unit credit method) to measure the obligations and the costs. For the calculations, actuarial assumptions are made about demographic variables (such as employee turnover and mortality) and financial variables (such as future increases in salaries). The discount rate is determined by reference to market rates. Cumulative actuarial gains and losses are recognised for the portion that these exceed the higher of 10% of the obligation and 10% of the fair value of plan assets (corridor approach). The excess is recognised over the employees expected average remaining service lives. Past service costs, if any, are recognised on a straight-line basis over the average vesting period of the amended pension or early retirement benefits. Certain past service costs may be recognised immediately if the benefits are vested immediately. 120 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Financial statements Chapter 12 Gains or losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised at the date of the curtailment or settlement. Pension costs for defined contribution plans are expensed in the consolidated statements of income when incurred. TERMINATION BENEFITS Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. We recognise termination benefits when we have demonstrably committed to terminate the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after balance sheet date are discounted to their present values. OTHER LONG TERM EMPLOYEE OBLIGATIONS These employee benefits include long-service leave or sabbatical leave, jubilee or other long service benefits, long term disability benefits and, if they are not payable wholly within twelve months after the end of the period, profit-sharing, bonuses and deferred compensation. The expected costs of these benefits are recognised over the period of employment. Actuarial gains and losses and changes in actuarial assumptions, are charged or credited to income in the period such gain or loss occur. Further, all past service costs are recognised immediately. PROFIT-SHARING AND BONUS PLANS We recognise a liability and an expense for cash settled bonuses and profit-sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit attributable to our shareholders after certain adjustments. We recognise a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation. Share based payments Share based payment transactions are transactions in which we receive benefits from our employees in consideration for our equity instruments. The fair value of the share based transactions is recognised as an expense (employee costs) and a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period. The fair value of employee share based payments is calculated using the Monte Carlo model. The equity instruments granted do not vest until the employee completes a specified period of service. The amount recognised is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number of securities that will be issued but not for changes in the fair value of those securities. Therefore, on vesting date the amount recognised is the exact number of securities that can be issued as of that date, measured at the fair value of those securities at grant date. Provisions Provisions are recognised when there is a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are recorded for restructuring, retirements, onerous contracts and other obligations. Provisions are measured at the present value of managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. The discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the increases specific to the liability. Provisions for onerous contracts are recorded when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligation under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to arise from that contract, taking into account impairment of fixed assets first. Income taxes The amount of income tax included in the statements of income is determined in accordance with the rules established by the taxation authorities, based on which income taxes are payable or recoverable. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, arising from temporary differences between the nominal values of assets and liabilities and the fiscal valuation of assets and liabilities, are calculated using the tax rates expected to apply when they are realised or settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised if it is probable that they will be realised in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities where a legally enforceable right to offset exists and within the same consolidated tax group are presented net in the consolidated balance sheets. Revenue recognition Revenues are recognised when services are rendered, goods are delivered or work is completed. Losses are recorded when probable. Revenue is the gross inflow of economic benefits during the current year arising in the course of the ordinary activities when those inflows result in increases in equity, other than increases relating to contributions from equity participants. Revenues of delivered goods and services are recognised when:  we have transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods,  we retain neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control of the goods sold,  the amounts of revenue are measured reliably,  it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to us,  the costs to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably, and  the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date can be measured reliably. 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 121 Back to Contents Chapter 12 Financial statements Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration of received amounts or receivable amounts. Amounts received in advance are recorded as accrued liabilities until services are rendered to customers, goods are delivered or work is completed, using the percentage of completion method, based on services provided. NET SALES Net sales represent the revenues from the delivery of goods and services to third parties less discounts, credit notes and taxes levied on sales. OTHER OPERATING REVENUES Other operating revenues include revenues that do not arise from our normal operations and mainly include rental income from temporarily leased-out property. Other income Other income includes net gains from the sale of property, plant and equipment and other gains. Operating leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to our shareholders is recognised as a liability in our financial statements in the year in which the dividends are approved by our shareholders. Accounting principles relating to the consolidated cash flow statement The cash flow statements have been prepared using the indirect method. Cash flows in foreign currencies have been translated at average exchange rates. Exchange rate differences affecting cash items are shown separately in the cash flow statements. Receipts and payments with respect to taxation on profits are included in the cash flow from operating activities. Interest payments are included in cash flows from operating activities while interest receipts are included in cash flows from investing activities. The cost of acquisition of new group companies, associated companies and investments, insofar as it was paid for in cash, is included in cash flows from investing activities. Acquisitions of group companies are presented net of cash balances acquired. Cash flows from derivatives are recognised in the statement of cash flows in the same category as those of the hedged item. Segment reporting We identify our primary reporting segments based on our assessment of risks and rates of return which are affected predominantly by differences in our products and services. As a result of this assessment, we have identified three reportable segments: mail, express and freight management. The secondary reporting format is geographically based. Business relations between the companies within the segments of TNT are transacted at arms length prices. 122 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Financial statements Chapter 12 ADOPTION OF IAS 32 AND IAS 39 Effective 1 January 2005, we adopted IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement. The following table summarises the effects of adopting these two IAS pronouncements as at 1 January 2005: 31 December Adoption 1 January 2004 IFRS IAS 32/39 2005 IFRS Non-current assets Intangible assets 2,643 2,643 Property, plant and equipment 1,924 1,924 Financial fixed assets 503 (3 ) 500 Total non-current assets 5,070 (3 ) 5,067 Current assets Inventory 46 46 Accounts receivable 2,089 2,089 Prepayments and accrued income 391 2 393 Cash and cash equivalents 633 46 679 Total current assets 3,159 48 3,207 Assets held for sale Total assets 8,229 45 8,274 Total equity 3,344 (268 ) 3,076 Total non-current liabilities 2,221 8 2,229 Current liabilities Trade accounts payable 670 670 Short term provisions 49 49 Other current liabilities 637 309 946 Accrued current liabilities 1,308 (4 ) 1,304 Total current liabilities 2,664 305 2,969 Liabilities related to assets classified as held for sale Total liabilities and equity 8,229 45 8,274 (in € millions) The €309 million increase in other current liabilities includes €259 million related to our commitment to purchase our ordinary shares from the State of the Netherlands on 5 January 2005. As at 31 December 2004 this transfer of legal ownership was included in equity. As required under IAS 32 the amount has been classified as a financial instrument and is included in other current liabilities. The increase in other current liabilities also includes €46 million related to the separate presentation of our bank overdrafts. Under IAS 32 it is not permitted to offset our bank overdrafts with our cash and cash equivalents, if there is no legal enforceable right and intention to settle the balances simultaneously. In connection with the acquisition of our 51% interest in TNT Arvil, we granted a put option to the minority shareholder, Ecotrans. Ecotrans has the right to sell their shares in TNT Arvil based on a price that has been determined in the shareholders agreement. Under the put option, the price at which the 49% shares can be sold to us includes a premium rate over the value at which the estimated price the option shares would be trading if TNT Arvil were a publicly traded company. This was deemed to be the fair market value. On adoption of IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, we are required to reflect the fair value on our balance sheet. The fair value was estimated at €9 million and is included in total non-current liabilities. The remaining adjustments relate to the IAS 39 accounting change from cost accounting to fair value accounting and to accounting at amortised cost for all outstanding financial instruments. 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 123 Back to Contents Chapter 12 Financial statements RECENT IFRS PRONOUNCEMENTS The IASB has issued certain International Financial Reporting Standards or amendments thereon, and the IFRIC has issued certain interpretations, each of which, when adopted, could affect our consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the IFRIC issued IFRIC 4, Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease. IFRIC 4 provides guidance on determining whether arrangements that do not take the legal form of a lease should be accounted for in accordance with IAS 17, Leases. It specifies that an arrangement contains a lease if it depends on the use of a specific asset and conveys a right to control the use of that asset. IFRIC 4 is effective as at 1 January 2006. We do not expect the adoption of IFRIC 4 to have a material impact on our financial statements. During 2005 the IASB issued several amendments to IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The amendments relate to (a) the hedge accounting provisions, (b) the fair value option, (c) the requirements for financial guarantee contracts. All amendments have 1 January 2006 as the effective date and we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the amendments. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS The preparation of our financial statements, in accordance with IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Our estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. Accounting for business combinations and impairment of goodwill and other long lived intangible assets We accounted for all our business combinations under the purchase method. The cost of an acquired company is assigned to the tangible and intangible assets purchased and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires us to make estimates and use valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. In determining impairments of intangible assets, tangible fixed assets and goodwill, management must make significant judgements and estimates to determine whether the cash flows generated by those assets are less than their carrying value. Determining cash flows requires the use of judgements and estimates that have been included in the companys strategic plans and long-range forecasts. The data necessary for the execution of the impairment tests are based on management estimates of future cash flows, which require estimating revenue growth rates and profit margins. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is valued at historical cost using a component approach, less depreciation or at the recoverable amount whenever impairment has taken place. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life, taking into account any residual value. The assets residual values and useful lives are based on our best estimates, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. Impairment of receivables The risk of uncollectibility of accounts receivable is primarily estimated based on prior experience with, and the past due status of, doubtful debtors, while large accounts are assessed individually based on factors that include ability to pay, bankruptcy and payment history. In addition, debtors in certain countries are subject to a higher collectibility risk, which is taken into account when assessing the overall risk of uncollectibility. Should the outcome differ from the assumptions and estimates, revisions to the estimated valuation allowances would be required. Employee benefits Post-employment benefits represent obligations that will be settled in the future and require assumptions to project benefit obligations. Post-employment benefit accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees approximate service period, based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made. The accounting requires us to make assumptions regarding variables such as discount rate, rate of compensation increase, return on assets, and future healthcare costs. We consult with outside actuaries regarding these assumptions at least annually. Changes in these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the defined benefit obligations, funding requirements and pension cost incurred. For a discussion of the current funded status and a sensitivity analysis with respect to pension plan assumptions, refer to note 10. Restructuring Restructuring charges mainly result from restructuring operations, including consolidations and/or relocations of operations, changes in our strategic plan, or managerial responses to declines in demand, increasing costs or other market factors. Restructuring provisions reflect many estimates, including those pertaining to separation costs, consolidation of excess facilities, contract settlements and 124 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Financial statements Chapter 12 tangible asset impairments. Actual experience has been and may continue to be different from these estimates. Accrued current liabilities We also have to estimate the deferred revenues from stamps sold but not yet used by our customers. We use a seasonal model based on historical figures in order to account for the seasonal effects in sales to our customers (for example, sales for Christmas greetings in November and December). Income taxes We are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision and liability for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. We recognise liabilities for tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due, based on our best interpretation of the relevant tax laws. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. We recognise deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. This is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which deferred tax assets are recoverable. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, and depending on the tax strategies that we may be able to implement, changes to the recognition of deferred tax assets could be required, which could impact our financial position and net profit. Accounting for discontinued operations Accounting for discontinued operations requires the use of significant assumptions and estimates, such as the assumptions used in the fair value calculations as well as the estimated costs to sell. We have evaluated the assets held for sale of our discontinued logistics operations as a disposal group in performing our impairment analysis. Contingent liabilities Legal proceedings and tax issues covering a range of matters are pending in various jurisdictions against us. Due to the uncertainty inherent in such matters, it is often difficult to predict the final outcome. The cases and claims against us often raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues which are subject to many uncertainties and complexities, including but not limited to the facts and circumstances of each particular case and claim, the jurisdiction and the differences in applicable law. In the normal course of business, we consult with legal counsel and certain other experts on matters related to litigation and taxes. We accrue a liability when it is determined that an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In the event an adverse outcome is possible or an estimate is not determinable, the matter is disclosed. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks, such as market risks (including foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk. All of these risks arise in the normal course of business. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we utilise a variety of foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge certain exposures. The following analyses provide quantitative information regarding our exposure to the financial risks described above. There are certain limitations inherent in the analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that rates change in a parallel fashion and instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts assumed. We use derivative financial instruments solely for the purpose of hedging exposures. We enter into contracts related to derivative financial instruments for periods commensurate with our underlying exposures and do not take positions independent of these exposures. None of these financial instruments are leveraged or used for trading purposes or to take speculative positions. Foreign currency exchange risk We operate on an international basis generating foreign currency exchange risks arising from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities, investments and divestments in foreign currencies other than the euro, our functional and reporting currency. Our treasury department matches and manages the intragroup and external financial exposures. Although we generally enter into hedging arrangements and other contracts in order to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations, these measures may be inadequate or may subject us to increased operating or financing costs. The main four currencies of our external hedges are the British pound, US dollar, Chinese yuan and Canadian dollar. Significant acquisitions are usually funded in the currency of the underlying assets. Main exchange rates Year end closing1 Annual average2 British pound 0.6853 0.6832 US dollar 1.1797 1.2396 Chinese yuan 9.5204 10.1457 Canadian dollar 1.3726 1.4989 1 Source: European Central Bank, reference rates on the last day of the year. 2 The annual average is calculated as the 12-month's average of the month-end closing rates of the European Central Bank. 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 125 Back to Contents Chapter 12 Financial statements The potential loss in fair value on our foreign currency hedging instruments from an adverse 10% change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately €54 million and €69 million for 2005 and 2004. Commodity risk We lease and own a fleet of vehicles and aircraft to facilitate domestic and international delivery of mail, parcel and logistics activities. We are exposed to the risk of an increase in the prices of refined fuels, principally jet and diesel gasoline, which is used in the transportation of the goods we carry. We may enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge our expected consumption. Although we are of the opinion that a majority of the increases in price risks can be passed on to our customers, we may use a combination of options, swaps and futures contracts to provide some protection against rising fuel and energy prices. At 31 December 2005, we had no outstanding fuel contracts but we may enter into such contracts in the future. Credit risk Credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if counterparties with whom we enter into financial transactions are unable to fulfil the terms of the agreements. We attempt to minimise our credit risk exposure by only transacting to financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines. We continually monitor the credit standing of financial counterparties and reassess such exposures. Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available. A downgrade in our credit rating may negatively affect our ability to obtain funds from financial institutions and banks and increase our financing costs by increasing the interest rates of our outstanding debt or the interest rates at which we are able to refinance existing debt or incur new debt. Furthermore, other non TNT specific adverse market conditions could also turn out to have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition. Interest rate risk Part of our borrowings and leases are against floating interest rates. These floating interest rates may fluctuate substantially and could have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition in any given reporting period. Although we generally enter into hedging arrangements and other contracts in order to attempt to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations, these measures may be inadequate or may subject us to increased operating or financing costs. Our debt instruments, including debt associated with capital leases that bear interest at fixed rates of interest are exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates. The potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase from current market interest rates would have been approximately €15 million and €11 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. This analysis assumes a parallel shift in each currencys yield curve of interest rates. TRANSITION TO INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS AS ADOPTED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION Our financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005 are the first annual financial statements that comply with IFRS as adopted by the EU. References to IFRS Standards throughout this document refer to the application of IAS and related Interpretations of IFRIC and Interpretations of the SIC. We have applied IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, in preparing these consolidated financial statements. Since TNT is also listed on the New York Stock Exchange, it has to meet the requirements of the SEC. On 13 April 2005 the SEC adopted amendments to Form 20-F for foreign private issuers related to the first time adoption of IFRS. Under this amendment TNT is permitted to provide only one year of comparative IFRS balances in the consolidated financial statements for the year 2005. Our transition date to IFRS is 1 January 2004. We prepared our opening IFRS balance sheet at that date. The reporting date of these consolidated financial statements is 31 December 2005 and our IFRS adoption date is 1 January 2005. In preparing these consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS 1, we have applied the mandatory exceptions and certain of the optional exemptions from full retrospective application of IFRS. We have elected to apply the following optional exemptions from full retrospective application: Business combinations exemption We have applied the business combinations exemption in IFRS 1. We have not restated business combinations that took place prior to the 1 January 2004 transition date. Employee benefits exemption Until 31 December 2004 we applied SFAS 87, Employers accounting for pensions, as permitted under Dutch GAAP. As permitted under IFRS 1, we have elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses as at 1 January 2004. The unrecognised prior year service costs reported under SFAS 87 at the date of transition to IFRS are treated as a curtailment result under IAS 19 and have been adjusted against shareholders equity. Cumulative translation differences exemption We have elected to set the previously accumulated cumulative translation to zero at 1 January 2004. This exemption has been applied to all subsidiaries in accordance with IFRS 1. As a 126 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Financial statements Chapter 12 result the gain or loss on a subsequent disposal of any foreign operation shall exclude translation differences that arose prior to 1 January 2004 and shall include translation differences that will arise subsequent to this date. Exemption from restatement of comparatives for IAS 32 and IAS 39 We have elected to apply this exemption. We apply previous GAAP rules to derivatives, financial assets and financial liabilities and to hedging relationships for the 2004 comparative information. The adjustments required for differences between previous GAAP and IAS 32 and IAS 39 are determined and recognised at 1 January 2005. Designation of financial assets and financial liabilities exemption We have reclassified various securities as available-for-sale investments and as financial assets at fair value through profit and loss. The adjustments relating to IAS 32 and IAS 39 at the opening balance sheet date of 1 January 2005, the IAS 32/39 transition date, are detailed in Note Adoption of New IFRS Pronouncements. Share based payment transaction exemption We have elected to apply the share based payment exemption. We have applied IFRS 2 from 1 January 2004 to those options that were issued after 7 November 2002 but that have not vested by 1 January 2005. Fair value measurement of financial assets or liabilities at initial recognition We have not applied the exemption offered by the revision of IAS 39 on the initial recognition of the financial instruments measured at fair value through profit and loss where there is no active market. This exemption is therefore not applicable. Assets held for sale and discontinued operations exemption Although the effective date for adopting IFRS 5, Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations Exception, was 1 January 2005, as permitted under IFRS 5, we have applied the requirements of IFRS 5 prospectively from 1 January 2004. Assets held for sale or discontinued operations are recognised in accordance with IFRS 5 from 1 January 2004. We have applied the following mandatory exceptions from retrospective application: Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities exception Financial assets and liabilities derecognised before 1 January 2004 are not rerecognised under IFRS. The application of the exemption from restating comparatives for IAS 32 and IAS 39 means that we recognised from 1 January 2005 any financial assets and financial liabilities derecognised since 1 January 2004 that do not meet the IAS 39 derecognition criteria. Management did not choose to apply the IAS 39 derecognition criteria to an earlier date. Hedge accounting exception Management has claimed hedge accounting from 1 January 2005 only if the hedge relationship meets all hedge accounting criteria under IAS 39. Estimates exception Estimates under IFRS at 1 January 2004 should be consistent with estimates made for the same date under previous GAAP, unless there is evidence that those estimates were in error.

Our statements of income for our discontinued logistics business included in note 8 include such amounts. 2 In accordance with IFRS 5 our non-network related business has been presented as discontinued operations. Explanation of the effect of the transition to IFRS The following explains the material adjustments to the balance sheet and income statement. (A) RECLASSIFICATION OF DEFERRED TAXES Based on IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, we have reclassified deferred taxes from current assets to non-current financial fixed assets for an amount of €37 million in our IFRS opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2004 and of €40 million as at 31 December 2004. Furthermore, as at 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2004, we have separately presented the total amount of deferred tax assets amounting to €205 million and €395 million, respectively. 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 129 Back to Contents Chapter 12 Financial statements (B) RECLASSIFICATION OF CURRENT PROVISIONS As required under IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, we have reclassified the current part of provisions to current liabilities amounting to €49 million in the IFRS opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2004 and €49 million as at 31 December 2004. The impact on other provisions of discounting leads to a reduction of €2 million in the IFRS opening balance sheet at 1 January 2004, taking into account a deferred tax liability of €1 million. (C) GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS IFRS 3, Business Combinations, prohibits merger accounting and the amortisation of goodwill. The carrying amount of goodwill as at 1 January 2004 is equal to the carrying amount of goodwill previously reported under Dutch GAAP and amortisation previously reported under Dutch GAAP for 2004 has been reversed for IFRS purposes. Increase in goodwill balance reflects this reversal of goodwill amortisation charge of €146 million, partly offset by the recognition of additional intangible assets of €96 million. The associated tax impact on the reversal of goodwill amortisation amounts to €11 million in 2004. Any intangible asset that can be separately identified in a business combination in accordance with IAS 38, Intangible Assets, has been capitalised separately rather than being part of goodwill. This is applicable for all our business combinations after 1 January 2004. Other intangible assets increased as a result of the recognition of €96 million of other intangible assets from the acquisitions of Wilson, Ventana and Overtrans, offset by €6 million of amortisation expenses during 2004. (D) OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS As at 31 December 2004 and as at 1 January 2004, other employment benefit obligations increased by €41 million and by €43 million respectively. The increase is mainly due to recognising jubilee payments and applying the requirements of IAS 19, Employee benefits, to other post-employment plans. The effect of discounting of the related assets is €11 million as at 1 January 2004 and as at 31 December 2004. The net equity impact on the adjustment related to the other post-employment benefit obligations was €35 million as at 1 January 2004 and €34 million as at 31 December 2004, taking into account a deferred tax asset of €19 million as at 1 January 2004 and €18 million as at 31 December 2004. The operating profit impact of the transition to IFRS in 2004 is an additional charge of €4 million, with a related tax credit of €1 million. (E) EMPLOYEE BENEFITS  PENSIONS The employee benefit obligations decreased by €71 million in our IFRS opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2004 and decreased by €18 million as at 31 December 2004. The corresponding impact on equity in our IFRS opening balance sheet amounts to €47 million (31 December 2004: €11 million), taking into account a deferred tax liability of €24 million (31 December 2004: €7 million). The operating profit impact of the transition to IFRS in 2004 is an additional charge of €57 million, with a related tax credit of €19 million. (F) MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY In accordance with the requirements of SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, we recognised in our 2004 financial statements an additional minimum pension liability of €654 million representing a net loss that under SFAS 87 is not yet to be recognised as net periodic pension cost, but is to be reported as a reduction of equity, net of taxes. IAS 19 does not require us to account for an additional minimum pension liability for situations in which the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of the plan assets. As a result, the additional minimum pension liability has been reversed in the IFRS balance sheet as at 31 December 2004. Accordingly, the provision for pensions was reduced by €654 million, equity increased by €454 million and the deferred tax assets decreased by €200 million as at 31 December 2004. (G) SHARE BASED PAYMENT In accordance with IFRS 2, Share Based Payment, we have recognised a charge to income representing the fair value of outstanding employee share options granted to certain employees (senior management and Board of Management) in accordance with our share based compensation plans. The operating profit impact of the transition to IFRS in 2004 is an additional charge of €6 million. (H) OTHER In conformity with IAS 16, Property, plant and equipment, gains arising from the sale of property, plant and equipment shall not be classified as revenue, but as other income. In the 2004 IFRS income statement €8 million was reclassified from other operating revenue to other income. (I) CASH FLOWS The differences between cash flows presented in accordance with Dutch GAAP and under IFRS relate mainly to the adjustments to profit before taxes with respect to employee benefits of €57 million and ceasing of amortisation of goodwill of €146 million. Subsequent events For information relating to subsequent events reference is made to note 45. Service concession arrangements For information relating to our postal concession, reference is made to note 46. 130 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Financial statements Chapter 12 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS O 1 INTANGIBLE ASSETS: 1,838 MILLION (2004: 2,643) Statement of changes in intangible assets Goodwill Software Other intangibles Total Amortisation percentage 10% - 35% 0% - 35% Historical cost 3,196 200 13 3,409 Accumulated amortisation and impairments (887 ) (100 ) (1 ) (988 ) Balance at 1 January 2004 2,309 100 12 2,421 Changes in 2004 Additions 169 48 19 236 Disposals (22 ) (2 ) (24 ) (De)consolidation 3 1 4 Internal transfers/reclassifications 11 85 96 Amortisation and impairments (50 ) (8 ) (58 ) Exchange rate differences (31 ) (1 ) (32 ) Total changes 116 9 97 222 Historical cost 3,280 282 120 3,682 Accumulated amortisation and impairments (855 ) (173 ) (11 ) (1,039 ) Balance at 31 December 2004 2,425 109 109 2,643 Changes in 2005 Additions 26 63 17 106 Disposals (5 ) (1 ) (6 ) (De)consolidation (1 ) 5 4 Transfers to assets held for sale (812 ) (12 ) (10 ) (834 ) Internal transfers/reclassifications 18 (18 ) Amortisation and impairments (49 ) (16 ) (65 ) Exchange rate differences (8 ) 1 (3 ) (10 ) Total changes (799 ) 19 (25 ) (805 ) Historical cost 2,139 335 103 2,577 Accumulated amortisation and impairments (513 ) (207 ) (19 ) (739 ) Balance at 31 December 2005 1,626 128 84 1,838 (in € millions, except percentages) Intangible assets as at 31 December 2005 of €895 million related to our discontinued logistics business is included in assets held for sale. €834 million included in the table above as transferred to assets held for sale represents the balance as at 1 January 2005 and does not reflect the movements (mainly related to foreign exchange effects) during 2005. Goodwill is not amortised but is subject to annual impairment review. For our impairment review purposes, all goodwill, including goodwill generated from the acquisition of TNT and GD Express Worldwide, is allocated to the applicable cash generating units (CGUs). Of the total goodwill balance of €1,626 million, we have allocated €1,201 million to our Express Europe CGU, €152 million to our combined CGU European Mail Networks, €140 million to our Freight Management CGU, €70 million to our other express CGUs and €62 million to our other mail CGUs. The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations by using the discounted cash flow model. These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 10-year period. TNTs management has demonstrated that its cash flow projections have been reliable in the past. The value beyond the 10-year period is determined using a sector specific multiple. We determined the budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations for market development. The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports. The discount rates used in the CGU valuations vary from 7% to 8% to reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segments. 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 131 Back to Contents Chapter 12 Financial statements Software balance includes internally generated software with a book value of €103 million at 31 December 2005 (2004: 82). Other intangible assets mainly relate to customer lists of €75 million (2004: 92) and software under construction of €8 million (2004: 16). The estimated amortisation expenses for software and other intangibles for the subsequent five years are 2006: €20 million, 2007: €35 million, 2008: €23 million, 2009: €16 million, 2010: €10 million and after 2011: €108 million. Of the additions in software, €37 million related to selfproduced software. Additions to other intangible assets include €7 million related to software licences. We do not conduct research and development, in the narrow sense, comparable with the normal activities in this area. Therefore we do not incur research and development costs in the narrow sense.

Historical cost refers to, amongst others, the then current value of the property, plant and equipment contributed by the former parent Royal PTT Nederland N.V. to our company upon incorporation on 1 January 1989. The calculation of the depreciation expense on these assets takes into account the useful life that had already elapsed at that date. The book value at 31 December 2005 of these assets contributed to our company on 1 January 1989 is €100 million (2004: 103), net of accumulated depreciation of €221 million (2004: 287). Aircraft, including spare parts, are classified as other property, plant and equipment. Aircraft and (spare) engines are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives to estimated residual values of 20%. Depending on the type of aircraft, the useful life varies from 10 to 25 years. Spare parts are depreciated to their estimated residual value on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated useful life of the associated aircraft or engine type. The book value of aircraft including spare parts is €221 million (2004: 243), comprising a historical cost of €375 million (2004: 371) with accumulated depreciation €154 million (2004: 128). All 43 aircraft (2004:42) are operated by the express business. Included in the property, plant and equipment balance as at 31 December 2005 are: Land and buildings Plant and equipment Other Construction in progress Total Under finance lease 25 7 52 84 Mail 10 10 Express 15 7 52 74 Freight management Pledged as security 33 33 Mail Express 33 33 Freight management (in € millions) Included in land and buildings under financial lease are lease hold rights and ground rent. The book value of the lease hold rights and ground rent in mail is €10 million (2004: 9), comprising a historical cost of €16 million with accumulated depreciation of €6 million. The book value of the lease hold rights and ground rent in express is €15 million (2004: 16), comprising a historical cost of €19 million with accumulated depreciation of €4 million. There are no existing contracts for lease hold and ground rents longer than 20 years or contracts with indefinite terms. Lease hold rights and ground rent for land and buildings are mainly in Belgium for €11 million and in the Netherlands for €10 million. The property, plant and equipment of €33 million (2004: 48) which are pledged as security to third parties are in Germany. We do not hold freehold office buildings for long term investments and for long term rental income purposes. The rental income is based upon incidental rental contracts with third parties for buildings which are temporarily not in use by TNT or based upon contracts which are supportive to the primary business activities of our company. There are no material capitalised borrowing costs in the capital expenditure of property, plant and equipment in 2005 and 2004. There are no material temporarily idle property, plant and equipment (2004: 4) on 31 December 2005. The gross carrying amount of fully depreciated property, plant and equipment that is still in use is €322 million (2004: 261) of which €280 million (2004: 232) is related to plant and equipment, €42 million (2004: 29) is related to land and buildings. 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 133 Back to Contents Chapter 12 Financial statements O 3 FINANCIAL FIXED ASSETS: 273 MILLION (2004: 503) Statement of changes in financial fixed assets Investments in associates Other loans receivable Deferred tax assets Prepayments and accrued income Total Balance at 31 December 2004 84 21 253 145 503 Adoption of IAS 32/39 (3 ) (3 ) Balance at 1 January 2005 84 21 253 142 500 Changes in 2005 Acquisitions/additions 13 3 38 2 56 Disposals/decreases (7 ) (61 ) (68 ) Transfers to assets held for sale (40 ) (5 ) (46 ) (110 ) (201 ) (De)consolidation 1 (4 ) (3 ) Withdrawals/repayments (1 ) (6 ) (7 ) (14 ) Exchange rate differences 3 1 4 Other changes (2 ) 1 (1 ) Total changes (37 ) (8 ) (65 ) (117 ) (227 ) Balance at 31 December 2005 47 13 188 25 273 (in € millions) Financial fixed assets as at 31 December 2005 of €160 million related to our discontinued logistics business is included in assets held for sale. €201 million included in the table above as transferred to assets held for sale represents the balance as at 1 January 2005 and does not reflect the movements during 2005. The opening balance sheet adjustment for adoption of IAS 32/39 relates to the changed accounting policy for the 5.125% Eurobond 2008 of which €3 million relates to the issuing costs still to be amortised. These capitalised costs are included in the valuation at amortised cost and stated as part of the book value of the 5.125% Eurobond 2008. Investments in associates at 31 December 2005 include goodwill of €1 million (2004: 1). Deferred tax assets are further explained in note 23. Our investment in Logispring Investment Fund Holding B.V. is our most significant investment in an associate. We account for this investment using the equity method.

The fair value has been calculated at the relevant market (forward) rates at 31 December 2005. The notional principal amount of the outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts at 31 December 2005 is €482 million (2004: 901). In addition, it also includes a net interest receivable of €4 million on the €500 million interest rate swaps. Prepayments and accrued income also includes the fair value of put and call options. As agreed on 15 July 2004, on 14 October 2004, our subsidiary Royal TPG Post B.V. and Essent N.V. established a company named Cendris BSC Customer Contact B.V. in which the ordinary share capital, carrying equal voting rights, is split 51% and 49% respectively. Cendris BSC Customer Contact B.V. provides call centre activities to TNT, Essent N.V. and third parties. The terms and conditions of the shareholders agreement provide Royal TPG Post B.V. with the option to call, as of 14 October 2007, on the shares of Essent N.V. and for Essent N.V. to put, as of 14 October 2007, its shares to Royal TPG Post B.V. where the price is determined by the fair market value of the shares. As the call option is based on the fair market value of the shares, the fair market value of the call option is zero.

Prepayments and accrued income as at 31 December 2005 of €157 million related to our discontinued logistics business is included in assets held for sale. O 7 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: 559 MILLION (2004: 633) Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand of €325 million (2004: 297). Short term bank deposits are €234 million (2004: 336). The effective interest rate during 2005 on short term bank deposits was 2.08% and the average outstanding amount was €216 million. Included in cash and cash equivalents is €140 million (2004: 171) of restricted cash. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates the carrying value. Cash and cash equivalents as at 31 December 2005 of €104 million related to our discontinued logistics business is included in assets held for sale. 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 135 Back to Contents Chapter 12 Financial statements O 8 ASSETS HELD FOR SALE: 2,378 MILLION (2004: 0) LIABILITIES RELATED TO ASSETS CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE: 1,230 MILLION (2004: 0) In December 2005 we announced a strategy to focus on our core competency of providing delivery services by expertly managing delivery networks. Based on the refined strategy we will now manage our business through two divisions: mail and express, with the express division including both our express and our freight management businesses. Our assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale include our non-network related logistics business we intend to divest. The majority of our logistics business in France was sold prior to year end and the remainder of the French business has since been sold. We will retain our freight management and our innight activities and these activities have been included in the express division. The major classes of assets and liabilities comprising the operations classified as held for sale and an analysis of the result from discontinued operations are as follows: At 31 December Balance sheet 2005 Intangible assets 895 Property, plant and equipment 345 Financial fixed assets 160 Current assets 978 Total assets 2,378 Deferred tax liabilities 30 Provisions for pension liabilities 107 Other non-current liabilities 133 Current liabilities 960 Total liabilities 1,230 (in € millions) All inter-company balances as at 31 December 2005 between our discontinued logistics business and our continuing business have been eliminated. Assets of €2,378 million include €12 million of assets held for sale in the mail and express segments and are not related to our discontinued logistics business. The difference between the remaining assets of €2,366 million and liabilities of €1,230 million consists of a combination of equity and financing from TNT. Current liabilities include a €222 million Canadian dollar denominated, syndicated facility that was signed in May 2001, at a rate of interest of three month Canadian LIBOR plus a margin of 0.325%. At 31 December 2005, the average rate of interest on this facility was 3.11%. In connection with the acquisition of our 51% interest in TNT Arvil, we granted a put option to the minority shareholder, Ecotrans. Ecotrans has the right to sell their shares in TNT Arvil based on a price that has been determined in the shareholders agreement. Under the put option, the price at which the 49% shares can be sold to us includes a premium rate over the value at which the estimated price the option shares would be trading if TNT Arvil were a publicly traded company. This was deemed to be the fair market value. The fair value was estimated at €13 million and is included in total non-current liabilities. Contingent liabilities Commitments and contingencies as at 31 December 2005 amount to €706 million and mainly relate to rent and operating leases of €580 million, guarantees of €114 million and commitments on capital expenditure of €7 million. Contingent assets As a result of the sale and the consequent liquidation of the remaining relevant entities of our French business. We expect to realise a tax credit of approximately €90 million. This potential benefit has not been reflected in our accounts.

Net interest expense of €51 million (2004: 48) related to debt, as part of our cash management strategy, that can be allocated to our discontinued logistics business has been included in the statements of income. The statements of income also include costs related to shared services of €21 million (2004: 14) directly attributable to our discontinued logistics business. 136 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Financial statements Chapter 12 The total amount of our results from discontinued logistics operations for 2005 includes the results of the sale of the majority of our French operations to Norbert Dentressangle and to Malherbe amounting to a loss of €102 million, pre-tax. The basis of allocation for net sales and total assets by geographical area is the country or region in which the entity recording the sales is located. Net sales per geographic region were as follows: Geographical information Net sales Property, plant and equipment Intangible assets Number of employees Europe The Netherlands 178 5 18 1,063 United Kingdom 647 100 130 7,373 Italy 962 43 195 6,379 France 191 26 76 1,998 Germany 250 9 713 Sweden 3 1 Rest of Europe 223 34 9 2,721 Americas USA and Canada 662 62 462 6,738 South & Middle America 135 5 4 5,131 Africa & the Middle East Australia & Pacific 152 25 799 Asia China and Taiwan 90 18 1 342 Rest of Asia 49 6 2,027 Total 3,542 333 895 35,285 (in € millions) 1 Assets held for sale of €12 million in mail and express are not included The cash flows relating to our discontinued operations is as follows: Cash flow statements Year ended at 31 December 2005 2004 Net cash from operating activities 28 250 Net cash used in investing (19 ) (22 ) activities Net cash used in financing 19 (216 ) activities Change in cash 28 12 Cash at the beginning of the 71 60 period Exchange rate differences 5 (1 ) Change in cash 28 12 Cash at the end of the period 104 71 (in € millions) Net cash from operating activities is lower by €222 million mainly due to €102 million relating to the disposal of our French logistics businesses in 2005 combined with lower operating income, resulting from contract terminations mainly in the United Kingdom, lower volumes in automotive contracts and deteriorating performance related to the disposed French logistics business. The financing relating to our discontinued logistics business of €28 million (2004: 211) as shown in our consolidated cash flow statements is included in the net cash used in financing activities. O 9 EQUITY: 3,279 MILLION (2004: 3,344) Equity consists of shareholders equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent of €3,262 million (2004: 3,325) and minority interest of €17 million (2004: 19). See note 36 for additional details on shareholders equity. O 10 PROVISIONS FOR PENSION LIABILITIES: 136 MILLION (2004: 339) We operate a number of pension plans around the world. Most of our non-Dutch pension plans are defined contribution plans. For our non-Dutch employees we also operate other post-employment benefit plans and defined benefit plans, for which the liabilities are separately covered by private insurers and foreign pension funds. Our main Dutch company pension plan, which is externally funded in Stichting Pensioenfonds TNT, covers the employees who are subject to our collective labour agreement in the Netherlands. The majority of all our Dutch employees are subject to the collective labour agreement. The plan covers some 92,000 participants including approximately 12,000 pensioners and some 30,000 former employees. By Dutch law the plan is carried out by a separate legal entity and is managed by an independent board that falls under the supervision of the Nederlandsche Bank (DNB). 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 137 Back to Contents Chapter 12 Financial statements As from 1 January 2006 new fiscal regulations apply to the Dutch pension plans. TNT agreed with the labour unions a new employee benefit package that complies with the new fiscal regulations. All early retirement benefits are cancelled for employees born after 1949. The decrease in prospective benefits is largely offset by improved regular pension benefits, the introduction of conditional pension benefits, a senior arrangement with full salary payment for part-time labour and a salary allowance for employees born between1950 and 1954. Employees born before 1950 are also affected by the overall changes. The early retirement date for these employees is postponed by 3.5 months. All other elements of their pension and early retirement benefits remain unchanged. In the pension plan only the employer contributes to the fund. The level of contribution is based upon actuarial recommendations. In addition and subject to our funding agreement with the plan we have to pay additional contributions to the pension fund in order to satisfy the minimum funding requirements of the DNB. The total contribution to the main pension fund amounted to €145 million in 2005 (2004: 159) and is estimated to be €113 million in 2006. The benefits for early retirement are directly paid by TNT to the pensioner. These payments amounted to €98 million in 2005 (2004: 95) and are estimated at €99 million for 2006. The pension fund runs an actively managed investment portfolio. The pension fund uses asset and liability management studies that generate future scenarios to determine its optimal asset mix. During 2005, the dynamic weight of equity investments increased to 47.5%, the dynamic weight of fixed interest investments decreased to 44.6% and the weight of real estate investments (including international) went down to 7.9%. For 2005 no rebalancing has taken place and it is expected that in 2006 the strategic mix will move to a percentage of 49% in equity investments, 40% in fixed interest investments and real estate investments of 11%. Investments in equity consist of 50% of a European equity portfolio and 50% of a worldwide equity portfolio, all of which is hedged against US dollar exposure. The fixed income portfolios consist of 50% government bonds for the eurozone. Actual asset mix at 31 December 2005 2004 Equities 47.5% 44.9% Fixed interest 44.6% 46.5% Real estate 7.9% 8.6% Cash 0.0% 0.0% Total 100.0% 100.0% Historical returns 2005 10-year average 12-year average Equities 21.1% 11.6% 9.7% Fixed interest 5.3% 6.7% 6.9% Real estate 8.8% 10.6% 7.7% The liabilities of our main plan and transitional plan cover approximately 94.8% of our total pension liabilities and the assets cover approximately 93.6% of our total pension assets. The return on plan assets totalled 12.7% in 2005 (2004: 8.8%). Pension costs recognised in the statements of income Inherent to the valuation of our pensions and the determination of our pension cost are key assumptions which include: employee turnover, mortality and retirement ages, discount rates, expected long term returns on plan assets and future wage increases, which are usually updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each financial year. Actual circumstances may vary from these assumptions giving rise to a different pension liability, which would be reflected as an additional profit or expense in our statement of income. In 2005, our employer pension expense was €141 million (2004: 185). Total cash contributions in 2005 amounted to €264 million (2004: 437) and are expected to amount to approximately €222 million in 2006. Cash contributions to the main and other pension funds totalled €166 million. Of these payments €59 million was contributed as prescribed by the minimum funding requirements of the DNB. Our cash payments for pensions, which fall under the transitional plan for early retirement in the Netherlands and are directly paid by TNT amounted to €98 million.

Provisions for restructuring include provisions related to restructuring projects in the mail division for €41 million and in the express division for €2 million. Restructuring in our mail division includes projects for mail activities in the Netherlands. During the year approximately 430 (2004: 1,004) employees were made redundant through such reorganisations, as a result of a combination of efficiency improvements and the impact of restructuring of the operations of our customers. Of the employees made redundant during the year, paid via the restructuring provisions, 360 (2004: 300) related to mail, 70 (2004: 704) related to employees in express. Other provisions of €91 million (2004: 100) mainly relate to provisions for claims of €22 million (2004: 27), provisions for onerous contracts of €3 million (2004: 8), provision for Italian subcontractor fees of €2 million and other provisions. The estimated utilisation in 2006 is €29 million, in 2007 €13 million, 2008 €6 million and 2009 and beyond €86 million. O 13 LONG TERM DEBT: 1,071 MILLION (2004: 1,440) At 31 December Carrying amounts and fair value of long term debt 2005 2004 Carrying amount Fair value Carrying amount Fair value Euro Bonds 1,009 1,094 1,000 1,079 Finance leases 24 24 86 86 Other loans 31 31 354 348 Interest rate swaps 7 7 Total long term debt 1,071 1,156 1,440 1,513 (in € millions) Long term debt as at 31 December 2005 of €61 million related to our discontinued logistics business is included in liabilities relating to assets classified as held for sale. The table below sets forth the amounts of interest-bearing long term liabilities during each of the following five years and thereafter: 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 141 Back to Contents Chapter 12 Financial statements Total borrowings Euro Bonds Finance leases Other loans Interest rate swaps Bank debt Total 2006 4 144 65 213 2007 5 4 9 2008 641 3 2 646 2009 3 2 5 2010 2 3 5 Thereafter 368 11 20 7 406 Total borrowings 1,009 28 175 7 65 1,284 of which included in long term debt 1,009 24 31 7 1,071 of which included in other current liabilities 4 144 65 213 (in € millions) The fair value of long term debt, net of current portion, has been estimated by calculating the discounted value of the loan portfolio using an estimated yield curve, appropriate for the contract terms in effect at the end of the year. The carrying amounts of current portion of long term debt approximate their fair value. On 5 December 2001, TNT N.V. issued a €1 billion Eurobond with an original maturity of seven years. The bond has a coupon of 5.125% and began paying interest annually in arrears on 5 December 2002. In May 2005 €354 million of the €1 billion 5.125% Eurobond 2008 was exchanged for €386 million of a new 10-year 3.875% Eurobond 2015. At the time of the exchange, the 2015 bond was increased with an additional €14 million to an outstanding total amount of €400 million. The total €1,046 million of Eurobonds will be measured at amortised cost of €1,011 million. A fair value adjustment of positive €2 million has been reflected in the amortised cost value to adjust the amortised cost value to the book value. The book value of the nominal €1,046 million of Eurobonds amounted to €1,009 million as at 31 December 2005. TNT has a total €500 million (2004: 300) of interest rate swaps outstanding for which we receive fixed interest and pay floating interest. These interest rate swaps act as a hedge against the fair value interest rate risk of our 5.125% December 2008 Eurobond. The market value of these instruments amounted to negative €2 million as at 31 December 2005 (2004: -1). In December 2005, we entered into €500 million of forward starting interest rate swaps whereby we will receive floating interest and pay fixed interest. These flows of interest exchanges under the forward starting interest rate swaps will start per December 2008. These interest rate swaps act as a hedge against the cash flow interest rate risk of the non-agreed upon additional funding to the 5.125% December 2008 Eurobond. Per the June 2005 exchange for the new 3.875% 2015 Eurobond we have decided to unwind €400 million of outstanding forward starting interest rate swaps whereby we paid the market value of €12 million. Because the forward starting swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge, the market value will stay in equity until December 2008 and will be straight-line amortised to income until December 2015. The market value of this long term €100 million outstanding forward starting interest rate swap amounted to €5 million as at 31 December 2005 (2004: 0). As the forward starting swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge, the market value movement has been included in equity. Total borrowings include bank loans of €18 million (2004: 21), which are secured by property, plant and equipment. At 31 December 2005, committed facilities with domestic and international banks amounted to €1 billion. This undrawn revolving syndicated facility will mature in 2012. The facility was negotiated in 2005. We lease several aircraft for our express business. Furthermore, we lease several buildings, trucks and trailers for our mail and express business. None of the individual lease arrangements are deemed significant. O 14 OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES: 571 MILLION (2004: 507) At 31 December 2005 2004 Short term bank debt 65 36 Current portion of long term debt 148 15 Total current borrowings 213 51 Taxes and social security contributions 137 273 Expenses to be paid 62 44 Other 159 139 Total 571 507 (in € millions) 142 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Financial statements Chapter 12 As at 31 December 2004 long term debt includes a €129 million bilateral loan agreement maturing in 2020 with fixed interest rate of 5.85%. In 2005, the loan agreement was changed to a bullet loan maturing in 2006 with a fixed interest of 2.54% and is included in current portion of long term debt. Included in the €159 million, in another €17 million related to shares purchased under the share buy back programme. Other current liabilities also include a fair value of €31 million (2004: 8) of all outstanding short term foreign exchange forward contracts and a basis swap. A basis swap is a hedge on an inter-company loan receivable or payable. Of the €31 million an amount of €0.4 million qualifies for hedge accounting and has been included directly in shareholders equity. The fair value has been calculated against the relevant market (forward) rates at 31 December 2005. The notional principal amount of the outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts at 31 December 2005 is €794 million (2004: 359). The balance of 31 December 2005 that is expected to be settled after 12 months is €70 million (2004: 58). Other current liabilities as at 31 December 2005 of €398 million related to our discontinued logistics business is included in liabilities relating to assets classified as held for sale.

The balance of the €1,126 million that is expected to be settled after 12 months is €45 million (2004: 12). Accrued current liabilities as at 31 December 2005 of €292 million related to our discontinued logistics business is included in liabilities relating to assets classified as held for sale.

The yearly average is calculated by summing the monthly numbers and dividing the result by twelve. At the end of 2005, 6,315 people (2004: 6,735) were employed by joint ventures, of whom 4,562 (2004: 4,964) were on the payroll of Dutch companies, primarily Postkantoren B.V., and 1,753 (2004: 1,771) were on the payroll of companies outside the Netherlands. In 2005 the average number of average full-time employee equivalents in the mail division was 42,482. This was a decrease of 4.5% compared to last year and was mainly caused by restructuring plans and natural attrition in the Netherlands. The 5% increase of average full-time employee equivalents in express was mainly caused by organic growth.

In addition, we contributed €14,521 for Dave Kulik and €180,000 for Marie-Christine Lombard under a defined contribution scheme. Performance Share Scheme The performance share scheme is an equity-settled plan with annual grants. Participants will be granted a conditional right over a number of TNT shares. The number of shares comprised in the share award reflects the position that the participant holds and managements assessment of their future contribution to the company. Participants will become owner of the share after a period of three years (vesting period). The plan includes market based vesting conditions such that the number of shares is dependent on TNTs Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance relative to certain other stock indices. These conditions are included in the calculation of the fair value at grant date. This plan is similar to the stock option plan as described below with the only difference that the exercise price of performance shares is equal to zero.  Performance shares were granted in May 2005 to about 1,000 managers in the current TNT group at a fair value of €14.11. These grants were part of the policy of granting rights on performance shares each year to eligible members of senior management from 2005 onwards.  Shares will become unconditional at the third anniversary of the grant (May 2008).  The participant retains the right to be compensated when he/she leaves the company for certain reasons (retirement, certain reorganisations, disability or death). The total number of rights on performance shares for management granted in 2005 is stated below. Rights on performance shares management Number of rights on performance shares Year Outstanding as at 1 Jan 2005 Granted during 2005 Exercised during 2005 Forfeited during 2005 Outstanding as at 31 Dec 2005 Remaining years in contractual life Management 2005 1,236,890 183 25,737 1,210,970 2.3 In the outstanding number of rights on performance shares in the table above, an estimated total of 329,000 is related to our discontinued logistics business. Management option plan No options were granted in 2005. In 2005 the option plans was replaced by the performance share scheme. The number of options granted in each of the three years that will ultimately be eligible for exercise is dependent on our total shareholder return relative to a peer group of direct competitors and a peer group of AEX companies. Option rights were granted in accordance with the management option plan, which is approved by the Supervisory Board. This plan sets out the procedures for share option grants in more than 40 countries around the world. The significant aspects of the plan are:  options are granted at the average market price as traded on the Euronext Amsterdam on the date the grant is made (2004: €18.44/share),  for options granted in 2003 and 2004 the option is exercisable between the third and eighth anniversary of the day of grant; after eight years the outstanding options are forfeited,  for options granted prior to 2003 the option is exercisable between the third and fifth anniversary of the day of grant; after five years the outstanding options are forfeited,  the option holder retains the right to exercise his/her option when he/she leaves the company for certain reasons (retirement, certain reorganisations, disability or death), and  the option holder loses the right to exercise his/her option when he/she leaves the company for reasons other than those mentioned above.

In the outstanding total number of options in the table above an estimated total of 1.9 million options with a weighted average exercise price of €17.85 is related to our discontinued logistics business. Bonus/matching plan for senior management Members of a select group of senior managers were paid 75% of their 2002, 2003 and 2004 bonus in cash and 25% as a grant of TNT shares with an associated matching right in 2005 (121,345), 2004 (107,710) and in 2003 (54,405) if at least 50% of the shares are kept for three years. We see the bonus/matching plan as part of our remuneration package for the members of our top management, and it is particularly aimed at further aligning their interests with the interests of the shareholders. The rights on bonus and matching shares are granted in accordance with the bonus/matching plan, which has been approved by the Supervisory Board. 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 151 Back to Contents Chapter 12 Financial statements The significant aspects of the plan are:  the grant of the right on bonus shares is in lieu of 25% of an individuals annual bonus payment, and bonus shares are delivered shortly after the right is granted,  the number of bonus shares is calculated by dividing 25% of an individuals gross annual bonus relating to the preceding financial year by the weighted average share price on the Euronext Amsterdam on the date the grant is made (2005: €20.55/share),  the rights on matching shares are granted for zero and the number of shares is equal to the number of bonus shares,  the matching shares are delivered three years after the delivery of the bonus shares. One matching share is delivered for each bonus share that has been retained for three years,  for each bonus share that is sold within three years, the associated right to one matching share lapses. If more than 50% of the bonus shares are sold within three years, the entire right to matching shares lapses with immediate effect,  where a participant leaves the company for certain reasons (retirement, certain reorganisations, disability or death) the right to matching shares will vest immediately and he/she can exercise his/her right pro rata, and  a participant loses the right to exercise his/her right on matching shares when he/she leaves the company for reasons other than those mentioned above, The exercise of the rights on matching shares is subject to the TNT rules concerning inside information that apply to our company. All awards under this plan are equity settled. The table below summarises the status of the number of outstanding rights on matching shares granted to senior managers in the current TNT group: Number of matching rights on shares Bonus connecting matching rights Management Year Outstanding as at 1 Jan 2005 Granted during 2005 Exercised or forfeited during 2005 Outstanding as at 31 Dec 2005 Remaining years in contractual life Management 2003 46,739 1,780 44,959 0.3 2004 97,707 2,921 94,786 1.3 2005 117,399 3,095 114,304 2.3 144,446 117,399 7,796 254,049 In the outstanding number of matching rights on shares in the table above, an estimated total of 43,000 is related to our discontinued logistics business. Fair value assumptions and hedging Our share based payments have been measured using the Monte Carlo fair value measurement method. Significant assumptions used in our calculations are as follows: 2005 2004 Share price (in ) 20.71 18.44 Volatility (%) 28.35 32.39 Vesting period (in years) 3 3 Risk free rate (%) 2.39 4.09 Dividend yield (%) 3.13 2.90 As of 5 May 2005, the 2005 grant date, the fair value of our matching shares awarded was €18.62 and the fair value of our performance shares awarded was €14.11. As of 27 April 2004, the 2004 grant date, the fair value of our options awarded was €4.73, of our matching shares was €16.29 and of our performance shares awarded was €10.74. We manage our risk in connection with the obligations we have under the existing share and option plans by purchasing shares in the market. In 2005, 2004 and 2003 we purchased no shares for hedging purposes. At 31 December 2005, we held a total of 33,251,915 (2004: 12,579,942) shares of which 3,791,438 shares were held to cover share schemes (2004: 4,979,942), purchased at a weigthed average price per share of €22.06 (2004: 21.92). O 20 DEPRECIATION, AMORTISATION AND IMPAIRMENTS: 320 MILLION (2004: 303) Year ended at 31 December 2005 2004 Amortisation of other intangibles 65 53 Depreciation and impairment 255 250 property, plant and equipment Total 320 303 (in € millions) Impairment costs for property, plant and equipment of €9 million (2004: 11) are included in the depreciation expense.

O 22 NET FINANCIAL INCOME AND EXPENSES Interest and similar income: 115 million (2004: 99) Interest and similar income in 2005 of €115 million mainly relates to interest income on funding our discontinued logistics business of €72 million, interest of €21 million relating to an income tax refund, interest income on loans and deposits of €12 million and other interest income relating to outstanding hedges. Interest and similar income in 2004 of €99 million mainly relates to interest income on funding our discontinued business of €66 million, interest income on loans and deposits of €12 million, a one-off gain of €11 million on the unwind of a US dollar 435 million swap and other interest income relating to outstanding hedges. Interest and similar expenses: 121 million (2004: 117) Year ended at 31 December 2005 2004 Interest on long term liabilities 54 61 Interest added to provisions 2 1 Interest on short term liabilities 11 8 Foreign currency swaps - fair value hedges 23 9 Net foreign exchange transaction gains/losses 2 2 Other financial expenses 29 36 Total 121 117 (in € millions) Interest and similar expense in 2005 of €121 million mainly relates to interest expense on long term borrowings of €54 million and fair value adjustments on the outstanding fair value hedges of €23 million. Other financial expenses of €29 million mainly relates to interest expense on funding from our discontinued logistics business of €21 million. Interest and similar expense in 2004 of €117 million mainly relates to interest expense on long term borrowing of €61 million and amortisation of expenses relating to hedging instruments and of €9 million. Other financial expenses of €36 million mainly relates to interest expense on funding from our discontinued logistics business of €18 million. O 23 INCOME TAXES: 379 MILLION (2004: 375) Income taxes in the statement of income of 2005 amount to €379 million (2004: 375), or 32.9% (2004: 34.2%) of income before income taxes. Of the €379 million, €99 million of our total income taxes related to tax authorities outside the Netherlands. Year ended at 31 December 2005 2004 Dutch statutary income tax rate: 31.5 34.5 Adjustment regarding effective income tax rates other countries (0.9 ) (1.9 ) Permanent differences: Non and partly deductible costs 1.4 0.9 Exempt income (0.4 ) Other 1.3 0.7 Effective income tax rate 32.9 34.2 (in percentages) 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 153 Back to Contents Chapter 12 Financial statements Income taxes differ from the amount calculated by multiplying the Dutch statutory corporate income tax rate with the income before income taxes. In 2005, the effective income tax rate was 32.9% (2004: 34.2%), which is higher than the statutory corporate income tax rate of 31.5% in the Netherlands (2004: 34.5%). The decline of the effective tax rate compared to 2004 is predominantly the result of a decrease in the Dutch statutory income tax rate. Income tax expense consists of the following: Year ended at 31 December 2005 2004 Current tax expense 338 345 Changes in deferred taxes (excluding acquisitions / foreign exchange effects) 41 30 Total income taxes 379 375 (in € millions) At 31 December 2005 2004 Income tax receivable 78 162 Income tax payable (233 ) (130 ) Netted current income tax positions (155 ) 32 (in € millions) In 2005, the current tax expense amounted to €338 million (2004: 345). The difference between the total income taxes in the statements of income and the current tax expense is due to timing differences. These differences are recognised as deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. The following table shows the movements in deferred tax assets in 2005: Deferred tax assets at 31 December 2004 253 Transfers to assets held for sale (46 ) Changes credited directly to equity 5 Other changes (28 ) (De)consolidation/foreign exchange effects 4 Deferred tax assets at 31 December 2005 188 (in € millions) Deferred tax assets as at 31 December 2005 include €36 million related to our discontinued logistics business and is included in assets held for sale. €46 million included in the table on deferred tax assets as transferred to assets held for sale represents the balance as at 1 January 2005 and does not reflect the movements during 2005. Deferred tax assets arise because of the following differences: At 31 December 2005 2004 Differences between valuation for book and tax purposes of: Provisions 18 46 Property, plant and equipment 6 5 Losses carried forward 71 98 Other 93 104 Total deferred tax assets 188 253 (in € millions) Deferred tax assets and liabilities with the same term and the same consolidated tax group are presented net in the balance sheet if we have a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts. Out of the total "other" deferred tax assets of €93 million (2004: 104) an amount of €42 million (2004: 45) relating to temporary differences for assets that are both capitalised and depreciable for tax purposes only. The total accumulated losses available for carry forward at 31 December 2005 amounted to €662 million (2004: 627). With these losses carried forward, future tax benefits of €211 million could be recognised (2004: 202). Tax deductible losses give rise to deferred tax assets at the statutory rate in the relevant country. Deferred tax assets are recognised if it is probable that they will be realised in the foreseeable future. The probability of the realisation is impacted by uncertainties regarding the utilisation of such benefits, for example as a result of the expiry of tax losses carried forward and legislative changes. As a result we have not recognised €140 million (2004: 123) of the potential future tax benefits and have recorded net deferred tax assets of €71 million at the end of 2005 (2004: 79). The expiration of total accumulated losses is presented in the table below: 2006 10 2007 6 2008 12 2009 11 2010 and thereafter 137 Indefinite 486 Total 662 (in € millions) 154 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Financial statements Chapter 12 The following table shows the movements in deferred tax liabilities in 2005: Deferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2004 236 Transfers to liabilities related to assets classified as held for sale (20 ) Changes 17 Deferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2005 233 (in € millions) Deferred tax liabilities as at 31 December 2005 include €30 million related to our discontinued logistics business and are included in liabilities related to assets classified as held for sale. €20 million included in the table on deferred tax liabilities as transferred to liabilities related to assets classified as held for sale represents the balance as at 1 January 2005 and does not reflect the movements during 2005. Deferred tax liabilities arise because of the following differences: At 31 December 2005 2004 Differences between valuation for book and tax purposes of: Provisions 153 122 Property, plant and equipment 62 73 Other 18 41 Total deferred tax liabilities 233 236 (in € millions) Multinational groups the size of TNT are exposed to varying degrees of uncertainty related to tax planning and regulatory reviews and audits. We account for our income taxes on the basis of our own internal analyses, supported by external advice. We continually monitor our global tax position, and whenever uncertainties arise, we assess the potential consequences and either accrue the liability or disclose a contingent liability in our financial statements, depending on the strength of our position and the resulting risk of loss. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENTS O 24 NET CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES: 984 MILLION (2004: 708) In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was €984 million, which is an increase of 39% compared to 2004 ( €708 million). Profit before income taxes contributed €1,151 million or €1,471 million if adjusted for the non-cash impact of depreciation, amortisation and impairments, an increase of €72 million or 5% compared to last year (€1,399 million). The changes in pension liabilities of €123 million (2004: 254) reflects the total non-cash charges for the defined benefit pension schemes of €141 million, offset by our total cash contributions of €166 million to various pension funds, the majority of which for our Dutch employees who fall under our collective labour agreement, plus our cash contributions of €98 million for pensions which fall under the transitional plan of our Dutch collective labour agreement and which are directly paid by TNT (see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements). In total the cash contributions are €168 million lower than last year, mainly due to contributions of €142 million related to the Personal Seniors Arrangement in 2004 and due to €32 million lower contributions as prescribed by the minimum funding requirements of De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), which amounted to €59 million in 2005 (2004: 91). The non-cash impact of €52 million from other provisions included provisions related to employee benefits mainly in express, provisions taken for the uninsured part of the damage caused by major fires in three different warehouses in the United States, Spain and the United Kingdom, increased provisions for employer liability in the United Kingdom and reorganisation provisions mainly in mail. Working capital increased by €180 million in 2005 as compared to a decrease of €21 million in 2004. Most of the increase of the accounts receivable position related to an increase of trade receivables that moved unfavourably by €165 million (2004: 77), due to a combination of additional revenue and increased debtor days. Trade payables negatively impacted the cash flow by €77 million as a result of a decrease of creditor days compared to last year. Other current liabilities moved favourably by €66 million, including higher accruals for subcontractors and claims. Interest and similar expenses amounted to €121 million, including non-cash hedge results of €21 million. The cash outflow for interest paid totalled €84 million. Income taxes paid was €130 million (2004: 404). The net amount of income taxes paid included €162 million repayments by the Dutch tax authority of taxes over previous years after it was concluded that preliminary payments were too high and a decrease of the Dutch statutory tax rate from 34.5% in 2004 to 31.5% in 2005. 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 155 Back to Contents Chapter 12 Financial statements O 25 NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES: (265) MILLION (2004:-268) In 2005, the total payments for acquisitions of group companies amounted to €36 million and no cash was acquired as part of the total acquisitions.

Financial and operating guarantees Total financial guarantees at 31 December 2005 were €267 million (2004: 350) of which €99 million (2004: 164) amounted to corporate guarantees. These guarantees were mainly issued in connection with our obligations under lease contracts, custom duty deferment and local credit lines. The increase of corporate guarantees to banks new mainly related to local credit lines. Furthermore, banks and other financial institutions have issued guarantees to cover obligations of group companies up to an amount of €147 million (2004: 127). These guarantees were mainly issued in connection with our obligations under lease contracts, customs duty deferment and local credit lines. The obligations under the guarantees issued by banks and other financial institutions have been secured by our company or by our subsidiaries. The €21 million (2004: 59) of remaining guarantees in 2005 relates to bank guarantees issued locally by group companies. Rent and operating lease contracts In 2005 operational lease expenses (including rental) in the consolidated statements of income amounted to €380 million (2004: 304). Future payments on non-cancellable existing lease contracts mainly relating to real estate, computer equipment and other equipment were as follows: At 31 December Payable in the period 2005 2004 Less than 1 year 229 393 Between 1 and 2 years 210 331 Between 2 and 3 years 182 256 Between 3 and 4 years 140 192 Between 4 and 5 years 105 145 Thereafter 385 358 Total 1,251 1,675 Of which guaranteed by a third party/customers 3 98 (in € millions) Capital expenditure Commitments in connection with capital expenditure are €16 million (2004: 33), of which €14 million is related to property, plant and equipment and €2 million related to intangible assets. These commitments primarily related to projects within the operations of the mail division. These projects include sequence sorting and tray cart unloading. Repurchase of shares On 6 December 2005, we announced to return capital to our shareholders by repurchasing ordinary shares. This share buy back programme started on 6 December 2005 and is expected to end four months after 6 December 2005 unless prior to such date: (a) the aggregate value of shares acquired would exceed €1 billion; (b) 10% of the outstanding ordinary shares have been repurchased, including any ordinary shares already held by the company; or (c) if a cash or exchange offer with respect to the shares of TNT is publicly launched through the publication of an offer document. 158 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Financial statements Chapter 12 As at 31 December 2005, we repurchased 9,020,000 of our ordinary shares for a total amount of €231 million. Note 40 includes a table summarising our repurchases during December 2005. Under this repurchase programme we anticipate purchasing additional shares with a value of €769 million. It is our intention to cancel the ordinary shares and intend to request for such cancellation to be approved by our shareholders. On 7 April 2005, TNTs shareholders meeting mandated the Board of Management to repurchase ordinary shares for a period of eighteen months. Given the share buy back value of €1.0 billion, the approximate number of ordinary shares to be repurchased under the repurchase programme is approximately 42.6 million, calculated on the basis of the last trade prior to commencement of the repurchase programme. Purchase commitments At 31 December 2005 we had unconditional purchase commitments of €100 million (2004: 84) which were primarily related to various service and maintenance contracts. These contracts for service and maintenance relate primarily to information technology, security, salary registration, cleaning and aircraft. Contingent tax liabilities Multinational groups the size of TNT are exposed to varying degrees of uncertainty related to tax planning and regulatory reviews and audits. We account for our income taxes on the basis of our own internal analyses, supported by external advice. We continually monitor our global tax position, and whenever uncertainties arise, we assess the potential consequences and either accrue the liability or disclose a contingent liability in our financial statements, depending on the strength of our position and the resulting risk of loss. In 2005, TNT continued to investigate and analyse its global tax position. As a result we currently estimate the realistic range to reflect our total contingent liability in this regard is between 150 million and 550 million. In early 2004, our audit committee, on behalf of our Supervisory Board, conducted an independent investigation regarding representations made to the UK tax authorities and to our independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers, with respect to certain UK tax matters originally arising in the late 1990s relating to one of our UK subsidiaries. The 2004 investigation, concluded that not all relevant details in connection with these tax matters were adequately disclosed to the UK tax authorities and PricewaterhouseCoopers. In addition to this investigation, in 2004 our audit committee, with the assistance of external legal and tax advisors, conducted a review of other UK tax matters that arose from the same period. In August 2004, we submitted a report to the UK tax authorities pursuant to a procedure under UK law designed to ensure full disclosure of all relevant information to the UK tax authorities. In the first quarter of 2005, we reached a settlement with the UK tax authorities in relation to those matters without any further negative impact on our tax position in 2005. As previously disclosed, since August 2004, we have been preparing an addendum to our original report to the UK tax authorities that will cover UK tax matters that were not the subject of the original investigation. We are in continuing discussions with the UK tax authorities in this connection, and we do not expect that these matters will be resolved with the UK tax authorities before the end of 2006. In late 2005 and early 2006 our audit committee conducted an independent investigation with respect to whether illegal acts occurred in connection with certain past tax matters. Although the investigation concluded that such acts had occurred, we have determined that no provision or contingent liability is required as a result of this investigation. We have also analysed and continue to analyse the tax positions of some of our subsidiaries with respect to other countries. Our investigations and analyses, which are ongoing, concern, among other things, the substance and implementation of tax structures set up in connection with the acquisition, in December 1996 (prior to our formation in 1998), by our former parent company of the Australian company TNT Limited through a UK subsidiary, and the integration and structuring of those and related businesses after our demerger in 1998. Some of these structures which were set up in consultation with outside advisors, have been, or might be, challenged by various tax authorities. An item that will be addressed in the addendum to our report to the UK tax authorities concerns whether some of our subsidiaries might have been resident in the United Kingdom prior to the acquisition of TNT Limited in December 1996 and, if so, whether tax on capital gains would have been due when the tax residency of those subsidiaries later may have moved to another European country. We are still investigating the residency of the relevant subsidiaries, but even if they were UK resident, we believe that the imposition of such a tax on capital gains would be impermissibly discriminatory under EU law. The addendum will also deal among other things, with certain transfer pricing issues in respect of which on 9 February 2005 we made a payment on account to the UK tax authorities of 22 million. We charged this payment against a tax accrual that we recorded in 2004 in connection with this issue. As part of a pilot publicly announced to the Dutch parliament to which the Dutch Ministry of Finance and the Confederation of Netherlands Industry and Employers (VNO-NCW) are committed, we recently signed a compliance covenant with the Dutch tax authorities to self-assess and transparently discuss our past, present and future tax issues with the Dutch tax authorities. The Dutch tax authorities have agreed, in turn, to 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 159 Back to Contents Chapter 12 Financial statements take a clear position on such issues swiftly. An example of what we expect to discuss is the group-wide finance structure we have applied in the past and the structure we intend to apply in the future. From the extensive review to date of our global tax position, on the basis of the facts and circumstances as currently known and advice received from external advisors, we currently believe that it is unlikely that we will incur an additional liability beyond what we have accrued to date, and thus we have not made any further provision in connection with these matters in our financial statements for 2005. To date no assessments relating to the items under investigation or analysis have been raised, and it is difficult to assess if and when, and if so, for what amount, any particular assessment might be raised. Our interpretation of past facts and circumstances and relevant tax laws and regulations may be open to challenge. However, our positions have been and are supported by strong external specialist advice, both contemporaneous and present, on the basis of which we have reached our estimates. Although we currently believe that it is unlikely that we will incur an additional liability beyond what we have accrued to date, we estimate that the realistic range to reflect our total contingent liability in this regard, including potential penalties and interest, is between 150 million and 550 million. This estimate incorporates our current assessment of the matters underlying the contingent liability disclosure in our audited financial statements for 2004. This estimate is based on a probability-weighted assessment of our estimated total theoretical liability. It has been tested against possible settlement negotiation scenarios. Altogether this estimate represents 25-30% of the non-probability weighted estimated theoretical maximum liability - in the highly unrealistic scenario where all of our tax positions under investigation or analysis were successfully challenged, we and all relevant tax authorities were unable to reach any settlement whatsoever, and all of our positions were rejected by all relevant courts. We believe this is highly unlikely. Our estimate of the realistic range of the total contingent liability of 150-550 million involves a series of complex judgments about past and future events and relies on estimates and assumptions. Although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable and are supported by external advice, our ultimate liability in connection with these matters will depend upon the assessments raised, the result of any negotiations with the relevant tax authorities and the outcome of any related litigation. Contingent legal liabilities ORDINARY COURSE LITIGATION We are involved in several legal proceedings relating to the normal conduct of our business. We do not expect any liability arising from any of these legal proceedings to have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity, capital resources or financial position. We believe we have provided for all probable liabilities deriving from the normal course of business. SUBCONTRACTOR SUITS IN FRANCE The authorities in France have brought several criminal and civil actions relating to our express divisions French operations alleging that our subcontractors or their employees should be regarded as our own unregistered employees. The actions variously seek criminal fines or the payment of social security contributions, wage taxes and overtime payments in respect of such employees. Similar actions have been brought against our competitors. A ruling of the court of Bordeaux which was in our favour in first instance, ordering the release of our French express subsidiaries from all charges, was upheld by the court of appeal in Bordeaux by judgement of 27 January 2004. In another case the court of appeal in Paris ruled against TNT Express International SNC and its regional operations director, and imposed on both TNT Express International SNC and the regional operations director being sentenced to fines. TNT Express International SNC has decided to take the case to the French supreme court, who rejected our request. We have sent a letter to the French Public Ministry, and at this moment we are still waiting for a response. In the case before the tribunal correctional of Toulouse (hearing on 17 May 2005) in which all defendants were acquitted on 18 October 2005, no appeal by the French Public Ministry was lodged against the judgment so this case is now closed. There is one case pending in a court against French Express subsidiaries, some of its board members and/or depot managers. The case before the tribunal correctional of St Etienne who had pronounced a decision of discharges on 26 May 2005. On 6 June 2005, the French Public Ministry appealed this decision. We are still waiting for the decision of the court of appeals of Lyon in 2006. Finally, a case is pending before the tribunal correctional of Bobigny regarding TNT Express International SNC, which could be ruled on before the third quarter of 2006. LIÈGE COURT CASE Judicial proceedings and claims were launched before the courts of Liège by people living around Liège airport to stop night flights and seek indemnification from the Walloon Region, Liege airport and the operators (including TNT). These proceedings were rejected in June 2004 by the Liège court of appeal. The court considered the obligations of the defendants (notably the Walloon Government, the Airport Authority and TNT) under the various applicable international and national conventions and regulations and concluded that there was no violation of any of these by the defendants. The plaintiffs have appealed this decision to the Belgian supreme court. The defendants, including TNT, have filed 160 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Financial statements Chapter 12 their response briefs with the same court. The final decision is not expected before the first half of 2006 at the earliest. The arguments developed in the appeal are technical, since the supreme court may only examine pure points of law or procedural items, and not facts. Each of the legal arguments invoked before the supreme court were already extensively developed before the Liège court of appeal, which rejected each and all of them with a substantiated legal reasoning in its decision of June 2004. A successful appeal would entail that the matter be sent to another Belgian court of appeal for a new exchange of briefs, pleadings and ruling. The outcome of this case is hard to predict. O 29 EARNINGS PER SHARE (No corresponding financial statement number) To compute diluted earnings per share, the average number of shares outstanding (excluding the special share) is adjusted for the number of all potentially dilutive shares. There were 7,296,048 stock options outstanding as at 31 December 2005 (2004: 10,080,990). There was no difference in the income attributable to shareholders in computing our basic and diluted earnings per share. The following table to summarise our computation related to earnings per share and diluted earnings per share: Year averages and numbers at 31 December 2005 2004 Number of issued and outstanding ordinary shares 479,999,999 480,259,522 Shares held by the company to cover share plans 3,791,438 4,979,942 Shares held by the company for cancellation 29,460,477 7,600,000 Average number of ordinary shares per year 454,367,662 473,387,568 Diluted number of ordinary shares per year 1,992,957 592,581 Average number of ordinary shares per year on fully diluted basis in the year 456,360,619 473,980,149 O 30 JOINT VENTURES (No corresponding financial statement number) We account for joint ventures in which we and another party have equal control according to the proportionate consolidation method. Key pro rata information regarding those joint ventures in which we have joint decisive influence over operations is set forth below and includes balances at 50%: Our only significant joint venture as at 31 December 2005 is the 50% interest in Postkantoren B.V. with Postbank N.V. to operate post offices in the Netherlands. Our 50% interest in a joint venture with Shanghai Automotive Industry Sales Corporation called AnjiTNT Automotive Logistics Company Limited is part of the discontinued logistics business.

By the sale and transfer the State of the Netherlands reduced its ownership in our capital from 34.8% to 18.6% and it has been further reduced to approximately 10% in July 2005 (see below). We repurchased 20.7 million of the total amount of shares sold by the State of the Netherlands. Transfer of the repurchased ordinary shares took place in two tranches. The first tranche of 7.6 million ordinary shares was transferred to us on 4 October 2004. The transfer of the remaining 13.1 million ordinary shares was completed on 5 January 2005. On 11 July 2005, the State of the Netherlands sold 43.3 million ordinary shares in a placement to ABN Amro Holding N.V. and Citigroup Inc. The sale by the State of the Netherlands reduced the holding of the State of the Netherlands in our company to approximately 10% as at 31 December 2005. Special share The State of the Netherlands holds a special share that gives it the right to approve decisions that lead to fundamental changes in our group structure. The State of the Netherlands has committed itself to exercising the rights attached to the special share only to safeguard the general interest in having an efficiently operating postal system in the Netherlands and also to protect its financial interest as a shareholder. The State of the Netherlands may not exercise its special share to protect us from unwanted shareholder influence. The State of the Netherlands may not transfer or encumber the special share without the approval of our Board of Management and Supervisory Board. Ownership of the special share gives the State of the Netherlands the right to approve certain actions, including:  issuing shares in our capital,  restrictions on or exclusions of the preemptive rights of holders of our ordinary shares,  mergers, demergers and dissolutions with respect to us and Royal TPG Post B.V.,  certain capital expenditures,  certain dividends and distributions, and  certain amendments to our articles of association and the articles of association of Royal TPG Post B.V., including any amendment to the articles of association with respect to – a modification of the objects clause that relates to performance of the concession obligations, – the creation of new classes of shares, profit sharing certificates or other securities entitling the holder thereof to the earnings and/or shareholders equity of the company, – the cancellation of the special share, – the cancellation of the preference shares B, – the transfer of the special share, and – the amendment of the rights attached to the special share. No change is currently proposed to the status of the special share owned by the State of the Netherlands. However, as part of its intention to reduce its involvement in our affairs, the State of the Netherlands is considering the possibility of limiting the applicability of rights attached to the special share. The State of the Netherlands as customer The State of the Netherlands is a large customer of ours, purchasing services from us on an arms-length basis. In addition, the State of the Netherlands may by law require us to provide certain services to the State of the Netherlands in connection with national security and the detection of crime. These activities are subject to strict legal scrutiny by the Dutch authorities. The State of the Netherlands as regulator The postal system in the Netherlands is regulated by the State of the Netherlands. See note 46 of our financial statements. O 32 OTHER RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES (No corresponding financial statement number) The TNT group companies have trading relationships with a number of joint ventures as well as with unconsolidated companies in which we hold minority shares. In some cases there are contractual arrangements in place under which TNT companies source supplies from such undertakings, or such undertakings source supplies from TNT. In the year ended 31 December 2005, sales made by TNT companies to its joint ventures amounted to €42million (2004: 24). Purchases of TNT from joint ventures amounted to €131 million (2004: 125). The net amounts due from joint venture entities amounted to €49 million (2004: 49). As at 31 December 2005 loans receivable from investments in associates as disclosed in note 3 and 5 amounted to €3 million (2004: 8). All transactions with joint ventures and investments in associates are conducted in the normal course of business and under arms length commercial terms and conditions. O 33 SEGMENT INFORMATION (No corresponding financial statement number) Until 2004 we presented our three divisions Mail, Express and Logistics as our reportable segments. In December 2005 we announced a strategy to focus on our core competency of providing delivery services by expertly managing delivery networks. Based on our refined strategy we will now manage our business through two divisions: mail and express, with the express division including two reportable segments: express and freight management. 162 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Financial statements Chapter 12 The majority of our former logistics division is reported as discontinued operations/assets held for sale. Our network related logistics business has been transferred to the express division. The mail business provides services for collecting, sorting, transporting and distributing domestic and international mail. The express business provides demand door-to-door express delivery services for customers sending documents, parcels and freight. The freight management services comprise primarily air and sea freight transportations by acquiring cargo space from airline and shipping firms. We have transferred our innight activities to the express segment and have restated the comparable prior year numbers.

Year ended at 31 December Non-allocated operating income 2005 2004 Non-core disposals 12 Business initiatives (61 ) (38 ) World Food Programme (9 ) (9 ) Other costs (45 ) (24 ) Total (103 ) (71 ) (in € millions) 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 165 Back to Contents Chapter 12 Financial statements In 2005, non-allocated operating income amounted to a loss of €103 million (2004: 71). Included in these costs is €61 million (2004: 38) for business initiatives of which €33 million (2004: 20) was used to further develop our operations in China. During 2005 we strengthened the TNT China corporate headoffice, we started our domestic parcel express business, which included 75 depots at the end of the year and we launched our direct mail activities. The average number of full-time equivalents employed for this initiative was 485 at year end 2005. The remaining €28 million (2004: 18) of the business initiatives was used for several other strategic projects, including the aim to build alliances with other organisations and postal operators, rebranding costs of non TNT branded organisations into the TNT brand and a cost efficiency project for lean warehousing. Costs made to support the World Food Programme were €9 million (2004: 9), including costs for knowledge transfer, hands-on support, raising awareness and funds for the World Food Programme and cash donations. The other costs were €45 million (2004: 24), which represent an increase of €21 million compared to 2004. This increase mainly related to costs incurred for tax investigations, which amounted to €23 million compared to €13 million in 2004 and to costs for the self insured part of the damage caused by major fires in three different warehouses in the United States, Spain and the United Kingdom and employer liability in the United Kingdom. These costs were partly offset by the gain on the sale of Global Collect B.V.

The following tables summarise the principal adjustments, gross of their tax effects, which reconcile profit for the period and total shareholders equity under IFRS to the amounts that would have been reported had US GAAP been applied: Profit attributable to the shareholders Year ended at 31 December 2005 2004 Profit attributable to the shareholders under IFRS 659 752 Adjustments for: Employee benefits (16 ) 61 Employment schemes: cancellation of contract (130 ) Employment schemes and group reorganisation (11 ) Real estate sale 20 Depreciation and amortisation related to our discontinued logistics business (8 ) Other (11 ) (6 ) Tax effect of adjustments 8 28 Profit attributable to the shareholders under US GAAP 632 714 of which related to discontinued operations (152 ) (25 ) of which related to continuing operations 784 739 Earnings per ordinary share/ADS under US GAAP 1 (in € cents) 139.1 151.9 Earnings per diluted ordinary share/ADS under US GAAP 2 (in € cents) 138.5 151.7 (in € millions, except per share figures) 1 In 2005 based on an average of 454,367,662 of ordinary shares/ADS (2004: 469,955,054) 2 In 2005 based on an average of 456,360,619 of diluted ordinary shares/ADS (2004: 470,547,635) Equity for the equity holders of the parent At 31 December 2005 2004 Total equity 3,279 3,344 Minority interest (17 ) (19 ) Equity for the equity holders of the parent under IFRS 3,262 3,325 Adjustments for: Employee benefits 18 34 Other long lived intangible assets 43 (45) Other intangible assets amortisation (10 ) (7 ) Repurchase of shares (259 ) Minimum pension liability (587 ) (454 ) Depreciation and amortisation related to our discontinued logistics business (8 ) Other (6 ) (8 ) Deferred taxes on adjustments 45 36 Equity for the equity holders of the parent under US GAAP 2,757 2,622 (in € millions) 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 167 Back to Contents Chapter 12 Financial statements The following is a summary of the significant differences for our company. Employee benefits As permitted under IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, at the date of transition to IFRS we have elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses and as permitted under IAS 19, Employee Benefits, the unrecognised prior year service costs for all our defined benefit pension plans. For US GAAP purposes the actuarial gains and losses continue to be recognised under the corridor approach while unrecognised prior year service costs are recognised during the future service periods of the active employees. This has resulted in a lower pension expense of €10 million under US GAAP than under IFRS. Employee benefits include expenses of €26 million related to payments expected to be made to certain employees on reaching a specific number of years of service. As permitted under IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, at the date of transition to IFRS, we recorded a liability with a corresponding adjustment to shareholders equity as at that date. For US GAAP purposes, we have included the amount in the income statement resulting in a difference in the profit for the period between IFRS and US GAAP. Under IFRS, we have accounted for certain defined benefit obligations in Italy by using the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which an employee is currently entitled to, but based on the employees expected date of separation or retirement. As permitted under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 88-1, Determination of Vested Benefit Obligation for Defined Benefit Plan, we have accounted for these obligations using the nominal value of the vested benefits to which the employee is entitled to if an employee separates immediately. Employment schemes In the past, we recognised a liability for future wage guarantees, which did not qualify as a liability under US GAAP. This difference resulted in a reconciliation to US GAAP shareholders equity. As at 1 January 2001, after approval of our labour unions and central works council, we transferred the liability to an insurance company. As a result, the obligation for future wage guarantees was settled in full in December 2001. For US GAAP we recognised the transfer payment to the insurance company as a deposit asset that was charged to our statement of income based on the wage guarantees paid by the insurance company of €11 million in 2004. Following the outcome of an unfavourable court decision with regard to the timing of the deductibility of the settlement amount paid for fiscal filing purposes in October 2004, we have decided to unwind the contract in accordance with the resolutive condition in the contract as per 23 December 2004. For IFRS purposes the termination of the contract led to a repayment by the insurance company (for an amount of €134 million) which was accounted for as a reduction in our salary costs. For US GAAP purposes however, we have unwounded the deposit asset (with a remaining balance of €130 million at the moment of termination of the contract). Due to the cancellation of the contract the reconciling item relating employee schemes no longer exists as per 31 December 2004. Real estate sales Due to timing differences when to account for gains on sale of real estate between IFRS and US GAAP, there is a difference in the statement of income in 2004 of 20 million caused by the fact that for certain real estate transactions in prior years, the legal ownership has not been transferred until 2004, resulting in a book profit under US GAAP (already accounted for in prior years under IFRS at the moment the economic risk was transferred). There were no such differences in 2005. Discontinued operations As a result of our December 2005 announcement to focus on our core competency of providing delivery services, we have presented assets and liabilities of our discontinued logistics business as long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and have presented our profit (loss) for the period from our discontinued logistics business as profit (loss) from discontinued operations. As required under IFRS 5, Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, we have not depreciated or amortised, since 6 December 2005, our assets held for sale. IFRS 5, Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, requires us to classify non-current assets or a disposal group as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. For this to be the case, the assets or disposal group should meet the following criteria: • the asset or disposal group must be available for immediate sale in its present condition, • the sale must be highly probable, which requires appropriate level of management be committed to a plan to sell the assets or disposal group, • an active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan must have been initiated, • the asset or disposal group must be actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, • the sale should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification and actions required to complete the plan should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. We have met all the criteria as required under IFRS 5. Our Board of Management is committed to a plan to sell the assets and as defined in the Dutch Civil Code, it can legally represent the company even in the event the general meeting of shareholders may not grant approval to certain resolutions. Furthermore, the Dutch Civil Code states that when a Board of Management commits a company in legally valid matters, the 168 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Financial statements Chapter 12 Balance sheets US GAAP At 31 December 2005 2004 Non-current assets 5,064 5,006 Current assets 3,334 3,160 Assets held for sale 12 Total assets 8,410 8,166 Equity 2,757 2,622 Minority interest 17 19 Non-current liabilities 2,396 2,602 Current liabilities 3,240 2,923 Total equity and liabilities 8,410 8,166 (in € millions) Statements of income US GAAP Year ended 31 December 2005 2004 Total revenues 13,341 12,328 Total operating expenses (12,072) (11,113 ) Operating income 1,269 1,215 Net financial (expense) income (73 ) (77 ) Results from investments in associates (2 ) (3 ) Profit before income taxes 1,194 1,135 Income taxes (408) (396 ) Profit for the period from continuing operations 786 739 Profit/(loss) from discontinued operations (152 ) (25 ) Profit for the period 634 714 Attributable to: Minority interest 2 Shareholders 632 714 (in € millions) company is bound towards a third party. The logistics business is available for immediate sale in its present condition and we believe the sale of the business is highly probable. The position of the SEC is that in the event shareholder approval is required, management is not considered having authority. Accordingly, under US GAAP the criteria management having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the asset is not met. The French logistics business meets all criteria and has been presented as discontinued operations and the remainder of the logistics business has presented as part of continuing operations. Depreciation and amortisation from 6 December 2005 to 31 December 2005 for our discontinued logistics business other than the French activities that we sold during 2005 amounted to 8 million and is included as a reconciling item between IFRS and US GAAP. Condensed consolidated balance sheets and condensed consolidated statements of income as at and for the years ended 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2004 are presented below. These statements present consolidated financial data in accordance with US GAAP and include our discontinued logistics business, other than the French activities sold, as business from continuing operations. Other long lived intangible assets and business combinations and impairment of goodwill As permitted under IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, we have not adjusted business combinations that took place prior to the 1 January 2004 transition date. Prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill on business combinations differed under our previous GAAP and under US GAAP mainly due to differences related to recognition of identifiable and separable intangible assets and recognition of certain provisions such as restructuring provisions. We adopted SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, for business combinations initiated after 30 June 2001. Effective 2002, the provisions of SFAS No. 142 were applied to goodwill and other intangible assets acquired prior to 30 June 2001. Since the adoption of SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142 goodwill is no longer amortised, but tested, at least annually, for impairment. 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 169 Back to Contents Chapter 12 Financial statements Under IFRS and under US GAAP, we amortise identifiable and separable intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Prior to 1 January 2004, we were not required to separate out intangible assets from goodwill resulting in a different carrying value and related amortisation between IFRS and US GAAP for separately identifiable intangible assets. The relating gross carrying amount was €28 million and the accumulated amortisation was €10 million. As at 31 December 2005, we had no separately identified intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended 31 December 2005, are as follows: Mail Express Freight management Total Balance as at 1 January 2005 233 1,278 150 1,661 Additions 20 5 1 26 Disposals (2 ) (2 ) Internal transfers/reclassifications 60 60 Exchange rate differences 15 2 (5 ) 12 Balance as of 31 December 2005 266 1,345 146 1,757 (in € millions) Repurchase of shares On 29 September 2004 we announced that the State of the Netherlands sold a total of 77.7 million ordinary shares in our outstanding share capital. We repurchased 20.7 million shares for a share price of €19.74 of the total amount of shares sold by the State of the Netherlands. Transfer of the repurchased ordinary shares has taken place in two tranches. The first tranche of 7.6 million shares was transferred to us on 4 October 2004. The transfer of the remaining 13.1 million shares was completed on 5 January 2005 and repurchased for €259 million. Under IFRS, the first tranche of 7.6 million shares representing an amount of €150 million, have been accounted for in the balance sheet as a debit against equity. Related transaction costs ( €1 million) have been debited against equity both under IFRS and under US GAAP. The transfer of the legal ownership for the second tranche took place on 5 January 2005. Under US GAAP (SFAS 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity), the second tranche (of 13.1 million shares) classifies as a financial instrument that should be accounted for as a liability rather than as equity. Therefore, we have reclassified an amount of €259 million (including €1 million interest costs) from equity to liabilities in our balance sheet as per 31 December 2004. Under IFRS the second tranche was presented as a commitment not appearing in the balance sheet as we only adopted the requirements of IAS 32 and IAS 39 effective 1 January 2005. We do not expect any reconciling items on subsequent share repurchase programmes. Mimumum pension liability Under US GAAP we are required to record a minimum pension liability in the event the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) exceeds the fair value of the pension plan assets, with a corresponding reduction in shareholders' equity net of deferred taxes. Under IFRS, such a minimum pension liability is not required. As at 31 December 2005 and 2004, the ABO amounted to €5,194 million and €4,643 million, respectively. For certain of our pension plans in the Netherlands, in Germany, and in the United States the ABO exceeded plan assets, requiring us to record a minimum pension liability. The increase in the ABO was mainly due to a decrease in interest rates. Sharebased payments Statement of Financial Accounting Standards no. 123, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation (SFAS 123), encourages, but does not require, companies to record compensation cost for stock based compensation plans at fair value. During 2004, we chose to continue to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion no. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25), and related interpretations. This resulted in the €6 million difference between the 2004 IFRS and US GAAP profit attributable to shareholders. As all options were granted at an exercise price that equals the average price on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange on the day of grant, no charges would have been recorded in the 2002, 2003 and/or 2004 income statements. If the company had elected to recognise compensation expense based on the fair value at the grant dates in accordance with FAS 123, the companys net income and net income per share would have decreased to the pro forma amounts indicated in the following table: 170 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Financial statements Chapter 12 Year ended at 31 December 2004 Profit attributable to the shareholders As reported 752 As adjusted 744 Earnings per ordinary share and per ADS As reported (in € cents) 158.9 As adjusted (in € cents) 157.2 Earnings per diluted ordinary share and per ADS As reported (in € cents) 158.7 As adjusted (in € cents) 157.0 (in € millions, except per share figures) Year ended at 31 December 2004 Risk free interest rate (%) 3.07 Dividend (in € cents per share) 57.0 Volatility (%) 21.7 Life of the option (in years) 8 Vesting period (in years) 3 These pro forma results are not an indicator of future performance. Prior to 1 January 2002, we calculated the fair value of options granted to senior managers and members of the Board using the binomial method, American style with dividend. From 1 January 2002 until 31 December 2004, we calculated the fair value of these options using the Black Scholes model. The use of the Black Scholes model, rather than the binomial pricing model, did not have a material effect on the compensation expense or on the pro forma profit or per share amounts disclosed. Effective 1 January 2005, as permitted by FASB Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure, we have elected to measure our share based payments using a fair value method. We have used the modified-prospective method wherein we have recognised share based employee compensation as if the fair value based accounting method had been used to account for all employee awards granted, modified, or settled since 1 January 1994 and not yet vested. As all of our share based awards vest over a three year period, this meant fair valuing all awards issued on or after 1 January 2002. Under IFRS, as permitted by IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, we were required to fair value share based awards issued after 7 November 2002 resulting in a €1 million difference in the income statement in 2005 between IFRS and US GAAP. Effective 1 January 2005, our share based payments have been measured using the Monte Carlo fair value measurement method. Other differences SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS Under IFRS, if a sale and leaseback transaction results in a finance lease, any excess of sales proceeds over the carrying amount shall be deferred and amortised over the lease term. If a sale and leaseback transaction results in an operating lease, any loss is generally recognised immediately. Recognition of gain is based on whether sale price is at, below or greater than fair value. US GAAP has more specific accounting criteria for sale and leasebacks under SFAS No. 28, Accounting for Sales with Leasebacks, SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, and SFAS No. 98, Accounting for Leases (SFAS No. 98). Under SFAS No. 98, a seller-lessee is required to make a determination whether the transaction qualifies for sale and leaseback accounting. Where sale and leaseback transactions do not qualify for sale and leaseback accounting, they are required to be accounted for as financings. Under US GAAP, gains on transactions qualifying as sale and leasebacks are recognised based on the degree to which the seller-lessee retains the right to use the real estate through the leaseback. Where the seller-lessee retains substantially all of the use of the property, the gain on the sale transaction is required to be deferred and amortised over the lease term. Where the seller-lessee retains only a minor use of the property, any profit or loss generally is recognised at the date of sale. If the seller-lessee retains more than a minor part but less than substantially all of the use of the property, any profit in excess of the present value of the minimum lease payments is recognised at the date of sale. Losses are recognised immediately upon consummation of the sale. Difference between IFRS and US GAAP resulted in a cumulative effect of 5 million on shareholders equity to defer gains on sale of property and to realise these gains over the respective lease terms. LONG TERM CONTRACT INCENTIVES Under IFRS, expenses related to long term contract incentive payments made to induce customers to enter or renew long term service contracts may be deferred and accounted for over the contract period. Under US GAAP such payments may not qualify for deferral, and must be recognised fully in income in the initial period that the cost is incurred. We have paid certain long term contract incentives totalling 6 million that did not qualify for deferral under US GAAP. As a result, under US GAAP, such payments were recognised immediately in the income statement, while under IFRS they have been deferred and will be recognised over the term of the contract. This difference resulted in an adjustment to the US GAAP net income and shareholders equity in the current year to reflect the reversal of the related annual charge to the income statement recorded under IFRS. 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 171 Back to Contents Chapter 12 Financial statements FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Effective 1 January 2005, under IFRS we are required to value derivative instruments at fair value and are required to recognise changes therein recognised either in current earnings or through a separate component of shareholders equity, depending on specific criteria. Similar accounting treatment is required under US GAAP. As at 31 December 2005 we had no significant differences between IFRS and US GAAP, in accounting for our derivative instruments. GUARANTEES We have provided guarantees in 2005, none of which are within the scope of FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. These guarantees are outside the scope of FIN 45 because they are guarantees of our own performance. OTHER Under IFRS, a curtailment gain on a suspended retirement plan is recognised as the difference between the curtailment gain and the estimated additional liability to terminate the plan. Under US GAAP, an estimated liability to terminate a plan is not recorded until the plan is formally terminated. This accounting difference resulted in a €2 million adjustment to our reconciliation of shareholders equity under IFRS to that under US GAAP in order to reverse the recognition of the estimated liability to terminate the plan that was made in 2002. Under IFRS, provisions were made for constructive obligations for early retirement benefits for certain part-time employees in one of our group companies. Under US GAAP these provisions were not permitted as we were not legally obligated to make these payments at year end 2004. However, a provision under US GAAP was permitted in 2005 and accordingly there is no longer a difference in shareholders equity related to this as at 31 December 2005. Under IFRS, for intangible assets other than goodwill, restoration of previously recognised impairments is required when the reason for the impairment is no longer valid. Under US GAAP, restoration of previously recognised impairments is prohibited. Property, plant and equipment transferred to our company in connection with the incorporation of the postal and telecommunications business as of 1 January 1989, were valued at the then current value. This method is prescribed under Dutch law and permitted under IFRS. US GAAP requires that property, plant and equipment be valued at historical cost. No adjustment to the IFRS accounts is made in the US GAAP reconciliation in relation to this difference, as the original historical cost can not be determined. We recognise deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that they will be realised in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we have established valuation allowances of €140 million (2004: 123) and recorded as at 31 December 2005 net deferred tax assets of €71 million (2004: 79). Under IFRS we have recorded the same amounts of net deferred tax assets. Under IFRS, investments in joint ventures may be proportionately consolidated. In general, the proportionate consolidation method is prohibited under US GAAP. However, as allowed under the United States Securities and Exchange Commissions (SEC) rules applicable to Form 20-F, no adjustment has been made for this difference as the joint ventures, in which we hold an investment, are operating entities for which we have joint control over the financial operating policies with all other parties holding an interest in the respective joint venture. We prepare our statement of cash flows in accordance with requirements of IFRS, IAS No. 7, Cash Flow Statements. As permitted under the SECs rules applicable to Form 20-F, no adjustment has been made for any difference that may arise between IFRS and US GAAP.

Recent US GAAP accounting pronouncements The Financial Accounting Standards Board in the United States has issued certain Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS), each of which, when adopted, could affect our consolidated financial statements for US GAAP reporting. In December 2004, the FASB issued a revised version of SFAS 123, Sharebased payments, Revised 2004 (SFAS 123(R)). The SEC has issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 relating to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). SFAS 123(R) requires us to measure all employee share based compensation awards using a fair value method, estimate award forfeitures, and record such expense in our consolidated statements of income. This statement supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock issued to Employees. The provisions of this statement were effective 1 January 2006. As permitted by FASB Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure, we have elected, effective I January 2005, to measure our share based payments using a fair value method under SFAS 123 using the transition provisions of SFAS 148. Accordingly, we do not expect the adoption of SFAS 123(R) to have a material impact on our financial statements. Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) of the FASB issued EIFT 05-6, Determining the Amortisation Period for Leasehold Improvements Purchased after Lease Inception or Acquired in a Business Combination. This pronouncement requires that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased subsequent to the inception of the lease should be amortised over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the lease term that includes reasonably assured lease renewals as determined on the date of acquisition of the leasehold improvement. We are required to adopt this pronouncement effective 1 January 2006 and do not expect the adoption the EITF 05-6 to have a material impact on our financial statements. 174 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Financial statements Chapter 12 TNT N.V.

The corporate financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005 have been prepared in accordance with part 9, book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. We have applied the option in Article 362 (8) to use the same principles of valuation and determination of result for the corporate financial statements as the consolidated financial statements. Until 2004, these statements were prepared under Dutch GAAP. Our corporate balance sheets and statements of income have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of IFRS. This has impacted our equity and the carrying value of the investments in group companies by 12 million as at 1 January 2004 and 560 million as at 31 December 2004. For details we refer to our note on Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union in our consolidated financial statements. As at 1 January 2005 the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 resulted in a decrease of 9 million relating to the valuation of a put option as disclosed in our note to the consolidated financial statements, Adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39. Our investments in group companies are carried at net asset value. For the principles of valuation of assets and liabilities and for the determination of results reference is made to the notes to the consolidated balance sheet and statements of income.

The number of authorised, issued and outstanding shares by class of share at 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2004 is as follows: Ordinary Preference B Special share Authorised 1,200,000,000 1,199,999,999 1 Issued and outstanding 479,999,999 0 1 of which held by the company to cover share plans 3,791,438 0 0 of which held by the company for cancellation 29,460,477 0 0 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 177 Back to Contents Chapter 12 Financial statements Our ordinary and preference shares have a nominal value of €0.48. We have ordinary shares in bearer form or in registered form. Ordinary shares in bearer form are represented by a global note held by the Dutch clearing system Euroclear Netherlands (formerly known as NECIGEF) and are transferable through Euroclear Netherlands book entry system. Ordinary shares in registered form are transferred by means of a deed of transfer and the companys written acknowledgement of the transfer. We do not have share certificates for ordinary shares represented by the global note. ADSs represent ordinary shares in bearer form represented by the note held by Euroclear Netherlands. The special share and the preference shares B are registered. During the year we purchased ordinary shares as part of our management and personnel share option plan. Furthermore, we purchased 13.1 million ordinary shares in January 2005 thereby completing our repurchase of 20.7 million ordinary shares sold by the State of the Netherlands. On 7 April 2005, the annual general meeting of shareholders resolved to cancel these shares. The cancellation of 259,523 of these shares became effective on 16 June 2005. The cancellation of the remaining 20,440,477 shares shall become effective as per the date on which a proposed amendment of our articles of association to decrease our authorised capital, to be submitted to an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders to be held on 27 February 2006, shall become effective. Upon effectuation of this amendment of the articles of association, our authorised capital shall amount to 864 million nominal value, divided into 900,000,000 ordinary shares, 1 special share and 899,999,999 preference shares B. Finally, we commenced a share buy back of 1 billion on 6 December 2005. We therefore owned and held for cancellation 29,460,477 ordinary shares at 31 December 2005 (2004: 4,979,942) and held 3,791,438 to cover share plans. The State of the Netherlands is the holder of the special share. At 31 December 2005, the State of the Netherlands held approximately 10% of the ordinary shares. We may not vote on shares we hold in our own capital. The Foundation Protection TNT was formed to care for our interests, the enterprises connected with us and all interested parties, such as shareholders and employees, by, among other things, preventing as much as possible influences which would threaten our continuity, independence and identity contrary to such interests. The Foundation Protection TNT is an independent legal entity and is not owned or controlled by any other legal person. Agreements have been concluded between us and the Foundation for the placement or acquisition of preference shares B. O 38 ADDITIONAL PAID IN CAPITAL: 1,421 MILLION (2004: 1,421) Additional paid in capital is exempt for Dutch tax purposes. O 39 CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT: (16) MILLION (2004: -35) Currency translation gains and losses on converting foreign subsidiaries of TNT N.V. into euros are charged or credited to the cumulative translation adjustment, net of taxation. As permitted by a change in the Dutch law, we have elected to set the previously accumulated cumulative translation adjustment at zero as at 1 January 2004. O 40 FAIR VALUE AND OTHER RESERVES: 1,068 MILLION (2004: 1,052) In connection with our announcement on 29 September 2004 we repurchased 20.7 million of the shares sold by the State of the Netherlands. The first tranche of 7,6 million shares was transferred to us on 4 October 2004. The first tranche was repurchased for €151 million (including transaction costs) and is deducted from other reserves.The second tranche was transferred to us on 5 January 2005 for an amount of €259 million and is reflected in the table below. Losses on cash flow hedges resulting from the fair value movement on the €500 million of forward starting swaps, net of taxes amounted to €12 million (2004: 3).

O 45 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Acquisition Trespertrans S.L. On 18 January 2006, we completed the acquisition of the 100% shares in Trespertrans S.L., which is the holding company of 100% shares in TG Plus Transcamergomez S.A.U., a domestic express company in Spain. The transaction was announced on 6 December 2005 and the acquisition price was approximately 48 million, goodwill is expected to be approximately 26 million, and intangible assets (customer list only) are expected to be approximately 5 million, with the intangible assets being amortised over the estimated useful life. These amounts are subject to our final purchase price allocations. Sale of remaining logistics activities in France On 27 January 2006, we announced an agreement for the sale of our Logistiques Nicolas activities to the French cargo transport operator Malherbe. On 10 February 2006, we announced an agreement for the sale of the activities of Transports Pierre Mendy and Mendy Ltda to PierreMichel Mendy/Groupe Lapegue. These transactions, together with the transactions announced on 1 December 2005 and 2 January 2006, completes the sale of our logistics France business unit.

This launch makes us the first multinational brand in India to offer international and domestic services using an integrated air and road network. Delisting London and Franfurt stock exchanges On 20 February 2006, we announced our intention to delist from the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges in the first half of 2006, as the costs and requirements for these listings are not justified by the low trading volume in our shares at these stock exchanges. O 46 POSTAL REGULATION AND CONCESSION (No corresponding financial statement number) Due to the importance of postal services to society, regulation is a significant factor in our mail business. The mandatory undertaking of certain postal activities in the Netherlands, some of which are exclusive to us, has been assigned to us in the Dutch Postal Act. In the Netherlands, the key legislation regulating our mail activities is the Dutch Postal Act. The Dutch Postal Act requires TNT to perform the mandatory postal services in the Netherlands and it grants us exclusive rights to provide some of these services, the reserved postal services. In connection with the Dutch Postal Act there is the parliamentary Postal Decree, which specifies the services that constitute the mandatory postal services and defines the scope of the reserved postal services. The combination of these mandates and exclusive rights are commonly called the Postal Concession. The Postal Concession is performed by our subsidiary Royal TPG Post B.V. Furthermore, there is a General Postal Regulations Decree, which specifies our obligations regarding the performance of mandatory postal services and the transparency of the financial accounting of these services according to the EU Postal Directive The Postal Concession MANDATORY POSTAL SERVICES The domestic mandatory postal services mainly consist of the conveyance against payment of standard single rates of the following postal items:  letters (including reply items) and printed matter with a maximum individual weight of two kilogrammes,  postal parcels with a maximum individual weight of 10 kilogrammes, and  registered, registered insured and registered value declared items. In addition, bulk mail of letters up to an individual weight of 50 grammes (100 grammes prior to 1 January 2006), which are conveyed against separately agreed rates, are part of the mandatory postal services. Mandatory postal services also cover rental of P.O. boxes. We are not required to provide the delivery of bulk printed matter such as advertising, magazines and newspapers, the delivery of bulk letters with an individual weight above 50 grammes and unaddressed mail items. For international inbound and outbound mail, based on the Dutch Postal Act and in accordance with the rules of the Universal Postal Union (UPU), mandatory postal services mainly comprise conveyance against payment of both postal items at standard single rates and of bulk mail items at separately agreed rates with a maximum individual weight of two kilogrammes and of postal parcels with a maximum individual weight of 20 kilogrammes. In addition, mandatory postal services cover the postal services regulated by the UPU. RESERVED POSTAL SERVICES Under the Dutch Postal Act and the Postal Decree, the reserved postal services include the following exclusive rights:  the conveyance of domestic and inbound international letters with a maximum individual weight of 50 grammes (100 grammes prior to 1 January 2006) at a rate of less than two and a half times (three times prior to 1 January 2006) the standard single rate (€0.39) for the lowest weight class of 20 grammes,  the exclusive right to place letterboxes intended for the public alongside or on public roads, and  the exclusive right to issue postal stamps and imprinted stamps bearing the likeness of the monarch and/or the word Nederland. These exclusive rights do not extend to courier services or services where the letters are delivered at the rate of more than two and a half times the standard single rate. The exclusive rights also do not extend to the conveyance of parcels, letters weighing in excess of 50 grammes and printed materials such as advertising, newspapers and magazines. In addition, the exclusive rights do not extend to the conveyance of letters by a business to its own customers. ACCOUNTING AND OTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS Our obligations on reporting include the establishment of an annual report on our performance of the mandatory postal services, providing, among other things, an overview of the financial results related to the mandatory postal services. This report must be reviewed by an independent auditor appointed by OPTA. Our financial accounting obligations require us to maintain separate financial accounts within our internal financial administration for mandatory postal services. This separate accounting must be broken down into reserved postal services and other mandatory postal services and must be separated from the accounting of our other activities. Every year, we 180 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Chapter 12 Financial statements must submit to OPTA a declaration of an independent auditor, appointed by OPTA that our financial accounting system complies with these obligations. This declaration has to be published by OPTA in the Staatscourant. Underlying this accounting system and the financial reports to OPTA is a system for allocating costs and revenues to the different types of services. This system complies with the accounting rules laid down in the EU Postal Directive and is approved by OPTA for the period ending 31 December 2006. The approval of OPTA was officially published in the Staatscourant on 14 July 2004. The full text of the description of the allocation system is published in Dutch by OPTA on their website, www.opta.nl. VALUE ADDED TAX ON POSTAL SERVICES At present, we are not allowed to charge value added tax on postal items forming part of the mandatory postal services. The flip side of this is that for mandatory postal services wecan not deduct the VAT amounts paid on our purchases of services and goods related to the mandatory services. We are required to charge VAT on all services not included in the mandatory services, i.e. the services in competition with other operators. Competitors are required to charge VAT on those items as well. Therefore, there is a level playing field for competitors and our company on these services. REGULATORY CONDITIONS FOR THE PROVISION OF MANDATORY POSTAL SERVICES Regarding mandatory postal services the General Postal Regulation Decree imposes various regulatory conditions on us with respect to service provision, tariffs, cost and revenue accounting, financial administration and reporting. Other than the mandatory postal services, none of our postal services is subject to governmental control. According to the Dutch Postal Act, article 2d, we are obliged to give our competitors entrance to our P.O. boxes. This service has to be delivered against reasonable, objectively justifiable and non-discriminatory conditions and remunerations. To date these conditions and remunerations are the negotiated results between parties. With respect to service levels, the General Postal Regulations Decree requires us to provide a level of service that complies with modern standards, to provide nationwide services and to perform a delivery round every day, except for Sundays and public holidays. We are required to deliver not less than 95% of all domestic letters the day after the day of posting, not including Sundays and public holidays. We are required to maintain a network of service points (post offices and agents) for the access of the general public to the services. With respect to rates and conditions, we are required to set rates and associated conditions that are transparent, non-discriminatory and uniform. However, we may grant volume discounts for items of correspondence and negotiate specific prices and conditions with high-volume users. We are required to submit proposed rate changes to OPTA, which has to evaluate whether the proposed changes are in accordance with the price cap system. The price cap system measures tariff developments in two different baskets of services, a total basket and a small users basket. The total basket comprises domestic mandatory postal services provided to all customers. The small users basket comprises a selection of the total basket of domestic mandatory postal services that is representative for consumers and small business users. The price cap system uses a weighing factor for each service in both baskets. The levels of the indices for both baskets are not to exceed the official national index of wages for employees in the market sector. The price cap system was evaluated in 2002. On 18 November 2002, the Ministry of Economic Affairs decided that tariffs controlled by the current price cap system should be frozen until the end of 2006. The Ministry of Economic Affairs indicated that in the event postal services became subject to value added tax between 1 January 2003 and 1 January 2007, a change of the frozen tariffs corresponding with the resulting tax burden would be allowed. On 19 June 2003, when the tariff freeze was discussed in parliament, the duration of the freeze was limited to 1 January 2005, awaiting the vision of the Minister of Economic Affairs on the future regulation of the postal sector. The Minister of Economic Affairs proposed in his postal vision sent to parliament on 1 April 2004 that the temporary tariff freeze would be extended until year end 2006. On 17 November 2003 we lodged an appeal against the administrative decision to freeze the tariffs. Following the grant of the formal appeal, the temporary tariff freeze decision was declared void in June 2004 and we remained able to amend the individual rates for mandatory postal services, subject to the provisions of the tariff control system. However, in view of the wider importance of the adoption of an integral and balanced vision for the postal market as submitted to parliament, we announced our intention not to increase the price of a stamp for consumers from the present level of €0.39 for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006. The prices for mandatory postal services to business customers that are covered by the price control system will increase in 2006, but the increase will be kept below the rate of wage inflation for 2004 and 2005. On 16 December 2004 the Minister of Economic Affairs discussed his vision for the postal market with the members of parliament. During this meeting parliament gave its support to the vision, giving clarity to the following issues:  full liberalisation of the Dutch postal market in 2007 (conditional on full market liberalisation in the United Kingdom and Germany, i.e. the condition of a level playing field). The vision foresees the possibility of an emergency 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 181 Back to Contents Chapter 12 Financial statements brake procedure that allows for the date of the introduction of liberalisation to be shifted to a later stage should delayed factual liberalisation of the German and UK postal markets call for this,  the intention to maintain the price of a stamp for consumers at €0.39 in 2004, 2005 and 2006, from 2007, rates for services provided under the universal service obligation will be regulated using a price cap system linked to inflation,  non-discrimination is applicable to our mail services. Competitors and customers must be treated equally in terms of rates and conditions,  there is a clearer distinction between general and sector specific competition monitoring. OPTA is charged with monitoring universal service and non discrimination requirements,  a reduction, yet to be fully defined, in the scope of the mandatory postal services, and  from 2007, the Minister of Economic Affairs will assess whether our obligation to deliver bulk mail letters up to 50 grammes will remain mandatory for an undefined transitional period, without any rights for us to offset this obligation. The postal vision, as the officially adopted governmental policy, is the basis for the development of new postal legislation. Based on the postal vision, a new Dutch Postal Act was drafted in 2005. As part of the normal process of drafting an act, the Minister of Economic Affairs in December 2005 has sent this draft to the Counsel of State to advise on this. Further discussions in parliament will take place in 2006. We recognise that the postal vision provides clarity on the most important aspects of postal regulation and gives a long term framework for the development of the postal market in the Netherlands. In particular, we are pleased that the policy regarding liberalisation is conditional on the future de facto liberalisation in the United Kingdom and Germany, where further liberalisation is also scheduled to take place in 2006 and 2007 respectively. In 2005, the Dutch government commissioned a study to investigate this issue. This study is expected to be repeated in 2006 to see if any changes in the market situation have taken place since the first study.

OTHER ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE STATE OF THE NETHERLANDS We have agreed with the State of the Netherlands that we may issue ordinary shares, subject to the approval of the State of the Netherlands, in its capacity as holder of the special share, and the Supervisory Board. The State of the Netherlands has agreed that it will withhold its approval only if:  the proposed share issuance is scheduled to take place, or our intention to make the issuance would be made public by us, within nine months prior to any offer of our ordinary shares by the State of the Netherlands, and  the State of the Netherlands in its reasonable opinion expects that the proposed issuance would be detrimental to its interests in any later offerings of our ordinary shares by it. However, we may within such nine-month period make a public announcement of our intention to issue ordinary shares, if:  ordinary shares would be issued exclusively or almost exclusively in exchange for the shares of one or more companies with which we or any of our group companies have concluded a co-operation, merger or acquisition agreement, or  the announcement is made in relation to a private issuance (other than an issuance referred to above), provided that the State of the Netherlands in its reasonable opinion determines that the announcement would not be detrimental to its interests in any future offerings by it. The State of the Netherlands is otherwise required to give its approval within eight business days upon written request to that effect, if the financial conditions of the issuance reasonably can not be regarded by the State of the Netherlands as adversely affecting the interests of shareholders in general. In issuing shares, we have agreed to consider the long term financial interests of the State of the Netherlands as the holder of a substantial interest in us. 184 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 185 Back to Contents Chapter 13 REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT 186 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Regulatory environment Chapter 13 POSTAL REGULATION AND CONCESSION INTERNATIONAL POSTAL REGULATION Universal Postal Union The Universal Postal Union (UPU) is a specialised agency within the United Nations framework. It is responsible for the regulation of cross-border postal services. Practically all nations are members of the UPU. The common rules applicable to cross-border postal services are laid down in the UPU Convention and its regulations. In the Convention, the UPU established an international system for mutual payments for the delivery of cross-border letter mail, known as the terminal dues system. The purpose is to compensate the destination countrys public postal operator for delivering international letter post. A different compensation scheme with similar purposes exists for parcel mail. Since 1 January 2006 a new terminal dues system applies. Under the new system Target countries (previously Industrialised Countries) will pay each other country-specific rates linked to domestic post charges. Over the next years the current percentage of the domestic 20 grammes tariff, 60%, will be increased gradually to 68% in 2009. Transition countries (previously Developing Countries) will continue to pay each other and Target countries a fixed kilogramme rate according to a per item and per kilogramme formula based on world average costs and on a world average weight. Transition countries are expected to move towards the Target system before 2014, at which time all exchanges will be based on country-specific compensation. Most European postal operators view the UPU target terminal dues system as inadequate for these purposes. As a consequence a significant majority of them are party to the separate, multilateral REIMS II agreement where terminal dues are related to a higher percentage of domestic tariffs, and to a certain extent to service quality as well. We did not enter into the REIMS II agreement because we felt it did not contain a strong incentive/penalty system that would guarantee improvement of the quality of service. Instead, we concluded commercially oriented bilateral agreements with most of the European postal operators. Most of the 10 countries who joined the EU on 1 May 2004 have entered into a REIMS East Agreement with the REIMS II parties. This agreement allows the new EU public postal operators to use a transitional period to get accustomed to terminal dues that are based on domestic tariffs. We decided to become a member of the REIMS East agreement as of 1 January 2005. In this way we avoid lengthy bilateral negotiations and create considerable goodwill that will support our position in future terminal dues negotiations. The financial effects of this decision are limited due to low volumes exchanged between Royal TPG Post B.V. and postal operators of the accession countries. EU postal regulation The current EU Postal Directive 2002/39/EC, amending Directive 97/67/EC (EU Postal Directive) with regard to the further opening to competition of community postal services, sets out a harmonised set of minimum obligations for the universal postal service (mandatory postal services) regarding service levels, rates, and cost and revenue accounting principles, as well as quality of service standards, with which all member states, including the Netherlands, must comply. The EU Postal Directive also defines the maximum scope of postal services the EU member states are permitted to reserve for national public postal operators (reserved postal services). Member states are permitted to reserve postal services for domestic and cross-border mail. As of 1 January 2006 this reservation is limited to a weight of 50 grammes per item of correspondence at a price of less than two and a half times the public tariff for an item of correspondence in the first weight step of the fastest category, i.e. items of correspondence weighing no more than 20 grammes. To the extent necessary to ensure the provision of universal service, outgoing cross-border mail and direct mail may continue to be reserved within the same weight and price limits. The EU Postal Directive delays full liberalisation of the EU postal market until at least 2009, depending on the results of a study on the effects of liberalisation that is to be finalised by 31 December 2006. POSTAL REGULATION IN THE NETHERLANDS Due to the importance of postal services to society, regulation is a significant factor in our mail business. The mandatory undertaking of certain postal activities in the Netherlands, some of which are exclusive to us, has been assigned to us in the Dutch Postal Act. In the Netherlands, the key legislation regulating our mail activities is the Dutch Postal Act. The Dutch Postal Act requires TNT to perform the mandatory postal services in the Netherlands and it grants us exclusive rights to provide some of these services, the reserved postal services. In connection with the Dutch Postal Act there is the parliamentary Postal Decree, which specifies the services that constitute the mandatory postal services and defines the scope of the reserved postal services. The combination of these mandates and exclusive rights are commonly called the Postal Concession. The Postal Concession is performed by our subsidiary Royal TPG Post B.V. Furthermore, there is a General Postal Regulations Decree, which specifies our obligations regarding the performance of mandatory postal services and the transparency of the financial accounting of these services according to the EU Postal Directive. The responsibility for supervising our performance of the mandatory postal services lies with an independent 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 187 Back to Contents Chapter 13 Regulatory environment Supervisory Authority for Post and Telecommunications established by the government, which is commonly called by its Dutch acronym OPTA. The Minister of Economic Affairs is responsible for postal regulation and policy. On 16 December 2004 the Minister of Economic Affairs discussed his vision for the Dutch postal market with parliament. During this meeting parliament gave its support to the vision, which contains the following key elements:  full liberalisation of the Dutch postal market in 2007 (conditional on full market liberalisation in the United Kingdom and Germany, i.e. the condition of a level playing field). The vision foresees the possibility of an emergency brake procedure that allows for the date of the introduction of liberalisation to be shifted to a later stage should delayed factual liberalisation of the German and UK postal markets call for this,  the intention to maintain the price of a stamp for consumers at €0.39 in 2004, 2005 and 2006, from 2007, rates for services provided under the universal service obligation will be regulated using a price cap system linked to inflation,  non-discrimination is applicable to our mail services. Competitors and customers must be treated equally in terms of rates and conditions,  there is a clearer distinction between general and sector specific competition monitoring. The OPTA is charged with monitoring universal service and non-discrimination requirements,  a reduction, yet to be fully defined, in the scope of the mandatory postal services, and  from 2007, the Minister of Economic Affairs will assess whether our obligation to deliver bulk mail letters up to 50 grammes will remain mandatory for an undefined transitional period, without any rights for us to offset this obligation. The postal vision, as the officially adopted governmental policy, is the basis for the development of new postal legislation. Based on the postal vision, a new Dutch Postal Act was drafted in 2005. As part of the normal process of drafting an act, the Minister of Economic Affairs in December 2005 has sent this draft to the Counsel of State to advise on this. Further discussions in parliament will take place in 2006. We recognise that the postal vision provides clarity on the most important aspects of postal regulation and gives a long-term framework for the development of the postal market in the Netherlands. In particular, we are pleased that the policy regarding liberalisation is conditional on the future de facto liberalisation in the United Kingdom and Germany, where further liberalisation is also scheduled to take place in 2006 and 2007 respectively. In 2005, the Dutch government commissioned a study to investigate this issue. This study is expected to be repeated in 2006 to see if any changes in the market situation have taken place since the first study. THE POSTAL CONCESSION Mandatory postal services The domestic mandatory postal services mainly consist of the conveyance against payment of standard single rates of the following postal items:  letters (including reply items) and printed matter with a maximum individual weight of two kilogrammes,  postal parcels with a maximum individual weight of 10 kilogrammes, and  registered, registered insured and registered value declared items. In addition, bulk mail of letters up to an individual weight of 50 grammes (100 grammes prior to 1 January 2006), which are conveyed against separately agreed rates, are part of the mandatory postal services. Mandatory postal services also cover rental of P.O. boxes. We are not required to provide the delivery of bulk printed matter such as advertising, magazines and newspapers, the delivery of bulk letters with an individual weight above 50 grammes (100 grammes prior to 1 January 2006) and unaddressed mail items. For international inbound and outbound mail, based on the Dutch Postal Act and in accordance with the rules of the UPU, mandatory postal services mainly comprise conveyance against payment of both postal items at standard single rates and of bulk mail items at separately agreed rates with a maximum individual weight of two kilogrammes and of postal parcels with a maximum individual weight of 20 kilogrammes. In addition, mandatory postal services cover the postal services regulated by the UPU. REGULATORY CONDITIONS FOR THE PROVISION OF MANDATORY POSTAL SERVICES Regarding mandatory postal services the General Postal Regulations Decree imposes various regulatory conditions on us with respect to service provision, tariffs, cost and revenue accounting, financial administration and reporting. Other than the mandatory postal services, none of our postal services is subject to governmental control. According to the Dutch Postal Act, article 2d, we are obliged to give our competitors entrance to our P.O. boxes. This service has to be delivered against reasonable, objectively justifiable and non-discriminatory conditions and remunerations. To date these conditions and remunerations are the negotiated results between parties. With respect to service levels, the General Postal Regulations Decree requires us to provide a level of service that complies with modern standards, to provide nationwide services and to perform a delivery round every day, except for Sundays and public holidays. We are required to deliver not less than 95% of all domestic letters the day after the day of posting, not including Sundays and public holidays. We are required 188 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Regulatory environment Chapter 13 to maintain a network of service points (post offices and agents) for the access of the general public to the services. With respect to rates and conditions, we are required to set rates and associated conditions that are transparent, non-discriminatory and uniform. However, we may grant volume discounts for items of correspondence and negotiate specific prices and conditions with high volume users. We are required to submit proposed rate changes to OPTA, which has to evaluate whether the proposed changes are in accordance with the price cap system. The price cap system measures tariff developments in two different baskets of services, a total basket and a small users basket. The total basket comprises domestic mandatory postal services provided to all customers. The small users basket comprises a selection of the total basket of domestic mandatory postal services that is representative for consumers and small business users. The price cap system uses a weighing factor for each service in these baskets. The levels of the indices for both baskets are not to exceed the official national index of wages for employees in the market sector. The development of the indices from the base year of 1989 is illustrated below: The price cap system was evaluated in 2002. On 18 November 2002, the Ministry of Economic Affairs decided that tariffs controlled by the current price cap system should be frozen until the end of 2006. The Ministry of Economic Affairs indicated that in the event postal services became subject to value added tax between 1 January 2003 and 1 January 2007, a change of the frozen tariffs corresponding with the resulting tax burden would be allowed. On 19 June 2003, when the tariff freeze was discussed in parliament, the duration of the freeze was limited to 1 January 2005, awaiting the vision of the Minister of Economic Affairs on the future regulation of the postal sector. The Minister of Economic Affairs proposed in his postal vision sent to parliament on 1 April 2004 that the temporary tariff freeze would be extended until year end 2006. On 17 November 2003 we lodged an appeal against the administrative decision to freeze the tariffs. Following the grant of the formal appeal, the temporary tariff freeze decision was declared void in June 2004 and we remained able to amend the individual rates for mandatory postal services, subject to the provisions of the tariff control system. However, in view of the wider importance of the adoption of an integral and balanced vision for the postal market as submitted to parliament, we announced our intention not to increase the price of a stamp for consumers from the present level of € 0.39 for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006. The prices for mandatory postal services to business customers that are covered by the price control system will increase in 2006, but the increase will be kept below the rate of wage inflation for 2004 and 2005. Reserved postal services Under the Dutch Postal Act and the Postal Decree, the reserved postal services include the following exclusive rights:  the conveyance of domestic and inbound international letters with a maximum individual weight of 50 grammes (100 grammes prior to 1 January 2006) at a rate of less than two and a half times (three times prior to 1 January 2006) the standard single rate (€ 0.39) for the lowest weight class of 20 grammes,  the exclusive right to place letter boxes intended for the public alongside or on public roads, and  the exclusive right to issue postal stamps and imprinted stamps bearing the likeness of the monarch and/or the word Nederland. These exclusive rights do not extend to courier services or services where the letters are delivered at the rate of more than two and a half times the standard single rate. The exclusive rights also do not extend to the conveyance of parcels, letters weighing in excess of 50 grammes and printed materials such as advertising, newspapers and magazines. In addition, the exclusive rights do not extend to the conveyance of letters by a business to its own customers. Accounting and other financial obligations Our obligations on reporting include the establishment of an annual report on our performance of the mandatory postal services, providing, among other things, an overview of the financial results related to the mandatory postal services. This report must be reviewed by an independent auditor appointed by OPTA. Our financial accounting obligations require us to maintain separate financial accounts within our internal financial administration for mandatory postal services. This separate accounting must be broken down into reserved postal services and other mandatory postal services and must be separated from the accounting of our other activities. Every year, we must submit to OPTA a declaration of an independent auditor, appointed by OPTA, that our financial accounting system complies with these obligations. This declaration has to be published by OPTA in the Staatscourant. 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 189 Back to Contents Chapter 13 Regulatory environment Underlying this accounting system and the financial reports to OPTA is a system for allocating costs and revenues to the different types of services. This system complies with the accounting rules laid down in the EU Postal Directive and is approved by OPTA for the period ending 31 December 2006. The approval of OPTA was officially published in the Staatscourant on 14 July 2004. The full text of the description of the allocation system is published in Dutch by OPTA on their website, www.opta.nl. Value added tax on postal services At present, we are not allowed to charge value added tax on postal items forming part of the mandatory postal services. The flip side of this is that for mandatory postal services we cannot deduct the VAT amounts paid on our purchases of services and goods related to the mandatory services. We are required to charge VAT on all services not included in the mandatory services, i.e. the services in competition with other operators. Competitors are required to charge VAT on those items as well. Therefore, there is a level playing field for competitors and our company on these services. Public procurement Public procurement is the purchase of goods, services and public works by governments. Public sector procurement must follow transparent, open procedures ensuring fair conditions of competition for suppliers. At this moment we have no obligation to tender resulting from any public procurement regulation. On 2 February 2004, the EU adopted a package of amendments to simplify and modernise its public procurement directives. Those directives impose EU-wide competitive tendering for public contracts above a certain value and transparency and equal treatment for all tenders to ensure that the contract is awarded to the tender offering best value for money. The new directive 2004/17/EC of 31 March 2004, coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors also applies to certain postal and non-postal activities that are not exposed to competition. However, the directive leaves to the European member states the possibility of postponing the application of the directive on postal services until 1 January 2009. The Netherlands has exercised this option. We will therefore not be subject to the directive in the Netherlands until 1 January 2009. COMPETITION LAW European competition law Our businesses are subject to competition rules in the jurisdictions in which they operate. The Court of Justice of the European Community has explicitly confirmed that the rules of EU competition law also apply to the national mandatory postal services of the EU member states. The European Community published a notice in 1998 describing the application of competition rules to the postal sector and on the assessment of certain state measures. In particular, we are subject to the competition rules contained in articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty and to preventative control of mergers and acquisitions as regulated in the EC Merger Control Regulation. Article 81 prohibits collusion between competitors that may affect trade between member states and which has the object or effect of restricting competition within the EU. Article 82 prohibits any abuse of a dominant position within a substantial part of the EU that may affect trade between member states. Since 1 May 2004, national competition authorities and national courts have been empowered to apply articles 81 and 82 in full, in close operation with the European Commission in order to ensure the effective and uniform enforcement of these competition rules. We are also subject to the competition rules in the Agreement on the European Economic Area, which corresponds to the rules of EU competition law. The EEA rules for competition are enforced by the European Commission and the EFTA Surveillance Authority. Dutch competition law The services we provide in the Netherlands, including the mandatory postal services, fall within the scope of the Dutch Competition Act. The Dutch Competition Act stipulates a similar structure and set of rules as the rules of EU competition law on the prohibition of cartels, the prohibition of abuse of a dominant position and the preventive control on mergers and acquisitions. Compliance with the Dutch Competition Act is monitored by the Dutch Competition Authority. 190 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 191 Back to Contents Chapter 14 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 192 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Additional information Chapter 14 SHARE CAPITAL Under our articles of association, our authorised share capital amounts to €1,152 million nominal value. Our authorised share capital consists of: • 1,200,000,000 ordinary shares, • 1 special share, and • 1,199,999,999 preference shares B. We have called an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders for 27 February 2006 at which we will propose to amend our articles of association in order to decrease the authorised share capital. Upon effectuation of this amendment to the articles of association, our authorised share capital would amount to €864 million nominal value. Our authorised share capital would then consist of: • 900,000,000 ordinary shares, • 1 special share, and • 899,999,999 preference shares B. Each of the above shares has a nominal value of €0.48. As at the date of this annual report 479,999,999 ordinary shares and one special share were issued. No preference shares B were issued. REPURCHASE OF SHARE/SHARE BUY BACK PROGRAMME The State of the Netherlands is the holder of the special share. See for further information on the special share page 162. Our ordinary shares are issued in bearer or registered form, at the option of the shareholder. Ordinary shares in bearer form may be converted into registered form, and vice versa, at any time without charge. The special share and the preference shares B are registered shares. During the year we completed the repurchase of 20.7 million ordinary shares sold by the State of the Netherlands. On 7 April 2005, the annual general meeting of shareholders resolved to cancel these shares. The cancellation of 259,523 of these shares became effective on 16 June 2005. The cancellation of the remaining 20,440,477 shares shall become effective on the same date as the proposed decrease of our authorised share capital becomes effective. On 6 December 2005, we commenced a share buy back programme of €1 billion worth of shares. On 31 December 2005, 480,000,000 shares were outstanding (one special share and 479,999,999 ordinary shares). On 31 December 2005, 3,791,438 of the outstanding ordinary shares were held by us to cover share plans, and 29,460,477 of the outstanding ordinary shares were held by us for cancellation. Total number of shares purchased1 Average price paid per share (in €) Number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programmes Approximate value of shares that may yet be purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programmes (in € million) Repurchased in January 2005 13,100,000 19.74 13,100,000 0 Repurchased in December 2005 9,020,000 25.60 9,020,000 769 Total 22,120,000 22.13 22,120,000 769 1 Between 1 February 2005 and 30 Novemebr 2005 we repurchased no shares. On 29 September 2004, we announced that we would repurchase 20.7 million ordinary shares from the State of the Netherlands. Transfer of the repurchased shares took place in two tranches: the first tranche of 7.6 million shares was transferred to us on 4 October 2004; the transfer of the remaining 13.1 million shares was completed on 5 January 2005, both at a share price of €19.74. On 6 December 2005, we announced a programme to repurchase €1 billion worth of ordinary shares. In December 2005, we repurchased 9,020,000 shares under this programme at an average price of €25.60 per share. The programme will end 6 April 2006 unless prior to such date: • the aggregate value of shares acquired would exceed €1.0 billion, • 10% of the outstanding ordinary shares have been repurchased, including any ordinary shares already held by the company, or • if a cash or exchange offer with respect to our shares is publicly launched through the publication of an offer document. 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 193 Back to Contents Chapter 14 Additional information The maximum consideration to be paid per ordinary share under this repurchase programme is the higher of the price of the last independent trade in our shares and the highest current independent bid price on the trading venues where the purchase is carried out. Furthermore, this price will not exceed the normal trade price plus 10%. The normal trade price is the average closing price during the five trading days prior to the day of purchase. Not more than 25% of the average daily volume of the ordinary shares will be repurchased in any one day on the regulated market on which the purchase is carried out. The average daily volume figure is based on the average daily volume traded in the 20 trading days preceding the date of purchase. In 2005, we did not repurchase any of our shares other than those shares repurchased pursuant to the above publicly announced programmes. MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS GENERAL To our knowledge, no one, except for the State of the Netherlands, owns 5% or more of our shares and there are no arrangements the operation of which might result in a change in our control. The State of the Netherlands sold part of its ordinary shares in 2005 and owns on 22 February 2006 46,073,810 ordinary shares, representing approximately 10% of our outstanding ordinary shares. Furthermore, the State of the Netherlands owns 1 special share. There are no others holding special shares. The State of the Netherlands announced that it has agreed with ABN Amro-Rothschild, Citigroup and the purchasing parties in July 2005, to not sell any of its shares in TNT until July 2006 (standstill agreement). For information as to the portion of each class of shares held in the United States and the number of record holders in the United States, see chapter 15. THE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS OF THE STATE OF THE NETHERLANDS Overview An effectively operating postal system is of great importance to Dutch society for various reasons, including economic, strategic and national security reasons, and is therefore of general interest to the State of the Netherlands. For certain important postal services we are the exclusive holder of the Postal Concession granted by the State of the Netherlands (see chapter 13). As a result, we are crucial to the maintenance of an effectively operating postal system in the Netherlands. The State of the Netherlands holds approximately 10% of our ordinary shares.In addition to being a significant holder of ordinary shares, the State of the Netherlands has influence on us and our affairs through corporate governance mechanisms, its ownership of a special share and a longer term equity interest. Special share The State of the Netherlands holds a special share. For more information on the special share see note 31 of the consolidated financial statements on page 162. Pending changes to relation with the State of the Netherlands The European Commission sent the State of the Netherlands a formal request to give up the special share the State of the Netherlands holds in us. The State of the Netherlands has reacted that it has no intention of giving up its special share in our company. The State of the Netherlands is, however, considering the possibility of transferring the Postal Concession from TNT N.V. to Royal TPG Post B.V., our subsidiary for postal services, and limiting the applicability of the rights attached to the special share to apply only to that subsidiary. On 17 December 2003 the European Commission has brought this matter before the European Court of Justice to compel the State of the Netherlands to give up the special rights conferred by the special share. ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION Following is a brief description of certain provisions of our articles of association as last amended on 11 April 2005, pertaining to the rights and restrictions applicable to our ordinary shares. A description pertaining to the powers and restrictions applicable to members of the Board of Management and members of the Supervisory Board can be found in chapter 7 and chapter 9. These descriptions do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to our articles of association, book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and other Dutch laws. Copies of our articles of association are available on our website and upon request from us and have been filed with the SEC. We have called an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders for 27 February 2006 at which we will propose to amend our articles of association in order to decrease the authorised share capital. The proposed amendment will not bring any changes to the rights and restrictions applicable to our ordinary shares as described in this chapter, nor to the powers and restrictions applicable to members of the Board of Management and members of the Supervisory Board as described in chapters 7 and 9. The amendment of our articles of association that was effected on 11 April 2005 served to bring the articles of association further in line with the act on amendment of book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code in respect of the amendment of the Dutch large company rules that entered into force as per 1 October 2004. These amendments pertain to the provisions on appointment of members of the Supervisory Board, 194 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Additional information Chapter 14 approval of resolutions of the Board of Management by the general meeting of shareholders and the fact that the financial statements are adopted by the general meeting of shareholders and no longer by the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, the name of our company was changed from TPG N.V. into TNT N.V. and some technical amendments were implemented. GENERAL Pursuant to the Enabling Act as currently in force, we are subject to the full Dutch large company regime. Under these rules, we are required to adopt a two-tier system of corporate governance, comprising a board of management and a supervisory board. Under these rules, subject to statutory exceptions, the supervisory board, rather than the general meeting of shareholders, • has the right to nominate members of the supervisory board for appointment by the general meeting of shareholders, • appoints and dismisses members of the board of management, and • must approve certain resolutions by the board of management. See for further information on the applicable rules on the large company regime page 66. We have our corporate seat in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We are registered in the Commercial Register in Amsterdam under number 27168968. CORPORATE PURPOSE Article 4 of our articles of association provides that our business activity shall be, among other things: • to conduct holding activities in enterprises that, among other things, operate in the field of the transportation, distribution and delivery of letters, messages, parcels and goods, as well as the storing, converting and transmitting of information, the management and disposal of information, the providing of logistics services and the providing of money transactions, • to permit our subsidiaries to carry out the concessions or licences granted by the Dutch government for the activities described above, and • to conduct other holding and financing activities. ISSUANCE OF ORDINARY SHARES We may issue ordinary shares and grant rights to subscribe for ordinary shares, including options and warrants, pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Management, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board and the holder of the special share. The scope and duration of this authority of the Board of Management is to be determined by the general meeting of shareholders. Under our articles of association as they currently read, we may issue up to a maximum of 1,200,000,000 ordinary shares. Provided that the proposed amendment of our articles of association, that will be submitted to the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders to be held on 27 February 2006, is effectuated, we may then issue up to a maximum of 900,000,000 ordinary shares. On 7 April 2005, the annual general meeting of shareholders extended the current authority of the Board of Management to issue ordinary shares, up to a maximum of 10% of the issued share capital and an additional 10% of the issued share capital in case an issuance takes place in relation to a merger or acquisition. This authority will terminate on 7 October 2006. The general meeting of shareholders can, in accordance with our articles of association and subject to approval of the holder of the special share, extend this authority for a period not exceeding five years or extend this authority by amending our articles of association to that effect. If no such extension is given, the issuance of ordinary shares or rights to subscribe for ordinary shares requires a resolution of the general meeting of shareholders, upon a proposal of the Board of Management approved by the Supervisory Board. Such resolution of the general meeting of shareholders also requires the approval of the holder of the special share. RIGHTS ATTACHED TO EACH CLASS OF SHARES Voting rights and general meetings of shareholders We are required to hold a general meeting of shareholders within six months after the end of the financial year, among other things, to adopt the financial statements. Other general meetings of shareholders are held as often as the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board deem necessary, subject to applicable provisions of Dutch law. One or more shareholders representing at least 10% of our issued share capital may, upon their request, be authorised by the president of the court to call a general meeting of shareholders. The president will only give this authorisation if these shareholders have a reasonable interest in a general meeting of shareholders being held, if these shareholders have requested our Board of Management and our Supervisory Board in writing to call a general meeting of shareholders, stating their proposed agenda in detail, and our Board of Management and our Supervisory Board have not taken steps to ensure that a general meeting of shareholders can be held within six weeks after their request. General meetings of shareholders are convened by 15 days prior notice published in a nationally distributed daily newspaper and in the Official Price List of Euronext Amsterdam N.V. There are no quorum requirements applicable to general meetings of shareholders, unless otherwise required by Dutch law. General meetings of shareholders may only be held in Amsterdam, The Hague, Hoofddorp or in the municipality of Haarlemmermeer (Schiphol). One or more shareholders holding shares representing at least 1% of our issued share capital or representing according to the Official Price List a value of €50 million have the right to request the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board to place items on the agenda of the general meeting of shareholders. Such a request has to be honoured by the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board provided that important company interests do not dictate otherwise and that the request is received by the Board of Management or the 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 195 Back to Contents Chapter 14 Additional information Supervisory Board in writing, at least sixty days before the date of the general meeting of shareholders. Each shareholder has the right to attend general meetings of shareholders, either in person or by written or electronic proxy, to address the meeting and to exercise voting rights, subject to the provisions of our articles of association, provided that such shareholder has the aforementioned rights on the applicable record date set by the Board of Management, which date may not in any event be earlier than seven days prior to the date of the meeting. Holders of shares in registered form must notify us in writing of their intention to attend, in each case by the date specified in the notice of the meeting, which date may not in any event be earlier than seven days prior to the date of the meeting. Holders of shares in bearer form must request their relevant associated institution within the meaning of the Dutch Securities Bank Giro Transfer Act (Wet giraal effectenverkeer) to deliver a written statement, to the address specified in the notice of the meeting and in each case by the date specified in the notice of the meeting, which date may not in any event be earlier than seven days prior to the date of the meeting, stating that the relevant holder of shares is entitled to a given number of shares in bearer form on the record date. Instruments of proxy must be delivered to us no later than on the date specified in the notice of the meeting, which date may not in any event be earlier than seven days prior to the date of the meeting. Each of the shares in our capital carries the right to cast one vote. Unless otherwise required by Dutch law or our articles of association, resolutions are passed by a simple majority of votes cast. Dividend rights Our articles of association provide that within five months after the end of our financial year, the Board of Management must prepare financial statements accompanied by an annual report, to be adopted by the general meeting of shareholders. Within this same period, the Supervisory Board shall prepare a report that shall be added to the financial statements and the annual report. The general meeting of shareholders can extend this period of five months by a maximum of six months on account of special circumstances. We pay dividends on profits or by exception out of the distributable part of our shareholders equity as shown in our financial statements. We may not pay dividends if the payment would reduce shareholders equity below the sum of the paid-up capital and any reserves required by Dutch law or our articles of association. Subject to certain exceptions, if a loss is sustained in any year, we may not pay dividends for that year and we may not pay dividends in subsequent years until the loss has been compensated for out of subsequent years profits. We first have to pay dividends on the special share equal to 7% of its nominal value each year. If preference shares B have been issued and there are remaining profits available for payment of dividends, we then have to pay dividends on the paid-up portion of the nominal value of such preference shares B, at a rate of the average 12-monthly EURIBOR (EURO Interbank Offered Rate)  weighted to reflect the number of days for which the payment is made  plus a premium, to be determined by the Board of Management subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, of at least one percentage point and at most three percentage points, depending on prevailing market conditions, over the financial year to which the distribution relates. After payment of dividends on the special share and the preference shares B, the Board of Management may then determine, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to appropriate part of the remaining profits to reserves. The profits remaining after appropriation to reserves are at the disposal of the general meeting of shareholders. The Board of Management may pass a resolution that has been approved by the Supervisory Board and the holder of the special share that any dividend on ordinary shares be paid, at the shareholders option, wholly or partly in our ordinary shares rather than in cash. The State of the Netherlands, in its capacity as holder of the special share, has agreed with us that it will give any such approval within a period of two business days after a written request from us. The State of the Netherlands will give this approval without prejudice to the option, if such option is made available to holders of ordinary shares, of the State of the Netherlands in its capacity as holder of ordinary shares to choose between a dividend paid in cash or in ordinary shares. The Board of Management may, with the prior approval of the Supervisory Board and subject to provisions of Dutch law, distribute one or more interim dividends. In accordance with article 35, paragraph 6 of the articles of association, no dividend shall be paid on shares held by us in our own capital. Shares we hold in our own capital shall not be included for the computation of the profit distribution, unless the Board of Management resolves otherwise, which resolution is subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board. Our policy on additions to reserves and on dividends (the level and purpose of the addition to reserves, the amount of the dividend and the type of dividend) at the time of determination and in the event of any change and the resolution to determine and pay dividends shall be dealt with and explained as a separate agenda item at the annual general meeting of shareholders. The policy on additions to reserves and on dividends can be viewed on our website. Liquidation rights In the event of our dissolution and liquidation, the assets remaining after payment of all debts and liquidation expenses are to be distributed in the following order of preference: first, to the holders of the special share and all outstanding preference shares B, the nominal amount paid up on these shares plus accumulated dividends for preceding years which have not yet been paid; and second, to holders of the ordinary shares in proportion to their shareholdings. 196 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Additional information Chapter 14 Redemption provision None of our ordinary shares is subject to any redemption provisions. Sinking fund provision None of our ordinary shares is subject to any sinking fund provisions under our articles of association or as a matter of Dutch law. Liability to further calls or assessments All of our outstanding shares are fully paid and non-assessable. Discriminatory provisions There are no discriminatory provisions against any of our shareholders as a result of owning a substantial number of shares. Pre-emptive rights Except for issuances of ordinary shares for non-cash consideration and issuances to our employees, holders of ordinary shares have pre-emptive rights to subscribe for new issuances of ordinary shares in proportion to their shareholdings. These rights may be restricted or excluded by a resolution of the Board of Management, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board and the holder of the special share. The State of the Netherlands, in its capacity as holder of ordinary shares and the special share, has agreed with us that it will vote in favour of any proposal submitted annually to the general meeting of shareholders by the Board of Management to extend the authority of the Board of Management to restrict or exclude the pre-emptive rights of holders of ordinary shares. On 7 April 2005, the annual general meeting of shareholders extended the current authority of the Board of Management to restrict or exclude the pre-emptive rights of holders of ordinary shares, up to a maximum of 10% of the issued share capital and an additional 10% of the issued share capital in case an issuance takes place in relation to a merger or acquisition. The authority will terminate on 7 October 2006. Holders of ADSs may not be able to exercise preemptive rights granted to holders of ordinary shares. ACQUISITION BY US OF OUR OWN SHARES We may acquire our own shares, subject to the requirements of Dutch law and our articles of association, if: • our shareholders equity less the payment required to make the acquisition does not fall below the sum of paid-up capital and any reserves required by Dutch law or the articles of association, and • after the share acquisition, we would not hold shares with an aggregate nominal value exceeding one-tenth of our issued share capital. We cannot vote on shares held by us in our own capital. An acquisition by us of shares in our own capital may be effected by the Board of Management, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board and, if the acquisition amounts to more than 1% of the issued ordinary shares, the approval of the holder of the special share. We may only acquire shares in our own capital if the general meeting of shareholders has granted the Board of Management the authorisation to effect such acquisitions. Such an authorisation may apply for a maximum period of 18 months and must specify the number of shares that may be acquired, the manner in which shares may be acquired and the price limits within which shares may be acquired. The current authorisation expires on 7 October 2006. Under this authorisation, the maximum number of ordinary shares that can be acquired cannot exceed the maximum amount authorised by law (currently 10%) of the issued ordinary shares at the time of the acquisition, for a price per ordinary share not less than €0.01 and not exceeding the average of the closing prices of the ordinary shares as published in the Official Price List for the five trading days prior to the day of acquisition, plus 10% of such average. We may acquire our own shares for the purpose of transferring those shares to our employees pursuant to any arrangements applicable to such employees, subject to the requirements of Dutch law, provided however, that our Board of Management shall not require authorisation by the general meeting of shareholders for such acquisitions. REDUCTION OF CAPITAL Upon a proposal of the Board of Management, which proposal must be approved by the Supervisory Board, the general meeting of shareholders may reduce our outstanding share capital by cancellation of shares or by reducing the nominal value of shares subject to the provisions of the articles of association. CHANGES IN CAPITAL The conditions imposed by our articles of association for changes in capital are described above under Issuance of ordinary shares (page 195), Pre-emptive rights (page 197), Acquisition by us of our own shares (page 197) and Reduction of capital (page 197). The following conditions for changes in capital are more stringent than required under Dutch law: • resolutions of the general meeting of shareholders to extend the authorisation of the Board of Management to issue shares and to restrict or exclude pre-emptive rights of holders of ordinary shares are subject to the approval of the holder of the special share, • resolutions of the general meeting of shareholders to reduce the issued capital can only be adopted upon a proposal of the Board of Management, and • resolutions of the Board of Management to issue shares, to restrict or exclude the pre-emptive rights of holders of ordinary shares and to have the company acquire/alienate more than 1% of the issued capital in the form of ordinary shares are subject to the approval of the holder of the special share. 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 197 Back to Contents Chapter 14 Additional information RELEASE FROM LIABILITIES At the annual general meeting of shareholders, the general meeting of shareholders is, after the adoption of the financial statements, requested to adopt resolutions, releasing the members of the Board of Management and the members of the Supervisory Board respectively from actual or potential liabilities in connection with the execution of their duties during the financial year. The release from liability obtained by the members of the Board of Management and the members of the Supervisory Board is limited to the facts reflected in the financial statements or otherwise disclosed to the general meeting of shareholders prior to the adoption of the financial statements. However, the scope of a release from liability is subject to limitations by virtue of the law. INDEMNITY The company indemnifies the members of the Board of Management and of the Supervisory Board against any and all liabilities incurred by the relevant member as a result of any action brought by any party other than the company itself or its group companies, in relation to acts or omissions related to his/her capacity as a member of the Board of Management or of the Supervisory Board. The company reimburses any expenses incurred by such member in connection with such actions, but only upon receipt of a written undertaking by that member that the member will repay such expenses if a competent court determines that the member is not entitled to be indemnified. This indemnity does not apply to claims relating to the gaining of personal profits, advantages or remuneration to which the member was not legally entitled, or if the relevant member is adjudged to be liable for willful misconduct (opzet) or intentional recklessness (bewuste roekeloosheid). The indemnity does not cover liability of a member of the Board of Management or of the Supervisory Board toward the company itself. Nor does the indemnity apply to the extent claims and expenses are reimbursed by insurers. REMUNERATION POLICY FOR THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT/SUPERVISORY BOARD The general meeting of shareholders adopts the remuneration policy for the Board of Management. The remuneration itself is determined by the Supervisory Board. The general meeting of shareholders determines the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board. AMENDMENTS TO THE ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION, STATUTORY MERGER AND DISSOLUTION A resolution of the general meeting of shareholders to amend the articles of association (including with respect to changing the rights of holders of our ordinary shares), to enter into a statutory merger or demerger within the meaning of part 7, book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code or to dissolve us may only be adopted upon a proposal of the Board of Management that has been approved by the Supervisory Board. The holder of the special share must approve the resolutions of the general meeting of shareholders as described on page 194 under The ownership interests of the State of the Netherlands. CHANGE IN CONTROL PROVISIONS None of our shares is subject to any change in control provision. LARGE COMPANY REGIME Pursuant to the Enabling Act as currently in force, we are subject to the full large company regime. APPOINTMENT OF MEMBERS OF SUPERVISORY BOARD UNDER LARGE COMPANY REGIME Under the provisions of the large company regime, the members of the Supervisory Board are appointed by the general meeting of shareholders following nomination by the Supervisory Board. Both the general meeting of shareholders and the central works council may make recommendations and must be informed about this right as well as of the profile of vacancies. Nominations by the Supervisory Board must be reasoned against the Supervisory Board profile, which will be made available and must be discussed with the general meeting of shareholders and the central works council at the time of determination and in the event of any change. The central works council has a special right of recommendation for one-third of the total number of members of the Supervisory Board. The only circumstances in which the Supervisory Board may decide not to put a person on the nomination as recommended by the central works council are if the nominee is considered unsuitable to fulfil the function of a member of the Supervisory Board or if, upon acceptance, the Supervisory Board would not be composed properly. The Dutch Enterprise Chamber is the competent court to decide on disputes between the central works council and the Supervisory Board in this respect. The transitional arrangement of the provisions of Dutch law on the large company regime obligates the Supervisory Board to grant the special right of recommendation to the central works council on every second vacancy until one-third of the members of the Supervisory Board has been appointed accordingly. The general meeting of shareholders may reject a nomination by the Supervisory Board with a majority of votes representing one-third of the issued share capital. If the general meeting of shareholders resolves by majority of votes to reject the nomination, but the quorum is not met, a new meeting should be convened, in which case the quorum requirement is not applicable. The general meeting of shareholders can dismiss the Supervisory Board as a whole, with a majority of votes representing one-third of the issued share capital. APPROVAL GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS Pursuant to article 107a, book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, certain resolutions of the Board of Management entailing a significant change in the identity or character of TNT or its business are subject to the approval of the general meeting of shareholders. 198 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Additional information Chapter 14 When the Board of Management represents the company in a matter described in article 107a, book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code whilst the general meeting of shareholders has not approved the underlying resolution of the Board of Management, the company will be bound towards the third party involved. The approval of the general meeting of shareholders is not indispensable for the Board of Management to effectuate its resolution. RESTRICTION ON NON-DUTCH SHAREHOLDERS RIGHTS Under our articles of association there are no limitations on the rights of Dutch, non-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or exercise voting rights in respect of our securities, and we are not aware of any such restrictions under Dutch corporate law. OBLIGATIONS OF SHAREHOLDERS TO DISCLOSE HOLDINGS The Act on Disclosure of Holdings in Listed Companies 1996 (Wet melding zeggenschap in ter beurze genoteerde vennootschappen 1996) applies to any person who, directly or indirectly, acquires or disposes of an interest in the voting rights and/or the capital of a public limited liability company incorporated under Dutch law with an official listing on a stock exchange within the European Economic Area, if as a result of such acquisition or disposal the interest falls within a different percentage range. The percentage ranges referred to in the Act on Disclosure of Holdings in Listed Companies 1996 are 0-5, 5-10, 10-25, 25-50, 50-66.6 and over 66.6. Failure to comply with the Act on Disclosure of Holdings in Listed Companies 1996 constitutes an economic offence. In addition, a civil court can issue sanctions against any person who fails to notify, or incorrectly notifies us and the Authority Financial Markets in accordance with the Act on Disclosure of Holdings in Listed Companies 1996. Possible court sanctions include the suspension of voting rights with respect to the ordinary shares held by such person. MATERIAL CONTRACTS On 23 June 1998, we entered into an agreement with the State of the Netherlands. The terms of this agreement were modified, subject to the approval of the Dutch parliament, by a letter agreement dated 9 March 2001, between us and the State of the Netherlands. For a description of certain terms of this agreement, see page 194  The ownership interests of the State of the Netherlands. EXCHANGE CONTROLS There are no legislative or other legal provisions currently in force in the Netherlands or arising under the articles of association restricting remittance to holders of our securities not resident in the Netherlands. Cash dividends payable in euro on our ordinary shares may be officially transferred from the Netherlands and converted into any other convertible currency.

EMPLOYEES For the number of employees and full-time equivalents see note 19 of our consolidated financial statements on page 144. LABOUR RELATIONS European region A significant number of our employees in Europe is presently represented by trade unions. Our labour relations in Europe have been good and we have not experienced any material work stoppages in recent years. In 2004 there was a four day stoppage at Turin TNT Automotive Logistics and there was a 22-day stoppage in one plant due to issues related to a customer. During 2005, there were stoppages in Italy amounting to a total of 4,643 hours (covering 3,800 blue collar workers in 17 locations), and in France limited action also took place (two day stoppage at one site for 100 workers). Wages and general working conditions in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom are the subject of centrally negotiated collective bargaining agreements. Within the limits established by these agreements, our operating companies negotiate directly with unions and other labour organisations representing our employees. Collective bargaining agreements relating to remuneration typically have a term of one or two years. In addition to trade unions, we also consult from time to time with various local, national and European works councils. 200 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Additional information Chapter 14 Employees generally elect the members of works councils. Some of these works councils primarily have an advisory role, but in other cases, e.g. the Netherlands, we may be required to consult or ask approval from one or more of the works councils before proceeding with a course of action. Under Dutch law, our central works council may make recommendations for candidates to fill vacancies on our Supervisory Board. For further information on the recommendation rights of the central works council, see page 198. Furthermore, we are obliged to apprise the European works council of activities that affect our workforce in Europe. Other regions Except for our employees in Australia and those of our discontinued logistics business in the United States, our employees outside Europe are generally neither represented by trade unions nor employed pursuant to collective labour agreements. Trade unions represent less than 50% of our employees in Australia and fewer than 50% within our discontinued logistics operations in the United States. Labour relations have been good and we have not, apart from certain labour disputes and some small (1/2  1 day) work stoppages in 2004 in Australia, experienced any material work stoppages in recent years. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS For an overview of the legal proceedings, see chapter 12, page 160. TAXATION GENERAL The following is a summary of the material Dutch and US tax consequences of the ownership of ordinary shares or American Depositary Shares (ADSs), in particular by US holders (as defined below). The summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase ordinary shares or ADSs, and prospective investors should consult their professional advisors as to the tax consequences of their purchase, ownership and disposition of the ordinary shares and ADSs, including the consequences under applicable federal, state, local and foreign law. In particular, the summary does not address US holders that do not hold the shares or ADSs as capital assets and the tax treatment of holders subject to special tax rules, such as banks, insurance companies and dealers in securities, investors liable for alternative minimum tax or investors who hold ordinary shares or ADSs as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion transaction, some of which may be subject to special rules. This summary should not be read as extending by implication to matters not specifically discussed herein. Additional rules may apply to holders who themselves or through affiliates actually or constructively own 10% or more of the voting power or value of the ordinary shares or ADSs as determined by US Federal income tax law. The Dutch rules applying to holders of a substantial interest, in broad terms, foreign entities and individuals who hold or have held directly or indirectly, either independently or jointly with certain close relatives, at least 5% of the nominal paid-up capital of any class of shares in the company – or rights to acquire such shares – are not addressed in this summary other than in general terms. With respect to US holders, this discussion generally applies only to such holders who hold ordinary shares or ADSs as a portfolio investment. This summary does not take into account the specific circumstances of any particular US holder although such circumstances might materially affect the general tax treatment of such US holder. For the purposes of this discussion, a US holder is a holder of ordinary shares or ADSs that is a person who is a citizen or resident of the United States or who holds ordinary shares or ADSs as assets effectively connected with a US trade or business. This discussion does not purport to be a complete analysis or listing of all potential tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs. In general, for Dutch tax purposes, US holders of ADSs will be treated as the beneficial owners of the ordinary shares represented by such ADSs. It is assumed for purposes of this summary that a US holder is entitled to the benefits of the 1992 Treaty (as defined below). However, US holders should consult with their tax advisors regarding their status under the limitation of benefits article under the 1992 Treaty. With respect to the applicable 1992 Treaty it is important to notice that during the year 2004 a new protocol to the 1992 Treaty was ratified by both the Dutch parliament (in June 2004) and the US senate (on 17 November 2004). The protocol became effective for taxable periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005. The provisions of the protocol relating to withholding taxes became effective for amounts paid or credited on or after 1 February 2005. DUTCH TAXATION General The descriptions of the Dutch tax laws and practices set forth below are based on the statutes, regulations, rulings, judicial decisions and other authorities in force and applied in practice on 1 January 2006, all of which are subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect) and differing interpretations. In this description Dutch legal concepts are sometimes expressed in English terms and not in their original Dutch terms. These concepts may not be identical to the concepts designated by the same English term, as they exist under the laws of jurisdictions other than the Netherlands. In this chapter a distinction is made between residents of the Netherlands and non-residents of the Netherlands. Whether an investor qualifies as a resident of the Netherlands or as a non-resident of the Netherlands is based on facts, as well as on several fictions in Dutch tax legislation. In this section we will address the relevant Dutch dividend withholding tax, personal income tax, corporate income tax and gift, estate and 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 201 Back to Contents Chapter 14 Additional information inheritance tax aspects of the ownership of ordinary shares or ADSs. Dutch withholding tax on dividends Dividends (or similar income derived from shares qualifying as such under the Dutch Dividend Withholding Tax Act 1965, hereinafter referred to as income) distributed by the company are in principle subject to tax at source at the current rate of 25%, which will be withheld and remitted by the company to the Dutch tax authorities. As regards US holders the following will apply. A US holder can only claim the benefits of the tax treaty for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income signed on 18 December 1992 between the State of the Netherlands and the United States, as modified by the protocol of 8 March 2004 (together, the 1992 Treaty), if: • the person is a resident of the United States as defined in the 1992 Treaty, • the persons entitlement to these benefits is not limited by the limitations on benefits provisions of article 26 of the 1992 Treaty, and • the person can be considered to be the beneficial owner of the dividend. A person may not be considered to be the beneficial owner if a dividend would fall under the Netherlands anti-dividend stripping rules. Under the 1992 Treaty, dividends paid by the company to a resident of the United States, other than an exempt organisation or exempt pension trust, as described below, are generally eligible for a reduction of the 25% Dutch withholding tax to 15%, provided that the holder does not carry on an enterprise in the Netherlands through a permanent establishment, permanent representative or fixed base to which or to whom the ordinary shares or ADSs are attributable. If and to the extent the ordinary shares or ADSs are attributable to such a permanent establishment or representative, Dutch withholding tax will in principle amount to 25%. The 1992 Treaty provides for a complete exemption for dividends received by exempt pension trusts and exempt organisations, as defined in the 1992 Treaty. Except in the case of exempt organisations, this reduced dividend withholding rate can be applied for at source upon payment of the dividend; exempt organisations remain subject to the statutory dividend withholding tax rate of 25% and are required to file for a refund of this dividend withholding tax. A US holder other than an exempt organisation, generally may claim the benefits of a reduced withholding tax rate pursuant to the 1992 Treaty by submitting a Form IB 92 USA, which includes a bankers affidavit stating that the ordinary shares or ADSs are in the banks custody in the name of the applicant, or that the ordinary shares or ADSs have been exhibited to the bank as being the property of the applicant. If the Form IB 92 USA is submitted prior to the dividend payment date, the reduced withholding tax rate can be applied to the dividend. A US holder unable to claim withholding tax relief in this manner can obtain a refund of excess tax withheld by filing a Form IB 92 USA and describing the circumstances that prevented a claim for dividend withholding tax relief at source. Qualifying exempt organisations other than exempt pension trusts may seek a refund of the tax withheld by submitting Form IB 95 USA, which also includes a bankers affidavit. Under the Dutch anti-dividend stripping rules the recipient of a dividend is not considered to be the beneficial owner if it is plausible that: • the recipient paid, directly or indirectly, a consideration, in cash or in kind, in connection with the dividend distribution, and the payment forms part of a sequence of related transactions, • an individual or a company benefited, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, from the dividend, and that individual or company would have been entitled to a less favourable relief from Dutch dividend withholding tax than the recipient of the dividend distribution, and • that individual or company directly or indirectly retains or obtains a position in the shares that is comparable to its position in similar shares before the sequence of related transactions commenced. As described above, as of January 2005 the protocol of the 1992 Treaty became effective. With respect to withholding taxes the protocol became effective as of 1 February 2005. The new protocol, under strict conditions, provides for 0% Dutch dividend withholding tax on dividends paid to a US company owning shares that represent at least 80% of the voting power in a Dutch company. Furthermore shareholders that do not qualify for the 0% rate may, under certain conditions, qualify for a 5% withholding tax rate. In all other cases, as described above, a company, apart from those listed above, that can claim treaty benefits is entitled to a reduction of the Dutch withholding tax to 15%. In addition, as of 1 January 2005, several changes apply to article 26, stipulating which shareholders can benefit from the 1992 Treaty. Personal income tax in respect of dividends Under the Personal Income Tax Act 2001, income is divided into three separate boxes each of which is governed by its own rules: • box I (work and private residence) includes business and employment income, income from receivables and income from assets made available to a company in which the individual holds a substantial shareholding and income from the main private residence, • box II (substantial interest) includes dividend income and capital gains from substantial shareholdings, and • box III (savings and investments) covers passive income from capital. 202 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Additional information Chapter 14 Losses from one box can, in principle, not be offset against income from another box. The elements of income will be allocated to the spouse or partner that has received the income. A summary of the box system is described below in respect of the ordinary shares and ADSs. Personal income tax in respect of the ordinary shares or ADSs RESIDENT INDIVIDUALS OF THE NETHERLANDS AND CERTAIN NON-RESIDENT INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE ELECTED TO BE TAXED AS A RESIDENT BOX I (WORK AND PRIVATE RESIDENCE) An individual Dutch shareholder, who holds the ordinary shares or ADSs that can be attributed to the business assets of an enterprise which is, in whole or in part, carried on for the account of this shareholder, is liable to income tax on the dividends derived from the ordinary shares or ADSs at the progressive rates of box I, the maximum rate being 52%. Income derived or gains realised that qualify as income from miscellaneous activities (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden), which include activities with respect to the ordinary shares or ADSs that exceed regular, active portfolio management (normaal, actief vermogensbeheer), are also taxable at the progressive rates of box 1. BOX II (SUBSTANTIAL INTEREST) Income from substantial interests (broadly, shareholdings of at least 5% including rights to acquire such shareholdings) is taxed in box II. The tax rate amounts to 25%. Losses from a substantial interest may only be offset against income from a substantial interest and not against income from box I (work and private residence) or box III (savings and investments). There is a possibility for a credit for losses not compensated against the income tax liability of box II. Such tax credit is limited to 25% of the amount of the loss, and can only be claimed on condition that the holder of the substantial interest has sold all of that interest and holds no such interest in another entity. Interest related to the financing of a substantial interest is only deductible against the 25% rate. Income from loans to the company as well as income from other assets which are made available to the company are not taxable in box II, but in box I. Stock dividends received/derived will not be considered to form taxable income in box II at the moment of receipt. The purchase price of such stock dividend will in principle amount to zero. BOX III (SAVINGS AND INVESTMENTS) Income derived from capital (savings and investments) is taxed according to the regime of box III. Taxable income is determined annually on the basis of a fictitious – i.e. deemed – return on capital. This deemed return has been fixed at 4% of average net capital, assets less liabilities at market value, on 1 January and 31 December of any year. In this respect, assets and liabilities relating to income from box I and box II are not taken into account. The taxable income is computed without regard to the actual income and capital gains received. Thus, if actual income exceeds 4%, tax will still only be levied on the basis of 4%. On the other hand, there is no reduction in tax if the actual income is less than 4%. The deemed income is taxed at 30%. In principle, under the provisions of the Personal Income Tax Act 2001 the Dutch dividend tax can be credited, or refunded, for Dutch residents. This credit is also available against tax under box III. However, in case of dividend stripping transactions, the dividend withholding tax cannot be credited or refunded if the recipient cannot be considered to be the beneficial owner of the dividend. See the discussion on Dutch dividend withholding tax above. NON-NETHERLANDS RESIDENT INDIVIDUALS EU residents and residents of specified countries with which the Netherlands has concluded a tax treaty providing for the exchange of information who are liable for Netherlands taxation may elect to be taxed according to the rules applicable to resident taxpayers. They are then taxed as if they were a resident of the Netherlands (see above). Non-resident individual holders of the ordinary shares or ADSs will be taxable in the Netherlands in respect of income or gain from this shareholding if these shares: • are attributable to the business assets of a permanent establishment or permanent representative in the Netherlands (box I), generate income or gains that qualify as income from miscellaneous activities (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden) in the Netherlands, which include activities in the Netherlands with respect to these shares that exceed regular, active portfolio management (normaal, actief vermogensbeheer) (box I), or • belong to a substantial interest of the shareholder in the company and this substantial interest does not form part of the business assets of an enterprise of the shareholder (box II). The right of the Netherlands to levy personal income tax on dividends received by non-resident individuals may be restricted under specific provisions of applicable tax treaties. Dutch corporate income tax COMPANIES RESIDENT IN THE NETHERLANDS Under the Corporate Income Tax Act 1969, dividends received are in principle taxed at the ordinary Dutch rate. The ordinary corporate income tax rate in 2005 was 31.5% (reduced to 29.6% as of 1 January 2006), although the first €22,689 of taxable profit is taxed at 27% (reduced to 25.5% as of 1 January 2006). A legal entity or a similar entity qualifying as such under Dutch tax law (an entity) which is the beneficial owner of the ordinary shares or ADSs and who resides, or is deemed to reside, in the Netherlands, is, in principle, able to set off in full the dividend withholding tax withheld against its Dutch corporate income tax or claim a refund if it exceeds corporate income tax due. If, however, a Dutch resident company receives a dividend which is exempt 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 203 Back to Contents Chapter 14 Additional information in the Netherlands (e.g. under the participation exemption) and tax has been withheld such tax cannot be credited against the corporate income tax due but will be refunded to the company receiving the dividend. An entity resident in the Netherlands which is not subject to Dutch corporate income tax can, under certain conditions, request a refund of the dividend tax withheld. An entity subject to Dutch corporate income tax for which the shareholding in the company qualifies for the participation exemption pursuant to article 13 of the Corporate Income Tax Act 1969 will not be subject to Dutch corporate income tax on income derived from the ordinary shares or ADSs and is entitled to an exemption from dividend tax. The participation exemption normally applies if a Dutch resident entity which is subject to corporate income tax at the ordinary rates holds an interest of at least 5% of the nominal paid-up share capital of the company. Under specific circumstances the participation exemption can also apply to interests of less than 5%. An entity subject to Dutch corporate income tax will not be subject to corporate income tax on income derived from the ordinary shares or ADSs if the participation exemption pursuant to article 13 of the Corporate Income Tax Act 1969 applies with respect to the shareholding in the company. COMPANIES NOT RESIDENT IN THE NETHERLANDS If the ordinary shares are attributable to a permanent establishment or permanent representative in the Netherlands of a non-resident entity, the income distributed by the company will, in principle, be subject to corporate income tax at the rate of 31.5% (29.6% as of 1 January 2006), unless the participation exemption of article 13 of the Corporate Income Tax Act 1969 applies with respect to the shareholding in the company. Any dividend tax withheld can generally be set off against the Dutch corporate income tax due on this income, provided the recipient is the beneficial owner of the dividend. The State of the Netherlands has concluded tax treaties with Canada, the United States, Switzerland, Japan, all EU member states, Norway and a large number of other countries. Most tax treaties concluded by the State of the Netherlands provide for a reduced dividend withholding tax rate of 15% for portfolio investment. If the shares are not attributable to a Dutch permanent establishment or a permanent representative, dividends paid to non-resident entities which are shareholders of the company are in principle not subject to Dutch corporate income tax (other than the dividend withholding tax mentioned above), unless the non-resident shareholder holds a substantial interest in the company and the substantial interest does not form part of the business assets of an enterprise of the shareholder. The right of the Netherlands to tax the dividends may be restricted under specific provisions of applicable tax treaties. Personal income tax and corporate income tax on capital gains RESIDENTS OF THE NETHERLANDS In principle, capital gains derived from the sale of the ordinary shares or ADSs by an individual shareholder who resides, or is deemed to reside, in the Netherlands are not subject to Dutch personal income tax provided that the ordinary shares or ADSs do neither form part of a substantial interest nor can be attributed to the enterprise of that individual nor do the capital gains realised qualify as income from miscellaneous activities, which include activities with respect to the ordinary shares or ADSs that exceed regular, active portfolio management. Capital gains realised on the disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs that form part of a substantial interest of an individual are subject to tax in box II at the special 25% rate. The capital gains are subject to personal income tax at the ordinary progressive rates of box I, currently up to 52%, if the ordinary shares or ADSs form part of the business assets of an enterprise carried on, in whole or in part, for the account of an individual or if the capital gains realised qualify as income from miscellaneous activities, which include activities with respect to the ordinary shares or ADSs that exceed regular, active portfolio management. If the ordinary shares or ADSs are held by a Dutch resident entity, any capital gains derived from the sale of the ordinary shares or ADSs are subject to corporate income tax at 31.5% (29.6% as of 1 January 2006), unless the shareholding in the company qualifies for the participation exemption of article 13 of the Corporate Income Tax Act 1969. NON-RESIDENTS OF THE NETHERLANDS Capital gains realised by non-resident individuals who, or non-resident entities which, are shareholders of the company are in principle not subject to Dutch personal income tax or Dutch corporate income tax, provided that these shareholders: • do not hold a substantial interest in the company, or • do not conduct a business, trade or other taxable activities, in whole or in part, through a permanent establishment or permanent representative in the Netherlands to which or to whom the ordinary shares or ADSs are attributable, or • if they are individuals, do not realise capital gains that qualify as income from miscellaneous activities in the Netherlands, which include the performance of activities in the Netherlands with respect to the shares that exceed regular, active portfolio management. If the ordinary shares or ADSs form part of a substantial interest, the capital gain on the disposal of the ordinary shares or ADSs is, in principle, subject to tax at a rate of 25% for individuals or 31.5% (29.6% as of 1 January 2006) for entities, unless the substantial interest forms part of the business assets of an enterprise of the shareholder. If the ordinary shares or ADSs are held by a non-resident entity and can be allocated to a permanent establishment or permanent representative in the Netherlands, the capital gains may be exempt if the participation exemption applies. 204 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Additional information Chapter 14 Furthermore, the right of the Netherlands to tax the capital gain may be restricted under specific provisions of applicable tax treaties. Gift, estate or inheritance tax in the Netherlands Generally, gift, estate and inheritance tax will be due in the Netherlands with respect to the gift or inheritance of the ordinary shares or ADSs if the donor or deceased who owned the ordinary shares or ADSs is or was a resident or is or was deemed to be a resident of the Netherlands for purposes of Dutch gift and inheritance tax. No gift, estate or inheritance tax will arise in the Netherlands on a gift of the ordinary shares or ADSs by, or on the death of, a holder of the ordinary shares or ADSs who at the moment the gift is made is neither a resident nor deemed to be a resident of the Netherlands for purposes of Dutch gift and inheritance tax, provided that: • such holder does not die within 180 days after having made a gift, while being on the moment of his death a resident or a deemed resident of the Netherlands, and • such holder at the time of the gift, or at the time of his or her death did not have, an enterprise or an interest in an enterprise that is or was, in whole or in part, carried on through a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in the Netherlands and to which permanent establishment or a permanent representative, the ordinary shares or ADSs are or were attributable. If the donor or the deceased is an individual who holds the Dutch nationality, he will be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for purposes of Dutch gift and inheritance tax if he has been resident in the Netherlands at any time during the 10 years preceding the date of the gift or his death. If the donor is an individual who does not hold the Dutch nationality he will be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for purposes of Dutch gift tax if he has been resident in the Netherlands at any time during the 12 months preceding the date of the gift. The same twelve-month rule may apply to entities that have transferred their seat of residence out of the Netherlands. Furthermore, in exceptional circumstances, the donor or the deceased will be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for purposes of Dutch gift and inheritance tax if the beneficiary of the gift, or all beneficiaries under the estate jointly, as the case may be, make an election to that effect. UNITED STATES TAXATION The following is a summary of certain US Federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of ordinary shares as evidenced by ADSs. This summary does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential US Federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs. For purposes of this discussion, a US holder means an individual, citizen or resident of the United States for US Federal income tax purposes, a corporation, a partnership or other entity created or organised under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia, or an estate or trust which is resident in the United States for US Federal income tax purposes, in each case who • is not also resident of, or ordinarily resident in the Netherlands for Dutch tax purposes, • is not engaged in a trade or business in the Netherlands through a permanent establishment, and • does not own, directly, indirectly or by attribution, 10% or more of the shares of the company (by vote or value). This summary is of a general nature only and does not discuss all aspects of the US and Dutch taxation that may be relevant to a particular investor. The summary deals only with ADSs held by US holders as capital assets and does not address special classes of purchasers, such as dealers in securities, traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings, persons that hold ordinary shares or ADSs as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion transaction or as part of a synthetic security or other integrated transaction for US Federal income tax purposes, US holders whose functional currency is not the US dollar and certain US holders (including, but not limited to, insurance companies, tax-exempt organisations, financial institutions and persons subject to the alternative minimum tax) who may be subject to special rules. If a partnership holds shares or ADSs, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Owners of ADSs are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences to them of the ownership and disposition of such shares in light of their particular circumstances, including the tax consequences under state, local, foreign and other tax laws, and the possible effects of changes in US Federal or other tax laws. In addition, this summary is based, in part, upon representations made by the depositary to us and assumes that the deposit agreement, and all other related agreements, will be performed in accordance with its terms. The US Treasury Department has expressed concern that depositaries for ADSs, or other intermediaries between the holders of shares of an issuer and the issuer, may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming of US foreign tax credits by US holders of such receipts or shares. Accordingly, the analysis regarding the availability of a US foreign tax credit for Dutch taxes and sourcing rules described below could be affected by ongoing and future actions that may be taken by the US Treasury Department. For purposes of tax treaties and the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, US holders that own ADSs will be treated as owning ordinary shares. 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 205 Back to Contents Chapter 14 Additional information Under the 1992 Treaty, the company, other than through its US subsidiaries, will generally not be subject to US Federal income tax unless it engages in a trade or business in the United States through a permanent establishment. The company intends to conduct its business activities in a manner that will not result in its non-US entities being considered to be engaged in a trade or business or to have a permanent establishment in the United States. Taxation of dividends To the extent paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits of the company, as determined under US Federal income tax principles (E&P), a distribution made with respect to ordinary shares or ADSs (including the amount of any additional payment, and any Dutch withholding tax) will be includable for US Federal income tax purposes in the income of a US holder as ordinary income on the day received by the US holder, in the case of ordinary shares, or on the day received by the depositary, in the case of ADSs and will be treated as foreign source dividend income. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated E&P of the company will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the US holders adjusted tax basis in the ordinary shares or ADSs and thereafter as taxable capital gain. The company has not historically maintained calculations of earnings and profits under US Federal income tax principles, although it may be required to do so in the future. Any such dividend paid in euros will be included in the gross income of a US holder in an amount equal to the US dollar value of the euros on the date of receipt, which in the case of ADSs is the date they are received by the depositary. If dividends received in euro are converted into US dollars on the day they are received by the depositary, the US holder generally will not be required to recognise foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the dividend income. The amount of any distribution of property other than cash will be the fair market value of such property on the date of distribution. Certain dividends paid to non-corporate US holders of ADSs in taxable years beginning after 31 December 2002 and before 1 January 2009 may be taxable at the rate applicable to long-term capital gains (generally at a maximum rate of 15%). This reduced income tax rate is only applicable to dividends paid by domestic corporations and qualified foreign corporations and only with respect to shares held by a qualified US holder (i.e. an individual) for a minimum holding period (generally, 61 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date). Based upon the information contained within the filing of this document with the SEC along with other factors the company may be considered a qualified foreign corporation. Accordingly, dividends paid to individual US holders on shares held for the minimum holding period may be eligible for a reduced income tax rate. The reduced income tax rate is not applicable to dividends paid by a company that is a passive foreign investment company for the corporations taxable year in which the dividend is paid or for the preceding year. This reduced tax rate for qualified dividends is scheduled to expire on 31 December 2008, unless further extended by congress. Each prospective investor should consult its own tax advisor regarding the implications of this legislation. In the case of a corporate US holder, dividends on shares and ADSs are taxed as ordinary income and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to US corporations in respect of dividends received from other US corporations. Dividends paid to US holders will generally be subject to a Dutch withholding tax of 25% and will generally be eligible for a foreign tax credit. This amount may be reduced under the 1992 Treaty and is referred to above under Dutch Taxation – Dutch withholding tax on dividends. If the US holder is a US partnership, trust or estate, the foreign tax credit will be available only to the extent that the income derived by such partnership, trust or estate is subject to US tax either as the income of a US resident in its hands or in the hands of its partners or beneficiaries, as the case may be. The withholding tax may, subject to certain limitations, be offset against US Federal taxes on foreign source income by filing Internal Revenue Services (IRS) Form 1116 (or IRS Form 1118 for corporations) Foreign Tax Credit with the Federal income tax return. IRS Form 1116 can be obtained by calling 1-800-TAX FORM. This tax credit will normally reduce the US tax liability on the dividend. A US holder of ADSs or ordinary shares nonetheless will not be entitled to claim the tax credit for withholding taxes if the holding of ADSs or ordinary shares: • is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in the Netherlands through which the holder carries on business in the Netherlands, or • is effectively connected with a fixed base in the Netherlands from which the holder performs independent personal services. Further, special rules apply if the holder: • owns at least 10% of the ordinary shares of the company (or, in the case of a holder that is a US corporation, controls, alone or with one or more associated corporations, at least 10% of the voting stock of the company), or • is exempt from tax in the US on dividends paid by the company. A US holder may elect annually either to deduct the Dutch withholding tax (see Dutch Taxation) from its income or take the withholding taxes as a credit against its US Federal income tax liability, subject to US foreign tax credit limitation rules. If and to the extent that the company pays a dividend on the common shares or ADSs out of dividend income from its non-Dutch subsidiaries and is, therefore, entitled to a credit for Dutch tax purposes for foreign taxes attributable to such dividend income from non-Dutch subsidiaries, there is a risk 206 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Additional information Chapter 14 that the IRS might take the position that the allowable credit for Dutch tax purposes constitutes a partial subsidy of the companys withholding tax obligation and that, therefore, a US holder would not be entitled to a foreign tax credit with respect to the amount so allowed. However, this Dutch tax credit is available only to the company and does not reduce the amount of withholding tax applied against the dividends paid by the company. The company does not believe that such a position would be correct because such Dutch credit is based primarily on the net dividend received and the US holder does not receive any benefit from such Dutch tax credit available to the company. Taxation of capital gains In general, a US holder who is a resident of the United States for purposes of the 1992 Treaty and who is entitled to benefits of the 1992 Treaty under the limitations on benefits provision contained therein will not be subject to Dutch taxation on any gain derived from the sale or exchange of ADSs, except in certain instances where the US holder maintains a permanent establishment or fixed base in the Netherlands. A US resident holder of ADSs or ordinary shares generally will be liable for US Federal income tax on such gains to the same extent as on any other gains from sales of stock. For US tax purposes, US holders will generally recognise gain or loss upon the sale or exchange of ADSs equal to the difference between the amount realised from the sale or exchange of the ADSs and the US holders basis in such ADSs. In general, such gain or loss will be US source capital gain or loss. In the case of individual US holders, capital gains are subject to US Federal income tax at preferential rates if specified minimum holding periods are met and if such shares are held as a capital asset. If held for more than one year, such gain or loss will generally be long term capital gain or loss. Long term capital gain of a non-corporate US holder that is recognised on or after 6 May 2003 and before 1 January 2009 is generally taxed at a maximum rate of 15%. Subject to the discussion below under Passive foreign investment company considerations, a US holder will be liable for US Federal income tax on gains from sales or dispositions of ADSs or ordinary shares to the same extent as on any other gains from sales or dispositions of shares. Passive foreign investment company considerations In general, a foreign corporation becomes a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) if either 75% of its gross income for a year is passive income or 50% of its assets during the year produce or are held for the production of passive income. Based on the manner in which the company has historically operated its business, the company does not believe that it is a PFIC for US Federal income tax purposes. However, the company can give no assurances that it will not at some time in the future become a PFIC. If the company were classified as a PFIC for any taxable year during which a US holder held an ADS or ordinary share, certain adverse tax consequences could apply to the US holder. A prospective purchaser of the companys ADSs should consult with its tax advisor regarding the application of the PFIC rules to its ownership of an ADS or ordinary share. US information reporting and backup withholding Generally, the amount of dividends paid to US holders of ADSs, the name and address of the recipient and the amount, if any, of tax withheld must be reported annually to the IRS. A similar report is sent to the US holder. A holder of ordinary shares or ADSs may be subject to US backup withholding tax, unless such holder: • is a corporation or other exempt recipient and, if required, demonstrates its status as such, or • provides a US taxpayer identification number, certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding and otherwise complies with any applicable backup withholding requirements. Holders who fail to furnish certain identifying information under the US information reporting rules will be subject to backup withholding. Amounts withheld from payments will be allowed as a credit against such US holders US Federal income tax liability. The backup withholding is currently 28% but this rate is subject to change. Persons required to establish their exempt status generally must provide such certification on IRS Form W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification) in the case of US persons and on the appropriate IRS Form W-8 in the case of non-US persons. Holders of ordinary shares should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the information reporting and backup withholding rules, including the finalised Treasury regulations. United States gift and estate tax An individual US holder will be subject to US gift and estate taxes with respect to the ADSs in the same manner and to the same extent as with respect to other types of personal property. 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 207 Back to Contents 208 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F Back to Contents Chapter 15 INVESTOR RELATIONS 2005 Annual Report and Form 20-F 209 Back to Contents Chapter 15 Investor relations FURTHER INFORMATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS GENERAL We adhere to the principle that we must explain business developments and financial results to investors. Our chief financial officer has the principle responsibility for investor relations with the active involvement of our chief executive officer. Our investor relations department organises presentations for analysts and institutional investors, which can be viewed on our website. Our policy is to provide all shareholders and other parties in the financial markets with equal and simultaneous information about matters that may influence the share price. The contacts between the Board of Management on the one hand and press and analysts on the other must be carefully handled and structured, and the company must not engage in any acts that compromise the independence of analysts in relation to the company and vice versa. Briefings on quarterly results are given either via group meetings or teleconference and are both accessible by telephone or via our website. Briefings are similarly given to update the market between each quarterly announcement. We may hold briefing meetings with institutional shareholders to ensure that the investing community receives a balanced and complete view of the companys performance and the issues faced by the business. These meetings generally occur after publication of our second and fourth quarter results, but also happen during other periods of the year, for example during broker conferences. We communicate with our shareholders through the annual general meeting of shareholders, newsletters and our website. Meetings of analysts can by way of webcasting at all times be reviewed by shareholders. Our website provides all relevant information with regard to dates of analyst meetings and procedures concerning webcasting. Our central officer is responsible for monitoring this process and the meetings. Analysts reports and valuations shall not be assessed, commented upon or corrected other than factually, by the company in advance of publication. For further information visit our website at group.tnt.com. We do not pay any fee(s) to parties for the carrying out of research for analysts reports or for the production or publication of analysts reports with the exception of credit rating agencies. Analysts meetings, presentations to institutional or other investors shall not take place during the closed period. The closed period runs from the end of the financial quarter until publication of a quarterly, halfyear or fullyear report. Our Board of Management has adopted investor relations and media guidelines with which all Board of Management members must at all times abide unless explicitly exempted by the chief executive officer. Our contacts with the capital market must be dealt with by the members of the Board of Management and our investor relations professionals. Our website provides all information that is required to be published. Our website will also give access to shareholders circulars required for any approvals sought from the general meeting of shareholders. We commit in this respect to shareholders circulars that in form and substance will be similar to the standard that applies to similar instruments issued by FTSE 100 companies. Our website provides a summary of the minutes of shareholders meetings. All shareholders resolutions are decided on a poll, except when the issue relates to a vote concerning individuals or the meeting decides to have a ballot. The proxy votes cast in relation to all resolutions are disclosed to those in attendance at the meeting and the results of the poll are published at our website. STOCK EXCHANGE AND SHARE PRICE INFORMATION Since 29 June 1998, following our demerger from KPN, our ordinary shares have been listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, which was renamed Euronext Amsterdam in connection with the merger of the Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris stock exchanges in 2000, the London Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. On 20 February 2006 we announced our intention to end our listing on the London Stock Exchange and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in the first half of 2006. The principal market for trading in our ordinary shares is Euronext Amsterdam. TNT is included in the AEX index, which consists of the top 25 companies in the Netherlands, ranked on the basis of their turnover in the stock market and free float. We have an unrestricted sponsored American Depositary Receipt (ADR) facility with Citibank N.A. as depositary.

PEER GROUP COMPARISON For comparative reasons, our company has defined a peer group of publicly listed companies with activities in the same industries in which TNT is active. This peer group consists of the Germany-based company Deutsche Post, with activities in mail, express and logistics and the UK-based company Exel, having activities in the field of logistics. On 12 December 2005, Exel was delisted as a result of a takeover by Deutsche Post. Other peers include Swiss based Kuehne & Nagel International AG, active in freight management and logistics, as well as the two United States-based express carriers FedEx and United Parcels Services. For this peer group, the comparative performance in terms of total shareholder returns in 2005 is charted below. DIVIDEND TNT (IN € CENTS) We try to meet shareholders return requirements through dividends and growth in value of our shares. TNT annually pays interim and final dividends in cash. TNT pays cash dividends in euro. Exchange rate movements will affect the amounts received by ADS holders on conversion by the depositary of such cash dividends. SHARE BUY BACK PROGRAMME In addition to returning cash to our shareholders through dividends, we may repurchase our own shares. On 6 December 2005, we announced the start of a €1 billion share buy back programme.
