Item 1A. Risk Factors. There are several factors, some beyond our control that could cause results to differ significantly from our expectations. Some of these factors are described below. Other factors, such as market, operational, liquidity, interest rate and other risks, are described elsewhere in this report (see, for example, Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations). Any factor described in this report could by itself, or together with one or more factors, adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. There may be factors not described in this report that could also cause results to differ from our expectations. We cannot predict the effect that healthcare reform and other changes in government programs may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The Affordable Care Act dramatically alters the United States healthcare system and is intended to decrease the number of uninsured Americans and reduce the overall cost of healthcare. The Affordable Care Act attempts to achieve these goals by, among other things, requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance, expanding Medicare and Medicaid eligibility, reducing Medicare DSH and Medicaid payments to providers, expanding the Medicare programs use of value-based purchasing programs, tying hospital payments to the satisfaction of certain quality criteria, bundling payments to hospitals and other providers, and instituting certain private health insurance reforms. Although a majority of the measures contained in the Affordable Care Act do not take effect until 2013, certain of the reductions in Medicare spending, such as negative adjustments to the Medicare hospital inpatient and outpatient prospective payment system market basket updates and the incorporation of productivity adjustments to the Medicare programs annual inflation updates, became effective in 2010 and 2011 or will be implemented in 2012. Challenges to the Affordable Care Act will be heard by the United States Supreme Court in 2012. The Supreme Court will consider four issues: (1) whether the individual mandate  the requirement that all individuals purchase some form of health insurance  is constitutional; (2) if the individual mandate is found unconstitutional, whether it is severable from the remainder of the Affordable Care Act; (3) whether the Affordable Care Acts requirement that states expand Medicaid eligibility or risk losing federal funds is constitutional; and (4) whether the individual mandate is a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act, meaning that plaintiffs seeking to challenge the requirement must wait until it takes effect in 2014. Additionally, several bills have been and will likely continue to be introduced in Congress to repeal or amend all or significant provisions of the Affordable Care Act. It is difficult to predict the full impact of the Affordable Care Act due to pending Supreme Court review, its complexity, lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance, gradual and potentially delayed implementation, and possible repeal and/or amendment, as well as our inability to foresee how individuals and businesses will respond to the choices afforded them by the Affordable Care Act. As a result, it is difficult to predict the full impact that the Affordable Care Act will have on our revenue and results of operations. Our revenues will decline if federal or state programs reduce our Medicare or Medicaid payments or if managed care companies reduce reimbursement amounts. In addition, the financial condition of payors and healthcare cost containment initiatives may limit our revenues and profitability. In 2011, we derived 49.3% of our revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, collectively. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations concerning patient eligibility requirements, funding levels and the method of calculating payments or reimbursements and requirements for utilization review, among other things, and federal and state funding restrictions, all of which could materially increase or decrease payments from these government programs in the future, as well as affect the timing of payments to our facilities. We are unable to predict the effect of future government healthcare funding policy changes on our operations. If the rates paid by governmental payors are reduced, if the scope of services covered by governmental payors is limited or if we or one or more of our hospitals are excluded from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid program or any other government healthcare program, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, revenues from HMOs, PPOs and other private payors are subject to contracts and other arrangements that require us to discount the amounts we customarily charge for healthcare services. 27 TABLE OF CONTENTS During the past several years, healthcare payors, such as federal and state governments, insurance companies and employers, have undertaken initiatives to revise payment methodologies and monitor healthcare costs. As part of their efforts to contain healthcare costs, payors increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures or the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk relating to paying for care provided, often in exchange for exclusive or preferred participation in their benefit plans. Similarly, many individuals and employers have attempted to reduce their healthcare costs by moving to private payor plans that reimburse our facilities at significantly lower rate than other competing private payors. We expect efforts to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls by government and other payors to continue, thereby reducing the payments we receive for our services. In addition, payors have instituted policies and procedures to substantially reduce or limit the use of inpatient services. For example, CMS has transitioned to full implementation of the MS-DRG system, which represents a refinement to the existing diagnosis-related group system. Future realignments in the MS-DRG system could impact the margins we receive for certain services. Furthermore, the Affordable Care Act provides for material reductions in the growth of Medicare program spending, including reductions in Medicare market basket updates, and Medicare DSH funding. All of our hospitals are certified as providers of Medicaid services. Medicaid programs are jointly funded by federal and state governments and are administered by states under an approved plan that provides hospital and other healthcare benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care. A number of states, however, are experiencing budget problems and have adopted or are considering legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures, including enrolling Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and imposing additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand such states Medicaid systems. It is possible that budgetary pressures will force states to resort to some of the cost saving measures mentioned above. These efforts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our hospitals receive federal and/or state funding from other programs like upper payment limits (UPL) and the sole community hospital program. For example, one of our hospitals, Memorial Medical Center of Las Cruces, New Mexico (MMC), received approximately $39.5 million during 2011 under the New Mexico Sole Community Provider Program (the SCPP). While the funds made available to MMC (and other New Mexico hospitals that participate in the SCPP) are not tied directly to the cost of actual services provided, MMC is required to provide an annual report of its costs to Dona Ana County (the county primarily served by MMC). Once desired funding levels were established by Dona Ana County for 2009, the county submitted funds to the New Mexico Human Services Department (the NMHSD), which in turn were combined with funds sent by other New Mexico counties and then used by the NMHSD to request matching funds from the federal government. Once the federal matching dollars were made available to the state, the resulting sole community provider payment was made under the SCPP directly to MMC (and other hospitals participating in the SCPP) by the NMHSD. The payments made by the NMHSD to hospitals pursuant to the SCPP are based on formulas established with respect to each participating hospital. The SCPP was created in 1993 and has resulted in significant payments to MMC in prior years. Like many other states, there is a general concern in New Mexico that the SCPP cannot be sustained at current funding levels as a result of budget concerns and other factors. It seems likely, as a result, that the SCPP will soon be reconstituted. We are not able to predict what changes may be made to the SCPP, but any change in the SCPP is likely to reduce payments made to MMC. Spending cuts resulting from the Budget Control Act of 2011 may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation or cash flow. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the BCA) was enacted. The BCA increased the nations debt ceiling while taking steps to reduce the federal deficit. The deficit reduction component was implemented in two phases. In the first phase, the BCA imposed caps that reduced discretionary (non-entitlement) spending by more than $900 billion over 10 years, beginning in FFY 2012. Second, a bipartisan Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (the Committee) was charged with identifying at least $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction, which could include entitlement provisions like Medicare reimbursement to providers. On November 21, 2011, the Committee announced that its members were unable to agree on any measures to reduce the deficit, and as a result, $1.2 trillion in across-the-board spending 28 TABLE OF CONTENTS reductions required by the BCA are scheduled to be imposed automatically for FFY 2013 through 2021, split evenly between domestic and defense spending. Certain programs (including the Medicaid program) are protected from these automatic spending reductions. While provider payments under the Medicare program would be subject to reduction under this enforcement mechanism, those reductions would be capped at 2%. The automatic spending cuts or Congressional action on other spending cuts may reduce the revenues we receive from governmental payment programs or impose additional restrictions on those programs intended to decrease the long-term cost of such programs may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation or cash flow. We cannot predict whether these cuts will be imposed or if they will be averted by future legislative action. We are subject to increasingly stringent governmental regulation, and may be subjected to allegations that we have failed to comply with governmental regulations which could result in sanctions and even greater scrutiny that reduce our revenues and profitability. All participants in the healthcare industry are required to comply with many laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels. These laws and regulations require that hospitals meet various requirements, including those relating to hospitals relationships with physicians and other referral sources, the adequacy and quality of medical care, inpatient admission criteria, privacy and security of health information, standards for equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, billing and cost reports, payment for services and supplies, maintenance of adequate records, compliance with building codes and environmental protection, among other matters. Many of the laws and regulations applicable to the healthcare industry are complex, and there are numerous enforcement authorities, including CMS, OIG, State Attorneys General, and contracted auditors, as well as whistleblowers. Some positions taken in connection with enforcement appear to be inconsistent with historical common practices within the industry but have not previously been challenged. Moreover, in light of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that created potential False Claims Act liabilities for failing to report and repay known overpayments and return an overpayment within sixty (60) days of the identification of the overpayment or the date by which a corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later, hospitals and other healthcare providers are encouraged to disclose potential violations of law. It is likely that voluntary disclosure of potential violations will continue in the future. The healthcare industry has seen a number of ongoing investigations related to patient referrals, physician recruiting practices, cost reporting and billing practices, laboratory and home healthcare services, physician ownership of hospitals and other healthcare providers, and joint ventures involving hospitals and physicians. For example, our hospital, Jackson Purchase Medical Center in Mayfield, Kentucky, entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement with the OIG on June 27, 2011 following an investigation of certain billing practices. This investigation was initiated after a Medicare beneficiary made a complaint to an Assistant United States Attorney. With an increased public emphasis on enforcement being made by state and federal agencies, including changes in laws that encourage and facilitate whistleblowers to make complaints, we anticipate that hospitals and healthcare providers, including those owned by the Company, will face an increased number of governmental inquiries arising out of complaints made by program beneficiaries or other individuals. Hospitals continue to be one of the primary focal areas of the OIG and other governmental fraud and abuse programs. In January 2005, the OIG issued Supplemental Compliance Program Guidance for Hospitals that focuses on hospital compliance risk areas. Some of the risk areas highlighted by the OIG include correct outpatient procedure coding, revising admission and discharge policies to reflect current CMS rules, submitting appropriate claims for supplemental payments such as pass-through costs and outlier payments and a general discussion of the fraud and abuse risks related to financial relationships with referral sources. Each FFY, the OIG also publishes a General Work Plan that provides a brief description of the activities that the OIG plans to initiate or continue with respect to the programs and operations of HHS and details the areas that the OIG believes are prone to fraud and abuse. In addition, the claims review strategies used by the RACs generally include a review of high dollar claims, including inpatient hospital claims. As a result, a large majority of the total amounts recovered by RACs has come from hospitals. The Affordable Care Act expands the RAC programs scope to include managed Medicare and to include Medicaid claims by requiring all states to establish programs to contract with RACs by January 1, 2012. In addition, CMS employs Medicaid Integrity Contractors (MICs) to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify 29 TABLE OF CONTENTS overpayments. The Affordable Care Act increases federal funding for the MIC program for FFY 2011 and later years. In addition to RACs and MICs, the state Medicaid agencies and other contractors have also increased their review activities. The laws and regulations with which we must comply are complex and subject to change. In the future, different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil or criminal penalties, including the loss of our licenses to operate our hospitals and our ability to participate in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. Finally, we are subject to various federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. Our healthcare operations generate medical waste, such as pharmaceuticals, biological materials and disposable medical instruments that must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations. Our operations are also subject to various other environmental laws, rules and regulations. Environmental regulations also may apply when we renovate or refurbish hospitals, particularly older facilities. We may continue to see the growth of uninsured and patient due accounts, and deterioration in the collectability of these accounts could adversely affect our collections of accounts receivable, revenues, results of operations and cash flows. The primary collection risks associated with our accounts receivable relate to the uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and co-payments) remain outstanding. The provision for doubtful accounts relates primarily to amounts due directly from patients. This risk has increased, and will likely continue to increase, as more individuals enroll in high deductible insurance plans or those with high co-payments or who have no insurance coverage. These trends will likely be exacerbated if general economic conditions remain challenging or if unemployment levels in the communities in which we operate rise. As unemployment rates increase, our business strategies to generate organic growth and to improve admissions and adjusted admissions at our hospitals could become more difficult to accomplish. The amount of our provision for doubtful accounts is based on our assessments of historical collection trends, business and economic conditions, trends in federal and state governmental and private employer health coverage and other collection indicators. A continuation in trends that results in increasing the proportion of accounts receivable being comprised of uninsured accounts and deterioration in the collectability of these accounts could adversely affect our collections of accounts receivable, results of operations and cash flows. As enacted, the Affordable Care Act seeks to decrease, over time, the number of uninsured individuals. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act will, beginning in 2014, expand Medicaid and incentivize employers to offer, and require individuals to carry, health insurance or be subject to penalties. However, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the Affordable Care Act due to its complexity, lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance, gradual and potentially delayed implementation, pending Supreme Court action, and possible repeal and/or amendment, as well as our inability to foresee how individuals and businesses will respond to the choices afforded them by the Affordable Care Act. In addition, even after implementation of the Affordable Care Act, we may continue to experience bad debts and be required to provide uninsured discounts and charity care for undocumented aliens who are not permitted to enroll in a health insurance exchange or government healthcare programs. Controls designed to reduce inpatient services may reduce our revenues. Controls imposed by Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as utilization review, have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities. Federal law contains numerous provisions designed to ensure that services rendered by hospitals to Medicare and Medicaid patients meet professionally recognized standards and are medically necessary and that claims for reimbursement are properly filed. These provisions include a requirement that a sampling of admissions of Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed by quality 30 TABLE OF CONTENTS improvement organizations, which review the appropriateness of Medicare and Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided, the validity of MS-DRG classifications and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay or cost on a post-discharge basis. Quality improvement organizations may deny payment for services or assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to HHS that a provider which is in substantial noncompliance with the standards of the quality improvement organization be excluded from participation in the Medicare program. The Affordable Care Act potentially expands the use of prepayment review by Medicare contractors by eliminating statutory restrictions on their use, and, as a result, efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue. Utilization review is also a requirement of most non-governmental managed care organizations and other third-party payors. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by third party payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Although we are unable to predict the effect these controls and changes will have on our operations, significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. The industry trend towards value-based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues. There is a trend in the healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services. These value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. Governmental programs including Medicare and Medicaid currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. In addition, Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events. Many large commercial payors currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payors do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events. The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions intended to promote value-based purchasing. Effective July 1, 2011, the Affordable Care Act prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat HACs. Beginning in FFY 2015, hospitals that fall into the top 25% of national risk-adjusted HAC rates for all hospitals in the previous year will receive a 1% reduction in their total Medicare payments. Hospitals with excessive readmissions for conditions designated by HHS will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excessive readmission standard. The Affordable Care Act also requires HHS to implement a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services. The Affordable Care Act requires HHS to reduce inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by a percentage beginning at 1% in FFY 2013 and increasing by 0.25% each fiscal year up to 2% in FFY 2017 and subsequent years. HHS will pool the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by HHS. HHS will determine the amount each hospital that meets or exceeds the quality performance standards will receive from the pool of dollars created by these payment reductions. We expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts. We are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect our results of operations, but it could negatively impact our revenues. The lingering effects of the economic recession could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The United States economy continues to experience the negative effects from an economic recession and unemployment levels remain high. While certain healthcare spending is considered non-discretionary and may not be significantly impacted by economic downturns, other types of healthcare spending may be adversely impacted by such conditions. When patients are experiencing personal financial difficulties or have concerns about general economic conditions, they may choose:  to defer or forego elective surgeries and other non-emergent procedures, which are generally more profitable lines of business for hospitals; or 31 TABLE OF CONTENTS  a high-deductible insurance plan or no insurance at all, which increases a hospitals dependence on self-pay revenue. Moreover, a greater number of uninsured patients may seek care in our emergency rooms. We are unable to determine the specific impact of these economic conditions on our business at this time, but we believe that the lingering effects of the economic recession could have an adverse impact on our operations and could impact not only the healthcare decisions of our patients, but also the solvency of managed care providers and other counterparties to transactions with us. The failure of certain employers, or the closure of certain manufacturing and other facilities in our markets, can have a disproportionate impact on our hospitals. The economies in the non-urban communities in which our hospitals primarily operate are often dependant on a small number of large employers, especially manufacturing or other facilities. These employers often provide income and health insurance for a disproportionately large number of community residents who may depend on our hospitals for care. The failure of one or more large employers, or the closure or substantial reduction in the number of individuals employed at manufacturing or other facilities located in or near many of the non-urban communities in which our hospitals primarily operate, could cause affected employees to move elsewhere for employment or lose insurance coverage that was otherwise available to them. The occurrence of these events may cause a material reduction in our revenues and results of operations or impede our business strategies intended to generate organic growth and improve operating results at our hospitals. If we do not effectively attract, recruit and retain qualified physicians, our ability to deliver healthcare services efficiently will be adversely affected. As a general matter, only physicians on our medical staffs may direct hospital admissions and the services ordered once a patient is admitted to a hospital. As a result, the success of our hospitals depends in part on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, the admitting practices of those physicians and maintaining good relations with those physicians. The success of our efforts to recruit and retain quality physicians depends on several factors, including the actual and perceived quality of services provided by our hospitals, our ability to meet demands for new technology and our ability to identify and communicate with physicians who want to practice in non-urban communities. In particular, we face intense competition in the recruitment and retention of specialists because of the difficulty in convincing these individuals of the benefits of practicing or remaining in practice in non-urban communities. If the non-urban communities in which our hospitals primarily operate are not seen as attractive, then we could experience difficulty attracting and retaining physicians to practice in our communities. We may not be able to recruit all of the physicians we target. In addition, we may incur increased malpractice expense if the quality of physicians we recruit does not meet our expectations. Additionally, our ability to recruit physicians is closely regulated. For example, the types, amount and duration of assistance we can provide to recruited physicians are limited by the Stark law, the Anti-kickback Statute, state anti-kickback statutes, and related regulations. For example, the Stark law requires, among other things, that recruitment assistance can only be provided to physicians who meet certain geographic and practice requirements, that the amount of assistance cannot be changed during the term of the recruitment agreement, and that the recruitment payments cannot generally benefit physicians currently in practice in the community beyond recruitment costs actually incurred by them. In addition to these legal requirements, there is competition from other communities and facilities for these physicians, and this competition continues after the physician is practicing in one of our communities. The financial performance of our employed physicians will be affected by changes in the Medicare and Medicaid payment rates. In recent years, physician payment amounts have been determined on a year by year basis. If the SGR is applied to the physician fee schedule in March 2012 as required by current legislation, physician Medicare payments will decrease by 27.4%. We believe that physician employment by acute care hospitals has become more common as a result of actual and potential reductions in payment amounts for physician services. Our 32 TABLE OF CONTENTS experience in employing physicians is consistent with industry trends. Employed physicians could present more direct risks to us than those presented by independent members of our hospitals medical staffs. The combination of increased salary cuts and potential liabilities are significant and if this trend continues, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our hospitals face competition for staffing, which may increase labor costs and reduce profitability. In addition to our physicians, the operations of our hospitals are dependent on the efforts, abilities and experience of our management and medical support personnel, such as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians. We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management and staff personnel responsible for the day-to-day operations of each of our hospitals, including nurses and other non-physician healthcare professionals. In some markets, the scarce availability of nurses and other medical support personnel presents a significant operating issue. This shortage may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel, recruit personnel from foreign countries, and hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. In addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit admissions in order to meet the required ratios. If our labor costs increase, we may not be able to raise rates to offset these increased costs. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. Because a significant percentage of our revenue consists of fixed, prospective payments, our ability to pass along increased labor costs is constrained. Our failure to recruit and retain qualified management, nurses and other medical support personnel, or to control our labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The loss of certain physicians can have a disproportionate impact on certain of our hospitals. Generally, the top ten attending physicians within each of our facilities represent a large share of our inpatient revenues and admissions. The loss of one or more of these physicians  even if temporary  could cause a material reduction in our revenues, which could take significant time to replace given the difficulty and cost associated with recruiting and retaining physicians. We may be subjected to actions brought by the government under anti-fraud and abuse provisions or by individuals on the governments behalf under the False Claims Acts qui tam or whistleblower provisions. The federal False Claims Act prohibits providers from, among other things, knowingly submitting false claims for payment to the federal government. The qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act allow private individuals to bring actions under the False Claims Act on behalf of the government. These private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government, and, as a result, the number of whistleblower lawsuits that have been filed against providers has increased significantly in recent years. Defendants found to be liable under the federal False Claims Act may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties ranging between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. The government has used the False Claims Act to prosecute Medicare and other government healthcare program fraud such as coding errors, billing for services not provided, submitting false cost reports, and providing care that is not medically necessary or that is substandard in quality. The Affordable Care Act also provides that claims submitted in connection with patient referrals that result from violations of the Anti-kickback Statute constitute false claims for the purposes of the federal False Claims Act, and some courts have held that a violation of the Stark law can result in False Claims Act liability, as well. In addition, a number of states have adopted their own false claims and whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court. We are required to provide information to our employees and certain contractors about state and federal false claims laws and whistleblower provisions and protections. 33 TABLE OF CONTENTS Although we intend and will endeavor to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws, many of these laws are broadly worded and may be interpreted or applied in ways that cannot be predicted. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our arrangements or business practices will not be subject to government scrutiny or be found to be in compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. If our access to licensed information systems is interrupted or restricted, or if we are not able to integrate changes to our existing information systems or information systems of acquired hospitals, our operations could suffer. Our business depends significantly on effective information systems to process clinical and financial information. Information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology. We rely heavily on HCA-Information Technology and Services, Inc., (HCA-IT), for information systems. HCA-IT provides us with financial, clinical, patient accounting and network information services. HCAs primary business is to own and operate hospitals, not to provide information systems. We do not control HCA-ITs systems. If these systems fail or are interrupted, if our access to these systems is limited in the future or if HCA-IT develops systems more appropriate for the urban healthcare market and not suited for our hospitals, our operations could suffer. Our existing contract with HCA-IT, expires on December 31, 2017 (including a wind-down period) unless extended by the parties. System conversions are costly, time consuming and disruptive for physicians and employees. Some of our hospitals have recently converted or are currently converting from the system provided by HCA-IT to another third party information system. Implementation of such conversions are very costly and, if such conversions occurred on a large scale, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, as new information systems are developed in the future, we will need to integrate them into our existing systems. Evolving industry and regulatory standards, such as HIPAA and meaningful use regulations, may require changes to our information systems in the future. We may not be able to integrate new systems or changes required to our existing systems or systems of acquired hospitals in the future effectively or on a cost-efficient basis. If we fail to effectively and timely implement electronic health record systems, our operations could be adversely affected. As required by ARRA, the Secretary of HHS is in the process of developing and implementing an incentive payment program for eligible hospitals and healthcare professionals that adopt and meaningfully use EHR technology. HHS intends to use the Provider Enrollment, Chain and Ownership System (PECOS) to verify Medicare enrollment prior to making EHR incentive program payments. If our hospitals and employed professionals are unable to meet the requirements for participation in the incentive payment program, including having an enrollment record in PECOS, we will not be eligible to receive incentive payments that could offset some of the costs of implementing EHR systems. Further, beginning in FFY 2015, eligible hospitals and professionals that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology will be subject to reduced payments from Medicare. System conversions to comply with EHR could be time consuming and disruptive for physicians and employees. Failure to implement EHR systems effectively and in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. We are in process of converting certain of our clinical and patient accounting information system applications to newer versions of existing applications or all together new applications at several of our facilities. In connection with our implementations and conversions, we have incurred significant capitalized costs and additional training and implementation expenses. 34 TABLE OF CONTENTS We are subject to potential legal and reputational risk as a result of our access to personal information of our patients. There are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient and consumer privacy concerns, including unauthorized access to or theft of personal information. In the ordinary course of our business, we, and vendors on our behalf, collect and store sensitive data, including personal health data and other personally identifiable information of our patients. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We have developed a comprehensive set of policies and procedures in our efforts to comply with HIPAA and other privacy laws. In 2011, the DHHS Office for Civil Rights imposed, for the first time, civil monetary penalties and imposed a corrective action plan on a covered entity for violating HIPAAs privacy rule. If, in spite of our compliance efforts we were to experience a breach, loss, or other compromise of such personal health information, such event could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, result in regulatory penalties, legal claims and liability under HIPAA and other state and federal laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may have difficulty acquiring hospitals on favorable terms. One element of our business strategy is expansion through the acquisition of acute care hospitals primarily in non-urban markets. We face significant competition to acquire attractive hospitals, and we may not find suitable acquisitions on favorable terms. Our primary competitors for acquisitions have included for-profit and tax-exempt hospitals and hospital systems and privately capitalized start-up companies. Buyers with a strategic desire for any particular hospital  for example, a hospital located near existing hospitals or those who will realize economic synergies  have demonstrated an ability and willingness to pay premium prices for hospitals. Strategic buyers, as a result, can present a competitive barrier to our acquisition efforts. Given the increasingly challenging regulatory and enforcement environment, our ability to acquire hospitals could be negatively impacted if targets are found to have material unresolved compliance issues, including obligations to self-report violations of law or outstanding obligations to pay amounts under the voluntary self-referral protocol or other laws. We could experience delays in closing or fail to close transactions with targets that initially were attractive but became unattractive as a result of a poor compliance program, material non-compliance with laws or failure to timely address compliance risks. The cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of operations, depending on various factors, including the amount paid for the acquisition, the acquired hospitals results of operations, allocation of purchase price, effects of subsequent legislation and limitations on rate increases. In the past, we have occasionally experienced temporary delays in improving the operating margins or effectively integrating the operations of our acquired hospitals. In the future, if we are unable to improve the operating margins of acquired hospitals, operate them profitably or effectively integrate their operations, we may be unable to achieve our growth strategy. Even if we are able to identify an attractive target, we may not be able to obtain financing, if necessary, for any acquisitions or joint ventures that we might make or may be required to borrow at higher rates and on less favorable terms. We may incur or assume additional indebtedness as a result of acquisitions. Our failure to acquire non-urban hospitals consistent with our growth plans could prevent us from increasing our revenues. In recent years, the legislatures and attorneys general of several states have become more interested in sales of hospitals by tax-exempt entities. This heightened scrutiny may increase the cost and difficulty, or prevent the completion, of transactions with tax-exempt organizations in the future. 35 TABLE OF CONTENTS We may encounter difficulty operating and integrating acquired hospitals. We may be unable to timely and effectively integrate any hospitals that we acquire with our ongoing operations. We may experience delays in implementing operating procedures and systems in newly acquired hospitals. Integrating an acquired hospital could be expensive and time consuming and could disrupt our ongoing business, negatively affect cash flow and distract management and other key personnel. In addition, acquisition activity requires transitions from, and the integration of, operations and, usually, information systems that are used by acquired hospitals. We will rely heavily on HCA-IT and other third parties for information systems integration as part of a contractual arrangement for information technology services. We may not be successful in causing HCA-IT and other third parties to convert our newly acquired hospitals information systems in a timely manner. If we acquire hospitals with unknown or contingent liabilities, we could become liable for material obligations. Businesses we have acquired, or businesses we may acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities for past activities of acquired businesses, including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and regulations, medical and general professional liabilities, workers compensation liabilities, previous tax liabilities and unacceptable business practices. Although we have historically obtained, and we intend to continue to obtain, contractual indemnification from sellers covering these matters, any indemnification obtained from sellers may be insufficient to cover material claims or liabilities for past activities of acquired businesses. Other hospitals and outpatient facilities provide services similar to those which we offer. In addition, physicians provide services in their offices that could be provided in our hospitals. These factors increase the level of competition we face and may therefore adversely affect our revenues, profitability and market share. Competition among hospitals and other healthcare service providers, including outpatient facilities, has intensified in recent years. We compete with other hospitals, including larger tertiary care centers located in larger metropolitan areas, and with physicians who provide services in their offices which could otherwise be provided in our hospitals. Although the hospitals with which we compete may be a significant distance away from our facilities, patients in our markets may migrate on their own to, may be referred by local physicians to, or may be encouraged by their health plan to travel to these hospitals. Furthermore, some of the hospitals with which we compete may offer more or different services than those available at our hospitals, may have more advanced equipment or may have a medical staff that is thought to be better qualified. Also, some of the hospitals that compete with our facilities are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or not-for-profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions. These hospitals, in most instances, are also exempt from paying sales, property and income taxes. We also face very significant and increasing competitions from services offered by physicians (including physicians on our medical staffs) in their offices and from other specialized care providers, including outpatient surgery, oncology, physical therapy and diagnostic centers (including many in which physicians may have an ownership interest). Some of our hospitals have and will seek to develop outpatient facilities where necessary to compete effectively. However, to the extent that other providers are successful in developing outpatient facilities or physicians are able to offer additional, advanced services in their offices, our market share for these services will likely decrease in the future. Quality of care and value-based purchasing have also become significant trends and competitive factors in the healthcare industry. In 2005, CMS began making public performance data relating to ten quality measures that hospitals submit in connection with their Medicare reimbursement. Since that time, CMS has on several occasions increased the number of quality measures hospitals are required to report in order to receive the full IPPS and OPPS market basket updates. In addition, the Medicare program no longer reimburses hospitals for the cost of care relating to certain preventable adverse events, and many private healthcare payors have adopted similar policies. If the public performance data become a primary factor in where patients choose to receive care, and if competing hospitals have better results than our hospitals on those measures, we would expect that our patient volumes could decline. 36 TABLE OF CONTENTS Our revenues are especially concentrated in a small number of states which will make us particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in those states. Our revenues are particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in states in which we generate the majority of our revenues including Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, New Mexico, West Virginia, Arizona, Louisiana and Alabama. The following table contains our revenues and revenues as a percentage of our total revenues by state for each of these states for the years presented (dollars in millions): Hospitals inState as ofDecember 31, 2011 Revenue Concentration by State Amount % of Total Revenues 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Kentucky 9 $ 501.5 $ 478.9 $ 434.3 16.6 % 17.0 % 16.8 % Virginia 4 369.0 345.4 334.6 12.2 12.3 12.9 Tennessee 10 345.1 257.5 202.7 11.4 9.1 7.8 New Mexico 2 291.3 277.1 271.5 9.6 9.8 10.5 West Virginia 2 252.1 246.2 224.9 8.3 8.7 8.7 Arizona 2 199.1 201.2 182.3 6.6 7.1 7.0 Louisiana 5 195.4 177.8 172.5 6.5 6.3 6.7 Alabama 5 178.2 187.3 169.4 5.9 6.6 6.5 Accordingly, any change in the current demographic, economic, competitive or regulatory conditions in the above-mentioned states could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects. Medicaid changes in these states could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we do not continually enhance our hospitals with the most recent technological advances in diagnostic and surgical equipment, our ability to maintain and expand our markets may be adversely affected. Technological advances, including with respect to computer-assisted tomography scanner (CTs), magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) and positron emission tomography scanner (PETs) equipment, continue to evolve. In addition, the manufacturers of such equipment often provide incentives to try to increase their sales, including providing favorable financing to higher credit risk organizations. In an effort to compete, we must continually assess our equipment needs and upgrade our equipment as a result of technological improvements. We believe that the direction of the patient flow correlates directly to the level and intensity of such diagnostic equipment. We may be subject to liabilities because of malpractice and related legal claims brought against our hospitals or our employed physicians. If we become subject to these claims, we could be required to pay significant damages, which may not be covered by insurance. We may be subject to medical malpractice lawsuits and other legal actions arising out of the operations of our owned and leased hospitals and the activities of our employed physicians. These actions may involve large claims and significant defense costs. In an effort to resolve one or more of these matters, we may choose to negotiate a settlement. Amounts we pay to settle any of these matters may be material. We maintain professional and general liability insurance with unrelated commercial insurance carriers to provide for losses in excess of our SIR amount. As a result, one or more successful claims against us that are within our SIR amounts could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition or liquidity. Also, some of these claims could exceed the scope of the coverage in effect, or coverage of particular claims could be denied. In addition, we operate a wholly-owned captive insurance company under the name Point of Life Indemnity, Ltd., which, issues malpractice insurance policies to our employed physicians. Insurance coverage in the future may not continue to be available at a cost allowing us to maintain adequate levels of insurance with acceptable SIR level amounts. One or more of our insurance carriers may become insolvent and unable to fulfill its obligation to defend, pay or reimburse us when that obligation becomes due. In addition, physicians using our hospitals may be unable to obtain insurance on acceptable 37 TABLE OF CONTENTS terms, which could result in these physicians not being able to meet the minimum insurance requirements in the applicable hospital medical staff bylaws or necessitate a reduction in the level of insurance required to be carried under such bylaws. We have substantial indebtedness and we may incur significant amounts of additional indebtedness in the future which could affect our ability to finance operations and capital expenditures, pursue desirable business opportunities or successfully operate our business in the future. As of December 31, 2011, our consolidated debt, excluding the unamortized discount of convertible debt instruments, was approximately $1,652.8 million. We also have the ability to incur significant amounts of additional indebtedness, subject to the conditions imposed by the terms of our credit agreement and the agreements or indentures governing any additional indebtedness that we incur in the future. As of December 31, 2011, revolving loans available for borrowing under our credit agreement, as amended, with Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders (the Credit Agreement) were up to $320.2 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $29.8 million. Additionally, our Credit Agreement contains uncommitted accordion features that permit us to borrow at a later date additional aggregate principal amounts of up to $650.0 million under the term A and the term B loan components and up to $300.0 million under the revolving loan component, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and the satisfaction of other conditions. Our Term A Loans and Revolving Loans mature on December 15, 2012. At December 31, 2011, there were no Term A Loans or Revolving Loans outstanding. We are currently working on maturity date extensions, potential increases in available capacity and additional flexibility in terms for our Credit Agreement. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity of our various debt instruments, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay maturing debt and fund other operating requirements. Although we believe that our future operating cash flow, together with available financing arrangements, will be sufficient to fund our operating requirements, our leverage and debt service obligations could have important consequences, including the following:  Under our Credit Agreement, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and tests. Failure to comply with these obligations may cause an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could require us to repay substantial indebtedness immediately. Moreover, if debt repayment is accelerated, we will be subject to higher interest rates on our debt obligations as a result of these covenants and our credit ratings may be adversely impacted.  We may be vulnerable in the event of downturns and adverse changes in the general economy or our industry. Specific examples of industry changes that could have an adverse impact on our cash flow include the implementation by the government of further limitations on reimbursement under Medicare and Medicaid.  We may have difficulty obtaining additional financing at favorable interest rates to meet our requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes.  We will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of funds available for operations, capital expenditures and future acquisitions.  Any borrowings we incur at variable interest rates expose us to increases in interest rates generally.  A breach of any of the restrictions or covenants in our debt agreements could cause a cross-default under other debt agreements. We may be required to pay our indebtedness immediately if we default on any of the numerous financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the debt agreements. It is not certain whether we will have, or will be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. If any senior debt is accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such indebtedness and our other indebtedness. 38 TABLE OF CONTENTS  In the event of a default, we may be forced to pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, reducing or delaying capital expenditures or seeking additional equity capital. There can be no assurances that any of these strategies could be effected on satisfactory terms, if at all, or that sufficient funds could be obtained to make these accelerated payments. Covenant restrictions under our senior secured credit facilities and our indenture will impose operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to operate our business and to make payments on the notes and other outstanding indebtedness. The exceptions to the covenants in our indenture may allow us to refinance subordinated indebtedness with senior indebtedness. Our Credit Agreement and indenture contain covenants that restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, to take advantage of other business opportunities that may be in our interest or to satisfy our obligations under the notes. These covenants restrict our ability to, among other things:  incur or guarantee additional debt or extend credit;  pay dividends or make distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, our capital stock or certain  other debt;  make other restricted payments, including investments;  dispose of assets;  engage in transactions with affiliates;  enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends;  create liens on our assets or engage in sale/leaseback transactions; and  effect a consolidation or merger, or sell, transfer, lease all or substantially all of our assets. The limitations in our Credit Agreement, our indenture or other instruments governing indebtedness that we may incur in the future may restrict our ability to repay existing outstanding indebtedness. Subject to certain conditions, holders of the 3½% convertible senior subordinated notes due 2014 and the 3¼% convertible senior subordinated debentures due 2025 may convert their securities for cash, and if applicable, shares in common stock prior to the maturation of the notes offered hereby. Failure to repay the 3½% convertible senior subordinated notes due 2014 or 3¼% convertible senior subordinated debentures due 2025 upon maturity or upon conversion of the securities may result in a default. Our revenues and volume trends may be adversely affected by certain factors over which we have no control. Our revenues and volume trends are dependent on many factors, including physicians clinical decisions and availability, payor programs shifting to a more outpatient-based environment, whether or not certain services are offered, seasonal and severe weather conditions, including the effects of extreme low temperatures, hurricanes and tornados, earthquakes, current local economic and demographic changes, the intensity and timing of yearly flu outbreaks. In addition, technological developments and pharmaceutical improvements may reduce the demand for healthcare services or the profitability of the services we offer. If our fair value declines or if our estimated future cash flows decrease, a material non-cash charge to earnings from impairment of our goodwill or our long-lived assets could result. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $1,568.7 million of goodwill and approximately $1,830.4 million of long-lived assets, net of accumulated depreciation. We expect to recover the carrying values of both our goodwill as well as our long-lived assets through our future cash flows. We evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill at least annually, based on our fair value, to determine whether it is impaired. We evaluate our long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset, or related group of assets, may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows. If the carrying value of our goodwill or our long-lived assets is impaired, we may incur a material non-cash charge to earnings. 39 TABLE OF CONTENTS Certificate of need laws and regulations regarding licenses, ownership and operation may impair our future expansion in some states. Some states require prior approval for the purchase, construction and expansion of healthcare facilities, based on the states determination of need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services. Eleven states in which we operate hospitals require a certificate of need for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount, changes in bed capacity or services, and for certain other planned activities. We may not be able to obtain certificates of need required for expansion activities in the future. In addition, all of the states in which we operate facilities require hospitals and most healthcare providers to maintain one or more licenses. If we fail to obtain any required certificate of need or license, our ability to operate or expand operations in those states could be impaired. In states without certificate of need laws, competing providers of healthcare services are able to expand and construct facilities without the need for significant regulatory approval. In the seven states in which we operate that do not require certificates of need for the purchase, construction and expansion of healthcare facilities or services, competing healthcare providers face low barriers to entry and expansion. If competing providers of healthcare services are able to purchase, construct or expand healthcare facilities without the need for regulatory approval, we may face decreased market share and revenues in those markets. Different interpretations of accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Generally accepted accounting principles are complex, continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by us, our independent registered public accounting firm and the SEC. Such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances. Differences in interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile; any significant decline may result in litigation. The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. This may result in stockholder lawsuits, which could divert managements time away from operations and could result in higher legal fees and proxy costs. Our stock price may fluctuate in response to the results or our operations and to a number of events and factors, including:  actual or anticipated quarterly variations in operating results, particularly if they differ from investors expectations;  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;  changes in government regulations including those relating to reimbursement and operational policies and procedures;  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable;  changes in overall economic factors in our markets;  news reports relating to trends or events in our markets; and  issues associated with integration of the hospitals that we acquire. Broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. 40 TABLE OF CONTENTS As a result of the above factors, we could be subjected to potential stockholder lawsuits. Such lawsuits are time consuming and expensive. Among other things, such lawsuits divert managements time and attention from operations. Such lawsuits also force us to incur substantial legal fees and proxy costs in defending our position. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. We have no unresolved SEC staff comments.
