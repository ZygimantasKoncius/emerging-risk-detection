Item 1A. Risk Factors. If the Merger is not completed, State Investors Bancorp will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the Merger. State Investors Bancorp has incurred substantial expenses in connection with the Merger. The completion of the Merger depends on the satisfaction of specified conditions and the receipt of regulatory approvals and the approval of State Investors Bancorp’s shareholders. The Company cannot guarantee that these conditions will be met. If the Merger is not completed, these expenses could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations on a stand-alone basis. In addition, the market price of the Company’s common stock would likely decline in the event that the Merger is not consummated as the current market price likely reflects an assumption that the Merger will be completed.
