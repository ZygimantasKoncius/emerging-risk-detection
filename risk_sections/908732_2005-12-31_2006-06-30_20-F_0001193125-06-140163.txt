D. Risk Factors. Our operations may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the petroleum and petrochemical market and by the volatility of prices of crude oil and refined oil products. Most of our revenues are attributable to petrochemical products which have historically been cyclical and sensitive to the availability and price of feedstocks and general economic conditions. Markets for many of our products are sensitive to changes in industry capacity and output levels, cyclical changes in regional and global economic conditions, the price and availability of substitute products and changes in consumer demand, which from time to time have had a significant impact on product prices in the regional and global markets. Historically, the markets for these products have experienced alternating periods of tight supply, causing prices and margins to increase, followed by periods of capacity additions, possibly resulting in oversupply and declining prices and margins. As tariffs and other import restrictions are reduced and the control of product allocation and pricing is relaxed in China, the markets for many of our products have become increasingly subject to the cyclicality of regional and global markets. Historically, international prices of crude oil have fluctuated widely due to many other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that future growth in demand for our products will be sufficient to alleviate any existing or future conditions of excess industry capacity or that such conditions will not be sustained or further aggravated by anticipated or unanticipated capacity additions or other events. In addition, we expect that the volatility and uncertainty of the prices of crude oil and petrochemical products will continue. Increasing crude oil prices and declines in prices of petrochemical products may adversely affect our business and results of operations and financial condition. 4 Table of Contents Our development plans have significant capital expenditure and financing requirements, which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The petrochemical business is a capital intensive business. Our ability to maintain and increase our revenues, net income and cash flows depends upon continued capital spending. Our current business strategy contemplates capital expenditures for 2006 of approximately RMB1.8 billion (US$223.04 million), which will be provided through financing activities and use of our own capital. Our actual capital expenditures may vary significantly from these planned amounts due to our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, investments and other factors that may be beyond our control. In addition, there can be no assurance as to whether, or at what cost, our capital projects will be completed or the success of these projects if completed. As of March 31, 2006, we had aggregate outstanding indebtedness of approximately RMB5,991 million (US$742.36 million). China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec Corp), our controlling shareholder, did not provide any guarantee or credit support for our debt for the year ended December 31, 2005 and for the three-month period ended March 31, 2006. Our ability to obtain external financing in the future is subject to a variety of uncertainties including:  our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows;  the condition of the economy in China and the markets for our products;  the cost of financing and the condition of financial markets; and  the issuance of relevant government approvals and other project risks associated with the development of infrastructure in China. Our failure to obtain sufficient funding for our operations or development plans could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We could face increased competition. Eastern China, our principal market, has enjoyed stronger economic growth and a higher demand for petrochemical products than other regions of China. As a result, we believe that competitors will try to expand their sales and build up their distribution networks in our principal market. We believe this trend will continue and probably accelerate. Increased competition may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to pass on all cost increases from rising crude oil prices. We currently consume large amounts of crude oil to manufacture our products. While we try to match crude oil cost increases with sales price increases, our ability to pass on cost increases to our customers is dependent on market conditions and government regulations, particularly government regulation with respect to the price of crude oil and certain of our products. There may be periods during which we cannot fully cover increases in crude oil prices by increases in the sale prices of our products. This may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 5 Table of Contents In 2005, our production costs increased significantly due to the continued price inflation of crude oil on the international market. Because the cost of crude oil accounted for 68.96% of our total cost of sales in 2005, and the average processing costs for crude oil increased by 39.13% compared to 2004, which was much higher than the price increases of our four major types of products, our profit margin in 2005 decreased significantly. Related party transactions; non-competition; conflicts of interests. We have engaged from time to time and will continue to engage in a variety of transactions with Sinopec Corp and China Petrochemical Corporation, the controlling shareholder of Sinopec Corp, and their various subsidiaries or affiliates who provide a number of services to us, including sales and marketing, educational and community services. Our transactions with these companies are governed by a number of service and other contracts, the terms of which were negotiated on an arms length basis. Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if Sinopec Corp refuses to engage in such transactions or if it seeks to amend our contracts with it in a way adverse to us. In addition, Sinopec Corp has interests in businesses which compete or are likely to compete, either directly or indirectly, with our businesses. Because Sinopec Corp is our controlling shareholder and its interests may conflict with our own interests, Sinopec Corp may take actions that favor itself over our interests. We are controlled by Sinopec Corp, whose interests may not be aligned with yours. As of May 31, 2006, Sinopec Corp owned 55.56% of our shares. Accordingly, it has voting and management control over us, and its interests may be different from your interests and the interests of our other shareholders. Subject to our Articles of Association and applicable laws and regulations, Sinopec Corp will be in a position to cause us to declare dividends, determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval or effect corporate transactions without the approval of the holders of the H shares and ADSs. Any such increase in our dividend payout would reduce funds available for reinvestment in our business and any such actions or transactions could adversely affect us or our minority shareholders. Additionally, Sinopec Corp completed its initial public offering of shares in late 2000. As a public company, Sinopec Corp may experience changes in its own business strategy and policies. Although we are not currently aware of any such changes, they could, in turn, lead Sinopec Corp to change its policies or practices toward us in ways that we cannot predict, with corresponding unpredictable consequences for our business. Our business operations may be adversely affected by present or future environmental regulations. We are subject to extensive environmental protection laws and regulations in China. These laws and regulations permit:  the imposition of fees for the discharge of waste substances;  the levy of fines and payments for damages for serious environmental offenses; and  the central government, at its discretion, to close any facility which fails to comply with orders and require it to correct or stop operations causing environmental damage. Our production operations produce substantial amounts of waste materials. In addition, our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal, modification and revocation. We believe that our operations substantially comply with all applicable Chinese environmental laws and regulations as they have been previously interpreted and enforced. The Chinese government, however, has moved, and may move further, toward more rigorous enforcement of applicable laws, and toward the adoption of more stringent environmental standards. There can be no assurance that Chinese national or local authorities will not impose additional regulations or apply more rigorous enforcement of such regulations which would require additional expenditures on environmental matters. 6 Table of Contents Our business may be limited or adversely affected by government regulations. The central and local Chinese governments continue to exercise a certain degree of control over the petrochemical industry in China by, among other things:  mandating distribution channels for our petroleum products;  setting the allocations and pricing of certain resources and services;  assessing taxes and fees payable;  setting import and export quotas and procedures; and  setting safety, environmental and quality standards. As a result, we may face significant constraints on our flexibility and ability to expand our business operations or to maximize our profitability. In the past, we have benefited from favorable regulatory policies that have, for example, reduced the competition we face from illegal imports of petroleum products. Existing policies that favor our industry may change in the future and our business could be adversely affected by any such changes. Our development plans require regulatory approval. We are currently engaged in a number of construction and expansion projects. Most of our projects are subject to governmental review and approval. The timing and cost of completion of these projects will depend on numerous factors, including approvals from relevant government authorities and general economic conditions in China. While in general we attempt to obtain governmental approval as far in advance as practicable, we may not be able to control the timing and outcome of these governmental reviews and approvals. If any of our important projects required for our future growth are not approved, or not approved on a timely basis, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization, or WTO, may significantly increase foreign competition in our lines of business. China joined the WTO on December 11, 2001. As part of its membership, China has committed to eliminate some tariff and non-tariff barriers to foreign competition in the domestic petrochemical industry that benefited us in the past. In particular, China:  has reduced tariffs on imported petrochemicals products that compete with ours to 2.8% to 12.9% from 5% to 17%;  increased levels of permitted foreign investment in the domestic petrochemicals industry, allowing foreign investors to own 100% of a domestic petrochemicals company from December 11, 2004;  is expected to gradually relax restrictions on the import of crude oil by non-state owned companies;  is expected to grant foreign-owned companies the right to import petrochemical products; and  is expected to permit foreign companies to distribute and market petroleum products in both retail and wholesale markets in China. 7 Table of Contents As a result of these measures, we face increased competition from foreign companies and imports. Overall, we think that Chinas WTO entry also creates substantial amounts of new investment and business in China, with a potential increase in sales opportunities for us. We do, however, believe that our products have been and will continue generally to be competitive with imported products in the PRC. Tariff reductions, however, could reduce our profit margins or otherwise negatively impact our revenue from certain products, including a small number of significant products. The PRC government may also reduce the tariffs imposed on production equipment that we may import in the future, as well as the restrictions on availability of imported raw materials (such as crude oil) currently enforced by the PRC. Although we believe that Chinas accession to the WTO may provide us with opportunities to increase our sales, we cannot be certain of its effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we believe that major international petrochemical companies are preparing to enter the Chinese market amid industry restructuring on a global basis. Apart from posing direct competition against us in petroleum and petrochemical products, these international companies are characterized by large-scale investments across different sectors, full vertical integration and streamlined organization. We expect that domestic companies will face intense competition from their international counterparts as the China market becomes increasingly internationalized. Political and economic policies in China could affect our business in unpredictable ways. The economy of China differs from the economies of most countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development in a number of respects, including:  structure;  level of government involvement;  level of development;  level of capital reinvestment;  control of foreign exchange; and  allocation of resources. Before its adoption of reform and open-door policies beginning in 1978, China was primarily a planned economy. Since that time, the Chinese government has been reforming the Chinese economic system, and has also begun reforming the government structure. These reforms have resulted in significant economic growth and social progress. Although the Chinese government still owns a significant portion of the productive assets in China, economic reform policies since the late 1980s have emphasized autonomous enterprises and the utilization of market mechanisms. We currently expect that the Chinese government will continue these reforms, further reduce government intervention and rely more heavily on market mechanisms to allocate resources. Although we believe these reforms will have a positive effect on our overall long-term development, we cannot predict whether changes to Chinas political, economic and social conditions, laws, regulations and policies will have any adverse effect on our current or future business or results of operations. 8 Table of Contents If the Chinese government changes current regulations that allow us to make payments in foreign currencies, we may be unable to obtain the foreign currency which is necessary for our business. The Renminbi currently is not a freely convertible currency. We receive most of our revenue in Renminbi. A portion of our Renminbi revenue must be converted into other currencies to meet our foreign currency obligations. We have substantial requirements for foreign currency, including:  debt service costs on foreign currency-denominated debt;  purchases of imported equipment;  payment of any cash dividends declared in respect of the H shares; and  import of crude oil and other materials. Under existing foreign exchange regulations in China, we may undertake current account foreign exchange transactions, including the payment of dividends, without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange by producing commercial documents evidencing the foreign exchange transactions, provided that they are processed through Chinese banks licensed to engage in foreign exchange transactions. The Chinese government has stated publicly that it intends to eventually make the Renminbi freely convertible in the future. However, uncertainty exists as to whether the Chinese government may restrict access to foreign currency for current account transactions if foreign currency becomes scarce in China. Foreign exchange transactions under the capital account (international revenues and expenditures that increase or decrease debt or equity, including principal payments in respect of foreign currency-denominated obligations) continue to be subject to limitations and require the prior approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. These limitations could affect our ability to obtain foreign exchange through debt financing, or to make capital expenditures in foreign currency. If the Chinese government restricts our ability to make payments in foreign currency, we may be unable to obtain the foreign currency which is necessary for our business. In that case, our business may be materially adversely affected, and we may default on our obligations. Changes in the PRC governments currency policy and fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi may adversely affect our business and operating results. Substantially all of our revenues are denominated in Renminbi, while most of our crude oil purchases and equipment purchases and some of our debt repayments are denominated in US dollars and, to a lesser extent, other foreign currencies. The value of the Renminbi against the US dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in Chinas political and economic conditions. Historically, the Peoples Bank of China has set the conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies, including US dollars. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government significantly changed its policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi to the US dollar by permitting the Renminbi to fluctuate within a narrow band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. Since the adoption of this new policy, the value of Renminbi against the US dollar has fluctuated daily within a narrow band, but overall has appreciated against the US dollar. In addition, the PRC government to continues to receive significant international pressure to further liberalize its currency policy and as a result may further change its currency policy. As we import a significant portion of our crude oil requirement from the international market, increases in the value of the Renminbi against the US dollar and other foreign currencies may increase our crude oil costs. Such fluctuation may also have a material effect on our revenues and financial condition, and the value of, and any dividends payable on, our ADSs in foreign currency terms. 9 Table of Contents Interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations is uncertain. The Chinese legal system is based on statutory law. Under this system, prior court decisions may be cited as persuasive authority, but do not have the binding effect of precedents. Since 1979, the Chinese government has been developing a comprehensive system of commercial laws and considerable progress has been made in the promulgation of laws and regulations dealing with economic matters, such as corporate organization and governance, foreign investment, commerce, taxation and trade. Because these laws, regulations and legal requirements are relatively new and not all accessible to the public and because prior court decisions have little precedential value, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws, regulations and legal requirements involve greater uncertainty than in other jurisdictions. You may not enjoy shareholders protections that you would be entitled to in other jurisdictions. As most of our business is conducted in China, our operations are governed principally by the laws of China. Chinese legal provisions for the protection of shareholders rights and access to information are different and less developed than those applicable to companies formed in the United States, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom and other developed countries or regions. You may not enjoy shareholders protections under Chinese law that you would be entitled to in other jurisdictions. Our Articles of Association require you to submit your disputes with us and other persons to arbitration. You will have no legal right to a court proceeding. Our Articles of Association require holders of our H shares or ADSs having a claim against, or a dispute with, us, our directors, supervisors, executive officers or a holder of our domestic shares relating to any rights or obligations conferred or imposed by our Articles of Association, the Chinese Company Law or any other Chinese laws or regulations relating to our affairs, to submit such claim or dispute to arbitration with the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission or to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center. Our Articles of Association further provide that any arbitration decisions with respect to such disputes or claims shall be final and binding on all parties.
