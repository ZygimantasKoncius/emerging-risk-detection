Risk Factors Risks Related to our Business The financial performance of our Arden B division has been poor for several quarters and our ability to improve the financial performance of this division may not be successful. We have experienced deterioration in the financial performance of our Arden B division over the past five fiscal quarters. The success of our Arden B division is largely dependent upon our ability to offer fashion to our target customers that satisfies current fashion tastes at appropriate price points. With the deterioration of our comparable store sales over the past several quarters we recognize that we have not met this challenge. We have recently engaged Sharon Hughes as a consultant to serve as the chief merchandise officer for our Arden B division and to focus on providing fashion appropriate merchandise to Arden Bs target customer in an attractive shopping environment. However, to the extent that there are design and/or merchandising misjudgments or a lack 10 Table of Contents of customer traffic in Arden B stores, the financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows for our Arden B division will not improve and/or could further worsen. Our Board of Directors and senior management team are continually reviewing the financial performance and the turnaround efforts involving our Arden B division. In the future, we could decide to close stores that are producing continuing financial losses or cease operations. If we do so, we would be required to write down the carrying value of these impaired assets to realizable value, a non-cash event that would negatively impact our earnings and earnings per share. If we decide to close any stores before the expiration of the lease term, we may incur payments to landlords to terminate or buy out the remaining term of the lease. We also may incur employee termination and inventory liquidation costs at such stores. These costs would negatively impact our financial results and cash position. In the last two fiscal years, we have grown our business through opening new stores. However, in the near term we will not increase our store count and this decision may have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. In 2006, we announced our desire to grow the number of stores in our chain significantly. We noted that there was a potential to have 600 to 700 Wet Seal stores and 200 to 250 Arden B stores. Due to difficult economic conditions generally, a need to rebuild our pipeline of potential real estate opportunities, and the weak performance of our Arden B division, we do not anticipate opening any new Arden B stores in fiscal 2008 and expect to open only a few new Wet Seal stores, net of closures during the same period. We have redirected our focus to improving the financial performance of our existing stores and finding the correct mix of merchandise for our customers. To the extent we are unable to improve the sales and profitability and reduce the selling expenses of our existing stores, our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows may suffer. Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation. In general, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, or Section 382, contains provisions that may limit the availability of federal net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, to be used to offset taxable income in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events, including significant changes in ownership interests. Under Section 382, potential limitations on NOLs are triggered when there has been an ownership change (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in our stock ownership over a three-year period). Our ownership changes on April 1, 2005 and December 28, 2006 resulted in Section 382 limitations applying to NOLs generated prior to those dates, which were approximately $172.1 million. As a result of these ownership changes, of our $138.2 million NOLs as of February 2, 2008, we may utilize up to $66.6 million of our NOLs to offset taxable income in fiscal 2008. Future transactions involving the sale or other transfer of our stock and any changes in the value of our stock may result in additional ownership changes for purposes of Section 382. The occurrence of such additional ownership changes could limit our ability to utilize our remaining NOLs and possibly other tax attributes. Limitations imposed on our ability to use NOLs and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income could cause us to pay U.S. federal income taxes earlier than we otherwise would if such limitations were not in effect. Any further ownership change could cause such NOLs and other tax attributes to expire unused, thereby reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs and other tax attributes to us and adversely affecting our future cash flow. In recent months we have had significant changes in our senior management and these changes may impact our ability to execute our business strategy in the near term. In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we appointed Edmond S. Thomas as our new president and chief executive officer and promoted Steven H. Benrubi, our former corporate controller, to be our new chief financial 11 Table of Contents officer. In addition to these changes, in February 2008, our chief operating officer and our president of Arden B merchandise resigned. Mr. Thomas, Mr. Benrubi and others within management will assume the duties of our former chief operating officer, while Sharon Hughes will serve as chief merchandise officer for Arden B under the direct supervision of Mr. Thomas. Although Mr. Thomas previously served as our president and chief operating officer, Mr. Benrubi previously served as our vice president and corporate controller and Ms. Hughes previously was an employee of our company for over a decade, we anticipate that we will experience a transition period before these individuals are fully integrated in their new roles, which could impact our ability to address the business challenges that confront our company. We may not be successful in achieving improvements in the business and operations of our company that have been identified by our new president and chief executive officer. Since his appointment, Mr. Thomas has identified several areas in which our companys business and operations can be improved. Mr. Thomas has focused on increasing comparable store sales for our retail divisions, improving our companys gross margin, enhancing in-store productivity, reviving the Arden B business and expanding our online business. Although Mr. Thomas is highly qualified and has extensive experience in the retail industry, including with our company, we may not be able to implement our strategy in the desired time frame and/or achieve the intended results and level of improvement desired by our senior management team and Board of Directors. If we are unable to anticipate and react to new fashion trends, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We rely on a limited demographic customer base for a large percentage of our sales. Our brand image is dependent upon our ability to anticipate, identify and provide fresh inventory reflecting current fashion trends. If we fail to anticipate, identify or react appropriately or in a timely manner to these fashion trends, we could experience reduced consumer acceptance of our products, a diminished brand image and higher markdowns. These factors could result in lower selling prices and sales volumes for our products, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our companys ability to attract customers to its stores depends heavily on the success of the shopping centers in which many of our stores are located. Substantially all of our stores are located in shopping centers. Factors beyond our control impact shopping center traffic, such as general economic conditions and consumer spending levels. Accordingly the slowdown in the U.S. economy may negatively affect consumer spending and reduce shopping center traffic. Moreover, the inability of mall anchor tenants and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic around our stores, or the decline in the popularity of malls as shopping destinations, would reduce our sales volume and, consequently, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. We depend upon a single center for our corporate offices and distribution activities, and any significant disruption in the operation of this center could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. Our corporate offices and the distribution functions for all of our stores and internet business are handled from a single, leased facility in Foothill Ranch, California. In general, this area of California is subject to earthquakes and wildfires. Any significant interruption in the operation of this facility due to a natural disaster, arson, accident, system failure or other unforeseen event could delay or impair our ability to distribute merchandise to our stores and, consequently, lead to a decrease in sales. The financial losses incurred may exceed our insurance for earthquake damages and business interruption costs related to any such disruption. As a 12 Table of Contents result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be adversely affected. Furthermore, we have little experience operating essential functions away from our main corporate offices and are uncertain what effect operating satellite facilities might have on our business, personnel and results of operations. Fluctuations in our results of operations for the third fiscal quarter and the fourth fiscal quarter have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. We experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues and operating income, with a disproportionate amount of our revenues and a majority of our income being generated in the third fiscal quarter back to school season, which begins the last week of July and ends during September, and the fourth fiscal quarter holiday season. Our revenues and income are generally lower during the first and second fiscal quarters. In addition, any factors that harm our third and fourth fiscal quarter operating results, including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions, could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year. In order to prepare for our peak shopping seasons, we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we would carry at other times of the year. An unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during our peak shopping seasons could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown, which could reduce our net sales and gross profit. Alternatively, an unanticipated increase in demand for certain of our products could leave us unable to fulfill customer demand and result in lost sales and customer dissatisfaction. Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including the merchandise mix and the timing and level of inventory markdowns. As a result, historical period-to-period comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily indicative of future period-to-period results. You should not rely on the results of a single fiscal quarter, particularly the third fiscal quarter back to school season or fourth fiscal quarter holiday season, as an indication of our annual results or our future performance. Our failure to effectively compete with other retailers for sales and locations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. The womens retail apparel industry is highly competitive, with fashion, quality, price, location and service being the principal competitive factors. Our Wet Seal and Arden B stores compete with specialty apparel retailers, department stores and certain other apparel retailers, including Aeropostale, Anthropologie, Abercrombie & Fitch, Charlotte Russe, Gap, Banana Republic, H&M, Old Navy, Pacific Sunwear, American Eagle, Target, Urban Outfitters, Forever 21, Express, J.C. Penney, bebe, Zara, Guess? and BCBG. Many of our competitors are large national chains that have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. We face a variety of competitive challenges, including:  anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands;  maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to consumers in narrowly-defined market segments;  developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors and styles that appeal to consumers in our target markets and maintaining a sufficient quantity of these items for which there is the greatest demand;  obtaining favorable site locations within malls on reasonable terms;  sourcing merchandise efficiently; and  pricing our products competitively and achieving customer perception of value. 13 Table of Contents Our industry has low barriers to entry that allow the introduction of new products or new competitors at a fast pace. Any of these factors could result in reductions in sales or the prices of our products which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. Further, competition for prime locations and lease terms within shopping malls, in particular, is intense, and we may not be able to obtain new locations or maintain our existing locations on terms favorable to us. The upcoming expiration of leases for approximately 80 of our existing stores could lead to increased costs associated with renegotiating our leases and/or relocating our stores. We have approximately 80 existing store leases scheduled to expire in fiscal 2008. In connection with the expiration of these leases, we will have to renegotiate new leases which could result in higher rental amounts for each store and landlord requirements to remodel existing locations as a condition for renewal. Although we expect to negotiate new leases with acceptable terms that will allow us to remain in a substantial majority of these locations, we may not be able to obtain new terms that are favorable to us. In addition, as a result of renewal negotiations, we may be required by the landlord to remodel, which could result in significant capital expenditures. In addition, some landlords may refuse to renew our leases due to our lower sales per square foot as compared with other prospective tenants. If we are unable to agree to new terms with our landlords, we will have to relocate these stores, which could result in a significant expenditure and could lead to an interruption in the operation of our business at the affected stores, and we could be required to relocate to less desirable locations. Because of the importance of our brand names, we may lose market share to our competitors if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights. We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position. We have registered trademarks for Wet Seal and Arden B (which are registered in the retail store services and other classes). We take actions to establish and protect our intellectual property. However, others may infringe on our intellectual property rights or seek to block the sale of our products as violative of their intellectual property rights. If we are required to stop using any of our registered or non-registered trademarks, our sales could decline and, consequently, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Covenants contained in agreements governing our existing indebtedness restrict the manner in which we conduct our business, and our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, growth prospects and ability to procure merchandise for our stores. Our senior revolving credit facility and the indenture, as amended, governing our secured convertible notes contain covenants that restrict the manner in which we conduct our business. Subject to certain exceptions (including an exception to permit limited stock repurchases), these covenants restrict our ability to, among other things:  incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness;  make investments or acquisitions;  merge, consolidate, dissolve or liquidate;  engage in certain asset sales (including the sale of stock);  repurchase stock;  grant liens on assets;  pay dividends; and  close stores. 14 Table of Contents A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the agreements governing our existing indebtedness, acceleration of any amounts then outstanding, the foreclosure upon collateral securing the debt obligations, or the unavailability of the lines of credit. We do not authenticate the license rights of our suppliers. We purchase merchandise from a number of vendors who purport to hold manufacturing and distribution rights under the terms of license agreements or that assert their products are not subject to any restrictions as to distribution. We generally rely upon each vendors representation concerning those manufacturing and distribution rights and do not independently verify whether each vendor legally holds adequate rights to the licensed properties they are manufacturing or distributing. If we acquire unlicensed merchandise or merchandise violating a registered trademark, we could be obligated to remove it from our stores, incur costs associated with destruction of the merchandise if the vendor is unwilling or unable to reimburse us and be subject to civil and criminal liability. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. We are subject to risks associated with our procurement of products from non-U.S. based vendors and U.S. vendors that purchase products internationally, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. A portion of our products is manufactured outside the United States. As a result, we are susceptible to greater losses as a result of a number of risks inherent in doing business in international markets and from a number of factors beyond our control, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. These factors include:  import or trade restrictions (including increased tariffs, customs duties, taxes or quotas) imposed by the United States government in respect of the foreign countries in which our products are currently manufactured or any of the countries in which our products may be manufactured in the future;  political instability or acts of terrorism, significant fluctuations in the value of the United States dollar against foreign currencies, restrictions on the transfer of funds between the United States and foreign jurisdictions, and/or potential disruption of imports due to labor disputes at U.S. ports, any of which could adversely affect our merchandise flow and, consequently, cause our sales to decline; and  local business practices that do not conform to our legal or ethical guidelines. Our imports are limited by textile agreements between the United States and a number of foreign jurisdictions, including Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and South Korea. These agreements impose quotas on the amounts and types of merchandise that may be imported into the United States from these countries. These agreements also allow the United States to limit the importation of categories of merchandise that are not now subject to specified limits. The United States and the countries in which our products are produced or sold may also, from time to time, impose new quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions, or adversely adjust prevailing quota, duty or tariff levels. In addition, none of our international suppliers or international manufacturers supplies or manufactures our products exclusively. As a result, we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers and import quota capacity. If we were unable to obtain our raw materials and finished apparel from the countries where we wish to purchase them, either because room under the necessary quotas was unavailable or for any other reason, or if the cost of doing so should increase, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. Violation of labor laws and practices by our suppliers could harm our business and results of operations. Our companys policy is to use only those sourcing agents and independent manufacturers who operate in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The violation of laws, particularly labor laws, by an 15 Table of Contents independent manufacturer, or by one of the sourcing agents, or the divergence of an independent manufacturers or sourcing agents labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States or in the country in which the manufacturing facility is located, and the public revelation of those illegal or unethical practices, could cause significant damage to our companys reputation. Although our manufacturer operating guidelines promote ethical business practices, we do not control the business and operations of the manufacturers and cannot guarantee their legal and regulatory compliance. We are exposed to business risks as a result of our internet operations. We operate online stores at www.wetseal.com and www.ardenb.com. Our internet operations are subject to numerous risks, including:  online security breaches and/or credit card fraud;  reliance on third-party software providers; and  diversion of sales from our retail stores. In addition, increased internet sales by our competitors could result in increased price competition and decreased margins. Our inability to effectively address these risks and any other risks that we face in connection with our internet operations could adversely affect the profitability of our internet operations. Three lawsuits have been filed against us alleging violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. In fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008, we were served with a total of three class action complaints alleging violations of The Fair Credit Reporting Act (one of the complaints was dismissed in August 2007). The Act provides in part that portions of the credit card number may not be printed together with expiration dates on credit or debit card receipts given to customers. The Act currently imposes significant penalties upon violators of these rules and regulations where the violation is deemed to have been willful. Otherwise damages are limited to actual losses incurred by the card holder. We do not believe that we have any liability for the violations alleged in the complaints and will vigorously contest these allegations. Moreover, there is pending legislation in Congress that would modify the definition of a willful violation in a manner favorable to our company. However, in the event we are found to have liability under the Act for these allegations, significant damages could be assessed against our company, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as well as consumer perception of our company. Our retail store operations are affected by local, regional and national economic conditions. Our business is sensitive to consumer spending patterns and preferences. Various economic conditions affect the level of spending on the merchandise we offer, including general business conditions, interest rates, taxation, the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. Our sales and profitability may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions on a local, regional or national level. Risks Related to our Common Stock Our stockholders may experience dilution due to conversions and exercises of outstanding convertible securities and/or the anti-dilution protection of the securities. Since May 2004, we have completed private placements of Class A common stock and warrants, convertible notes and shares of preferred stock that are convertible into or exercisable for shares of Class A common stock. Through February 2, 2008, we have issued 57,319,486 shares of our Class A common stock as a result of these private placements and exercises and conversions of these securities. An additional 18,749,624 shares of Class A common stock may be issued under the convertible notes, preferred stock and warrants that remain outstanding, 16 Table of Contents and this number of shares of Class A common stock is subject to anti-dilution adjustments based upon the anti-dilution provisions contained in these instruments. The issuance of the additional shares of Class A common stock upon conversion and exercise could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline. The price of our Class A Common Stock has fluctuated significantly during the past few years and may fluctuate significantly in the future. Our Class A common stock, which is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market, has experienced and may continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. The market price of our Class A common stock is likely to fluctuate, both because of actual and perceived changes in our operating results and prospects and because of general volatility in the stock market. The market price of our Class A common stock could continue to fluctuate widely in response to factors such as:  actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations, including comparable store sales;  the addition or loss of suppliers, customers and other business relationships;  changes in financial estimates of, and recommendations by, securities analysts;  conditions or trends in the apparel and consumer products industries;  additions or departures of key personnel;  sales of our Class A common stock;  general market and economic conditions; and  other events or factors, including the realization of any of the risks described in this risk factors section, many of which are beyond our control. Fluctuations in the price and trading volume of our Class A common stock in response to factors such as those set forth above could be unrelated or disproportionate to our actual operating performance. We have never paid dividends on our Class A common stock and do not plan to do so in the future. Holders of shares of our Class A common stock are entitled to receive any dividends that may be declared by our Board of Directors. However, we have not paid any cash dividends on our Class A common stock and we do not expect to for the foreseeable future. Also, our agreements with our senior lenders and the indenture governing our notes restrict the payment of dividends to our stockholders. Our charter provisions and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects. Our certificate of incorporation permits our Board of Directors to designate and issue, without stockholder approval, up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock with voting, conversion and other rights and preferences that could differentially and adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our Class A common stock, which could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal. Furthermore, certain provisions of Delaware law applicable to our company could also delay or make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years unless certain conditions are met. The possible issuance of preferred stock and the application of anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law could each have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company, including, without limitation, discouraging a proxy contest, making the acquisition of a substantial block of Class A common stock more difficult and limiting the price that investors might in the future be willing to pay for shares of our Class A common stock. 17 Table of Contents Item 1B.
