ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS YOU SHOULD READ THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS TOGETHER WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT. SOME OF THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR SET FORTH ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, INCLUDING INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO OUR PLANS AND STRATEGIES FOR OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDES FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. YOU SHOULD REVIEW THE "RISK FACTORS" SECTION OF THIS REPORT FOR A DISCUSSION OF IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS DESCRIBED IN OR IMPLIED BY THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS ACTUALLY OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD SUFFER. OUR INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT EXPRESSES DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. Our independent auditors' report, dated April 10, 2009, includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern, due to our working capital deficit at December 31, 2008. We have experienced operating losses since the date of the auditors' report. Our auditor's opinion may impede our ability to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all, we will not be able to accomplish any or all of our initiatives and will be forced to consider steps that would protect our assets against our creditors. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, your entire investment in us could be lost. WE ARE IN DEFAULT OF A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR DEBT AND DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE CASH TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS. OUR FAILURE TIMELY TO PAY OUR INDEBTEDNESS MAY REQUIRE US TO CONSIDER STEPS THAT WOULD PROTECT OUR ASSETS AGAINST OUR CREDITORS. If we cannot raise additional capital, we will not be able to repay our debt or pursue our business strategies as scheduled, or at all, and we may cease operations. We have been unable to pay all of our creditors and certain other obligations in accordance with their terms, and as a result, at December 31, 2008 we are in default on a portion of our debt totaling approximately $331,000 excluding accumulated interest of approximately $463,000. In the aggregate, as of December 31, 2008, we have approximately $2.3 million in debt obligations, including interest, owing within the next 12 months. We cannot assure you that any of these note-holders will agree to extend payment of these debt obligations or ultimately agree to revise the terms of this debt to allow us to make scheduled payments over an extended period of time. 9 We have nominal cash on hand and short-term investments and we do not expect to generate material cash from operations within the next 12 months. We have attempted to raise additional capital through debt or equity financings and to date have had limited success. The downtrend in the financial markets has made it extremely difficult for us to raise additional capital. In addition, our common stock trades on The Over the Counter Bulletin Board which makes it more difficult to raise capital than if we were trading on The NASDAQ Stock Market. Also, our default in repaying our debt restricts our ability to file registration statements, including those relating to capital-raising transactions, on Form S-3, which may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. In July 2004, we completed a private placement resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $2.5 million, all of which have been used. As a condition to this financing however, we agreed that we would not use the net proceeds to repay any of our debt outstanding as of the closing of the financing. If we are unable to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all, we will not be able to accomplish any or all of our initiatives and will be forced to consider steps that would protect our assets against our creditors. WE HAVE A HISTORY OF LOSSES AND WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL BE PROFITABLE IN FISCAL 2009. We do not anticipate generating significant sales of the BSM-2000 until after we complete all testing and modifications, which is contingent principally upon receipt of adequate funding and our ability to continue to form collaborative arrangements with qualified third parties to engage in that testing at nominal cost to us. We have not been profitable in the past years and had an accumulated deficit of approximately $38.6 million at December 31, 2008. We have had little revenues from sales of our products since the beginning of fiscal 2002, the commencement of development of our BSM-2000. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had losses of $2.3 and $3.6 million, respectively. Achieving profitability depends upon numerous factors, including our ability to develop, market and sell commercially accepted products timely and cost-efficiently. We do not anticipate that we will be profitable in fiscal 2009. IF WE OBTAIN FINANCING, EXISTING SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS MAY BE DILUTED. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our shareholders will be diluted. In addition, any convertible securities issued may not contain a minimum conversion price, which may make it more difficult for us to raise financing and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline because of the indeterminable overhang that is created by the discount to market conversion feature. In addition, any new securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available when and to the extent we require or that, if available, it will be on acceptable terms. IF WE CANNOT PARTNER WITH THIRD PARTIES TO ENGAGE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF OUR DEVICE AT MINIMAL COST TO US, OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT WILL BE DELAYED. We contract with third parties at minimal cost to us to conduct research and development activities and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Under our agreement with JPL, it will engage in limited testing of our device. Because we are unable to pay third parties to test our product and instead must rely on a qualified third party's willingness to partner with us to test our product, our research and development activities and the testing of our product may be delayed. In addition, since we contract with third parties for these services, we have less direct control over those activities and cannot assure you that the research or testing will be done properly or in a timely manner. MANAGEMENT HAS NO EXPERIENCE IN PRODUCT MANUFACTURING, MARKETING, SALES, OR DISTRIBUTION. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MANUFACTURE OUR BACTERIAL SPORE DETECTOR IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES AT AN ACCEPTABLE COST, OR IN A TIMELY FASHION, AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MARKET AND DISTRIBUTE IT EFFECTIVELY, EACH OF WHICH COULD HARM OUR FUTURE PROSPECTS. If we are unable to establish an efficient manufacturing process for the BSM-2000, our costs of production will increase, our projected margins may decrease, and we may not be able to timely deliver our product to customers. When and if we complete all design and testing of our product, we will need to establish the capability to manufacture it. Management has no experience in establishing, supervising, or conducting commercial manufacturing. We plan to rely on third party contractors to manufacture our product, although to date we have not entered into any manufacturing arrangements with any third party. Relying on third parties may expose us to the risk of not being able to directly oversee the manufacturing process, which may adversely affect the production and quality of our BSM-2000. In addition, these third party contractors may experience regulatory compliance difficulty, mechanical shutdowns, employee strikes, or other unforeseeable acts that may increase the cost of production or delay or prevent production. 10 In addition, if we are unable to establish a successful sales, marketing, and distribution operation, we will not be able to generate sufficient revenue in order to maintain operations. We have no experience in marketing or distributing new products. We have not yet established marketing, sales, or distribution capabilities for our BSM-2000. We plan on entering into distribution agreements with third parties to sell our BSM-2000. If we are unable to enter into relationships with third parties to market, sell, and distribute our products, we will need to develop our own capabilities. We have no experience in developing, training, or managing a sales force. If we choose to establish a direct sales force, we will incur substantial additional expense. We may not be able to build a sales force on a cost effective basis or at all. Any direct marketing and sales efforts may prove to be unsuccessful. In addition, our marketing and sales efforts may be unable to compete with the extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations of some of our competitors. We also may be unable to engage qualified distributors. Even if engaged, they may fail to satisfy financial or contractual obligations to us, or adequately market our products. WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT OUR BIOTERRORISM DETECTION DEVICE WILL WORK OR BE COMMERCIALLY VIABLE. Our product in development requires testing, third party verification, potentially additional modifications and demonstration of commercial scale manufacturing before it can be proven to be commercially viable. Potential products that appear to be promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons. These reasons include the possibilities that the product may be ineffective, unsafe, difficult or uneconomical to manufacture on a large scale, or precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty when, or if, the testing, modification and validation process will be completed. If our product development efforts are unsuccessful or if we are unable to develop a commercially viable product timely, we would need to consider steps to protect our assets against our creditors. OUR PRODUCTS MAY NOT BE COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTED WHICH WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY. Our ability to enter into the bioterrorism detection device market, establish brand recognition and compete effectively depends upon many factors, including broad commercial acceptance of our products. If our products are not commercially accepted, we will not recognize meaningful revenue and may not continue to operate. The success of our products will depend in large part on the breadth of information these products capture and the timeliness of delivery of that information. The commercial success of our products also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing products, general economic and political conditions and other factors, all of which can change and cannot be predicted with certainty. We cannot assure you that our new products will achieve market acceptance or will generate significant revenue. EXISTING AND DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR ONLY PRODUCT, THE BSM-2000. Our industry is subject to rapid and substantial technological change. Developments by others may render our technology and planned product noncompetitive or obsolete, or we may be unable to keep pace with technological developments or other market factors. Competition from other biotechnology companies, universities, governmental research organizations and others diversifying into our field is intense and is expected to increase. According to the public filings of Cepheid, one of our competitors, it has begun shipping its detection technology product, including for use by the U.S. Postal Service. Cepheid's entry into the market before us may make it more difficult for us to penetrate the market. In addition, our competitors offer technologies different than ours which potential customers may find more suitable to their needs. For example, Cepheid's technology specifically detects for Anthrax whereas our technology detects for an increase in the level of bacterial spores. Many of our competitors also have significantly greater research and development capabilities than we do, as well as substantially greater marketing, manufacturing, financial and managerial resources. SHARES ISSUED UPON THE EXERCISE OF OUR OUTSTANDING OPTIONS AND WARRANTS MAY DILUTE YOUR STOCK HOLDINGS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE. If exercised, our outstanding options and warrants will cause immediate and substantial dilution to our stockholders. We have issued options and warrants to acquire our common stock to our employees, consultants, and investors at various prices, some of which are or may in the future be below the market price of our stock. As of December 31, 2008, we had outstanding options and warrants to purchase a total of 592,750 shares of common stock. Of these options and warrants, all have exercise prices at or above the recent market price of $0.003 per share (as of March 31, 2009) and none have exercise prices at or below this price. 11 WE USE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR CASH ON HAND AND STOCK TO PAY CONSULTING FEES. WE MAY NOT RECEIVE THE BENEFIT WE EXPECT FROM THESE CONSULTANTS. The consultants that we hire may not provide us with the level of services, and consequently, the operating results, we anticipate. We spent approximately $0.3 and $0.7 million in consulting fees during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 respectively, and utilized approximately 10 consultants during this period. The consultants we engage provide us with a variety of services. THE LOSS OF OUR PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER WOULD DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS. Our success depends in substantial part upon the services of Jacques Tizabi, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors. The loss of or the failure to retain the services of Mr. Tizabi would adversely affect the development of our business and our ability to realize profitable operations. We do not maintain key-man life insurance on Mr. Tizabi and have no present plans to obtain this insurance. IF INTERNATIONAL PATENTS FOR THE BACTERIAL SPORE DETECTION TECHNOLOGY ARE NOT ISSUED, COMPETITORS MAY BE ABLE TO COPY AND SELL PRODUCTS SIMILAR TO OURS WITHOUT PAYING A ROYALTY, WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE. If BSM-2000 is commercialized, the lack of foreign patent protection could allow competitors to copy and sell products similar to ours without paying a royalty. Caltech owns the bacterial spore detection technology that is integrated into BSM-2000. On January 31, 2003, Caltech filed a U.S. patent application covering the technology, which was granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in December 2007. Caltech also filed a patent application with the European Patent Office. We paid and filed on behalf of Caltech a patent application in Japan as well. No international patents have been issued and we cannot assure you that any international patents will be issued. WE MAY BE SUED BY THIRD PARTIES WHO CLAIM OUR PRODUCT INFRINGES ON THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. DEFENDING AN INFRINGEMENT LAWSUIT IS COSTLY AND WE MAY NOT HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO DEFEND OURSELVES. We may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our technology, product, or activity infringes on the intellectual property rights of others or that we have misappropriated the trade secrets of others. This risk is compounded by the fact that the validity and breadth of claims covered in technology patents in general and the breadth and scope of trade secret protection involves complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are unresolved. Any litigation or claims against us, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs, could place a significant strain on our financial and managerial resources, and could harm our reputation. Our license agreement with Caltech requires that we pay the costs associated with initiating an infringement claim and defending claims by third parties for infringement, subject to certain offsets that may be allowed against amounts we may owe to Caltech under the licensing agreement. In addition, intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following: o cease selling, incorporating, or using any of our technology and/or products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, which could adversely affect our potential revenue; o obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may be costly or may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; or o redesign our products, which would be costly and time consuming. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS RIGHTS TO THE TECHNOLOGY WE LICENSE FROM CALTECH. Under the license rights provided to the U.S. government in our license agreement with Caltech, a U.S. government agency or the U.S. armed forces may, either produce the proprietary products or use the proprietary processes or contract with third parties to provide the proprietary products, processes, and services to one or more Federal agencies or the armed forces of the U.S. government, for use in activities carried out by the U.S. government, its agencies, and the armed forces, including, for instance, the war on terrorism or the national defense. Further, the Federal agency that provided funding to Caltech for the research that produced the inventions covered by the patent rights referenced in the Technology Affiliates Agreement and the related technology may require us to grant, or if we refuse, itself may grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license to these intellectual property rights to a third party if the agency determines that action is necessary: 12 o because we have not taken, or are not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the invention in the detection of pathogens, spores, and biological warfare agents; o to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by us or our sublicensees; o to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations and those regulations are not reasonably satisfied by us; or o because we have not satisfied, or obtained a waiver of, our obligation to have the licensed products manufactured substantially in the United States. THE BACTERIAL SPORE DETECTION TECHNOLOGY IS LICENSED TO US BY CALTECH. IF OUR LICENSE TERMINATES, OUR FUTURE PROSPECTS WOULD BE HARMED. The loss of our technology license would require us to cease operations until we identify, license and integrate into our product another technology, if available. If we fail to fulfill any payment obligation under the terms of the license agreement or materially breach the agreement, Caltech may terminate the license. To maintain our license with Caltech, a minimum annual royalty of $10,000 was due to Caltech on August 1, 2005, and is due on each anniversary thereof, regardless of any product sales. Any royalties paid from product sales for the 12-month period preceding the date of payment of the minimum annual royalty will be credited against the annual minimum. As of the date of this report, we have not yet paid the minimum annual royalty of $10,000 due on August 1, 2008. Under our license agreement, Caltech has the option to revoke our license if payment has not been made fifteen days after receipt of the second default notice from Caltech. To date, we have not yet received any default notices from Caltech in relation to the August 1, 2008 minimum annual royalty payment. OUR STOCK PRICE IS VOLATILE. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates widely and in the future may be subject to similar fluctuations in response to quarter-to-quarter variations in our operating results, announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors, general conditions in the bioterrorism detection device industry in which we compete and other events or factors. In addition, in recent years, broad stock market indices, in general, and the securities of technology companies, in particular, have experienced substantial price fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations also may adversely affect the future trading price of our common stock. OUR STOCK HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN THINLY TRADED. THEREFORE, SHAREHOLDERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL THEIR SHARES FREELY. The volume of trading in our common stock historically has been low and a limited market presently exists for the shares. We have no analyst coverage of our securities. The lack of analyst reports about our stock may make it difficult for potential investors to make decisions about whether to purchase our stock and may make it less likely that investors will purchase our stock. We cannot assure you that our trading volume will increase, or that our historically light trading volume or any trading volume whatsoever will be sustained in the future. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our shareholders will be able to sell their shares of our common stock at the time or at the price that they desire, or at all. POTENTIAL ANTI-TAKEOVER TACTICS AND RIGHTS AND PREFERENCES GRANTED THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK RIGHTS MAY BE DETRIMENTAL TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS. We are authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The issuance of preferred stock does not require approval by the shareholders of our common stock. Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, has the power to issue preferred stock in one or more series and establish the dividend rates and preferences, liquidation preferences, voting rights, redemption and conversion terms and conditions and any other relative rights and preferences with respect to any series of preferred stock. Holders of preferred stock may have the right to receive dividends, certain preferences in liquidation and conversion and other rights, any of which rights and preferences may operate to the detriment of the shareholders of our common stock. Further, the issuance of any preferred stock having rights superior to those of our common stock may result in a decrease in the market price of the common stock and, additionally, could be used by our Board of Directors as an anti-takeover measure or device to prevent a change in our control. 13 150 shares of our preferred stock have been designated as Series A-1 Preferred Stock (the "Series A-1 Shares") and have been issued to Mr. Jacques Tizabi, our President, Chief Executive Officer, Acting Chief Financial Officer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Series A-1 Shares entitled Mr. Tizabi to 1,000,000 votes per share, which shall vote together with the common stock of the Company for all purposes, except where a separate vote of the classes of capital stock is required by California law. The aggregate value of the 150 shares issued to Mr. Tizabi was $50,000. The shares had a liquidation value, as described in the Company's Articles of Incorporation, of $50,000. Mr. Tizabi was prohibited, by agreement with the Company, from transferring or selling such stock, or any interest in such stock for so long as the shares were outstanding. In the manners discussed above, the rights and preferences of the Series A-1 Shares may have operated to the detriment of our common shareholders. In July 2007, Mr. Tizabi surrendered the 150 shares of the Series A-1 preferred stock of the Company in the amount of $50,000 in return for a promissory note that bears no interest and is due on or before July 1, 2008. The shares were cancelled by the Company. WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO TIMELY COMPLY WITH SECTION 404 OR IF THE COSTS RELATED TO COMPLIANCE ARE SIGNIFICANT, OUR PROFITABILITY, STOCK PRICE AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. We are required to comply with the provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which require us to maintain an ongoing evaluation and integration of the internal controls of our business. We were required to document and test our internal controls and certify that we are responsible for maintaining an adequate system of internal control procedures for the year ended December 31, 2007. In sequent years, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to opine on those internal controls and management's assessment of those controls. In the process, we may identify areas requiring improvements, and we may have to design enhanced processes and controls to address issued indentified through this review. We evaluated our existing controls for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and determined that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. The identified material weaknesses did not result in material audit adjustments to our 2008 financial statements; however, uncured material weaknesses could negatively impact our financial statements for subsequent years. We cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully complete the procedures, certification and attestation requirements of Section 404 or that our auditors will not have to report a material weakness in connection with the presentation of our financial statements. If we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404 or if our auditors report such material weakness, the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual report may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, result of operations and financial condition. Further, we believe that the out-of-pocket costs, the diversion of management's attention from running the day-to-day operations and operational changed caused by the need to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could be significant. If the time and costs associated with such compliance exceed our current expectations, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
