D. Risk Factors We may not have sufficient funds to complete further exploration programs. We have limited financial resources (working capital deficiency of $504,419 at December 31, 2008), do not generate operating revenue, and must finance our exploration activity by other means, including financing equity or debt financing. We cannot provide any assurance that additional funding will be available for further exploration of our projects or to fulfill our anticipated obligations under our existing property agreements. As reflected in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to obtain financing. If we fail to obtain additional financing, we will have to delay or cancel further exploration of our properties, and we could lose all of our interest in our properties. We have a history of losses and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We have incurred losses during each of the prior three periods in the amounts of $6,834,181, for the year ended December 31, 2008, $7,303,304 for the year ended December 31, 2007, and $3,830,534 for the year ended December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2008, we had an accumulated deficit of $28,627,483. We expect to continue to incur losses unless and until such time as one or more of our properties enter into commercial production and generate sufficient revenues to fund our continuing operations. Our exploration programs may not result in a commercial mining operation. Mineral exploration involves significant risk because few properties that are explored contain bodies of ore that would be commercially economic to develop into producing mines. Our mineral properties are without a known body of commercial ore and our proposed programs are an exploratory search for ore. We cannot provide any assurance that our current exploration programs will result in any commercial mining operation. If the exploration programs do not result in the discovery of commercial ore, we will be required to acquire additional properties and write-off all of our investments in our existing properties. - 2 - We do not have Proven Mineral Reserves or Probable Mineral Reserves. We have not established the presence of any Proven Mineral Reserves or Probable Mineral Reserves (as such terms are defined in National Instrument 43-101 of the Canadian Securities Administrators) at any of our mineral properties. We cannot provide any assurance that future feasibility studies will establish Proven Mineral Reserves or Probable Mineral Reserves at our properties. The failure to establish Proven Mineral Reserves or Probable Mineral Reserves could restrict our ability to successfully implement our strategies for long-term growth. Our future business and financial condition are dependent upon resource prices. Resource prices have fluctuated widely, particularly in recent years, and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These include international economic and political trends, inflation, currency exchange fluctuations, interest rates, global or regional consumption patterns, speculative activities and increased production due to new and improved extraction and production methods. These factors may negatively affect the marketability of any ore or minerals discovered at, and extracted from, our properties. If, because of a sustained decline in prices, financing were not available to meet cash operating costs, the feasibility of continuing operations would be evaluated and if warranted, would be discontinued. Our common share price has been and may continue to be subject to volatility. U.S. and Canadian securities markets since 2008 have experienced high levels of price and volume volatility, and the market price of securities of many companies have experience wide fluctuation in price which have not necessarily been related to the operating performance underlying assets values or prospects of such companies. Factors unrelated to our financial performance or prospects include macroeconomic developments in North America and globally, and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries. Our share price, financial condition, and results of operations are all also likely to be significantly affected by short-term changes in uranium, gold, silver and copper prices. Continual fluctuations in metal prices may occur. As a result of any of these factors, the market price of our shares at any given point in time may be subject to wide swings unrelated to any direct action by our operations. Some of our directors and officers may have conflicts of interest due to their involvement with other natural resource companies. Some our directors and officers are directors or officers of other natural resource or mining-related companies and these associations may give rise to conflicts of interest from time to time. As a result of these conflicts of interest, we may miss the opportunity to participate in certain transactions, which may have a material, adverse effect on our financial position. We may experience difficulty attracting and retaining qualified management to grow our business. We are dependent on the services of key executives including our Chief Executive Officer and other highly skilled and experienced executives and personnel focused on advancing our corporate objectives as well as the identification of new opportunities for growth and funding. Due to our relatively small size, the loss of these persons or our inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees required for our activities may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We may be limited in our ability to manage growth. Should we be successful in our efforts to develop mineral properties or to raise capital for such development or for the development of other mining ventures, we may experience significant growth in operations. Any expansion of our business would place demands on our management, operational capacity, and financial resources. We anticipate that we will need to recruit qualified personnel in all areas of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be effective in retaining our current personnel or attracting and retaining additional qualified personnel, expanding our operational capacity or otherwise managing growth. The failure to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on the our business, financial condition and results of operations. - 3 - Environmental and other regulatory requirements may limit our operations and increase our expenses. Our operations are subject to environmental regulations promulgated by various Canadian, U.S., and Mexican government agencies. Claims and current and future operations will be governed by laws and regulations governing mineral concession acquisition, prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection, mine safety and other matters. Companies such as ours that engage in exploration activities often experience increased costs and delays in production and other schedules as a result of the need to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permits. Issuance of permits for our exploration activities is subject to the discretion of government authorities, and we may be unable to obtain or maintain such permits. Permits required for future exploration or development may not be obtainable on reasonable terms or on a timely basis. Existing and possible future laws, regulations and permits governing operations and activities of exploration companies, or more stringent implementation thereof, could have a material adverse impact us and cause increases in capital expenditures or require abandonment or delays in exploration. Operating hazards associated with mining may expose us to liability. Mining operations generally involve a high degree of risk, including hazards such as unusual or unexpected geological formations. Operations in which we have an interest are subject to all the hazards and risks normally incidental to exploration, development and production of minerals, any of which could result in work stoppages, damage to or destruction of mines and other producing facilities, damage to or loss of life and property, environmental damage and possible legal liability for any or all damage or loss. We currently do not maintain standard insurance policies on our properties. We may become subject to liability for cave-ins and other hazards for which we cannot fully insure or against which we may elect not to insure where premium costs are disproportionate to our perception of the relevant risks. For example, we are not currently covered by any form of political risk insurance or any form of environmental liability insurance. The payment of such insurance premiums and the incurring of such liabilities would reduce the funds available for exploration activities. Our properties may be subject to uncertain title. The acquisition of title to resource properties or interest therein is a very detailed and time consuming process. Title to and the area of resource concessions may be disputed. We have investigated title to all of our mineral properties and, to the best of our knowledge, title to all of our properties are in good standing. The properties may be subject to prior, and in some cases, not fully ascertainable unregistered agreements or transfers, and title may be affected by undetected defects. Title may be based upon interpretation of a countryÂ’s laws, which laws may be ambiguous, inconsistently applied and subject to reinterpretation or change. Enforcement of judgments or bringing actions outside the United States against us and our directors and officers may be difficult. We are organized under the law of and headquartered in British Columbia, Canada, and the majority of our directors and officers are not citizens or residents of the U.S. In addition, a substantial part of our assets are located outside the U.S. and Canada. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for you to (a) enforce in courts outside the U.S. judgments against us and a majority of our directors and officers, obtained in U.S. courts based upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws or (b) bring in courts outside the U.S. an original action against us and our directors and officers to enforce liabilities based upon such U.S. securities laws.
