Risk Factors  Risks Related to Our Operations. Impact of Changes in Interest Rates Interest rates may fluctuate upon changes in financial market conditions and material changes can affect our results from operations and financial condition, since these changes can impact the total interest income received on our cash and cash equivalents and the total interest expense paid on our financial debt. Our interest income, net, as reported on our consolidated statements of income, is the balance between interest income received from our cash and cash equivalent and marketable securities investments and interest expense paid on our long-term debt. Our interest income is dependent upon fluctuations in interest rates, mainly in U.S. dollars and Euros, since we invest primarily on a short-term basis; any increase or decrease in the short-term market interest rates would mean an equivalent increase or decrease in our interest income. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 40% of our long-term debt was at fixed interest rates. Our interest expenses are associated with our long-term Zero Coupon 2016 Convertible Bonds (with a fixed rate of 1.5%), our 2013 Floating Rate Senior Bond, which is fixed quarterly at a rate of EURIBOR plus 40bps, and European Investment Bank Floating Rate Loans totaling $672 million at LIBOR plus variable spreads. To manage the interest rate mismatch, in the second quarter of 2006, we entered into cancellable swaps to hedge a portion of the fixed rate obligations on our outstanding long-term debt with floating rate derivative instruments. Of the $974 million in 2016 Convertible Bonds issued in the first quarter of 2006, we entered into cancellable swaps for $200 million of the principal amount of the bonds, swapping the 1.5% yield equivalent on the bonds for 6 Month USD LIBOR minus 3.375%, partially offsetting the interest rate mismatch of the 2016 Convertible Bond. Our hedging policy was not intended to cover the full exposure and all risks associated with these instruments. Due to the exceptionally low U.S. dollar interest rate brought about by the financial crisis, in 2008 we determined that the swaps had not been effective since November 1, 2008 and the fair value hedge relationship was discontinued. Consequently, the swaps were designated as held-for-trading financial assets and reported at fair value as a component of Other receivables and current assets in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008 for $34 million, since we intended to hold the derivative instruments for a short period of time that would not exceed twelve months. An unrealized gain of $15 million was recognized in earnings from the discontinuance date and was reported on the line Unrealized gain on financial assets of the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2008. This instrument was sold during the first quarter of 2009 with a positive cash flow impact of $26 million and a loss of $8 million. In December 2009, in order to reduce the negative carry of the outstanding Zero Coupon Senior Convertible Bonds due 2016, we began a program to repurchase a portion of them. At December 31, 2009, 98 thousand bonds had been repurchased, corresponding to 4,295,722 shares. In light of the put option that will be exercisable by bondholders on February 23, 2011, we decided to repurchase a portion of the 2016 Bonds to optimize our liquidity management and yield through that date. See Other Developments. We also have $250 million of restricted cash at a fixed rate (Hynix Semiconductor-Numonyx JV), which partially offsets the interest rate mismatch of the 2016 Convertible Bond. Our hedging policy is not intended to cover the full exposure and all risks associated with these instruments. At December 31, 2009, our total financial resources, including cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities current and non-current and restricted cash, generated an average interest income rate of 0.86%. This does not include interest income accrued on the shareholder loan to Numonyx. 74 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Treasury activities are regulated by our policies, which define procedures, objectives and controls. The policies focus on the management of our financial risk in terms of exposure to currency rates and interest rates. Most treasury activities are centralized, with any local treasury activities subject to oversight from our head treasury office. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held in U.S. dollars and Euros and are placed with financial institutions rated A or better. Part of our liquidity is also held in Euros to naturally hedge intercompany payables and financial debt in the same currency and is placed with financial institutions rated at least single A long-term rating, meaning at least A3 from Moodys Investor Service and A- from Standard & Poors or Fitch Ratings. Marginal amounts are held in other currencies. See Item 11, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. As of December 31, 2009, our total liquidity and capital resources were comprised of $1,588 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $186 million is held at the ST-Ericsson level, $1,032 million in marketable securities as current assets, of which $40 million is held at the ST Ericsson level, $250 million as restricted cash and $42 million in ARS, invested by Credit Suisse contrary to our instruction, both items considered as non-current assets. Our total capital resources were $2,912 million as of December 31, 2009, a significant increase compared to $2,132 million at December 2008. Such increase was originated by the proceeds from the ST-Ericsson business combination and from operating cash flow. As of December 31, 2009, we had $1,032 million in marketable securities as current assets, composed of $484 million invested in Aaa treasury bills from the French and U.S. governments, $548 million invested in senior debt floating rate notes issued by primary financial institutions with an average rating, excluding one impaired debt security for a notional value of 15 million, of Aa3/A+ from Moodys and S&P. Both the treasury bills and the Floating Rate Notes are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of changes in equity, except if deemed to be other-than-temporary. We reported as of December 31, 2009 a before tax increase of $8 million compared to December 31, 2008 in the fair value of our floating rate note portfolio. Since the duration of the floating-rate note portfolio is only an average of two years and the securities have a minimum Moodys rating of A3, we expect the value of the securities to return to par as the final maturity approaches (with the only exception being the $15 million of Senior Floating Rate Notes issued by Lehman Brothers, the value of which was impaired through an other than temporary charge in 2008). The fair value of these securities is based on market prices publicly available through major financial information providers. The market price of the Floating Rate Notes is influenced by changes in the credit standing of the issuer but is not significantly impacted by movement in interest rates. In 2009, we invested $1,730 million in French and U.S. treasury bills, of which $1,263 million was sold or matured during the year. The change in fair value of the $484 million debt securities classified as available-for-sale was not material at December 31, 2009. The duration of the treasury bills portfolio is less than five months and the securities are rated Aaa by Moodys. Due to regulatory and withholding tax issues, we could not directly provide the Hynix joint venture with the $250 million long-term financing as originally planned. As a result, in 2006, we entered into a ten-year term debt guarantee agreement with an external financial institution through which we guaranteed the repayment of the loan by the joint venture to the bank. The guarantee agreement includes our placing up to $250 million in cash in a deposit account with a yield of 6.06%. The guarantee deposit will be used by the bank in case of repayment failure from the joint venture (which is now known as the Numonyx-Hynix joint venture), with $250 million as the maximum potential amount of future payments we, as the guarantor, could be required to make. In the event of default and failure to repay the loan from the joint venture, the bank will exercise our rights, subordinated to the repayment to senior lenders, to recover the amounts paid under the guarantee through the sale of the joint ventures assets. The $250 million, which has been on deposit since 2007, was reported as Restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009. The debt guarantee was evaluated under guidance related to disclosures about credit derivatives and certain guarantees, and resulted in the recognition of a $17 million liability, corresponding to the fair value of the guarantee at inception of the transaction. The debt guarantee obligation continues to be reported on the line Other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009, since we retained the deposit, as an asset, and the related guarantee at the formation of Numonyx. At December 31, 2009, the guarantee was not exercised. To the best of our knowledge, at December 31, 2009, the joint venture was current on its debt obligations, was not in default of any debt covenants and did not expect to be in default on these obligations in the foreseeable future. Our current maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with the joint venture is limited to our indirect investment through Numonyx and the debt guarantee commitments. Under the terms of the recently signed agreement to sell Numonyx to Micron, we will continue to retain the $250 million deposit with DBS Bank Ltd. in Singapore, which is intended to guarantee the Hynix-Numonyx joint ventures debt financing for such amount. Under the terms of the joint venture agreement with Hynix, upon the closing of the sale of Numonyx, Hynix and Numonyx have certain rights to buy or sell or cause the other party to buy or sell their interests in the Hynix JV. We have entered into an agreement with 75 Table of Contents Micron and Numonyx that provides that, in the event that Hynix exercises its right to purchase Numonyx interest in the Hynix joint venture following the closing of the Numonyx transaction, Numonyx will take over all or part of our obligations under the guarantee. As of December 31, 2009, we had Auction Rate Securities, purchased by Credit Suisse contrary to our instruction, representing interests in collateralized debt obligations with a par value of $261 million, that were carried on our balance sheet as available-for-sale financial assets for $42 million, including the positive revaluation of $15 million in other comprehensive income in equity. Following the continued failure of auctions for these securities which began in August 2007, we first registered a decline in the value of these Auction Rate Securities as an Other-than-temporary impairment charge against net income for $46 million during the fourth quarter of 2007. Since the initial failure of the auctions in August 2007, the market for these securities has completely frozen without any observable secondary market trades, and consequently, during 2008 and 2009, the portfolio experienced a further estimated decline in fair value charged to our Income Statement pursuant applicable GAAP of $127 million and $72 million, respectively, of which no additional impairment was recorded during the third or fourth quarter of 2009. The reduction in estimated fair value was recorded as an Other-than-temporary impairment charge against net income. The investments made in the aforementioned Auction Rate Securities were made without our authorization and, in 2008, we launched a legal action against Credit Suisse. On February 16, 2009, the arbitration panel of FINRA awarded us approximately $406 million comprising compensatory damages, as well as interest and attorneys fees, and authorized us to retain an interest award of approximately $27 million, out of which $25 million has already been paid, as well as to obtain interest at the rate of 4.64% on the par value of the portfolio from December 31, 2008 until the award is paid in full. In December 2009, Credit Suisse, because of its contingent interest in certain securities held by us and issued by Deutsche Bank, requested that we either tender the securities or accept that the amount that would be received by us pursuant to such tender ($75 million) be deducted from the sum to be collected by us if and when the FINRA award is confirmed and enforced. Pursuant to legal advice, and while reserving our legal rights, we participated in the tender offer. As a result, we sold ARS with a face value of $154 million, collected $75 million and registered $68 million as realized losses on financial assets. Such amount comes in addition to the $245 million impairment that had been taken as of September 30, 2009 with respect to the portfolio of ARS purchased on our account by Credit Suisse contrary to our instruction. These amounts should be recovered upon collection of the award. We are seeking confirmation of the award from the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York. Since the fourth quarter of 2007, as there was no information available regarding mark to market bids and mark to model valuations from the structuring financial institutions for these securities, we based our estimation of fair value on a theoretical model using yields obtainable for comparable assets. The value inputs for the evaluation of these securities were publicly available indices of securities with the same rating, similar duration and comparable/similar underlying collaterals or industries exposure (such as ABX for the collateralized debt obligation and ITraxx and IBoxx for the credit linked notes). The higher impairment charges during 2008 and 2009 reflect downgrading events on the collateral debt obligations comparing the relevant ABX indices of a lower rating category and a general negative trend of the corporate debt market. The estimated value of the collateralized debt obligations could further decrease in the future as a result of credit market deterioration and/or other downgrading. Liquidity We maintain a significant cash position and a low debt to equity ratio, which provide us with adequate financial flexibility. As in the past, our cash management policy is to finance our investment needs mainly with net cash generated from operating activities. During 2009, the evolution of our cash flow produced an increase in our cash and cash equivalents of $579 million, generated by net cash from both operating and investing activities, the latter including the proceeds from the ST-Ericsson business combination. The evolution of our cash flow for each period is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Net cash from (used in) operating activities $ 816 $ 1,722 $ 2,188 Net cash from (used in) investing activities 290 (2,417 ) (1,737 ) Net cash from (used in) in financing activities (513 ) (67 ) (296 ) Effect of change in exchange rates (14 ) (84 ) 41 Net cash increase (decrease) $ 579 $ (846 ) $ 196 76 Table of Contents Net cash from (used in) operating activities. The net cash from operating activities in 2009 was significantly lower compared to previous periods due to a higher amount of net losses registered. See Results of Operations for more information. However, in response to the financial market crisis we focused on strong capital management by taking aggressive actions to generate cash by accelerating our cash conversion cycle, resulting in a $553 million reduction in inventory and reflecting the accelerated collection of States receivables, mainly certain R&D tax credits. As a result, our net cash from operating activities decreased from $1,722 million in 2008 to $816 million in 2009. Depreciation and amortization was $1,367 million in 2009, equivalent to the prior year period. Net cash from (used in) investing activities. Investing activities generated cash in 2009 primarily due to the net proceeds of $1,155 million, received from Ericsson in relation to the creation of ST-Ericsson. Payments for the purchase of tangible assets totaled $451 million, a significant reduction from the $983 million registered in the equivalent prior year period. Furthermore, in 2009, we made payments of $1,730 million for the purchases of marketable securities, while we collected $1,446 million upon the sales of marketable securities largely due to their maturity dates. Net cash from (used in) financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $513 million in 2009 compared to the $67 million used in 2008. The 2009 amount included $158 million as dividends paid to shareholders, $134 million as repayment at maturity of long term debt, $103 million related to the repurchase of the 2016 Bonds and $92 million of purchase of equity from noncontrolling interests related to the acquisition of NXPs 20% stake in ST-NXP Wireless. There were no proceeds from long term debt in 2009, while the corresponding amount in 2008 was $663 million. Net operating cash flow. We also present net operating cash flow, defined as net cash from (used in) operating activities plus (minus) net cash from (used in) investing activities, excluding payment for purchases of and proceeds from the sale of marketable securities (both current and non-current), short-term deposits and restricted cash. We believe net operating cash flow provides useful information for investors and management because it measures our capacity to generate cash from our operating and investing activities to sustain our operating activities. Net operating cash flow is not a U.S. GAAP measure and does not represent total cash flow since it does not include the cash flows generated by or used in financing activities. In addition, our definition of net operating cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies. Net operating cash flow is determined as follows from our Audited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Net cash from (used in) operating activities $ 816 $ 1,722 $ 2,188 Net cash from (used in) investing activities 290 (2,417 ) (1,737 ) Payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of marketable securities (current and non-current), short-term deposits and restricted cash, net 258 (351 ) 389 Net operating cash flow $ 1,364 $ (1,046 ) $ 840 We had favorable net operating cash flow of $1,364 million in 2009, significantly higher compared to net negative operating cash flow of $(1,046) million in 2008, mainly as a result of the $1,137 million, net of related fees, received from EMP as part of the creation of the ST-Ericsson joint venture. Excluding the effects of business combinations, net operating cash flow was favorable by $227 million in 2009, decreasing compared to favorable net operating cash flow of $648 million in 2008, because of the deterioration in our operating results which negatively impacted the net cash from operating activities. Capital Resources Net financial position Our net financial position represents the balance between our total financial resources and our total financial debt. Our total financial resources include cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current marketable securities, short-term deposits and restricted cash, and our total financial debt includes bank overdrafts, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt, as represented in our consolidated balance sheet. Net financial position is not a U.S. GAAP measure but we believe it provides useful information for investors because it gives evidence of our global position either in terms of net indebtedness or net cash by measuring our capital resources based on cash, 77 Table of Contents cash equivalents and marketable securities and the total level of our financial indebtedness. Our net financial position has been determined as follows from our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2009: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents, net of bank overdrafts $ 1,588 $ 989 $ 1,855 Marketable securities, current 1,032 651 1,014 Restricted cash 250 250 250 Marketable securities, non-current 42 242 369 Total financial resources 2,912 2,132 3,488 Current portion of long-term debt (176 ) (123 ) (103 ) Long-term debt (2,316 ) (2,554 ) (2,117 ) Total financial debt (2,492 ) (2,677 ) (2,220 ) Net financial position $ 420 $ (545 ) $ 1,268 Our net financial position as of December 31, 2009 resulted in a net cash position of $420 million, representing a solid improvement compared to the net debt of $545 million at December 31, 2008, due to the proceeds from the ST-Ericsson business combination and favorable net operating cash flow. In the same period, both our cash position and our current marketable securities portfolio increased significantly to $1,588 million and $1,032 million, respectively, while total financial debt decreased by $185 million. At December 31, 2009, the aggregate amount of our long-term debt, including the current portion, was $2,492 million, which included $943 million of our 2016 Convertible Bonds, $720 million of our 2013 Senior Bonds (corresponding to 500 million at issuance) and $672 million in European Investment Bank loans (the EIB Loans). The EIB Loans represent two committed credit facilities as part of R&D funding programs. The first, for 245 million for R&D in France was fully drawn in U.S. dollars for a total amount of $341 million, of which $49 million had been paid back at December 31, 2009. The second, signed on July 21, 2008, for 250 million for R&D projects in Italy, was fully drawn in U.S. dollars for $380 million at December 31, 2009. Additionally, we had unutilized committed medium term credit facilities with core relationship banks totaling $500 million. Furthermore, the aggregate amount of our total available short-term credit facilities, excluding foreign exchange credit facilities, was approximately $759 million at December 31, 2009. In addition, as the parent companies, we and Ericsson have granted ST-Ericsson a $25 million committed facility and $25 million unutilized committed line, respectively. The withdrawal of that line is subject to approval of the parent companies at STEs Board of Directors. We also maintain uncommitted foreign exchange facilities totaling $714 million at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, the amounts available under the short-term lines of credit were not reduced by any borrowing. Our long-term capital market financing instruments contain standard covenants, but do not impose minimum financial ratios or similar obligations on us. Upon a change of control, the holders of our 2016 Convertible Bonds and 2013 Senior Bonds may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holders bonds. See Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2009, debt payments due by period and based on the assumption that convertible debt redemptions are at the holders first redemption option were as follows: Payments Due by Period Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter (In millions) Long-term debt (including current portion) $ 2,492 $ 176 $ 1,063 $ 119 $ 836 $ 114 $ 92 $ 92 In February 2006, we issued $1,131 million principal amount at maturity zero coupon senior convertible bonds due in February 2016. The bonds are convertible by the holder at any time prior to maturity at a conversion rate of 43.833898 shares per one thousand dollar face value of the bonds corresponding to 42,694,216 equivalent shares. This conversion rate was adjusted from 43.363087 shares per one thousand dollar face value of the bonds at May 21, 2007, as the result of the extraordinary cash dividend distribution of $0.36 per share approved by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders held on May 14, 2008. This new conversion has been in effect since May 19, 2008. The holders will also be able to redeem the convertible bonds on February 23, 2011 at a price of $1,077.58, on February 23, 2012 at a price of $1,093.81 and on February 24, 2014 at a price of $1,126.99 per one thousand dollar face value of the bonds. We can call the bonds at any time after March 10, 2011 subject to our share price exceeding 130% of the accreted value divided by the conversion rate for 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days. On 78 Table of Contents December 30, 2009 we repurchased 98 thousand bonds for a total cash consideration of $103 million, realizing a gain on the repurchase of $3 million. As of December 31, 2009, we have the following credit ratings on our 2013 and 2016 Bonds: Moodys Investors Service Standard & Poors Zero Coupon Senior Convertible Bonds due 2013 WR(1) NR Zero Coupon Senior Convertible Bonds due 2016 Baa1 BBB+ Floating Rate Senior Bonds due 2013 Baa1 BBB+ (1) Rating withdrawn since the redemption in August 2006 of $1.4 billion of our 2013 Convertible Bonds. We are also rated A− from Fitch on an unsolicited basis. On February 6, 2009 Standard & Poors Rating Services lowered our senior debt rating from A− to BBB+ and Moodys Investors Service affirmed the Baa1 senior debt ratings and changed the outlook on the ratings to negative from stable. In March 2006, STMicroelectronics Finance B.V. (ST BV), one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, issued Floating Rate Senior Bonds with a principal amount of 500 million at an issue price of 99.873%. The notes, which mature on March 17, 2013, pay a coupon rate of the three-month Euribor plus 0.40% on June 17, September 17, December 17 and March 17 of each year through maturity. The notes have a put for early repayment in case of a change of control. The Floating Rate Senior Bonds issued by ST BV are collateralized with guarantee issued by us. Contractual Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Contingencies Our contractual obligations, commercial commitments and contingencies as of December 31, 2009, and for each of the five years to come and thereafter, were as follows (1): Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Operating leases(2) $ 481 $ 131 $ 98 $ 68 $ 43 $ 26 $ 115 Purchase obligations(2) 741 604 62 37 20 18  of which: Equipment and other asset purchase 267 267      Foundry purchase 182 182      Software, technology licenses and design 292 155 62 37 20 18  Other obligations(2) 532 263 135 125 6 2 1 Long-term debt obligations (including current portion)(3)(4)(5) of which: 2,492 176 1,063 119 836 114 184 Capital leases(3) 19 8 4 2 2 2 1 Pension obligations(3) 317 41 21 28 28 37 162 Other non-current liabilities(3) 342 19 20 87 8 7 201 Total $ 4,905 $ 1,234 $ 1,399 $ 464 $ 941 $ 204 $ 663 (1) Contingent liabilities which cannot be quantified are excluded from the table above. (2) Items not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009. (3) Items reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009. (4) See Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2009 for additional information related to long-term debt and redeemable convertible securities. (5) Year of payment is based on maturity before taking into account any potential acceleration that could result from a triggering of the change of control provisions of the 2016 Convertible Bonds and the 2013 Senior Bonds. As a result of our July 10, 2007 announcement relating to the planned closures of certain manufacturing facilities, the shutdown of plants in the United States is ongoing and negotiations with suppliers continue. As no final date for the closure has been set, some of the aforementioned contracts have been terminated. The termination fees for the sites still in operation have not been taken into account. Operating leases are mainly related to building leases and to equipment. The amount disclosed is composed of minimum payments for future leases from 2010 to 2014 and thereafter. We lease land, buildings, plants and equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates under non-cancelable lease agreements. 79 Table of Contents Purchase obligations are primarily comprised of purchase commitments for equipment, for outsourced foundry wafers and for software licenses. Other obligations primarily relate to firm contractual commitments with respect to cooperation agreements. Long-term debt obligations mainly consist of bank loans, convertible and non-convertible debt issued by us that is totally or partially redeemable for cash at the option of the holder. They include maximum future amounts that may be redeemable for cash at the option of the holder, at fixed prices. The outstanding long-term debt corresponding to the 2013 convertible debt was not material at December 31, 2009. See Net financial position. Pension obligations and termination indemnities amounting to $317 million consist of our best estimates of the amounts projected to be payable by us for the retirement plans based on the assumption that our employees will work for us until they reach the age of retirement. The final actual amount to be paid and related timing of such payments may vary significantly due to early retirements, terminations and changes in assumptions rates. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. As part of the FMG deconsolidation, we retained the obligation to fund the severance payment (trattamento di fine rapporto) due to certain transferred employees by the defined amount of about $32 million which qualifies as a defined benefit plan and was classified as an other non-current liability at December 31, 2009. Other non-current liabilities include, in addition to the above-mentioned pension obligation, future obligations related to our restructuring plans and miscellaneous contractual obligations. They also include at December 31, 2009, following the FMG deconsolidation in 2008, a long-term liability for capacity rights amounting to $47 million. In addition, we and Intel have each granted in favor of Numonyx B.V., in which we hold a 48.6% equity investment through Numonyx, a 50% guarantee not joint and several, for indebtedness related to the financing arrangements entered into by Numonyx for a $450 million term loan and a $100 million committed revolving credit facility. We have estimated the guarantee to be $69 million based on the fair value of the term loan over 4 years, including the effect of savings provided by the guarantee. Upon the closing of the Numonyx deal with Micron, Numonyx will repay the full amount of its outstanding $450 million term loan, while simultaneously terminating our $225 million guarantee of its debt. Please refer to Other developments. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2009. Financial Outlook While we are reconfirming our target to have capital expenditures to remain in the range of 5 to about 7% of revenues, we expect a moderate increase compared to the $451 million spent in 2009 in order to keep pace with the sharp increase in customer demand. The most significant of our 2010 capital expenditure projects are expected to be: (a) for the front-end facilities: (i) the increase of up to 3200 wafers per week in the capacity of our 300-mm fab in Crolles, and costs related to the preparation for an additional increase to 3600 wafers per week; (ii) the establishment of a 32nm R&D capability in Crolles; (iii) the completion of the program for front-end fabs, targeting the increased capacity in the Ang-Mo-Kio (Singapore) 150mm to 18K wafers per week; (iv) selective programs of robustness / mix change in our 200-mm fabs, mainly by installing tools transferred from internal sources; (v) the strengthening of proprietary technologies in our 200-mm fab in Agrate; and (vi) quality, safety, security, maintenance both in 6 and 8 front end fabs; (b) for the back-end facilities, the capital expenditures will mainly be dedicated to the capacity increase: (i) growth of our manufacturing presence in China (Longgang and Shenzhen) and the Philippines (Calamba); (ii) further consolidation of our presence in Malaysia (Muar); and (iii) specific investments in the areas of quality, environment, energy saving and (c) an overall capacity increase in wafers probing (EWS) for all product groups. We will continue to monitor our level of capital spending by taking into consideration factors such as trends in the semiconductor industry, capacity utilization and announced additions. We expect to have significant capital requirements in the coming years and in addition we intend to continue to devote a substantial portion of our net revenues to R&D. We plan to fund our capital requirements from cash provided by operating activities, available funds and available support from third parties, and may have recourse to borrowings under available credit lines and, to the extent necessary or attractive based on market conditions prevailing at the time, the issuing of debt, convertible bonds or additional equity securities. A substantial deterioration of our economic results and consequently of our profitability could generate a deterioration of the cash generated by our operating activities. Therefore, there can be no assurance that, in future periods, we will generate the same level of cash as in the previous years to fund our capital expenditures plans for expending/upgrading our production facilities, our working capital requirements, our R&D and industrialization costs. 80 Table of Contents On February 23, 2011, holders will be able to call for the redemption of our 2016 convertible bonds, which we believe is likely to occur in view of current market prices, for an amount of $728 million. Furthermore, there could be possible financial needs for temporary bridge financing by the parent companies of the ST-Ericsson joint venture, the amount of which cannot be estimated at this stage.
