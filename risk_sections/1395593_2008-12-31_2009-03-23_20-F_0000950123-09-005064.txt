D. Risk Factors Some of the following risks relate principally to the seaborne transportation industry in which we operate and our business in general. Other risks relate principally to the securities market and ownership of our common stock. You should carefully consider the following risks together with the other information described in this section before deciding to invest in our common stock. Any of the risk factors could significantly and negatively affect our business, financial condition or operating results and the trading price of our stock. You may lose all or part of your investment. Industry Specific Risk Factors Charter hire rates for drybulk carriers have decreased, which may adversely affect our earnings. The drybulk shipping industry is cyclical with attendant volatility in charter hire rates and profitability. For example, the degree of charter hire rate volatility among different types of drybulk carriers has varied widely. After reaching historical highs in mid-2008, charter hire rates for Panamax and Capesize drybulk carriers have reached near historically low levels. We currently employ one of our vessels in a spot market pool where we are exposed to changes in spot market and short-term charter rates for drybulk carriers and such changes may affect our earnings and the value of our drybulk carriers at any given time. In addition, we may charter some of our vessels pursuant to short-term time charters in the future. We cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully charter our vessels in the future or renew existing charters at rates sufficient to allow us to meet our obligations or pay any dividends in the future. Because the factors affecting the supply and demand for vessels are outside of our control and are unpredictable, the nature, timing, direction and degree of changes in industry conditions are also unpredictable. Factors that influence demand for vessel capacity include:  supply and demand for energy resources, commodities, semi-finished and finished consumer and industrial products;  changes in the exploration or production of energy resources, commodities, semi-finished and finished consumer and industrial products;  the location of regional and global exploration, production and manufacturing facilities;  the location of consuming regions for energy resources, commodities, semi-finished and finished consumer and industrial products;  the globalization of production and manufacturing;  global and regional economic and political conditions, including armed conflicts and terrorist activities; embargoes and strikes; 5 Table of Contents  developments in international trade;  changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns, including the distance cargo is transported by sea;  environmental and other regulatory developments;  currency exchange rates; and  weather. The factors that influence the supply of vessel capacity include:  the number of newbuilding deliveries;  port and canal congestion;  the scrapping rate of older vessels;  vessel casualties; and  the number of vessels that are out of service. We anticipate that the future demand for our drybulk carriers will be dependent upon continued economic growth in the worlds economies, including China and India, seasonal and regional changes in demand, changes in the capacity of the global drybulk carrier fleet and the sources and supply of drybulk cargo to be transported by sea. The capacity of the global drybulk carrier fleet seems likely to increase and there can be no assurance that economic growth will continue. Adverse economic, political, social or other developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. The downturns in the drybulk carrier and tanker charter markets may have an adverse effect on our earnings, affect compliance with our loan covenants, require us to raise additional capital in order to comply with our loan covenants, and affect our ability to pay dividends if reinstated in the future. The BDI, a daily average of charter rates in 26 shipping routes measured on a time charter and voyage basis covering Supramax, Panamax and Capesize drybulk carriers, declined from a high of 11,793 in May 2008 to a low of 663 in December 2008, which represents a decline of 94%. The BDI fell over 70% during the month of October alone. The decline in charter rates is due to various factors, including the lack of trade financing for purchases of commodities carried by sea, which has resulted in a significant decline in cargo shipments, and the excess supply of iron ore in China which has resulted in falling iron ore prices. The decline in charter rates in the drybulk market also affects the value of our drybulk vessels, which follow the trends of drybulk charter rates, and earnings on our charters, and similarly, affects our cash flows, liquidity and compliance with the covenants contained in our loan agreements. In the second half of 2008, the slowdown in global economic growth led to a significant decline in oil prices from a high of $145 per barrel in July 2008 to $42 per barrel in January 2009 after reaching a low of $39 in December 31, 2008. OPEC has responded to this decrease in oil price by reducing oil supply significantly. 6 Table of Contents The recent rapid decline in global oil prices has negatively impacted tanker charter rates as well as the value of our tanker vessels. According to industry sources, the average spot market rate for a Suezmax tanker for the benchmark Suezmax tanker route loading in West Africa and discharging in the U.S. Atlantic Coast declined from a high of $138,943 per day in July 2008 to a low of $35,018 per day in November 2008, which represents a decline of 75%. The average spot market rate for this benchmark route was $56,574 per day on December 31, 2008, which represents a decline of 59% from the high reached in July 2008. Although this decline has not been as severe as the decline in the drybulk market, it has a commensurate decline in our tanker vessel values affecting our cash flows, liquidity and compliance with the covenants contained in our loan agreements. On December 12, 2008, our Board of Directors determined, after careful consideration of various factors, including the recent sharp decline in charter rates and vessel values in the drybulk sector, to suspend the payment of cash dividends until such time as the Board of Directors shall determine in its discretion, in order to preserve capital. On January 9, 2009, we entered into an amendment to our Nordea credit facility waiving the December 9, 2008 breach of the collateral maintenance coverage ratio contained in such credit facility resulting from the decrease in the market value of our vessels and reducing the level of the collateral maintenance coverage ratio for the remaining term of the agreement. Please see Item 5. Operating Financial Review and Prospects  B. Liquidity and Capital Resources  Long Term Debt Obligations and Credit Arrangements. If the current low charter rates in the drybulk and tanker markets continue through any significant period in 2009 and 2010, when time charters for our vessels expire and we are consequently exposed to then-prevailing charter rates, our earnings may be adversely affected. If these trends continue, in order to remain viable, we may have to extend the period in which we suspend dividend payments or reinstate dividend payments at a reduced level (subject to restrictions in our credit facilities, including a prohibition on dividend payments set forth in our amended Nordea credit facility, which matures in October 2015), sell vessels in our fleet and/or seek to raise additional capital in the equity markets. If we are able to sell additional shares at a time when the charter rates in the drybulk and tanker charter markets are low, such sales could be at prices below those at which shareholders had purchased their shares, which could, in turn, result in significant dilution of our then existing shareholders and affect our ability to pay dividends if reinstated in the future and our earnings per share. During the period from January 30, 2009 through March 19, 2009, we issued a total of 3.15 million common shares pursuant to our Standby Equity Purchase Agreement, or SEPA, with YA Global Master SPV Ltd., or YA Global, resulting in net proceeds of $6.2 million. Even if we are able to raise additional capital in the equity markets, there is no assurance we will be able to comply with our loan covenants. An over-supply of drybulk carrier capacity may lead to reductions in charter hire rates and profitability. The market supply of drybulk carriers has been increasing, and the number of drybulk carriers on order is near historic highs. These newbuildings were delivered in significant numbers starting at the beginning of 2006 and continuing through 2008. As of December 2008, newbuilding orders had been placed for an aggregate of more than 70.3% of the existing global drybulk fleet, with deliveries expected during the next 36 months. An over-supply of drybulk carrier capacity may result in a reduction of charter hire rates. If such a reduction occurs, upon the expiration or termination of our vessels current charters we may only be able to re-charter our vessels at reduced or unprofitable rates or we may not be able to charter these vessels at all. 7 Table of Contents A further economic slowdown in the Asia Pacific region could exacerbate the effect of recent slowdowns in the economies of the United States and the European Union and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We anticipate a significant number of the port calls made by our vessels will continue to involve the loading or discharging of drybulk commodities in ports in the Asia Pacific region. As a result, negative change in economic conditions in any Asia Pacific country, but particularly in China, may exacerbate the effect of recent slowdowns in the economies of the United States and the European Union and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations, as well as our future prospects. In recent years, China has been one of the worlds fastest growing economies in terms of gross domestic product, which has had a significant impact on shipping demand. According to preliminary estimates by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, Chinas year over year GDP growth rate in 2008 was 9%, the lowest since 2001, and its quarterly growth rate declined over the course of 2008 from 10.6% in the first quarter to 6.8% in the fourth quarter. It is likely that China and other countries in the Asia Pacific region will continue to experience slowed economic growth in the near future. Moreover, the current economic slowdown in the economies of the United States, the European Union and other Asian countries may further adversely affect economic growth in China and elsewhere. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, and our future prospects, will likely be materially and adversely affected by a further economic downturn in any of these countries. Changes in the economic and political environment in China and policies adopted by the government to regulate its economy may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, in such respects as structure, government involvement, level of development, growth rate, capital reinvestment, allocation of resources, rate of inflation and balance of payments position. Prior to 1978, the Chinese economy was a planned economy. Since 1978, increasing emphasis has been placed on the utilization of market forces in the development of the Chinese economy. Annual and five year State Plans are adopted by the Chinese government in connection with the development of the economy. Although state-owned enterprises still account for a substantial portion of the Chinese industrial output, in general, the Chinese government is reducing the level of direct control that it exercises over the economy through State Plans and other measures. There is an increasing level of freedom and autonomy in areas such as allocation of resources, production, pricing and management and a gradual shift in emphasis to a market economy and enterprise reform. Limited price reforms were undertaken, with the result that prices for certain commodities are principally determined by market forces. Many of the reforms are unprecedented or experimental and may be subject to revision, change or abolition based upon the outcome of such experiments. If the Chinese government does not continue to pursue a policy of economic reform, the level of imports to and exports from China could be adversely affected by changes to these economic reforms by the Chinese government, as well as by changes in political, economic and social conditions or other relevant policies of the Chinese government, such as changes in laws, regulations or export and import restrictions, all of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Disruptions in world financial markets and the resulting governmental action in the United States and in other parts of the world could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain financing, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could cause the market price of our common shares to decline. The United States and other parts of the world are exhibiting deteriorating economic trends and have been in a recession. For example, the credit markets worldwide and in the United States have experienced significant contraction, de-leveraging and reduced liquidity, and the United States federal government, state governments and foreign governments have implemented and are considering a broad variety of governmental action and/or new regulation of the financial markets. 8 Table of Contents Securities and futures markets and the credit markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations and other requirements. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, other regulators, self-regulatory organizations and exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of market emergencies, and may effect changes in law or interpretations of existing laws. Recently, a number of financial institutions have experienced serious financial difficulties and, in some cases, have entered bankruptcy proceedings or are in regulatory enforcement actions. The uncertainty surrounding the future of the credit markets in the United States and the rest of the world has resulted in reduced access to credit worldwide. As of March 19, 2009, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $321.7 million consisting of $302.9 million under our existing credit facilities and $18.8 million due under the sellers credit in connection with the acquisition of the M/T Tigani and M/T Tamara. We face risks attendant to changes in economic environments, changes in interest rates, and instability in certain securities markets, among other factors. Major market disruptions and the current adverse changes in market conditions and regulatory climate in the United States and worldwide may adversely affect our business or impair our ability to borrow amounts under our credit facilities or any future financial arrangements. The current market conditions may last longer than we anticipate. These recent and developing economic and governmental factors may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, have caused the price of our common shares to decline and could cause the price of our common shares to decline further. Acts of piracy on ocean-going vessels have recently increased in frequency, which could adversely affect our business. Acts of piracy have historically affected ocean-going vessels trading in regions of the world such as the South China Sea and in the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia. Throughout 2008 the frequency of piracy incidents has increased significantly, particularly in the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia, with drybulk vessels and tankers particularly vulnerable to such attacks. For example, in November 2008, the Sirius Star, a tanker vessel not affiliated with us, was captured by pirates in the Indian Ocean while carrying crude oil estimated to be worth $100 million, and was released in January 2009 upon a ransom payment of $3 million. If these piracy attacks result in regions in which our vessels are deployed being characterized as war risk zones by insurers, as the Gulf of Aden temporarily was in May 2008, or Joint War Committee (JWC) war and strikes listed areas, premiums payable for such coverage could increase significantly and such insurance coverage may be more difficult to obtain. In addition, crew costs, including due to employing onboard security guards, could increase in such circumstances. We may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, any detention hijacking as a result of an act of piracy against our vessels, or an increase in cost, or unavailability, of insurance for our vessels, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to reinstate the payment of dividends. Fuel, or bunker prices, may adversely affect profits. While we generally do not bear the cost of fuel, or bunkers, under our time charters, fuel is a significant factor in negotiating charter rates. As a result, an increase in the price of fuel beyond our expectations may adversely affect our profitability at the time of charter negotiation or when our vessels trade in the spot market. Fuel is also a significant, if not the largest, expense in our shipping operations when vessels are under voyage charter. Increases in the price of fuel may adversely affect our profitability. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by OPEC and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. 9 Table of Contents Further, fuel may become much more expensive in the future, which may reduce the profitability and competitiveness of our business versus other forms of transportation, such as truck or rail. We are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business. Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the form of international conventions and treaties, national, state and local laws and national and international regulations in force in the jurisdictions in which our vessels operate or are registered, which can significantly affect the ownership and operation of our vessels. These requirements include, but are not limited to, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships of 1975, the International Maritime Organization, or IMO, International Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution of 1973, the IMO International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea of 1974, the International Convention on Load Lines of 1966, the U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, the U.S. Clean Air Act, the U.S. Clean Water Act and the U.S. Marine Transportation Security Act of 2002. Compliance with such laws, regulations and standards, where applicable, may require installation of costly equipment or operational changes and may affect the resale value or useful lives of our vessels. We may also incur additional costs in order to comply with other existing and future regulatory obligations, including, but not limited to, costs relating to air emissions, the management of ballast waters, maintenance and inspection, elimination of tin-based paint, development and implementation of emergency procedures and insurance coverage or other financial assurance of our ability to address pollution incidents. These costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. A failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions or the suspension or termination of our operations. Environmental laws often impose strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances, which could subject us to liability without regard to whether we were negligent or at fault. Under OPA, for example, owners, operators and bareboat charterers are jointly and severally strictly liable for the discharge of oil within the 200-mile exclusive economic zone around the United States. An oil spill could result in significant liability, including fines, penalties and criminal liability and remediation costs for natural resource damages under other federal, state and local laws, as well as third-party damages. We are required to satisfy insurance and financial responsibility requirements for potential oil (including marine fuel) spills and other pollution incidents. Although we have arranged insurance to cover certain environmental risks, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be sufficient to cover all such risks or that any claims will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We are subject to international safety regulations and the failure to comply with these regulations may subject us to increased liability, may adversely affect our insurance coverage and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. The operation of our vessels is affected by the requirements set forth in the IMOs International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and Pollution Prevention, or ISM Code. The ISM Code requires shipowners, ship managers and bareboat charterers to develop and maintain an extensive Safety Management System that includes the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for safe operation and describing procedures for dealing with emergencies. The failure of a shipowner or bareboat charterer to comply with the ISM Code may subject it to increased liability, may invalidate existing insurance or decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. As of the date of this annual report, each of our vessels is ISM code-certified. 10 Table of Contents Our vessels may suffer damage due to the inherent operational risks of the seaborne transportation industry and we may experience unexpected drydocking costs, which may adversely affect our business and financial condition. Our vessels and their cargoes will be at risk of being damaged or lost because of events such as marine disasters, bad weather, business interruptions caused by mechanical failures, grounding, fire, explosions and collisions, human error, war, terrorism, piracy and other circumstances or events. These hazards may result in death or injury to persons, loss of revenues or property, environmental damage, higher insurance rates, damage to our customer relationships, delay or rerouting. If our vessels suffer damage, they may need to be repaired at a drydocking facility. The costs of drydock repairs are unpredictable and may be substantial. We may have to pay drydocking costs that our insurance does not cover in full. The loss of earnings while these vessels are being repaired and repositioned, as well as the actual cost of these repairs, would decrease our earnings. In addition, space at drydocking facilities is sometimes limited and not all drydocking facilities are conveniently located. We may be unable to find space at a suitable drydocking facility or our vessels may be forced to travel to a drydocking facility that is not conveniently located to our vessels positions. The loss of earnings while these vessels are forced to wait for space or to steam to more distant drydocking facilities would decrease our earnings. Increased inspection procedures, tighter import and export controls and new security regulations could increase costs and disrupt our business. International shipping is subject to various security and customs inspection and related procedures in countries of origin and destination and trans-shipment points. Inspection procedures can result in the seizure of the cargo and contents of our vessels, delays in the loading, offloading or delivery and the levying of customs duties, fines or other penalties against us. International container shipping is subject to additional security and customs inspection and related procedures in countries of origin, destination and trans-shipment points. Since the events of September 11, 2001, U.S. authorities have increased container inspection rates. Government investment in non-intrusive container scanning technology has grown, and there is interest in electronic monitoring technology, including so-called e-seals and smart containers that would enable remote, centralized monitoring of containers during shipment to identify tampering with or opening of the containers, along with potentially measuring other characteristics such as temperature, air pressure, motion, chemicals, biological agents and radiation. It is unclear what changes, if any, to the existing security procedures will ultimately be proposed or implemented, or how any such changes will affect the container shipping industry. These changes have the potential to impose additional financial and legal obligations on carriers and, in certain cases, to render the shipment of certain types of goods by container uneconomical or impractical. These additional costs could reduce the volume of goods shipped in containers, resulting in a decreased demand for container vessels. In addition, it is unclear what financial costs any new security procedures might create for container vessel owners, or whether companies responsible for the global traffic of containers at sea, referred to as container line operators, may seek to pass on certain of the costs associated with any new security procedures to vessel owners. 11 Table of Contents Maritime claimants could arrest our vessels, which would interrupt our business. Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of our vessels could interrupt our business or require us to pay large sums of funds to have the arrest lifted, which would have a negative effect on our cash flows. In addition, in some jurisdictions, such as South Africa, under the sister ship theory of liability, a claimant may arrest both the vessel which is subject to the claimants maritime lien and any associated vessel, which is any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. Claimants could try to assert sister ship liability against one vessel in our fleet for claims relating to another of our ships. Governments could requisition our vessels during a period of war or emergency, resulting in loss of earnings. A government could requisition for title or seize our vessels. Requisition for title occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and becomes the owner. Also, a government could requisition our vessels for hire. Requisition for hire occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and effectively becomes the charterer at dictated charter rates. Generally, requisitions occur during a period of war or emergency. Government requisition of one or more of our vessels may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay dividends if reinstated in the future. Terrorist attacks and international hostilities can affect the seaborne transportation industry, which could adversely affect our business. We conduct most of our operations outside of the United States, and our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to pay dividends if reinstated in the future may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where our vessels are employed or registered. Moreover, we operate in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political instability, terrorist or other attacks, war or international hostilities. Terrorist attacks such as the attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, the bombings in Spain on March 11, 2004, in London on July 7, 2005 and in Mumbai on November 26, 2008 and the continuing response of the United States and other countries to these attacks, as well as the threat of future terrorist attacks, continue to contribute to world economic instability and uncertainty in global financial markets. Future terrorist attacks could result in increased volatility of the financial markets in the United States and globally and could result in an economic recession in the United States or the world. These uncertainties could also adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. In the past, political conflicts have also resulted in attacks on vessels, such as the attack on the Limburg in October 2002, mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt international shipping, particularly in the Arabian Gulf region. Acts of terrorism and piracy have also affected vessels trading in regions such as the South China Sea. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay dividends if reinstated in the future. 12 Table of Contents Company Specific Risk Factors We may not be able to comply with the collateral maintenance coverage ratio covenants in our credit facilities, which may affect our ability to conduct our business if we are unable to obtain waivers or covenant modifications from our lenders. Our two credit facilities, with Nordea Bank Norge ASA, or Nordea, and DVB Bank SE, or DVB, require us to maintain a minimum ratio of the fair market value of our vessels mortgaged thereunder to our aggregate outstanding balance under each respective credit facility (please see Item 5. Operating Financial Review and Prospects  B. Liquidity and Capital Resources - Long-Term Debt Obligations and Credit Arrangements). The market value of drybulk and tanker vessels is sensitive to, among other things, changes in the drybulk and tanker charter markets, respectively, with vessel values deteriorating in times when drybulk and tanker charter rates, as applicable, are falling and improving when charter rates are anticipated to rise. The current low in charter rates in the drybulk market coupled with the prevailing difficulty in obtaining financing for vessel purchases have adversely affected drybulk vessel values. The recent fall in oil prices has also led to lower tanker charter rates and tanker vessel values. These conditions have led to a significant decline in the fair market values of our vessels since September 30, 2008, particularly our drybulk carriers. On January 9, 2009, we entered into an amendatory agreement to our Nordea credit facility, or the Nordea Amendatory Agreement, which became effective on January 23, 2009. The amendatory agreement waives the breach of the collateral maintenance coverage ratio covenant contained in such credit facility resulting from the decrease in the market value of our vessels and reduces the level of the collateral maintenance coverage ratio to a level between 90% and 125% for the remaining term of the agreement, with such waiver taking effect from the date of prior breach to the effective date of the amendatory agreement. Although we expect to be in compliance with the collateral maintenance coverage ratio covenants under our two credit facilities, in the future we may fall out of compliance if our vessel values experience further declines. If this were to occur, under the terms of our two credit facilities, our lenders could require us to post additional collateral or pay down our indebtedness to a level where we are in compliance with our loan covenants and, if we are unable to post this collateral, make these prepayments or obtain a waiver, our lenders could accelerate our indebtedness, which would impair our ability to continue to conduct our business. In such an event, our auditors may give either an unqualified opinion with an explanatory paragraph relating to the disclosure in the notes to our financial statements as to the substantial doubt of our ability to continue as a going concern, or a qualified, adverse or disclaimer of opinion, which could lead to additional defaults under our loan agreements. If the current low charter rates in the drybulk market and the tanker market and low vessel values continue or decrease further, our ability to comply with various other covenants in our loan agreements may be adversely affected. In such event, we may have to seek additional covenant modifications or waivers. Any default by or the failure of our charterers to honor their obligations to us under our charter agreements would reduce the likelihood that our lenders would be willing to provide waivers or covenant modifications or other accommodations. If our indebtedness is accelerated in full or in part, it would be very difficult in the current financing environment for us to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing and we could lose our vessels if our lenders foreclose their liens. Furthermore, if the current low charter rates in the drybulk market and the tanker market continue or decrease further, we may have to record impairment adjustments to our financial statements (please see Vessel Lives and Impairment on page 59 herein), which would adversely affect our financial results and further hinder our ability to raise capital. If we find it necessary to sell our vessels at a time when vessel prices are low, we will recognize losses and a reduction in our earnings which could affect our ability to raise additional capital necessary to comply with our loan covenants. 13 Table of Contents We depend upon a few significant customers for a large part of our revenues and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely affect our financial performance. We derive a significant part of our revenue from a small number of customers, with 57% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 generated from four charterers. Our fleet is employed under fixed rate period charters or pooling arrangements to nine customers or their affiliates. If one or more of these customers is unable to perform under one or more charters with us and we are not able to find a replacement charter, or if a customer exercises certain rights to terminate the charter, we could suffer a loss of revenues that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could lose a customer or the benefits of a time charter if, among other things:  the customer fails to make charter payments because of its financial inability, disagreements with us or otherwise;  the customer terminates the charter because we fail to deliver the vessel within a fixed period of time, the vessel is lost or damaged beyond repair, there are serious deficiencies in the vessel or prolonged periods of off-hire, or if we are otherwise in default under the charter; or  the customer terminates the charter because the vessel has been subject to seizure for more than a specified number of days. If we lose a key customer, we may be unable to obtain charters on comparable terms or may become subject to the volatile spot market, which is highly competitive and subject to significant price fluctuations. The time charters on which we deploy 12 of the vessels in our fleet provide for charter rates that are significantly above current market rates, particularly spot market rates that most directly reflect the current depressed levels of the drybulk and tanker charter markets. If it were necessary to secure substitute employment, in the spot market or on time charters, for any of these vessels due to the loss of a customer in these market conditions, such employment would be at a significantly lower charter rate than currently generated by such vessel, or we may be unable to secure a charter at all, in either case, resulting in a significant reduction in revenues. For example, we had entered into a time charter for one of our tanker vessels, the M/T Olinda at a rate of $41,025 per day with Industrial Carriers Corp. and on October 11, 2008, the charter was terminated by mutual agreement as a result of the charterers insolvency. We have since deployed the vessel in the Blue Fin Tankers Inc. spot market pool where the vessel generates revenues based on spot market charter rates. The loss of any of our customers, time charters or vessels, or a decline in payments under our charters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future. The failure of our counterparties to meet their obligations under our time charter agreements could cause us to suffer losses or otherwise adversely affect our business. Twelve of our vessels are currently employed under time charters with nine customers or their affiliates, with 57% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 generated from four customers chartering our drybulk carriers. The ability and willingness of each of our counterparties to perform its obligations under a time charter agreement with us will depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions, the condition of the drybulk shipping and tanker industries and the overall financial condition of the counterparty. In addition, in depressed market conditions, there have been reports of charterers renegotiating their charters or defaulting on their obligations under charters and our customers may fail to pay charterhire or attempt to renegotiate charter rates. For example, we agreed to reduce the contracted charter rate for one of our drybulk vessels, the M/V Augusta, from $42,100 per day to $16,000 per day upon its commencement in November 2008. 14 Table of Contents The time charters on which we deploy 12 of the vessels in our fleet provide for charter rates that are above current market rates. Should a counterparty fail to honor its obligations under agreements with us, it may be difficult to secure substitute employment for such vessel, and any new charter arrangements we secure in the spot market or on time charters would be at lower rates given currently decreased charter rate levels, particularly in the drybulk carrier market. For example, we had entered into a time charter for one of our tanker vessels, the M/T Olinda, at a rate of $41,025 per day with Industrial Carriers Corp. and on October 11, 2008, the charter was terminated by mutual agreement as a result of the charterers insolvency. We have since deployed the vessel in the Blue Fin spot market pool where the vessel generates revenues based on spot market charter rates. If our charterers fail to meet their obligations to us or attempt to renegotiate our charter agreements, we could sustain significant losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as our ability to pay dividends, if any, in the future, and comply with covenants in our credit facilities. Our earnings may be adversely affected if we do not successfully employ our vessels. Our strategy is to employ our vessels on fixed rate period charters, three of which expire in 2009. In addition, one of our vessels, the M/T Olinda, is employed in a spot market pool. Current charter rates have sharply declined from historically high levels and the charter market remains volatile. In the past, charter rates for vessels have declined below operating costs of vessels. If our vessels become available for employment in the spot market or under new period charters during periods when charter rates are at depressed levels, we may have to employ our vessels at depressed charter rates which would lead to reduced or volatile earnings. We cannot ensure that future charter rates will be at a level that will enable us to operate our vessels profitably or to reinstate dividend payments or repay our debt. The aging of our fleet may result in increased operating costs in the future, which could adversely affect our earnings. In general, the costs to maintain a vessel in good operating condition increase with the age of the vessel. As of March 19, 2009, our fleet has an average age of 14.1 years. Older vessels are typically less fuel efficient and more costly to maintain than more recently constructed vessels due to improvements in engine technology. Cargo insurance rates increase with the age of a vessel, making older vessels less desirable to charterers. Governmental regulations, safety or other equipment standards related to the age of vessels may require expenditures for alterations or the addition of new equipment to our vessels and may restrict the type of activities in which our vessels may engage. We cannot ensure that, as our vessels age, market conditions will justify those expenditures or enable us to operate our vessels profitably during the remainder of their useful lives. The derivative contracts we have entered into to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates could result in higher than market interest rates and charges against our income. We have entered into two interest rate swaps for purposes of managing our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates applicable to indebtedness under our Nordea credit facility which was advanced at a floating rate based on LIBOR. Our hedging strategies, however, may not be effective and we may incur substantial losses if interest rates move materially differently from our expectations. Since our existing interest rate swaps do not, and future derivative contracts may not, qualify for treatment as hedges for accounting purposes we recognize fluctuations in the fair value of such contracts in our income statement. In addition, our financial condition could be materially adversely affected to the extent we do not hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations under our financing arrangements, including under our new DVB credit facility, under which loans have been advanced at a floating rate based on LIBOR and for which we have not entered into an interest rate swap or other hedging arrangement. 15 Table of Contents Any hedging activities we engage in may not effectively manage our interest rate exposure or have the desired impact on our financial conditions or results of operations. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of our interest rate swaps was an unrealized loss of $16.1 million. Due to the decline in interest rates since December 31, 2008, the fair value of our interest rate swaps at March 18, 2009, which is the most recent date for which the Company has received a fair value estimate, amounted to an unrealized loss of approximately $15 million. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008. Investors may experience significant dilution as a result of the offering pursuant to our Standby Equity Purchase Agreement, or SEPA, and future offerings. On January 30, 2009, we entered into the SEPA, which is described under Note 14(d) to our consolidated financial statements. Pursuant to the SEPA, we may offer and sell such number of common shares equal to $147,885,850. As of March 19, 2009, we have issued and sold an aggregate of 3.15 million common shares resulting in net proceeds of $6.2 million. If we sell the remaining dollar amount of our common shares offered pursuant to the SEPA, at an average price equal to $1.39, which was the last reported closing sale price for our common shares on The Nasdaq Global Market on March 19, 2009, we would have approximately 124 million common shares outstanding, which would represent an increase of 566% in our issued and outstanding common shares from December 31, 2008; according to our articles of incorporation the Companys authorized share capital is 95 million common shares, and therefore our shareholders would need to authorize an increase in our authorized share capital before we could issue any shares in excess of 95 million common shares. As our loan agreements contain provisions providing that a change-of-control will be deemed to have occurred if a person or entity, that was not a beneficial owner of our capital stock at the respective times of our entry into such agreements, becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 20% of the voting or ownership interest in our company, such issuances of common shares could result in a change of control constituting an event of default under these loan agreements that entitles our lenders to declare all of our indebtedness thereunder immediately due and payable. Because the sales pursuant to the SEPA and related prospectus supplements will be made at market prices or prices related to such market prices, the prices at which we sell these shares will vary and these variations may be significant. Purchasers of the shares we sell, as well as our existing shareholders, will experience significant dilution if we sell shares at prices significantly below the price at which they invested. In addition, we may have to attempt to sell additional shares in the future in order to satisfy our capital needs; however there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. Lenders may be unwilling to provide future financing or will provide future financing at significantly increased rates. If we are able to sell shares in the future, the prices at which we sell these future shares will vary, and these variations may be significant. Our existing shareholders will experience significant dilution if we sell these future shares at prices significantly below the price at which previous shareholders invested. Our Board of Directors has determined to suspend the payment of cash dividends as a result of market conditions in the international shipping industry, and until such market conditions significantly improve, it is unlikely that we will reinstate the payment of dividends and if reinstated, it is likely that any dividend payments would be at reduced levels. We previously paid regular cash dividends on a quarterly basis from our operating surplus, in amounts substantially equal to our available cash from operations in the previous quarter, less any cash reserves for drydockings and working capital, as determined by our Board of Directors. 16 Table of Contents Our Board of Directors has determined to suspend the payment of cash dividends as a result of market conditions in the international shipping industry and in particular the sharp decline in charter rates and vessel values in the drybulk sector. Until such market conditions significantly improve, it is unlikely that we will reinstate the payment of dividends and if reinstated, it is likely that any dividend payments would be at reduced levels. Furthermore, the amendatory agreement to our Nordea credit facility, which matures in October 2015, prohibits us from paying dividends. In addition, in the event that we are permitted to pay cash dividends under our Nordea credit facility, our DVB loan agreement contains additional restrictions. Specifically, we will be required to obtain our lenders consent for dividend payments in excess of 50% of our quarterly net profit. Accordingly, pursuant to the restrictions on dividend payments contained in our DVB credit facility, had it been in effect when we declared our dividend of $0.77 per share in respect of the third quarter of 2008, we would have been required to obtain the consent of our lender thereunder in order to pay a dividend above $0.31 per share, or reduce our dividend by 60.0%, on a per share basis, to $0.31 per share. As a result of deteriorating market conditions and restrictions imposed by our lenders, we will not reinstate the payment of dividends until our Nordea credit facility matures in October 2015 or the prohibition on our payment of dividends is removed from our amended Nordea credit facility agreement. If reinstated, it is likely that any dividend payments would be at reduced levels. The market price of our common shares has fluctuated widely and the market price of our common shares may fluctuate in the future. The market price of our common shares has fluctuated widely since our initial public offering in April 2007 and may continue to do so as a result of many factors, including our actual results of operations and perceived prospects, the prospects of our competition and of the shipping industry in general and in particular the drybulk and tanker sectors, differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts, changes in analysts recommendations or projections, changes in general valuations for companies in the shipping industry, particularly the drybulk and tanker sectors, changes in general economic or market conditions and broad market fluctuations. The market price of our common shares has recently dropped below $5.00 per share, and the last reported sale price on The Nasdaq Global Market on March 19, 2009 was $1.39 per share. If the market price of our common shares remains below $5.00 per share, under stock exchange rules, our shareholders will not be able to use such shares as collateral for borrowing in margin accounts. This inability to continue to use our common shares as collateral may lead to sales of such shares creating downward pressure on and increased volatility in the market price of our common shares. In addition, under the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market, listed companies have historically been required to maintain a share price of at least $1.00 per share and if the share price declines below $1.00 for a period of 30 consecutive business days, then the listed company would have a cure period of at least 180 days to regain compliance with the $1.00 per share minimum. In light of recently deteriorating market conditions, under a rule change recently approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Nasdaq Stock Market has temporarily suspended the minimum share price requirement through April 19, 2009. Following the expiration of the suspension, in the event that our share price declines below $1.00 for a period of 30 consecutive business days, we may be required to take action, such as a reverse stock split, in order to comply with Nasdaq rules that may be in effect at the time. 17 Table of Contents Future sales of shares by our major shareholder could cause the market price of our common shares to decline. On September 3, 2008, we filed a resale shelf registration statement on Form F-3, as amended on October 30, 2008, to register under the Securities Act 2,085,150 common shares on behalf of the selling shareholders Basset Holdings Inc., Steel Wheel Investments Limited, and Seabert Shipping Co. This resale shelf registration statement has not yet been declared effective. Basset Holdings Inc. and Steel Wheel Investments Limited are owned and controlled by Mr. Antonis Kandylidis, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer. Seabert Shipping Co. is controlled by Mr. Michael Gregos, our former Chief Operating Officer. Companies controlled by Mr. Antonis Kandylidis beneficially own, in the aggregate, 2,080,000 common shares, which represents approximately 9.6% of our outstanding common shares as of March 19, 2009. These common shares may be sold in registered transactions and may also be resold subject to the holding period, volume, manner of sale and notice requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Sales or the possibility of sales of substantial amounts of our common shares by these shareholders in the public markets could adversely affect the market price of our common shares. Under our loan agreements, the failure of our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Antonis Kandylidis, to maintain his existing beneficial ownership in our company would violate an affirmative covenant. See Item 5. Operating Financial Review and Prospects  B. Liquidity and Capital Resources  Long-Term Debt Obligations and Credit Arrangements for a summary of our loan agreement covenants. Obligations associated with being a public company require significant company resources and management attention. We completed our initial public offering in April 2007 and are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and the other rules and regulations of the SEC, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. We will continue to need to dedicate a significant amount of time and resources to ensure compliance with these regulatory requirements. We will continue to work with our legal, accounting and financial advisors to identify any areas in which changes should be made to our financial and management control systems to manage our growth and our obligations as a public company. We will evaluate areas such as corporate governance, corporate control, internal audit, disclosure controls and procedures as well as financial reporting and accounting systems. We will make changes in any of these and other areas, including our internal control over financial reporting, which we believe are necessary. However, these and other measures we may take may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely and reliable basis. In addition, compliance with reporting and other requirements applicable to public companies will create additional costs for us and will require the time and attention of management. Our limited management resources may exacerbate the difficulties in complying with these reporting and other requirements while focusing on executing our business strategy. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur, the timing of such costs or the degree of impact that our managements attention to these matters will have on our business. We intend to expand our operations into other sectors and own and operate a diversified fleet of vessels which will expose us to a greater number of risks. Our fleet is comprised of nine secondhand drybulk carriers that mainly transport iron ore, coal, grains and minerals, fertilizers and four secondhand tanker vessels that transport crude oil. We intend to grow our fleet and expand our operations into other sectors. Operating a diversified fleet of vessels as opposed to a fleet concentrated in one sector of the seaborne transportation industry requires expertise in multiple sectors and the ability to avoid a greater variety of vessel management risks in order to maintain effective operations. 18 Table of Contents We have selected fleet managers for vessels operating in a certain sector based on the expertise of the particular fleet manager in managing vessels in that sector. Wallem Ship Management Ltd., or Wallem, provides technical vessel management services to us for our eight Panamax drybulk carriers. Cardiff Marine Inc., or Cardiff, effective January 8, 2009, provides commercial vessel management services to us for these eight Panamax drybulk carriers. Cardiff additionally provides both commercial and technical vessel management services to us for our Capesize drybulk carrier and our four tanker vessels. We refer to Cardiff and Wallem collectively as our Fleet Managers. We cannot ensure that we or our Fleet Managers will have the requisite expertise to address the greater variety of vessel management risks to which we expect to be exposed as we expand into other sectors. We are entirely dependent on our Fleet Managers to perform the day-to-day management of our fleet. Our executive management team consists of our Chief Executive Officer/Interim Chief Financial Officer, our Vice President  Business Development and our Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer. As we subcontract the day-to-day vessel management of our fleet, including crewing, maintenance and repair to our Fleet Managers, we are dependent on our Fleet Managers and the loss of any of our Fleet Managers services or failure to perform obligations to us could materially and adversely affect the results of our operations. Although we may have rights against a Fleet Manager if it defaults on its obligations to us, you will have no recourse directly against a Fleet Manager. Further, we expect that we will need to seek approval from our lenders to change a Fleet Manager. If a Fleet Manager suffers material damage to its reputation or relationships it may harm our ability to:  continue to operate our vessels and service our customers;  renew existing charters upon their expiration;  obtain new charters;  obtain financing on commercially acceptable terms;  obtain insurance on commercially acceptable terms;  maintain satisfactory relationships with our customers and suppliers; and  successfully execute our growth strategy. Our Fleet Managers are privately held companies and there may be limited or no publicly available information about them. Our Fleet Managers, Cardiff Marine Inc. and Wallem Shipmanagement Ltd. are privately held companies. The ability of our Fleet Managers to continue providing services for our benefit will depend in part on their own financial strength. Circumstances beyond our control could impair one or more of our Fleet Managers financial strength, and there may be limited publicly available information about their financial strength. As a result, an investor in our common shares might have little advance warning of problems affecting our Fleet Managers, even though these problems could have a material adverse effect on us. 19 Table of Contents Our Fleet Managers may have conflicts of interest between us and other clients of our Fleet Managers. We have subcontracted the day-to-day technical and commercial management of our fleet, including crewing, maintenance, supply provisioning and repair to our Fleet Managers. Our contracts with our Fleet Managers have an initial term of one year which will automatically extend for successive one year terms, unless, in each case, at least two months advance notice of termination is given by either party. Our Fleet Managers will be providing similar services for vessels owned by other shipping companies including companies with which they are affiliated. These responsibilities and relationships could create conflicts of interest between our Fleet Managers performance of their obligations to us, on the one hand, and our Fleet Managers performance of their obligations to their other clients on the other hand. These conflicts may arise in connection with the crewing, supply provisioning and operations of the vessels in our fleet versus vessels owned by other clients of our Fleet Managers. In particular, our Fleet Managers may give preferential treatment to vessels owned by other clients whose arrangements provide for greater economic benefit to our Fleet Managers. These conflicts of interest may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Companies affiliated with Cardiff own and will acquire vessels that compete with our fleet. We entered into agreements with Cardiff to provide us with certain services. Cardiff is owned by a company controlled by Mrs. Chryssoula Kandylidis, who is the wife of one of our directors, Konstandinos Kandylidis, and is the mother of our Chief Executive Officer/Interim Chief Financial Officer, Antonis Kandylidis, and by the Entrepreneurial Spirit Foundation, or the Foundation, which is controlled by Mr. George Economou. Mrs. Chryssoula Kandylidis is the sister of Mr. Economou. Cardiff currently manages 38 drybulk carriers for DryShips Inc. and also manages 18 tankers and 16 drybulk carriers and supervises the construction of 13 crude oil tankers, and 20 drybulk carriers with scheduled delivery dates between 2009 and 2011 on behalf of companies controlled by members of the Economou family and the construction of four ultra deep water drilling rigs. Moreover, Mr. Economou, members of his family and companies affiliated with Cardiff own and will acquire additional vessels in the future. These vessels could be in competition with our fleet. Cardiff may be faced with conflicts of interest with respect to its interests and its obligations to us. We may be unable to effectively manage our growth. We intend to continue to grow our fleet. Our growth will depend on:  locating and acquiring suitable vessels;  identifying and consummating acquisitions or joint ventures;  obtaining required financing;  integrating any acquired business successfully with our existing operations;  enlarging our customer base;  hiring additional shore-based employees and seafarers; and  managing our expansion. We intend to finance our growth with the net proceeds of future debt and equity offerings. Growing any business by acquisition presents numerous risks such as undisclosed liabilities and obligations, difficulty in obtaining additional qualified personnel and managing relationships 20 Table of Contents with customers and suppliers and integrating newly acquired operations into existing infrastructures. The expansion of our fleet may impose significant additional responsibilities on our management and staff, and the management and staff of our Fleet Managers, and may necessitate that we, and they, increase the number of personnel. We cannot give any assurance that we will be successful in executing our growth plans or that we will not incur significant expenses and losses in connection therewith. If our Fleet Managers are unable to recruit suitable seafarers for our fleet or as we expand our fleet, our results of operations may be adversely affected. We rely on our Fleet Managers to recruit suitable senior officers and crews for our fleet. In addition, as we expand our fleet, we will have to rely on our Fleet Managers to recruit suitable additional seafarers. We cannot ensure that our Fleet Managers will be able to continue to hire suitable employees as we expand our fleet. If our Fleet Managers crewing agents encounter business or financial difficulties, they may not be able to adequately staff our vessels. The seafarers who are employed on the ships in our fleet are covered by industry-wide collective bargaining agreements that set basic standards. We cannot ensure that these agreements will prevent labor interruptions. If our Fleet Managers are unable to recruit suitable seafarers as we expand our fleet, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends if reinstated in the future may be materially adversely affected. The operation of drybulk carriers and tankers each involve certain unique operational risks. The operation of drybulk carriers has certain unique operational risks. With a drybulk carrier, the cargo itself and its interaction with the ship can be a risk factor. By their nature, drybulk cargoes are often heavy, dense, easily shifted, and react badly to water exposure. In addition, drybulk carriers are often subjected to battering treatment during unloading operations with grabs, jackhammers (to pry encrusted cargoes out of the hold), and small bulldozers. This treatment may cause damage to the drybulk carrier. Drybulk carriers damaged due to treatment during unloading procedures may be more susceptible to a breach to the sea. Hull breaches in drybulk carriers may lead to the flooding of their holds. If a drybulk carrier suffers flooding in its forward holds, the bulk cargo may become so dense and waterlogged that its pressure may buckle the drybulk carriers bulkheads leading to the loss of the drybulk carrier. The operation of tankers has unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil. An oil spill may cause significant environmental damage, and a catastrophic spill could exceed the insurance coverage available. Compared to other types of vessels, tankers are exposed to a higher risk of damage and loss by fire, whether ignited by a terrorist attack, collision, or other cause, due to the high flammability and high volume of the oil transported in tankers. If we are unable to adequately maintain or safeguard our vessels we may be unable to prevent these events. Any of these circumstances or events could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay dividends if reinstated in the future. In addition, the loss of any of our vessels could harm our reputation as a safe and reliable vessel owner and operator. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover our losses that may result from our operations due to the inherent operational risks of the seaborne transportation industry. We carry insurance to protect us against most of the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of our business, including marine hull and machinery insurance, protection and indemnity insurance, which includes pollution risks, crew insurance and war risk insurance. However, we may not be adequately insured to cover losses from our operational risks, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Additionally, our insurers may refuse to pay particular claims and our insurance may be voidable by the insurers if we take, or fail to take, certain action, such as 21 Table of Contents failing to maintain certification of our vessels with applicable maritime regulatory organizations. Any significant uninsured or under-insured loss or liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends if reinstated in the future. In addition, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates in the future during adverse insurance market conditions. As a result of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. response to the attacks and related concern regarding terrorism, insurers have increased premiums and reduced or restricted coverage for losses caused by terrorist acts generally. Accordingly, premiums payable for terrorist coverage have increased substantially and the level of terrorist coverage has been significantly reduced. In addition, we may not carry loss-of-hire insurance, which covers the loss of revenue during extended vessel off-hire periods, such as those that occur during an unscheduled drydocking due to damage to the vessel from accidents. Accordingly, any loss of a vessel or extended vessel off-hire, due to an accident or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends if reinstated in the future. We may be subject to calls because we obtain some of our insurance through protection and indemnity associations. We may be subject to increased premium payments, or calls, in amounts based on our claim records and the claim records of our fleet managers as well as the claim records of other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which we receive insurance coverage for tort liability, including pollution-related liability. In addition, our protection and indemnity associations may not have enough resources to cover claims made against them. Our payment of these calls could result in significant expense to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to pay dividends if reinstated in the future. Labor interruptions could disrupt our business. Our vessels are manned by masters, officers and crews that are employed by our shipowning subsidiaries. If not resolved in a timely and cost-effective manner, industrial action or other labor unrest could prevent or hinder our operations from being carried out normally and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to pay dividends if reinstated in the future. In the highly competitive international shipping industry, we may not be able to compete for charters with new entrants or established companies with greater resources. We employ our vessels in a highly competitive market that is capital intensive and highly fragmented. Competition arises primarily from other vessel owners, some of whom have substantially greater resources than we do. Competition for the transportation of drybulk cargo by sea is intense and depends on price, location, size, age, condition and the acceptability of the vessel and its operators to the charterers. Due in part to the highly fragmented market, competitors with greater resources could enter the drybulk shipping industry and operate larger fleets through consolidations or acquisitions and may be able to offer lower charter rates and higher quality vessels than we are able to offer. 22 Table of Contents We may be unable to attract and retain key senior management personnel and other employees in the seaborne transportation industry, which may negatively affect the effectiveness of our management and our results of operations. Our success depends upon our ability to hire and retain key members of our senior management team. The loss of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business prospects and financial condition. Difficulty in hiring and retaining personnel could adversely affect our business, results of operations and ability to pay dividends if reinstated in the future. We do not intend to maintain key man life insurance on any of our officers. Purchasing and operating previously owned, or secondhand, vessels may result in increased drydocking costs and vessels off-hire, which could adversely affect our earnings. Even following a physical inspection of secondhand vessels prior to purchase, we do not have the same knowledge about their condition and cost of any required (or anticipated) repairs that we would have had if these vessels had been built for and operated exclusively by us. Accordingly, we may not discover defects or other problems with such vessels prior to purchase. Defects or problems discovered after purchase may be expensive to repair, and if not detected, may result in accidents or other incidents for which we may become liable to third parties. Generally, we do not receive the benefit of warranties on secondhand vessels. Increased drydocking costs or vessels off-hire may adversely affect our earnings. Unless we set aside reserves or are able to borrow funds for vessel replacement, at the end of a vessels useful life our revenue will decline, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Unless we maintain reserves or are able to borrow or raise funds for vessel replacement we will be unable to replace the vessels in our fleet upon the expiration of their remaining useful lives, which we expect to range from 25 years to 30 years, depending on the type of vessel. Our cash flows and income are dependent on the revenues earned by the chartering of our vessels to customers. If we are unable to replace the vessels in our fleet upon the expiration of their useful lives, our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends will be materially and adversely affected. Any reserves set aside for vessel replacement may not be available for dividends if reinstated in the future. We cannot ensure that we will be able to borrow amounts under our senior secured credit facilities and restrictive covenants in our senior secured credit facilities may impose financial and other restrictions on us. Our senior credit facilities, as amended, impose operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions may limit our ability to, among other things:  incur additional indebtedness, including through the issuance of guarantees;  create or permit liens on our assets;  sell our vessels or the capital stock of our subsidiaries;  make investments;  change the flag or classification society of our vessels; 23 Table of Contents  reinstate the payment of dividends (as described under Item 5  Operating Financial Review and Prospects-B, Liquidity and Capital Resources);  make capital expenditures;  compete effectively to the extent our competitors are subject to less onerous financial restrictions; and  change the management of our vessels or terminate or materially amend the management agreement relating to each vessel. These restrictions could limit our ability to finance our operations or capital needs, make acquisitions or pursue available business opportunities. In addition, as discussed above, our credit facilities require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial covenants. We expect to be able to comply with all of these specified financial ratios and financial covenants. However, should our charter rates or vessel values further decline in the future due to any of the reasons discussed in the industry specific risk factors set forth above or otherwise, we may be required to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives to meet these ratios and satisfy these covenants. Events beyond our control, including changes in the economic and business conditions in the shipping markets in which we operate, may affect our ability to comply with these covenants. We cannot ensure that we will meet these ratios or satisfy these covenants or that our lenders will waive any failure to do so. A breach of any of the covenants in, or our inability to maintain the required financial ratios under, our senior secured credit facilities would prevent us from borrowing additional money under our credit facility agreements and could result in a default under these agreements. If a default occurs under our credit facility agreements, the lenders could elect to declare the outstanding debt, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and proceed against the collateral securing that debt, which could constitute all or substantially all of our assets. Therefore, our discretion is limited because we may need to obtain consent from our lenders in order to engage in certain corporate actions. Our lenders interests may be different from ours, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain our lenders consent when needed. This may prevent us from taking actions that are in our best interest. Our ability to obtain additional debt financing may be dependent on the performance of our then existing charters and the creditworthiness of our charterers. The actual or perceived credit quality of our charterers, and any defaults by them, may materially affect our ability to obtain the additional capital resources required to purchase additional vessels or may significantly increase our costs of obtaining such capital. Our inability to obtain additional financing at anticipated costs or at all may materially affect our results of operation and our ability to implement our business strategy. We cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any indebtedness incurred under our credit facilities. We have partially financed the acquisition of our vessels with secured indebtedness drawn under our credit facilities. We cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance amounts drawn under our credit facilities at an interest rate or on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. If we are not able to refinance these amounts with the net proceeds of debt and equity offerings at an interest rate or on terms acceptable to us or at all, we will have to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to pay the principal and interest of this indebtedness. If we are not able to satisfy these obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans. 24 Table of Contents The actual or perceived credit quality of our charterers, any defaults by them, and the market value of our fleet, among other things, may materially affect our ability to obtain alternative financing. In addition, debt service payments under our credit facilities or alternative financing may limit funds otherwise available for working capital, capital expenditures, the payment of dividends and other purposes. If we are unable to meet our debt obligations, or if we otherwise default under our credit facilities or an alternative financing arrangement, our lenders could declare the debt, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable and foreclose on our fleet, which could result in the acceleration of other indebtedness that we may have at such time and the commencement of similar foreclosure proceedings by other lenders. We may be subject to tax on United States source income, which would reduce our earnings. Under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or the Code, 50% of the gross shipping income of a vessel owning or chartering corporation, such as ourselves and our subsidiaries, that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not begin and end, in the United States is characterized as United States source shipping income and as such is subject to a four percent United States federal income tax without allowance for deduction, unless that corporation qualifies for exemption from tax under Section 883 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated hereunder. We expect that we and each of our subsidiaries will qualify for this statutory tax exemption and we intend to take this position for United States federal income tax return reporting purposes for the 2008 taxable year. However, there are factual circumstances beyond our control that could cause us to lose the benefit of this tax exemption and thereby become subject to United States federal income tax on our United States source income. For example, if 5% shareholders owned 50% or more of our outstanding common shares for more than half the days of a taxable year, then we would not be eligible for this statutory tax exemption unless we were able to establish that among our 5% shareholders, there are sufficient 5% shareholders that are qualified shareholders for purposes of Section 883 to preclude non-qualified 5% shareholders from owning 50% or more of our common shares for more than half the number of days during the taxable year. In order to establish this, 5% shareholders would have to provide us with certain information in order to substantiate their identity as qualified shareholders. Due to the factual nature of the issues involved, we can give no assurances on our tax-exempt status or that of any of our subsidiaries in the future. If we or our subsidiaries are not entitled to this exemption under Section 883 for any taxable year, we or our subsidiaries would be subject for those years to a four percent United States federal income tax on our U.S. source shipping income. The imposition of this taxation could have a negative effect on our business and would result in decreased earnings available for distribution to our shareholders. U.S. tax authorities could treat us as a passive foreign investment company, which could have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders. A foreign corporation will be treated as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes if either (1) at least 75% of its gross income for any taxable year consists of certain types of passive income or (2) at least 50% of the average value of the corporations assets produce or are held for the production of those types of passive income. For purposes of these tests, cash is treated as an asset that produces passive income and passive income includes dividends, interest, and gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties which are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business. For purposes of these tests, income derived from the performance of services does not constitute passive income. U.S. shareholders of a PFIC may be subject to a disadvantageous U.S. federal income tax regime with respect to the income derived by the PFIC, the distributions they receive from the PFIC and the gain, if any, they derive from the sale or other disposition of their shares in the PFIC. 25 Table of Contents There is a risk that we may be treated as a PFIC for the 2006 taxable year. Although we intend to take the position that we were not a PFIC during the 2006 taxable year pursuant to a special start-up exception, there is little guidance regarding the application of this exception. Therefore, there is a risk that the IRS or a court may disagree with our position and treat us as a PFIC for the 2006 taxable year. If we are treated as a PFIC for the 2006 taxable year, any dividends paid on our common shares during 2007 to a U.S. shareholder that is an individual, trust or estate will be taxable as ordinary income rather than as qualified dividend income. However, even if we were to be treated as a PFIC for the 2006 taxable year, a U.S. shareholder who acquired shares after 2006 will not be subject to the passive foreign investment company rules discussed below. Please read Tax ConsiderationsUnited States Federal Income Taxation of U.S. HoldersTax Treatment of Common Stock  Passive Foreign Investment Company Status and Significant Tax Consequences for a more comprehensive discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. shareholders if we are treated as a PFIC for the 2006 taxable year. We do not believe that we were a PFIC during the 2007 or 2008 taxable years or that we will be a PFIC with respect to any taxable year after the 2008 taxable year. In this regard, we intend to treat the gross income we derive or are deemed to derive from our time chartering activities as services income, rather than rental income. Accordingly, we believe that our income from our time chartering activities does not constitute passive income, and the assets that we own and operate in connection with the production of that income do not constitute passive assets. There is, however, no direct legal authority under the PFIC rules addressing our proposed method of operation. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or a court of law will accept our position, and there is a risk that the IRS or a court of law could determine that we are a PFIC. Moreover, no assurance can be given that we would not constitute a PFIC for any future taxable year if there were to be changes in the nature and extent of our operations. If the IRS were to find that we are or have been a PFIC for any taxable year beginning with the 2007 or 2008 taxable year, our U.S. shareholders will face adverse U.S. tax consequences. Under the PFIC rules, unless those shareholders make an election available under the Code (which election could itself have adverse consequences for such shareholders), such shareholders would be liable to pay U.S. federal income tax at the then highest income tax rates on ordinary income plus interest upon excess distributions and upon any gain from the disposition of our common shares, as if the excess distribution or gain had been recognized ratably over the shareholders holding period of our common shares. Please read Tax ConsiderationsUnited States Federal Income Taxation of U.S. HoldersTax Treatment of Common Stock  Passive Foreign Investment Company Status and Significant Tax Consequences for a more comprehensive discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. shareholders if we are treated as a PFIC. Because we generate all of our revenues in dollars but incur a significant portion of our expenses in other currencies, exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We generate all of our revenues in dollars but we incur a portion of our expenses in currencies other than the dollar. This difference could lead to fluctuations in net income due to changes in the value of the dollar relative to the other currencies, in particular the Euro. Expenses incurred in foreign currencies against which the dollar falls in value can increase, decreasing our revenues. Further declines in the value of the dollar could lead to higher expenses payable by us. 26 Table of Contents We are a holding company, and we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us in order to satisfy our financial obligations. We are a holding company and our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own all of our operating assets. We have no significant assets other than the equity interests in our subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to satisfy our financial obligations depends on our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to us. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, we may not be able to satisfy our financial obligations. There is no guarantee that there will continue to be an active and liquid public market for shareholders to resell our common stock in the future. The price of our common stock may be volatile and may fluctuate due to factors such as:  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results and those of other public  companies in our industry;  mergers and strategic alliances in the shipping industry;  market conditions in segments of the shipping industry in which we operate;  changes in government regulation;  shortfalls in our operating results from levels forecast by securities analysts;  announcements concerning us or our competitors; and  the general state of the securities market. The drybulk and tanker industries have been highly unpredictable and volatile. The market for our common stock may be equally volatile. We are incorporated in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which does not have a well-developed body of corporate law and as a result, shareholders may have fewer rights and protections under Marshall Islands law than under a typical jurisdiction in the United States. Our corporate affairs are governed by our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and by-laws and by the Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act, or BCA. The provisions of the BCA resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the United States. However, there have been few judicial cases in the Republic of the Marshall Islands interpreting the BCA. The rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under the law of the Republic of the Marshall Islands are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain United States jurisdictions. Shareholder rights may differ as well. While the BCA does specifically incorporate the non-statutory law, or judicial case law, of the State of Delaware and other states with substantially similar legislative provisions, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions by the management, directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a United States jurisdiction. 27 Table of Contents It may not be possible for investors to enforce U.S. judgments against us. We and all of our subsidiaries are incorporated in jurisdictions outside the U.S. and substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries are located outside the U.S. In addition, most of our directors and officers are non-residents of the U.S., and all or a substantial portion of the assets of these non-residents are located outside the U.S. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for U.S. investors to serve process within the U.S. upon us, our subsidiaries or our directors and officers or to enforce a judgment against us for civil liabilities in U.S. courts. In addition, you should not assume that courts in the countries in which we or our subsidiaries are incorporated or where our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries are located (1) would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against us or our subsidiaries based upon the civil liability provisions of applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws or (2) would enforce, in original actions, liabilities against us or our subsidiaries based on those laws.
