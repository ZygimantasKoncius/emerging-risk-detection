Item 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully consider these risk factors in addition to our financial statements and notes to such financial statements. In addition to the following risks, there may also be risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial that may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected. We are highly dependent on our revenues from AlloDerm. If we are unable to maintain, increase or replace our AlloDerm revenues, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, revenues from the distribution of AlloDerm represented approximately 88%, 85% and 79%, respectively, of our product revenues. Surgeons will not use our products unless they determine that the clinical benefits to the patient are greater than those available from competing products or therapies. Even if the advantage of our products is established as clinically significant, surgeons may not elect to use such products for any number of reasons. Consequently, surgeons, health care payers and patients may not accept our current products or products under development. Broad market acceptance of our products may require the training of numerous surgeons and clinicians, as well as conducting or sponsoring clinical studies to demonstrate the benefits of such products. The amount of time required to complete such training and studies could result in a delay or dampening of such market acceptance. If we are unable to maintain or increase our revenues from the distribution of our AlloDerm products, our financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, if we were unable to replace such revenue from existing or new products, the market price of our stock could be negatively affected. Failure to comply with government regulations applicable to our products could adversely affect the marketing of such products and therefore our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Once our products are on the market, they are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA. We are subject to inspection at any time by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with any applicable regulatory requirements could result in civil and criminal enforcement actions, as well as fines and other penalties. Moreover, the FDA has the authority to detain, recall or destroy our products and order us to cease manufacturing and distribution if we fail to comply with these requirements. A few, but increasing number of states including Florida, California, Illinois, New York and Maryland, impose their own regulatory requirements on transplanted human tissue. Our financial condition and results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by a finding of noncompliance with governmental regulations and the imposition of fines or penalties, recalls or any disruption in our ability to market our current products. FDA could disagree with our conclusion that AlloDerm, GraftJacket and Repliform products satisfy the FDA’s requirements for regulation solely as human tissue. If FDA were to impose medical device or biologic regulation on one or more of these products, it would adversely affect their marketing and therefore our financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. We believe that our AlloDerm, GraftJacket and Repliform products satisfy the FDA’s requirements to be considered HCT/P’s eligible for regulation solely as human tissue, and therefore, we have not obtained prior FDA clearance or approval for commercial distribution of these products. If FDA were to disagree with our determination as to any of these products, or were to prospectively alter the requirements for HCT/P eligibility, the agency could prohibit the marketing of these products until we met stringent medical device or biologic premarket clearance or approval requirements, which could include obtaining extensive supporting clinical data. In that event, our financial condition and results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We may not be able to obtain required premarket clearance or approval of our products for new intended uses, resulting in an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 8 Table of Contents Our determination that AlloDerm, GraftJacket and Repliform products are eligible for regulation as HCT/P’s is limited to their current intended uses. In the future, we may wish to market AlloDerm, GraftJacket and Repliform for new intended uses. Based on such new uses, our products may also be regulated as medical devices or biologics, requiring premarket clearance or approval and adherence to the FDA’s medical device or biologic regulations. Additionally, the FDA could prohibit distribution of our existing products for new uses until clearance or approval is obtained. We do not know if clearance or approval for new uses of existing products, or new products could be obtained in a timely fashion, or at all. Such clearance or approval process could include a requirement to provide extensive supporting clinical data. Even if a device receives 510(k) clearance, such as Strattice, any modification we wish to make that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device will require a new 510(k) submission or, possibly, a PMA application. The FDA could prohibit distribution of the modified product until clearance or approval is obtained. We do not know if clearance or approval could be obtained in a timely fashion, or at all. Such clearance or approval process could include a requirement to provide extensive supporting clinical data. Our financial condition and results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by a change in the regulatory classification of our products resulting in a disruption in our ability to market such products and the expense associated with providing extensive clinical data, if required by the FDA. The National Organ Transplant Act (“NOTA”) could be interpreted in a way that could reduce our revenues and income in the future. Procurement of certain human organs and tissue for transplantation is subject to the restrictions of NOTA, which prohibits the acquisition of certain human organs, including skin and related tissue for valuable consideration, but permits the reasonable payment of costs associated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control and storage of human tissue, including skin. We reimburse tissue banks for expenses incurred that are associated with the recovery and transportation of donated cadaveric human skin that we process and distribute. In addition to amounts paid to tissue banks to reimburse them for their expenses associated with the procurement and transportation of human skin, we include in our pricing structure certain costs associated with: · tissue processing; · tissue preservation; · quality control and storage of the tissue; and · marketing and medical education expenses. NOTA payment allowances may be interpreted to limit the amount of costs and expenses that we may recover in our pricing for our products, thereby negatively impacting our future revenues and profitability. If we are found to have violated NOTA’s prohibition on the sale of human tissue, we also are potentially subject to criminal enforcement sanctions which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Certain of our products contain donated human cadaveric tissue and therefore have the potential for disease transmission which may result in patient claims. AlloDerm, GraftJacket, AlloCraft DBM and Repliform contain donated human cadaveric tissue. The implantation of tissue products derived from donated cadaveric tissue creates the potential for transmission of communicable disease. Although we comply with Federal and state regulations and voluntary AATB guidelines intended to prevent communicable disease transmission, and our tissue suppliers are also required to comply with such regulations, there can be no assurance that: · our tissue suppliers will comply with such regulations intended to prevent communicable disease transmission; · even if such compliance is achieved, that our products have not been or will not be associated with transmission of disease; or · a patient otherwise infected with disease would not erroneously assert a claim that the use of our products resulted in disease transmission. Any actual or alleged transmission of communicable disease could result in patient claims, litigation, distraction of management’s attention and potentially increased expenses. As a result, such actions or claims could potentially harm our reputation with our customers and disrupt our ability to market our products, which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and the market price of our stock. 9 Table of Contents We are exposed to product liability claims for which our product liability insurance may be inadequate and therefore could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Our business exposes us to product liability risks inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing and use of medical products. We are currently named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits that are related to the distribution of our products. Although we intend to vigorously defend against these actions, there can be no assurance that we will prevail. We maintain product liability insurance; however, we cannot be certain that: · the level of our insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities; · the type of claim will be covered by the terms of the insurance coverage; · adequate product liability insurance will continue to be available in the future; or · our insurance can be maintained on acceptable terms. The legal expenses associated with defending against product liability claims and the obligation to pay a product liability claim in excess of available insurance coverage would increase our operating expenses and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. We depend heavily upon a limited number of sources of human cadaveric tissue, and any interruption in the availability of human tissue would interfere with our ability to process and market our products. Our business is dependent on the availability of donated human cadaveric tissue. We currently receive human tissue from United States tissue banks and organ procurement organizations. Over the past few years, demand for our products has increased substantially and our requirements for donor tissue have also increased substantially. Although we have met such demand and have established what we believe to be adequate sources of donated human tissue to satisfy the expected demand for our human tissue products in the foreseeable future, we cannot be sure that donated human cadaveric tissue will continue to be available at current levels or will be sufficient to meet our future needs. If our current sources can no longer supply human cadaveric tissue or our requirements for human cadaveric tissue exceed their current capacity, we may not be able to locate other sources on a timely basis, or at all. Any significant interruption in the availability of human cadaveric tissue would likely cause us to slow down the processing and distribution of our human tissue products, which could adversely affect our ability to supply the needs of our customers and materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our relationships with our customers. Negative publicity concerning the use of donated human tissue in medical procedures could reduce the demand for our products and negatively impact the supply of available donor tissue. Negative publicity concerning the use and method of obtaining donated human tissue that is used in medical procedures could reduce the demand for our products or negatively impact the willingness of families of potential donors to agree to donate tissue, or tissue banks to provide tissue to us. In such event, we might not be able to obtain adequate tissue to meet the needs of our customers and our results of operations and our relationships with our customers could be materially and adversely affected. Changes in third-party payer reimbursement practices regarding the procedures performed with our products could adversely affect the market acceptance of our products and materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Generally, hospitals, surgeons and other health care providers purchase products, such as the products being sold or developed by us, for use in providing care to their patients. These parties typically rely on third-party payers, including Medicare, Medicaid, private health insurance, and managed care plans to reimburse all or part of the costs of acquiring those products and costs associated with the medical procedures performed with those products. Third-party payers have adopted cost control measures in recent years that have had and may continue to have a significant effect on the purchasing practices of many health care providers, generally causing them to be more selective in the purchase of medical products. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products. We believe that certain third-party payers provide reimbursement for medical procedures at a specified rate without additional reimbursement for products, such as those being sold or developed by us, used in such procedures. Adequate third-party payer reimbursement may not be available for us to maintain price levels sufficient for realization of an appropriate return on our investment in developing new products. The FDA generally permits human tissue for transplantation to be commercially distributed without obtaining prior FDA approval of the product. In contrast, products regulated as medical devices or biologics usually require such approval. Certain government and other third-party payers refuse, in some cases, to provide any coverage for uses of products for indications for which the FDA has not granted marketing approval. Further, certain of our products are used in medical procedures that typically are not covered by third-party payers or for which patients sometimes do not obtain coverage. These and future changes in third-party payer reimbursement practices regarding the procedures performed with our products could adversely affect the market acceptance of our products and therefore, also materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. 10 Table of Contents All of our operations are currently conducted at a single location and any disruption at our facility could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. All of our operations are currently conducted at a single location in Branchburg, New Jersey. We take precautions to safeguard our facility including security, health and safety protocols and off-site backup and storage of our electronic data. Additionally, we maintain property insurance that includes coverage for business interruption. However, a natural disaster such as a fire or flood could affect our ability to maintain ongoing operations and cause us to incur additional expenses. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to fully cover our losses in any particular case. Accordingly, damage to our facility or other property due to fire, flood or other natural disaster or casualty event could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. The medical technology field is highly competitive and such competition could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. The medical technology field is undergoing rapid and significant technological change. Our success depends upon our ability to develop and commercialize efficient and effective products based on our technologies. Our products compete with autologous tissue and various commercially available products made from synthetic materials or biologic materials of human or animal tissue origin. Our tissue matrix products compete with synthetic surgical mesh products marketed by such large medical device companies as Johnson & Johnson; C.R. Bard; W.L. Gore & Associates; and Integra Life Sciences Holdings Corporation. They also compete with animal-derived products marketed by companies such as C.R. Bard; Cook, Inc.; and Tissue Science Laboratories, plc. Two tissue processors, Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation (“MTF”) and Tutogen, distribute human tissue-based products that compete with our products. MTF distributes its products through a direct sales force and through Synthes, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson. Tutogen distributes its products through C.R. Bard and Mentor. Our AlloCraft DBM product competes with other similar bone repair products produced by companies such as Regeneration Technologies, Inc.; Osteotech, Inc.; AlloSource; Wright Medical Group; Isotis Orthobiologics; and MTF. We believe that there are many companies, academic institutions, tissue banks, organ procurement organizations and tissue processors, including those identified above, that are capable of developing products that may be competitive with our current products. Additionally, many of these organizations are well established and may have substantially greater financial and other resources, research and development capabilities and more experience in conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, manufacturing and marketing than we do, and accordingly may succeed in developing competing products which may render our products or technology uncompetitive, uneconomical or obsolete. Our success depends on the scope of our intellectual property rights and not infringing the intellectual property rights of others. The validity, enforceability and commercial value of these rights are highly uncertain. Our ability to compete effectively with other companies is materially dependent upon the proprietary nature of our technologies. We rely primarily on patents and trade secrets to protect our technologies. Third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate, circumvent or render unenforceable any patents or proprietary rights owned by or licensed to us based on, among other things: · subsequently discovered prior art; · lack of entitlement to the priority of an earlier related application; or · failure to comply with the written description, best mode, enablement or other applicable requirements. In general, the patent position of biotechnology and medical product firms are highly uncertain, still evolving and involves complex legal, scientific and factual questions. We are at risk that: · patents may be granted to others that preclude granting patents on patent applications filed by us; and · any patents issued or licensed to us may not provide commercial benefit to us or will be infringed, invalidated or circumvented by others. The United States Patent and Trademark Office currently has a significant backlog of patent applications, and the approval or rejection of patents may take several years. The contents of United States patent applications are generally published 18 months after the initial filing date. Once published or issued, a United States patent application or patent would constitute prior art from its filing date, which might predate the filing date of one of our patent applications. Conceivably, the publication or issuance of such a prior art patent application or patent, or the discovery of “prior art” of which we are currently unaware, could invalidate a patent of ours or our licensor or discourage commercialization of a product claimed within such patent. 11 Table of Contents We generally conduct a cursory review of issued patents prior to engaging in research or development activities. If others already have issued patents covering new products that we develop, we may be required to obtain a license from them to commercialize such new products. There can be no assurance that any necessary license could be obtained on favorable terms or at all. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to resort to litigation to protect our patented technologies or other proprietary rights or that we will not be the subject of additional patent litigation to defend our existing or proposed products or processes against claims of patent infringement or other intellectual property claims. Any of such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our financial and management resources. We also have applied for patent protection in several foreign countries. Because of the differences in patent laws and laws concerning proprietary rights, the extent of protection provided by United States patents or proprietary rights owned by or licensed to us may differ from that of their foreign counterparts. We may decide for business reasons to retain certain knowledge that we consider proprietary as confidential and elect to protect such information as a trade secret, as business confidential information or as know-how. In that event, we must rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to maintain our competitive position. There can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or otherwise gain access to or disclose such information. We rely upon independent sales and marketing agents and distributors to generate part of our revenues. Our independent sales and marketing agents and distributors generated 12% of our total product revenue in the year ended December 31, 2007. Wright Medical Group, our exclusive distributor for GraftJacket, represented 5% of our total product revenues in 2007. No other individual independent sales agent or distributor generated more than 5% of our total product revenues in the year ended December 31, 2007. If any of our independent sales and marketing agents or distributors fails to adequately market our products, our revenues could be adversely affected until a replacement agent or distributor could be retained by us. Finding replacement agents and distributors could be a time-consuming process, and we may not be able to find replacement agents and distributors on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to find replacement agents and distributors, our revenues and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Increasing our revenues and profitability in the future may depend on our ability to develop and commercialize new products. Product development is subject to risks and uncertainties. We may be required to undertake time-consuming and costly development activities and seek regulatory clearance or approval for new clinical applications for current products and new products. The completion of development of any new products, including obtaining regulatory approval, remains subject to all the risks associated with the commercialization of new products based on innovative technologies, including: · unanticipated technical problems; · obtaining regulatory approval of such products, if required · manufacturing difficulties; · the possibility of significantly higher development costs than anticipated, and · gaining customer acceptance. In June 2007, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for Strattice, a new xenograft tissue product developed by us. In pre-clinical studies, Strattice demonstrated rapid revascularization and cell repopulation and strong healing. A significant amount of our research and development initiatives in 2008 include clinical programs designed to support the marketing of Strattice in current clinical applications and to potentially extend its use into new surgical applications. The results of our pre-clinical and clinical studies may not be sufficient to gain surgeon customer acceptance of this new product. 12 Table of Contents Additionally, health care payers' approval of reimbursement for new products in development may be an important factor in establishing market acceptance. If we are unable to successfully develop and commercialize new products, including Strattice, our future revenues and profitability could be materially and adversely affected. We may need additional capital to acquire complementary products or businesses, and it is uncertain whether such capital will be available. We believe that our current cash resources, together with anticipated cash from ongoing operating activities, will be sufficient to fund our planned operations, research and development programs and fixed asset additions in the foreseeable future. However, we may determine that we require additional funds to meet our long-term objectives, including the completion of potential acquisitions, and there can be no assurance that our financial sources will be sufficient and, as a result, we may need additional funding. We have no commitments for any future funding, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing in the future from debt or equity financings, collaborative arrangements or other sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve significant restrictive covenants. Collaborative arrangements, if necessary to raise additional funds, may require us to relinquish our rights to certain of our technologies, products or marketing territories.
