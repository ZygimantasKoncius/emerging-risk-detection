Item 1A. Risk Factors Risk factors are events and uncertainties over which the Company has limited or no control and which can have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We are subject to a variety of risk factors. The following information sets forth our evaluation of the risk factors we deem to be most material. We work to actively manage these risks, but the reader should be cautioned that we are only able to mitigate the impact of most risk factors, not eliminate. Also, there may be other risks which we do not presently deem material that may become material in the future. Underwriting and product pricing The insurance subsidiaries maintain underwriting departments that seek to evaluate the risks associated with the issuance of an insurance policy. NSIC accepts standard risks and, to an extent, substandard risks and engages medical doctors who review certain applications for insurance. In the case of the property and casualty subsidiaries, the underwriting staff attempts to assess, in light of the type of insurance sought by an applicant, the risks associated with a prospective insured or insurance situation. Depending upon the type of insurance involved, the process by which the risks are assessed will vary. In the case of automobile liability insurance, the underwriting staff assesses the risks involved in insuring a particular driver, and in the case of dwelling insurance, the underwriting staff assesses the risks involved in insuring a particular dwelling. Where possible, the underwriting staff of the property-casualty insurance subsidiary utilizes standard procedures as guides that quantify the hazards associated with a particular occupancy. In general, the property and casualty subsidiaries specialize in writing nonstandard risks. The nonstandard market in which the property and casualty subsidiaries operate reacts to general economic conditions in much the same way as the standard market. When insurers profits and equity are strong, companies sometimes cut rates or do not seek increases. Also, underwriting rules are less restrictive. As profit and/or capital fall, companies may tighten underwriting rules, and seek rate increases. Premiums in the nonstandard market are higher than the standard market because of the increased risk of the insured, which generally comprises more frequent claims. Drivers of autos who have prior traffic convictions are one such increased risk that warrants higher premiums. Lower valued dwellings and mobile homes also warrant higher premiums because of the nature of the risk. The costs of placing such nonstandard policies and making risk determinations are similar to those of the standard market. The added costs due to more frequent claims servicing is reflected in the generally higher premiums that are charged. 12 Our ability to maintain profitability is contingent upon our ability to actively manage our rates and underwriting procedures. Premium rate inadequacy may not become apparent quickly and we will incur lag-time to correct. If our rates or underwriting processes become inadequate, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Approval of rates Most lines of business written by our property and casualty insurers are subject to prior approval of premium rates in the majority of the states in which we operate. The process of obtaining regulatory approval can be expensive and time consuming and can impair our ability to make necessary rate adjustments due to changes in loss experience, cost of reinsurance or other factors. If our requests to regulatory bodies for rate increases are not approved in an adequate or timely manner, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted. Reinsurance Both insurance subsidiaries customarily reinsure with other insurers certain portions of the insurance risk. The primary purpose of such reinsurance arrangements is to enable the Company to limit its risk on individual policies, and in the case of property insurance, limit its risk in the event of a catastrophe in various geographic areas. A reinsurance arrangement does not discharge the issuing company from primary liability to the insured, and the issuing company is required to discharge its liability to the insured even if the reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations under the reinsurance arrangements. Reinsurance, however, does make the reinsurer liable to the issuing company to the extent of any reinsurance in force at the time of the loss. Reinsurance arrangements also decrease premiums retained by the issuing company since that company pays the reinsuring company a portion of total premiums based upon the amount of liability reinsured. NSIC generally reinsures all risks in excess of $50,000 with respect to any one insured. NSFC and Omega generally reinsure with third parties any liability in excess of $225,000 on any single policy. In addition, the property and casualty subsidiaries have catastrophe excess reinsurance, which provided protection in part with respect to aggregate property losses arising out of a single catastrophe, such as a hurricane. In 2006, the property and casualty subsidiaries had catastrophe protection up to a $42.5 million loss. Under the property and casualty subsidiaries reinsurance arrangement in force during 2006, the Company retained the first $3 million of insured losses from any single catastrophic event. The next $14.5 million in insured losses from any single event was 95% reinsured with the Companys net retention being 5%. The final layer of reinsurance protection provided coverage for 100% of insured losses exceeding $25 million and up to $42.5 million. The amount of catastrophe reinsurance protection purchased by the Company was based on computer modeling of actual Company exposure. The Company generally seeks protection for worst case scenarios based on the computer modeling that mitigates losses up to a 1 in 250 year event further described as a loss that has less than a ½ of 1% chance of occurring in any given year. NSFC and Omega had a provision for one reinstatement (coverage for two catastrophic events) during 2006. NSFC discontinued the 60% quota share reinsurance agreement on ocean marine exposure with additional excess of loss coverage during 2006. Our inability to procure reinsurance, primarily catastrophe reinsurance, could adversely impact our ability to maintain our level or premium revenue. Risk of loss from catastrophic events and geographic concentration: As described above, we maintain catastrophe reinsurance in amounts that provides protection to the Companys financial condition in all but the most remote likelihood of occurrences. Our most critical catastrophe risk is from hurricanes due to our proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Our results of operations are very likely to be materially impacted in the event of the landfall of a major hurricane striking the Northern Gulf Coast or Southern Atlantic Coast in Georgia or South Carolina where we maintain significant concentrations of business. We are also exposed to the risk of significant tornado activity in many of the states in which we operate. Our most significant catastrophic event risk is the risk of a loss in excess of the Companys upper catastrophe limit which could adversely impact the Companys financial condition if such an event occurs. 13 Reserve liabilities NSIC maintains life insurance reserves for future policy benefits to meet future obligations under outstanding policies. These reserves are calculated to be sufficient to meet policy and contract obligations as they arise. Liabilities for future policy benefits are calculated using assumptions for interest, mortality, morbidity, expense and withdrawals determined at the time the policies were issued. As of December 31, 2006, the total reserves of NSIC (including the reserves for accident and health insurance) were approximately $27.5 million. NSIC believes that such reserves for future policy benefits were calculated in accordance with generally accepted actuarial methods and that these reserves are adequate to provide for future policy benefits. Wakely Actuarial, consulting actuaries, provided actuarial services in calculating reserves. The property and casualty subsidiaries are also required to maintain loss reserves (claim liabilities) for all lines of insurance. Such reserves are intended to cover the probable ultimate cost of settling all claims, including those incurred but not yet reported. The reserves of the property and casualty subsidiaries reflect estimates of the liability with respect to incurred claims and are determined by evaluating reported claims on an ongoing basis and by estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported claims. Such reserves include adjustment expenses to cover the cost of investigating losses and defending lawsuits. The establishment of accurate reserves is complicated by the fact that claims in some lines of insurance are settled many years after the policies have been issued, thus raising the possibility that inflation may have a significant effect on the amount of ultimate loss payment, especially when compared to initial loss estimates. The subsidiaries, however, attempt to restrict their writing to risks that settle within one to four years of issuance of the policy. As of December 31, 2006, the property and casualty subsidiaries had reserves for unpaid claims of approximately $12.5 million before subtracting unpaid claims, due from reinsurers of $1.8 million leaving net unpaid claims of $10.7 million. The reserves are not discounted for the time value of money. No changes were made in the assumptions used in estimating the reserves during the years ending December 31, 2006, 2005 or 2004. The Company believes such reserves are adequate to provide for settlement of claims. Employees of the Company calculate NSFC and Omega loss reserves. Milliman, Inc., an independent actuarial consulting firm, reviews loss reserve estimates and issues a Statement of Actuarial Opinion regarding the adequacy of reserves. We incur the risk that we may experience excessive losses due to unanticipated claims frequency, severity or both that may not be factored into our loss reserve liabilities. Unexpected frequency and severity can be adversely impacted by outcomes of claims litigation, adverse jury verdicts related to claims settlements and adverse interpretations of insurance policy provisions which results in increased liabilities. We are also subject to the risk of unanticipated assessments from state underwriting associations or windstorm pools related to losses in excess of the associations or pools ability to pay. Such costs are often allocated to companies operating in the jurisdiction of the association or windstorm pool and the likelihood and amount of such assessments are difficult to predict. These events could adversely impact our historical loss reserving methodology and cause financial adjustments that could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. Financial Ratings The insurance subsidiaries are rated by AM Best Company, an insurance company-rating agency. NSFC is rated B++ (Good), Omega is rated B+ (Good) and NSIC is rated B (Fair) by AM Best Company. A downgrade in our AM Best ratings could adversely impact our ability to maintain existing business or generate new business. Regulation The insurance subsidiaries are each subject to regulation by the insurance departments of those states in which they are licensed to conduct business. Although the extent of regulation varies from state to state, the insurance laws of the various states generally establish supervisory departments having broad administrative powers with respect to, among other matters, (1) the granting and revocation of licenses to transact business, (2) the licensing of agents, (3) the establishment of standards of financial solvency (including reserves to be maintained) and the nature of investments and (5) in most cases premium rates; the approval of forms and policies; and the form and content of financial statements. The primary purpose of these regulations is the protection of policyholders and do not necessarily confer a benefit upon shareholders. Many states in which the insurance subsidiaries operate, including Alabama, have laws requiring that insurers become members of guaranty associations. These associations guarantee that benefits due policyholders of insurance companies will continue to be provided even if the insurance company which wrote the business is financially unable to fulfill its obligations. To provide these benefits, the associations assess the insurance companies licensed in a state that write the line of insurance for which coverage is guaranteed. The amount of an insurers assessment is generally based on the relationship between that companys premium volume in the state and the premium volume of all companies writing the particular line of insurance in the state. The Company has paid no material amounts to guaranty associations over the past three years. These payments, when made, are principally related to association costs incurred due to the insolvency of various insurance companies. Future assessments depend on the number and magnitude of insurance company insolvencies and such assessments are therefore difficult to predict. 14 Most states have enacted legislation or adopted administrative rules and regulations covering such matters as the acquisition of control of insurance companies, transactions between insurance companies and the persons controlling them. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has recommended model legislation on these subjects and all states where the Companys subsidiaries transact business have adopted, with some modifications, that model legislation. Among the matters regulated by such statutes are the payments of dividends. These regulations have a direct impact on the Company since its cash flow is substantially derived from dividends from its subsidiaries. However, the Company has not had nor does it foresee a problem obtaining the necessary funds to operate because of the regulation. Statutory limitations of dividend payments by subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 12 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. While most regulation is at the state level, the federal government has increasingly expressed an interest in regulating aspects of the insurance industry. All of these regulations at various levels of government increase the cost of conducting business through increased compliance expenses. Also, existing regulations are constantly evolving through administrative and court interpretations and new regulations are often adopted. It is difficult to predict what impact changes in regulation may have on the Company in the future. Changes in regulations could occur that might adversely impact our ability to achieve acceptable levels of profitability and limit our growth. Competition The insurance subsidiaries are engaged in a highly competitive business and compete with many insurance companies of substantially greater financial resources, including stock and mutual insurance companies. Mutual insurance companies return profits, if any, to policyholders rather than shareholders; therefore, mutual insurance companies may be able to charge lower net premiums than those charged by stock insurers. Accordingly, stock insurers must attempt to achieve competitive premium rates through greater volume, efficiency of operations and control of expenses. NSIC primarily markets its life and health insurance products through the home service system and independent producers. Direct competition comes from home service companies and other insurance companies that utilize independent producers to sell insurance products, of which there are many. NSICs life and health products also compete with products sold by ordinary life companies. NSIC writes policies primarily in Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi. The market share of the total life and health premiums written is small because of the number of insurers in this highly competitive field. The primary methods of competition in the field are service and price. Because of the increased costs associated with a home service company, premium rates are generally higher than ordinary products, as a result competition from these ordinary insurers must be met through service. Initial costs of distribution through independent agents are generally more than through home service distribution methods, but lower commissions are paid in years subsequent to the first year of the policy so costs decline rapidly as policies renew after the first year. The primary factor in controlling cost under the independent agent distribution method is maintaining a high persistency rate. The persistency rate is the rate at which new business is maintained in renewal periods subsequent to the first year. If a high persistency rate can be maintained, the overall costs of distribution are lowered due to lower commission rate payments on policies in force subsequent to the first year. The property and casualty subsidiaries market their products through independent agents and brokers, concentrating primarily on dwelling fire, homeowners and nonstandard auto coverage. NSFC, though one of the larger writers of lower value dwelling fire insurance in Alabama, nevertheless faces a number of competitors in this niche. Moreover, larger general line insurers also compete with NSFC. The market share in states other than Alabama is small. Price is the primary method of competition. Because the Company utilizes independent agents, commission rates and service to the agent are also important factors in whether the independent agent agrees to offer NSFC products over those of its competitors. 15 Significant changes in the competitive environment in which we operate could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations. Inflation The Company shares the same risks from inflation as other companies. Inflation causes operating expenses to increase and erodes the purchasing power of the Companys assets. A large portion of the Companys assets is invested in fixed maturity investments. The purchasing power of these investments will be less at maturity because of inflation. This is generally offset by the reserves that are a fixed liability and will be paid with cheaper dollars. Also, inflation tends to increase investment yields, which may reduce the impact of the increased operating expenses caused by inflation. Investment Risk and Liquidity Our invested assets are managed by company personnel. The majority of these investments consist of fixed maturity securities. These securities are subject to price fluctuations due to changes in interest rates and unfavorable changes could materially reduce the market value of the Companys investment portfolio and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Fixed maturity investments are managed in light of anticipated liquidity needs. Should we experience a significant change in liquidity needs for any reason, we may be forced to sell fixed maturity securities at a loss to cover these liquidity needs. Changes in general economic conditions, the stock market and various other external factors could also adversely impact the value of our investments and consequently our results of operations and financial condition. Dependence of the Company on Dividends from Insurance Subsidiaries The Company is an insurance holding company with no significant operations. The primary asset of the Company is its stock in the insurance subsidiaries. The Company relies on dividends from the insurance subsidiaries in order to pay operating expenses and to provide liquidity for the payment of dividends to shareholders. The ability of the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to regulatory restrictions discussed in detail in note 12 of the consolidated financial statements included herein. Should the insurance subsidiaries become subject to restrictions imposed by insurance regulations regarding the payment of dividends, the ability of the Company to pay expenses, meet debt service requirements and pay cash dividends to shareholders could be adversely impacted. Accounting Standards Our financial statements are prepared based upon generally accepted accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board along with standards set by other regulatory organizations. We are required to adopt newly issued or revised accounting standards that are issued periodically. Future changes could impact accounting treatment applied to financial statements and could have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations and financial conditions. Potential changes in accounting standards that are currently expected to impact the Company are disclosed in the Notes to Financial Statements included herein. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None
