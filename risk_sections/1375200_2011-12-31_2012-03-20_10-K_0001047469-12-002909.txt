ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business is subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks and uncertainties described below, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. These risks and uncertainties could also cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements that we make from time to time (please read the "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" appearing at the beginning of this Form 10-K). The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Risks and uncertainties of general applicability and additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Risks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements We need to raise additional funds to continue as a going concern; failure to raise such funds may cause us to delay or modify our operations and plans related to NP101 and our other product candidates, pursue a plan to sell our assets or seek bankruptcy protection. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents of $23.1 million as of December 31, 2011, of which $3.0 million is required to be maintained under the terms of our term loan facility (Term Loan Facility). As of December 31, 2011, we had working capital of $11.0 million. During 2011, we used $20.9 million of cash for operating activities and $3.5 million for investing activities, which were partially funded from $8.6 million of net cash provided by financing activities (primarily the $10.0 million of gross proceeds from the issuance of additional debt). We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations, debt service and interest obligations into the third quarter of 2012. We will require additional capital to fund our operations and capital requirements beyond that point. There is no assurance that such capital will be available when needed or on acceptable terms. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 related to our ability to continue as a going concern. 29 Table of Contents To meet our capital needs, we are considering multiple alternatives, including, but not limited to, additional equity financings, debt financings, corporate collaboration and licensing agreements, and other funding opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such transaction on acceptable terms or otherwise. Furthermore, the covenants and the pledge of our assets as collateral under the Term Loan Facility limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. If we are unable to successfully complete the additional trials, tests, device enhancement, packaging modification and other activities to support the resubmission of our New Drug Application (NDA) in a timely manner, our ability to obtain additional capital may be adversely affected. Until such time as we are able to secure the necessary funding, we plan to continue conserving our capital resources, predominantly by limiting investments to those activities related to the approval of NP101. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, will result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms, such as liquidation and other preferences, which are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise the necessary capital, we will need to curtail operations significantly and modify our business strategy which may require us to delay, modify or abandon our operations and plans related to NP101 and our other product candidates, pursue a plan to sell our assets or seek bankruptcy protection. Bankruptcy may result in the termination of agreements pursuant to which we license certain intellectual property rights. Additionally, failure to obtain additional capital may result in an event of default under our Term Loan Facility. Our Term Loan Facility contains customary events of default including upon the occurrence of a payment default, a covenant default, a material adverse change (as defined therein) and insolvency. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the interest on outstanding loans will be increased by 3% over the rate that would otherwise be applicable. In addition the occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of our obligations under the facility as well as grant the lenders the right to exercise remedies with respect to the collateral which secures the facility. We have prepared our financial statements on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in existence. Our indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and our inability to meet our payment obligations may permit our lenders to proceed against the collateral granted pursuant to our Term Loan Facility. Our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have significant adverse consequences, including: Requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash resources to the payment of interest on, and principal of, our debt, which will reduce the amounts available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts and other general corporate purposes; Increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; 30 Table of Contents Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and Placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt. As of December 31, 2011, we had $13.9 million of principal indebtedness, of which $8.4 million is current and due in 2012, as well as $235,000 of accrued and unpaid interest outstanding under our loan and security agreement (Term Loan Facility). We may not have sufficient capital or may be unable to arrange for additional capital to pay the amounts due under our Term Loan Facility or any other borrowings. Our obligations under our Term Loan Facility are secured by a lien on all of our assets, excluding intellectual property, which is subject to a negative pledge. In addition, our cash and investment accounts are subject to account control agreements with the lenders that give them the right to assume control of the account in the event of a default under the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility contains operating covenants including, among others, covenants restricting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or other distributions, effect a sale of any part of its business and merge with or acquire another company. The Term Loan Facility also includes customary events of default including upon the occurrence of a payment default, a covenant default, a material adverse change (as defined therein) and insolvency. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the interest on outstanding loans will be increased by 3% over the rate that would otherwise be applicable. In addition, the occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of our obligations under the Term Loan Facility as well as grant the Lenders the right to exercise remedies with respect to the collateral. We have incurred significant operating losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future. We may never become profitable. As of December 31, 2011, we had an accumulated deficit of $103.0 million. We are a development stage biopharmaceutical company with no products approved for commercial sale and, to date, have not generated any revenues. We have funded our operations to date primarily with the proceeds of the sale of common stock, convertible preferred stock, preferred stock warrants, convertible notes and borrowings under debt facilities. We expect to continue to incur substantial additional operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue to develop our product candidates and seek marketing approval and, subject to obtaining such approval, the eventual commercialization of NP101 and our other product candidates. In addition, we are incurring additional costs of operating as a public company and, if we obtain marketing approval for NP101, will incur significant sales, marketing and outsourced manufacturing expenses. As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing losses for the foreseeable future. To achieve and maintain profitability, we need to generate significant revenues from future product sales. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including: Obtaining marketing approval for the marketing of NP101 and possibly other product candidates; Commercializing NP101 and any other product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval; and Achieving market acceptance of NP101 and any other product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval in the medical community and with patients and third party payors. We expect to resubmit an NDA for NP101 to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the first half of 2012. NP101 will require marketing approval and investment in commercial capabilities, including manufacturing and sales and marketing efforts, before its product sales generate any revenues for us. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development and commercialization, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses. We may never successfully commercialize any products, generate significant future revenues or achieve and sustain profitability. 31 Table of Contents The sale of our common stock to Aspire Capital may cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and the sale of the shares of common stock acquired by Aspire Capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline. We have registered 2,901,734 shares of common stock that we may sell to Aspire Capital under the Purchase Agreement, of which 84,866 shares have been issued to Aspire Capital as a commitment fee in consideration for entering into the Purchase Agreement (the Commitment Shares), 70,721 shares were sold to Aspire Capital upon execution of the Purchase Agreement (the Initial Purchase Shares) and 2,746,147 shares that we may elect to sell to Aspire Capital under the Purchase Agreement. It is anticipated that shares registered will be sold over the term of the Purchase Agreement, which ends on August 15, 2013. The number of shares ultimately offered for sale by Aspire Capital is dependent upon the number of shares we elect to sell to Aspire Capital under the Purchase Agreement. Depending upon market liquidity at the time, sales of shares of our common stock under the Purchase Agreement may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. In addition, sales by Aspire Capital of shares acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement under the registration statement may result in dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by Aspire Capital or anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales. However, we have the right to control the timing and amount of sales of our shares to Aspire Capital, and the Purchase Agreement may be terminated by us at any time at our discretion without any penalty or cost to us. We have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and growth prospects. We were incorporated in Delaware in January 2005. Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, conducting product development activities for NP101 and performing preclinical development of our other product candidates. As a company, we have not yet demonstrated an ability to obtain marketing approval for or commercialize a product candidate. Consequently, any predictions about our future performance may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products as a company. In addition, as a new business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. We will need to transition from a company with a development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. We may not be successful in such a transition. Risks Related to Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates We are heavily dependent on the success of NP101. If we fail to obtain marketing approval for and commercialize NP101, or experience delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed. We have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of our most advanced product candidate, NP101. NP101 is the only product candidate for which we have conducted clinical trials, and to date we have not marketed, distributed or sold any products. Our ability to generate revenues in the near term is substantially dependent on our ability to develop and commercialize NP101. We cannot commercialize NP101 prior to obtaining FDA approval. NP101 is susceptible to the risks of failure inherent at any stage of drug development, including the appearance of unexpected adverse events, manufacturing and testing failures, and the FDA's determination NP101 is not approvable. As a company, we have never obtained marketing approval for or commercialized a drug. It is possible that the FDA may review our data and conclude that our application is insufficient to obtain marketing approval of NP101. The FDA may require that we conduct additional clinical or preclinical trials or manufacture additional validation batches before it will consider our application. If the FDA requires additional studies or data, we would incur increased costs and delays in the marketing approval process, which may require us to expend more resources than we have available. In 32 Table of Contents addition, the FDA may not consider sufficient any additional required trials that we perform and complete. Even if we believe that the data from our clinical trials support marketing approval of NP101 in the U.S., the FDA may not agree with our analysis and may not approve our NDA. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, marketing approvals would prevent us from commercializing NP101, generating revenues and achieving profitability. Our success in obtaining regulatory approval to market NP101 in the U.S. depends on our ability to address the issues raised by the FDA in its complete response letter regarding our new drug application for NP101. We are seeking to obtain regulatory approval to market NP101 in the U.S. for the treatment of migraine. We submitted a NDA for NP101 to the FDA in October 2010. In August 2011 we received a CRL from the FDA regarding the NDA. A CRL is issued by the FDA when questions remain that preclude the FDA from approving the NDA in its present form. In the CRL, the FDA acknowledged that the efficacy of the migraine patch in the overall migraine population was established. The CRL primarily contained chemistry, manufacturing and safety questions. In November 2011, we had an end-of-review meeting with the FDA to discuss certain questions contained in the CRL and our approach for addressing such questions. Based on the CRL and our discussion with FDA at this meeting, we believe the primary outstanding issues are: product containment and uniformity of dosage. We are making minor modifications to the product packaging and providing additional data in order to characterize the uniformity of dosage. demonstrating that NP101 can be used correctly by patients. We will be conducting a new patient usability study with NP101's revised packaging. development and validation of a new in vitro testing method. We have developed a new in vitro testing method and validation is ongoing. We believe this new method meets applicable FDA criteria. The new method will be included in our resubmission and used to qualify newly manufactured product. the potential for NP101 to cause application site adverse events that result in permanent skin effects. In our Phase III clinical program, consisting of 796 patients applying approximately 10,000 NP101 patches, four patients (0.5%) experienced application site adverse events that resulted in a small mark on the skin. These marks occurred because NP101 was not applied correctly. To address this issue we are implementing a device enhancement that will prevent NP101 from activating in the event that it is applied incorrectly. completion of two Phase I trials. One trial is to verify the performance of our planned device enhancement and the other, which has been completed, was a repeat of a Phase I trial that assessed the pharmacokinetics of NP101 compared to oral Imitrex because the clinical site that performed the original trial did not retain sufficient samples. Pharmacokinetics refers to a drug's absorption, distribution and metabolism in, and excretion from, the body and measures, among other things, bioavailability of a drug, or concentration of drug in the plasma. justification for waiver of a dermal carcinogenicity study. In order to qualify for a waiver, we believe we must demonstrate that sumatriptan is not passively absorbed through the skin. We have clinical and preclinical data confirming that there is no passive absorption and will include these data in our resubmission. In addition to these primary issues, we are addressing the other questions raised by the FDA in the CRL. By providing additional data and following FDA recommendations, we believe we can address these questions to the satisfaction of the FDA in our NDA resubmission. We expect to resubmit our NDA in the first half of 2012 after completing the activities discussed above. If we do not timely complete the additional trials, tests, device enhancement, packaging modification and other activities to support the resubmission of our NDA, or if we obtain unexpected results, our NDA 33 Table of Contents resubmission may be delayed, we may incur substantial additional costs and our ability to obtain additional capital may be adversely affected. We believe our resubmission will result in a six month review period under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which will be the target date for the FDA to complete its review of the NDA. If the FDA is not satisfied with the information we provide, the FDA may require the addition of labeling statements or other warnings or contraindications, require us to perform additional trials or studies or provide additional information, or redesign NP101 in order to secure approval. Any such requirement could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. The FDA may require us to address additional issues which may delay, limit or preclude approval of NP101. While we may continue our efforts to obtain and to follow FDA guidance in order to receive approval of NP101, the FDA may not agree that any new trial results or manufacturing information we submit will be sufficient to support NP101 approval, or may reconsider its guidance, require more trials or studies or otherwise require additional information to justify approval. Additionally, despite the FDA's acknowledgment that the efficacy of NP101 in the overall migraine population had been established, there can be no assurance that the FDA will not come to a different interpretation of our previously submitted clinical trial data, or otherwise alter its view and conclude that NP101 is not sufficiently effective, or safe, to warrant approval. The commercial success of NP101 and any other product candidates that we develop, if approved in the future, will depend upon significant market acceptance of these products among physicians, patients and third party payors. As a company, we have never commercialized a product candidate for any indication. Even if any product candidate that we develop, including NP101, is approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities for marketing and sale, it may not gain acceptance among physicians, patients and third party payors. If our products for which we obtain marketing approval do not gain an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues or become profitable. Market acceptance of NP101, and any other product candidates that we develop, by physicians, patients and third party payors will depend on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: The efficacy, safety and other potential advantages in relation to alternative treatments; The relative convenience and ease of administration; The availability of adequate coverage or reimbursement by third parties, such as insurance companies and other healthcare payors, and by government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid; The prevalence and severity of adverse events; The cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments, including generic products; The extent and strength of marketing and distribution support; The limitations or warnings contained in a product's FDA approved labeling; and Distribution and use restrictions imposed by the FDA or to which we agree as part of a mandatory risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or voluntary risk management plan. For example, even if the medical community accepts that NP101 is safe and effective for its approved indication, physicians and patients may not immediately be receptive to NP101 and may be slow to adopt it as an accepted treatment for acute migraine. In addition, even though we believe NP101 has significant advantages, because no head-to-head trials comparing NP101 to competing products have been conducted, it is unlikely that any labeling approved by the FDA will contain claims that NP101 is safer or more effective than competitive products or will permit us to promote NP101 as being superior to competing products. Further, the availability of numerous inexpensive generic forms 34 Table of Contents of migraine therapy products may also limit acceptance of NP101 among physicians, patients and third party payors. If NP101 is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance among physicians, patients and third party payors, we may not generate meaningful revenues from NP101 and we may not become profitable. It will be difficult for us to profitably sell any of our product candidates that the FDA approves, including NP101, if reimbursement for such product candidate is limited. Market acceptance and sales of NP101 or any other product candidates that we develop will depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures. Government authorities and third party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and these third party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for NP101 or any other product candidates that we develop and, if reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, our products for which we obtain marketing approval. Numerous generic products may be available at lower prices than branded therapy products, such as NP101, if it is approved, which may also reduce the likelihood and level of reimbursement for our product candidates, including NP101. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize NP101 or any other product candidates that we develop. The active ingredient in NP101, sumatriptan, is available as a generic, as our other triptans. Because of the low cost, health insurers may require or encourage use of, and consumers may use, a generic triptan prior to trying NP101. If we are unable to establish effective marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates after they are approved, we may be unable to generate product revenues. In order to commercialize our products, we must build our marketing, sales and distribution capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. If NP101 is approved by the FDA, we plan to build a commercial infrastructure, including a specialty sales force, to launch NP101 in the U.S. along with a partner. We may seek to further penetrate the U.S. market in the future by expanding our sales force or through collaborations with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. We may also seek to commercialize NP101 outside the U.S., although we currently plan to do so only with a collaborator. The establishment and development of our own sales force and related compliance plans to market any products we may develop will be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch, and we may not be able to successfully develop this capability. We, or our future collaborators, will have to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain marketing and sales personnel. In the event we are unable to develop a marketing and sales infrastructure, we would not be able to commercialize NP101 or any other product candidates that we develop, which would limit our ability to generate product revenues. Companies such as ours often expand their sales force and marketing capabilities for a product prior to it being approved by the FDA so that the drug can be commercialized upon approval. Although our plan is to hire our sales representatives and most of our other sales and marketing personnel only if NP101 is approved by the FDA, we have incurred and will continue to incur expenses prior to product launch in recruiting this sales force and developing a marketing and sales infrastructure. If the commercial launch of NP101 is delayed as a result of FDA requirements or other reasons, we would incur these expenses prior to being able to realize any revenue from product sales. Even if we are able to effectively hire a sales force and develop a marketing and sales infrastructure, 35 Table of Contents our sales force and marketing teams may not be successful in commercializing NP101 or any other product candidates that we develop. To the extent we rely on or partner with third parties to commercialize any products for which we obtain marketing approval, we may receive less revenue than if we commercialized these products ourselves. In addition, we would have less control over the sales efforts of any other third parties involved in our commercialization efforts. In the event we are unable to partner with a third party marketing and sales organization, our ability to generate product revenues may be limited either in the U.S. or internationally. We face significant competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our major competitors include organizations such as major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies and specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, such as larger research and development staff and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, these companies may obtain marketing approval more rapidly than we are able to and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis technologies and drug products that are more effective or less costly than NP101 or any other drug candidate that we are currently developing or that we may develop, which could render our products obsolete and noncompetitive. We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third party payors. We also expect to face competition in our efforts to identify appropriate collaborators or partners to help commercialize our product candidates in our target commercial markets. The competition in the market for acute migraine medication is intense. The majority of marketed prescription products for treatment of acute migraine in the U.S. are in the triptan class in tablet, orally-disintegrating tablet, nasal spray and injectable formulations. The largest selling triptan in units is sumatriptan, with approximately 75.6 million individual units sold in the U.S. during the twelve months ended June 2011, including approximately 9.2 million units attributable to GlaxoSmithKline plc's (GSK), branded sumatriptan products, Imitrex and Treximet. There are at least six other branded triptan therapies being sold by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Maxalt from Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck), the largest selling triptan with sales of approximately $548.4 million in the U.S. during the twelve months ended June 2011. If approved, NP101 will face competition from inexpensive generic versions of sumatriptan and generic versions of other branded products of competitors that have lost or will lose their patent exclusivity, including the largest selling triptan, Maxalt, which is expected to lose patent exclusivity between 2012 and 2014. In addition, we expect other triptan patents to expire between 2013 and 2017. Many of these products are manufactured and marketed by large pharmaceutical companies and are well accepted by physicians, patients and third party payors. Because of the low cost, health insurers likely would require or encourage use of, a generic triptan prior to trying NP101. In addition to marketed migraine medications, both large and small companies have migraine product candidates in various stages of clinical development. These include Levadex from MAP Pharmaceuticals, Inc., an inhaled formulation of DHE, and an intranasal powder formulation of sumatriptan from Optinose, both for the treatment of acute migraine. Optinose initiated enrollment in a 200 patient Phase III trial in 2012 and MAP Pharmaceuticals submitted a NDA to the FDA in 2011. 36 Table of Contents Additionally, MAP has entered into a collaborative agreement with Allergan Inc., whose Botox product was approved for the treatment of chronic migraine in October 2010. Pursuant to the collaboration, the parties will co-promote Levadex following its potential FDA approval. As with NP101, if approved, each of NP201 and NP202 will face competition from generic and branded products. Specifically, NP201, a biodegradable, subcutaneous, injectable polymer implant combined with ropinirole, will face competition from generic immediate release and extended release versions of ropinirole and the dopamine agonist pramiprexole, as well as from two continuous delivery medications, a levadopa gel and an injectable apomorphine. NP202, a biodegradable, subcutaneous, injectable polymer implant combined with an atypical antipsychotic medication, will face competition from a variety of branded and generic versions of antipsychotic medications, in addition to several other sustained delivery depot formulations of atypical antipsychotics. As a result of all of these factors, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection or FDA approval or discovering, developing and commercializing migraine and other therapies before we do. Any failure or delay in preclinical studies or clinical trials for our product candidates may cause us to incur additional costs or delay or prevent the commercialization of our product candidates and could severely harm our business. Before obtaining marketing approval for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct, at our own expense, extensive preclinical tests and then clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing, in particular, is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. The outcome of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Even if preclinical studies and early phase clinical trials succeed, it is necessary to conduct additional clinical trials in larger numbers of subjects taking the medication for longer periods before seeking FDA approval to market and sell a medication in the U.S. Clinical data is often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain FDA approval for their products. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process, which could delay or prevent us from receiving marketing approval or commercializing our product candidates, including the following: Regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site; Our clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or we may abandon projects that we expect to be promising; The number of subjects required for our clinical trials may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in our clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, or participants may drop out of our clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate; We might have to suspend or terminate our clinical trials if the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks; Regulators or institutional review boards may require that we hold, suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols; 37 Table of Contents Regulators may refuse to accept or consider data from clinical trials for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols; The cost of our preclinical or clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate; The supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical trials may be insufficient or inadequate; and The effects of our product candidates may not be the desired effects or the desired level of effect or may include undesirable side effects or the product candidates may have other unexpected characteristics. We are conducting and expect to conduct additional clinical trials in the future for NP101 and our other product candidates. Subject enrollment, which is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by a variety of factors, including the following: The size and nature of the subject population; The proximity of subjects to clinical sites; The eligibility criteria for the trial; The design of the clinical trial; Competing clinical trials; and Clinicians' and subjects' perceptions as to the potential advantages of the medication being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new medications that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. Furthermore, we plan to rely on clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials, and while we have agreements governing their committed activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance. Any delays or unanticipated problems during clinical testing, such as enrollment in our clinical trials being slower than we anticipate or participants dropping out of our clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate, could increase our costs, slow down our product development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Serious adverse events or other safety risks could require us to abandon development and preclude or limit approval of our product candidates. We may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to participants. In addition, regulatory agencies or institutional review boards may at any time order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials or of investigators in the clinical trials if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. If we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate a clinical trial of any product candidates, the commercial prospects of such product candidates will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates, if at all, will be delayed or eliminated. Clinical trials for our product candidates involve testing in large subject populations, which could reveal a high prevalence of adverse events. If these effects include undesirable serious adverse events or have unexpected characteristics, we may need to abandon our development of these product candidates. Alternatively, the identification of serious adverse events or other significant safety risks could result in the imposition of approval requirements, such as labeling or distribution and use restrictions that limit the available market for our product candidates. 38 Table of Contents If we fail to acquire, develop and commercialize product candidates other than NP101, our prospects for future growth and our ability to sustain profitability may be limited. A key element of our strategy is to develop and commercialize a portfolio of product candidates in addition to NP101. To do so, we plan to obtain additional product candidates or technologies primarily through acquisitions or licenses. We may not be successful in our efforts to identify and develop additional product candidates, and any product candidates we do identify may not produce commercially viable drugs that safely and effectively treat their indicated conditions. To date, our efforts have yielded two product candidates in addition to NP101, both of which are currently in preclinical development. Our development programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product leads, yet fail to produce product candidates for clinical development. In addition, identifying new treatment needs and product candidates requires substantial technical, financial and human resources on our part. If we are unable to maintain or secure additional development program funding or continue to devote substantial technical and human resources to such programs, we may have to delay or abandon these programs. Any product candidate that we successfully identify may require substantial additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including preclinical studies, extensive clinical testing and approval by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are susceptible to the risks of failure that are inherent in pharmaceutical product development. We may be unable to license or acquire suitable product candidates or technologies from third parties for a number of reasons. In particular, the licensing and acquisition of pharmaceutical products is competitive. A number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire products. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources or greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, we expect competition in acquiring product candidates to increase, which may lead to fewer suitable acquisition opportunities for us as well as higher acquisition prices. Other factors that may prevent us from licensing or otherwise acquiring suitable product candidates include the following: We may be unable to license or acquire the relevant technology on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return from such product; Companies that perceive us to be their competitors may be unwilling to assign or license their product rights to us; or We may be unable to identify suitable products or product candidates within our areas of expertise. Product liability lawsuits could divert our resources, result in substantial liabilities and reduce the commercial potential of any products that we may successfully develop. The risk that we may be sued on product liability claims is inherent in the development of pharmaceutical products. We will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates, or any products we may commercialize, cause injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, these lawsuits may: Expose us to adverse publicity; Decrease demand for any products that we successfully develop; Cause clinical trial participants to withdraw from clinical trials or be reluctant to enroll; Divert our management from pursuing our business strategy; 39 Table of Contents Increase warnings on our product label; Be costly to defend; and Force us to limit or forgo further development and commercialization of these products. Although we maintain general liability and product liability insurance with limits, subject to deductibles, of $2.0 million in the aggregate for general liability, $10.0 million in the aggregate for umbrella liability coverage for payments that exceed the general liability limits and $5.0 million in the aggregate for product liability, this insurance may not fully cover potential liabilities. The cost of any product liability litigation or other proceedings, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. In addition, inability to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the development and commercial production and sale of our products, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. A variety of risks associated with our planned international business relationships could materially adversely affect our business. We may enter into agreements with third parties for the development and commercialization of NP101 and possibly other products in international markets. If we do so, we would be subject to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships, including: Differing regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries; Potentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights; The potential for so-called parallel importing, which is what happens when a local seller, faced with higher local prices, opts to import goods from a foreign market, with lower prices, rather than buying them locally; Unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements; Economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets; Compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees traveling abroad; Foreign taxes; Foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country; Workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the U.S.; Production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and Business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters, including earthquakes, volcanoes, typhoons, floods, hurricanes and fires. These and other risks may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or sustain profitable operations. 40 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties We use third parties to manufacture our product candidates, including NP101, and the machinery to produce the commercial supply of NP101 must be designed, built and validated. This may increase the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could result in clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates being delayed, prevented or impaired. We do not own or operate, and have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities for our product candidates. We lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. We currently outsource all manufacturing of our preclinical and clinical product candidates to third parties, typically without any guarantee that there will be sufficient supplies to fulfill our requirements or that we may obtain such supplies on acceptable terms. Any delays in obtaining adequate supplies with respect to our preclinical and clinical product candidates may delay the development or commercialization of NP101 or our other product candidates. In addition, we do not currently have any agreements with third party manufacturers and suppliers for the commercial supply of NP101 or any of our other product candidates. If we are unable to enter into such agreements with LTS and other third party manufacturers and suppliers in a timely manner, or on acceptable terms, our ability to commercialize NP101 and our other product candidates may be delayed, prevented or impaired. Even if we enter into these agreements, the various manufacturers and suppliers will likely be single source suppliers to us for a significant period of time. In particular, LTS manufactures NP101 using sumatriptan and components that we purchase from third parties. Although LTS has considerable experience in the manufacture of passive transdermal drug patches, it has not manufactured active transdermal patches other than NP101. In order for LTS to produce our commercial supply of NP101, LTS must successfully complete the following: Transfer technology and production capabilities from its German facility where our clinical supply has been produced to its manufacturing facility in New Jersey; and Qualify and validate the newly-assembled machinery and production process. The machinery that LTS will use to produce the commercial supply of NP101 is customized to the particular manufacturing specifications of NP101. If LTS is unable to qualify and validate this equipment at its New Jersey facility, in each case in a timely manner, our ability to launch and commercialize NP101 will be compromised significantly. If this customized equipment malfunctions at any time during the production process, the time it may take LTS to secure replacement parts, to undertake repairs and to revalidate the equipment and process could limit our ability to meet the commercial demand for NP101. In addition, we are developing another customized piece of machinery to assemble a key component of NP101. Upon completion, the equipment will be installed at a designated third party manufacturer. If we are unable to get this equipment fabricated or the equipment cannot be validated at our third party manufacturer, in each case in a timely manner, our ability to launch and commercialize NP101 will be adversely affected. If this customized equipment malfunctions at any time during the production process, the time it may take to secure replacement parts, to undertake repairs and to revalidate the equipment and process could adversely affect our ability to commercially launch NP101 and meet the commercial demand for NP101. Reliance on third party manufacturers subjects us to risks that would not affect us if we manufactured the product candidates ourselves, including: Reliance on the third parties for regulatory compliance and quality assurance; 41 Table of Contents The possible breach of the manufacturing agreements by the third parties because of factors beyond our control; The possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreements by the third parties because of our breach of the manufacturing agreement or based on their own business priorities; and The disruption and costs associated with changing suppliers. Our product candidates may compete with other products and product candidates for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that are both capable of manufacturing for us and willing to do so. If our existing third party manufacturers, or the third parties that we engage in the future to manufacture a product for commercial sale or for our clinical trials, should cease to continue to do so for any reason, we likely would experience delays in obtaining sufficient quantities of our product candidates for us to meet commercial demand or to advance our clinical trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers. If for any reason we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of our product candidates or the drug substances used to manufacture them, it will be more difficult for us to develop our product candidates and compete effectively. Our suppliers are subject to regulatory requirements, covering manufacturing, testing, quality control, manufacturing, and record keeping relating to our product candidates, and subject to ongoing inspections by the regulatory agencies. Failure by any of our suppliers to comply with applicable regulations may result in long delays and interruptions to our manufacturing capacity while we seek to secure another supplier that meets all regulatory requirements. We may rely on third parties to conduct aspects of our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be delayed in obtaining or ultimately not be able to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates. We currently rely on contract research organizations (CROs) for some aspects of our clinical trials, including data management, statistical analysis and electronic compilation of our NDA. We may enter into additional agreements with CROs to obtain additional resources and expertise in an attempt to accelerate our progress with regard to ongoing clinical and preclinical programs. Entering into relationships with CROs involves substantial cost and requires extensive management time and focus. In addition, typically there is a transition period when a CRO commences work. As a result, delays may occur, which may materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines and ultimately have a material adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition or future prospects. As CROs are not our employees, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical and preclinical programs in which they are engaged to perform. If the CROs we engage do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they provide is compromised due to the failure to adhere to regulatory requirements or for other reasons, then our development programs may be extended, delayed or terminated, or we may not be able to obtain marketing approval for or successfully commercialize NP101 or any other product candidates that we develop. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for NP101 and any other product candidates that we develop would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed. 42 Table of Contents Any collaboration arrangements that we may enter into in the future may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. We may seek collaboration arrangements with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the development or commercialization of our product candidates in the future. We may enter into such arrangements on a selective basis depending on the merits of retaining commercialization rights for ourselves as compared to entering into selective collaboration arrangements with leading pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for each product candidate, both in the U.S. and internationally. We face competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Moreover, collaboration arrangements are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement collaborations or other alternative arrangements should we choose to enter into such arrangements. The terms of any collaborations or other arrangements that we may establish may not be favorable to us. Any future collaborations that we enter into may not be successful. The success of our collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators. Collaborators generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations. Disagreements between parties to a collaboration arrangement regarding clinical development and commercialization matters can lead to delays in the development process or commercialization and, in some cases, termination of the collaboration arrangement. These disagreements can be difficult to resolve if neither of the parties has final decision making authority. Collaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies and other third parties often are terminated or allowed to expire by the other party. Any such termination or expiration could adversely affect us financially and could harm our business reputation. Risks Related to Regulatory Matters If we are unable to obtain marketing approval for NP101 or our other product candidates, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates and our business will be substantially harmed. Our product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the U.S. and by comparable authorities in other countries. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. As a company, we have not received approval from the FDA or demonstrated our ability to obtain marketing approval for any drugs that we have developed or are developing. Securing FDA approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the FDA to establish the product candidate's safety and efficacy. Securing FDA approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the FDA. Our other product candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. The process of obtaining marketing approvals is expensive and often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved and the nature of the disease or condition to be treated. We are seeking approval of NP101, and expect to seek approval of our other product candidates, pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) in the U.S., which enables an NDA applicant to rely in part on findings of safety and efficacy of a product 43 Table of Contents already approved by the FDA. We may fail to obtain marketing approval for NP101 or any other product candidates for many reasons, including the following: We may not be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication; The results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval; The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the number, design, conduct or implementation of our clinical trials; We may not be able to demonstrate that a product candidate's clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks; We may not be able to demonstrate that a product candidate provides an advantage over current standard of care or future competitive therapies in development; The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials; The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data generated at our clinical trial sites; The data collected from clinical trials of any product candidates that we develop may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA or other submission or to obtain marketing approval in the U.S. or elsewhere; The FDA may determine that we have identified the wrong reference listed drug or drugs or that approval of our 505(b)(2) application for NP101 or any other product candidate is blocked by patent or non-patent exclusivity of the reference listed drug or drugs; and The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may identify deficiencies in the manufacturing or testing processes or facilities of third party manufacturers with which we enter into agreements for clinical and commercial supplies. This lengthy approval process, as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results, may result in our failing to obtain marketing approval to market NP101 or any future product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects. Even if we obtain marketing approval for NP101 or any of our other product candidates, we will continue to face extensive regulatory requirements and our products may face future development and regulatory difficulties. Even if marketing approval in the U.S. is obtained, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a product's indicated uses or marketing, including risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or impose ongoing requirements, including with respect to: Post-market surveillance, post-market studies or post-market clinical trials; Labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information; Monitoring and reporting adverse events and instances of the failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA; Changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process; Advertising and other promotional material; and 44 Table of Contents Disclosure of clinical trial results on publicly available databases. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations. The distribution, sale and marketing of our products are subject to a number of additional requirements, including: State wholesale drug distribution laws and the distribution of our product samples to physicians must comply with the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act; Sales, marketing and scientific or educational grant programs must comply with the anti-kickback and fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the transparency provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and an associated reconciliation bill that became law in March 2010, which we refer to collectively as the Health Care Reform Law, the False Claims Act and similar state laws; Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veteran's Health Care Act of 1992; and If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. If we or any third parties involved in our commercialization efforts fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may: Issue warning letters or untitled letters asserting that we are in violation of the law; Seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines; Suspend or withdraw marketing approval; Suspend any ongoing clinical trials; Refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications submitted by us; Suspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; Seize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall; Refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts; Impose civil monetary penalties; or Pursue civil or criminal prosecutions and fines against our company or responsible officers. Any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response, and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenues. Even if we obtain marketing approval for NP101 or any of our other product candidates, adverse effects discovered after approval could limit the commercial profile of any approved product. If we obtain marketing approval for NP101 or any other product candidate that we develop, we or others may later discover, after use in a larger number of subjects for longer periods of time than in clinical trials, that our products could have adverse effect profiles that limit their usefulness or require 45 Table of Contents their withdrawal. This discovery could have a number of potentially significant negative consequences, including: Regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product; Regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as black box or other warnings or contraindications; Regulatory authorities may require us to issue specific communications to healthcare professionals, such as "Dear Doctor Letters;" Regulatory authorities may impose additional restrictions on marketing and distribution of the products; Regulatory authorities may issue negative publicity regarding the product, including safety communications; We may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical studies or restrict the distribution of the product; We could be sued and held liable for harm caused to subjects; and Our reputation may suffer. Any of these events could prevent us from maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates. We will need FDA approval of a trade name for NP101 and any failure or delay associated with such approval may delay the commercialization of NP101. Any trade name we intend to use for our product candidates will require approval from the FDA regardless of whether we have secured a formal trademark registration from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The FDA typically conducts a rigorous review of proposed trade names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other trade names and medical error. The FDA may also object to a trade name if it believes the name inappropriately implies medical claims. If the FDA objects to our proposed trade name we may be required to adopt an alternative name for our product candidate. Even after approval, the FDA may request that we adopt an alternative name for the product if adverse event reports indicate a potential for confusion with other trade names and medical error. If we are required to adopt an alternative name, the commercialization of NP101 could be delayed or interrupted, which would limit our ability to commercialize NP101 and generate revenues. If the FDA does not approve the manufacturing facilities of our third party manufacturers for commercial production, we may not be able to commercialize NP101 or any of our other product candidates. The facilities of our manufacturers must be approved by the FDA before approval of NP101. The FDA may also require the approval of one or more of our key component suppliers for NP101. We do not control the manufacturing process of NP101 and are dependent on third party manufacturers for compliance with the FDA's requirements for manufacture of NP101. If our manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material components and finished products that conform to our specifications and the FDA's strict regulatory requirements, they will not be able to secure FDA approval for their manufacturing facilities. If the FDA does not approve these facilities for the commercial manufacture of NP101, or the facilities of any of our other product candidates, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would result in significant delays of up to several years in obtaining FDA approval for NP101, or any of our other product candidates. We would incur substantial 46 Table of Contents additional costs as a result of any such delays, including with respect to finding alternative manufacturing facilities. Even if our product candidates receive marketing approval in the U.S., we may never receive marketing approval or commercialize our products outside the U.S. In order to market NP101 or any other product candidate outside the U.S., we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our product candidates. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. The marketing approval process in other countries may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval in the U.S., as well as other risks. For example, legislation analogous to Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA in the U.S., which relates to the ability of an NDA applicant to use published data not developed by such applicant, does not exist in other countries. In territories where data is not freely available, we may not have the ability to commercialize our products without negotiating rights from third parties to refer to their clinical data in our regulatory applications, which could require the expenditure of significant additional funds. Further, we may be unable to obtain rights to the necessary clinical data and may be required to develop our own proprietary safety and effectiveness dossiers. In addition, in many countries outside the U.S., it is required that a product receives pricing and reimbursement approval before the product can be commercialized. This can result in substantial delays in such countries. Marketing approval in one country does not ensure marketing approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining marketing approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. In addition, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution if we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed. Our relationships with customers and payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings. Healthcare providers, physicians and others play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third party payors and customers will expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following: The federal healthcare anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid; The federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making 47 Table of Contents a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; The federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; The federal transparency requirements under the Health Care Reform Law requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to physician payments and other transfers of value and physician ownership and investment interests; and Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws and transparency laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers, and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and drug pricing. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations could be costly. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations, including anticipated activities conducted by our sales team in the sale of NP101, are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Recently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain. In the U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell our products for which we obtain marketing approval. In the U.S., the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Modernization Act) changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the 48 Table of Contents coverage and price that we receive for any approved products. While the Medicare Modernization Act applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the Medicare Modernization Act may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. More recently, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Effective October 1, 2010, the Health Care Reform Law revises the definition of "average manufacturer price" for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states once the provision is effective. Further, beginning in 2011, the new law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners. We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law. Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the United States Congress of the FDA's approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. Risks Related to Intellectual Property We may not be able to rely on our intellectual property to protect our products in the marketplace. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to protect our competitive position through patents, trade secrets, trademarks and other intellectual property rights. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including our company, are uncertain and involve complex questions of law and fact for which important legal issues remain unresolved or may change. As a result of recent court decisions, the requirements for patentability of inventions in the U.S. have become more stringent, including stricter requirements that inventions be non-obvious and that patent applications provide an adequate written description of the invention. These court decisions may have the effect of narrowing the types of medical treatments that are patentable. The issued patents that we own and license or that may be issued to or licensed by us in the future may not provide us with any competitive advantage. Our patents may be challenged by third parties in patent litigation, or in patent reexamination or opposition proceedings, which are becoming widespread in the pharmaceutical industry. In particular, it is not uncommon for potential competitors to challenge the validity of patents protecting new pharmaceutical products shortly after the products receive FDA approval. Alternatively, it is possible that third parties with products that are very similar to ours will circumvent our issued patents by purposely developing products or processes that avoid our patent claims. Our patent protection may be limited because of any of the following: Our patents may not be broad or strong enough to prevent competition from identical or similar products; 49 Table of Contents We may be required to disclaim part of the term of some patents; There may be prior art of which we are not aware that may affect the validity or enforceability of a patent claim; There may be prior art of which we are aware, which we do not believe affects the validity or enforceability of a claim, but which, nonetheless ultimately may be found to affect the validity or enforceability of a claim; If challenged, a court could determine that our patents are not valid or enforceable; A court could determine that a competitor's technology or product does not infringe our patents; and Our patents and patent applications could irretrievably lapse due to failure to pay fees or otherwise comply with regulations, or could be subject to compulsory licensing. We own one issued U.S. patent and one allowed U.S. patent. Our issued U.S. patent is generally directed to methods of treating migraine using an iontophoretic patch containing a triptan. Our allowed U.S. patent is generally directed to methods of treating migraine by administering sumatriptan using an iontophoretic patch to achieve consistent plasma levels with low patient to patient variability. We have also licensed one issued U.S. patent that relates to an iontophoresis drug delivery system. We and our licensors have filed and are actively pursuing applications for patents in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. However, pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents or the scope of patent protection that we have requested, and we may not develop additional proprietary products which are patentable. Further, if we encounter delays in our development or clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market our products under patent protection would be reduced. Because the composition of matter patent covering the active pharmaceutical ingredient of NP101 has expired, competitors will be able to offer and sell products with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient as NP101 so long as these competitors do not infringe any other patents that may be issued to or licensed by us, including any product, formulation and method of use patents, or violate any marketing exclusivity period that may be granted. Similarly, the composition of matter patents covering the active ingredients of our NP201 and NP202 product candidates have expired, and competitors will be able to offer and sell products with the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as these product candidates products so long as these competitors do not infringe any other patents that we hold or may obtain in the future, including any product, formulation and method of use patents, or violate any marketing exclusivity period that may be granted. Patents covering new products or formulations incorporating a generic active pharmaceutical ingredient cannot prevent competitors from commercializing the original products and formulations. In addition, method-of-use patents, in particular, are more difficult to enforce than composition of matter patents because of the risk of off label sale or use of the subject compounds. Physicians are permitted to prescribe an approved product for uses that are not described in the product's labeling. Although off label prescriptions may infringe our method of use patents, if issued, the practice is common across medical specialties and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute. Off label sales would limit our ability to generate revenue from the sale of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale. In addition, if a third party were able to design around any issued product, method, formulation or other patent and create a different product not covered by our patents, if issued, we would likely be unable to prevent that third party from manufacturing and marketing its product. We rely on third parties to protect the intellectual property we license, including trade secrets, patents, and know-how, and we may not have any input or control over the filing, prosecution or enforcement of such intellectual property rights. Any resulting patents may be invalid or unenforceable. Any enforcement of intellectual property rights, or defense of any claims asserting the invalidity thereof, may be subject to the cooperation of the third parties. 50 Table of Contents If we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business. We are a party to a number of license agreements and may enter into additional licenses in the future. If we fail to comply with the obligations under a license agreement or otherwise breach the license agreement, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we might not be able to market any product that is covered by any previously licensed patents. For example, we are party to a license agreement with the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), pursuant to which we license from Penn patent applications and other intellectual property related to the LAD technology to develop and commercialize licensed products, including NP201 and NP202, and a license agreement with Evonik Industries AG, Inc. (as successor to SurModics Pharmaceuticals), pursuant to which we license from Evonik Industries intellectual property to make, have made, use, sell, import and export NP201. We are obligated to pay milestone and royalty payments under each agreement in addition to other obligations. The triggering of milestone payments to Penn or Evonik Industries depends on factors relating to the clinical and regulatory development and commercialization of NP201 and NP202, many of which are beyond our control. We may become obligated to make a milestone payment when we do not have the cash on hand to make such payment, which could require us to delay our clinical trials, curtail our operations, scale back our commercialization and marketing efforts or seek additional capital to meet these obligations on terms unfavorable to us. Our failure to comply with the requirements of these license agreements, including our milestone payment obligations, could result in the termination of such agreements, in which case we might not be able to develop or market any product that is covered by the license. Even if we contest any such termination and are ultimately successful, our results of operations and stock price could suffer. Our ability to pursue the development and commercialization of NP101 is significantly dependent upon obtaining a license of LTS's intellectual property. Our development and license agreement with LTS provides that if we enter into a commercial manufacturing agreement with LTS, LTS will have the exclusive right to manufacture NP101 and LTS will grant us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under LTS's intellectual property to use, import, sell, market and distribute NP101. We may not enter into a commercial manufacturing agreement with LTS on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we do not enter into a commercial manufacturing agreement with LTS, we may not have access to LTS's proprietary technology and know-how to manufacturer NP101. In this situation, we would need to develop equivalent or alternative intellectual property, which will significantly delay our commercialization of NP101 and entail significant additional cost. We may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may prevent or delay our product development efforts and stop us from commercializing or increase the costs of commercializing our products. Our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. There could be issued patents of which we are not aware that our products infringe. There also could be patents that we believe we do not infringe, but that we may ultimately be found to infringe. Moreover, patent applications are in some cases maintained in secrecy until patents are issued. The publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made and patent applications were filed. Because patents can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that our products infringe. For example, pending applications may exist that provide support or can be amended to provide support for a claim that results in an issued patent that our product infringes. 51 Table of Contents Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. If a court held that any third party patents cover our products, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize our products unless we obtained a license under the applicable patent or patents, or until such patents expire. We may not be able to enter into licensing arrangements or make other arrangements at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms. Any inability to secure licenses or alternative technology could result in delays in the introduction of our products or lead to prohibition of the manufacture or sale of products by us. If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be significantly diminished. In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect our intellectual property. We generally require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers and other advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements. These agreements typically provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during employment are our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Where appropriate, agreements we obtain with our consultants also typically contain similar assignment of invention provisions. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary information. Involuntary disclosure or misappropriation by third parties of our confidential proprietary information could enable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding our competitive position. In addition, it is possible that third parties could independently develop proprietary information and techniques substantially similar to ours or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. Risks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth If we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, including our current senior executive team, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy. Our ability to compete in the highly competitive pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. Competition for skilled personnel in our market is very intense because of the numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that seek similar personnel. These companies may have greater financial and other resources, offer a greater opportunity for career advancement and have a longer history in the industry than we do. We also experience competition for the hiring of our scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. We are highly dependent on Jane Hollingsworth, our chief executive officer, and Terri Sebree, our president. Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific and medical teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. We have formal employment agreements with all of our executive officers. All employees, including our executive officers, are employed at-will, which means that any of these employees could leave our employment at any time. We maintain "key person" insurance for each of Ms. Hollingsworth and Ms. Sebree. The total death benefit under each policy is $2.0 million and we are the only named beneficiary and owner of the policies. The policies have an initial term of ten years and are subject to renewal annually thereafter. We do not maintain "key person" insurance for any of our other employees. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could potentially harm our business, operating results or financial condition. 52 Table of Contents We will need to grow our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations. As of December 31, 2011, we employed 37 full-time employees. We expect to expand our employee base in the future for managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the anticipated commercialization of NP101 or development of additional product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or increase our revenues could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize NP101 and our other product candidates and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following: Any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to our ability to successfully complete the additional trials, tests, device enhancement, packaging modification and other activities to support the resubmission of our NDA for NP101 and our ability to obtain a waiver of a dermal carcinogenicity study or the FDA's review of our NDA for NP101, including the FDA's refusal to accept the NDA for substantive review or a request for additional information; Our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and capital requirements; The commercial success of NP101, if approved by the FDA; Results of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors; Changes or developments in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates; Introduction of competitive products or technologies; Failure to meet or exceed financial projections we provide to the public; Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results; Failure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community; The perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community; General economic and market conditions and overall fluctuations in U.S. equity markets; Developments concerning our sources of manufacturing supply; Disputes or other developments relating to patents or other proprietary rights; 53 Table of Contents Additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel; Issuances of debt, equity or convertible securities; Changes in the market valuations of similar companies; and The other factors described in this "Risk Factors" section. In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management's attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. Our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval. To our knowledge, as of December 31, 2011, our executive officers, directors and 5% stockholders and their affiliates owned approximately 75% of our outstanding voting stock, including shares subject to outstanding options and warrants that were exercisable within 60 days after December 31, 2011. As a result, these stockholders will have significant influence and may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This concentration of ownership could delay or prevent any acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire. Future sales of shares of our common stock, including shares issued upon the exercise of currently outstanding options and warrants could negatively affect our stock price. A substantial portion of our outstanding common stock can be traded without restriction at any time. Some of these shares are currently restricted as a result of securities laws, but may be able to be sold, subject to any applicable volume limitations under federal securities laws with respect to affiliate sales. As such, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell such shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, we have 1,784,285 shares that are subject to outstanding options, and 200,268 shares that are subject to outstanding warrants. The exercise of these options and warrants and the subsequent sale of the underlying common stock could cause a further decline in our stock price. These sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Because we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, your returns will be limited to any increase in the value of our stock. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to support our operations and finance the growth and development of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock. 54 Table of Contents Some provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL) could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions include: the ability of our Board of Directors to authorize the issuance of "blank check" preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval; the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; the inability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings. These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing our officers. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by our board of directors. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders. Proxy contests have been waged against many companies in the pharmaceutical industry over the last few years. If faced with a proxy contest, we may not be able to successfully respond to the contest, which would be disruptive to our business. Even if we are successful, our business could be adversely affected by a proxy contest because: Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders may be costly and time-consuming, and may disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees; Perceived uncertainties as to the potential outcome of any proxy contest may result in our inability to consummate potential acquisitions, collaborations or licensing opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners; and If individuals that have a specific agenda different from that of our management or other members of our board of directors are elected to our board as a result of any proxy contest, such an election may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our stockholders. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS We do not have any unresolved SEC staff comments relating to our periodic or current reports. 55 Table of Contents
