PART II Item 13. Defaults, Dividend Arrearages and Delinquencies Not applicable. Item 14. Material Modifications to the Rights of Security Holders and Use of Proceeds Use of Proceeds The following discussion relates to the initial public offering our ADSs by us and certain selling shareholders, pursuant to a registration statement on Form F-1 (File No. 333-119606), which was completed on November 2, 2004. The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on October 27, 2004. We received net proceeds (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses related to the offering) of approximately US$42 million from the offering 4,602,547 ADSs, representing 9,205,094 ordinary shares. None of the transaction expenses included payments to our directors, executive officers, persons owning 10% or more of our equity securities or our affiliates. Deutsche Bank Securities, WR Hambrecht + Co, and Allen & Company LLC were the underwriters for the offering. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of our ADSs by the selling shareholders. From November 2, 2004 through May 31, 2006, we have not used any of the net proceeds from our initial public offering. Net proceeds from the offering have been invested in short-term bank deposits. Item 15. Controls and Procedures We performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2005. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the material financial and non-financial information required to be disclosed in this annual report on Form 20-F and filed with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner. The evaluation was performed with the participation of our key corporate senior management, and under the supervision of our Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, Derek Palaschuk, and our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, Thomas SooHoo. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, rather than absolute, assurances of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our management, including our CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting subsequent to the date of our most recent evaluation that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 78 Table of Contents Item 16A.

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of eLong, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The accompanying consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 have been translated into United States dollars solely for the convenience of the reader.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) December 31, 2004 and 2005 eLong Airline Service (former Global Link) is a domestic company incorporated in Hangzhou. In April 2005, Beijing Airline acquired 100% interest in Global Link for RMB 830,000, and renamed it eLong Airline Service.

The registered capital of eLong Airline Service is RMB 1,500,000. The equity interests in the VIEs were all funded by the Chairman of the Board of Directors and employees of the Company through loans obtained from the Company or eLong Information as described below. The Company has economic controlling interest over the VIEs through a series of related agreements, including exclusive technical services agreements, equity pledge agreements, operating agreements and loan agreements. Through these agreements, the Company is the primary beneficiary of these entities as it absorbs a majority of the VIEs expected losses and receives a majority of the VIEs expected residual returns. A summary of certain key agreements with the VIEs is as follows: Exclusive Technical Services Agreements. eLong Information provides the VIEs with technical consulting and related services and information services. eLong Information is the exclusive provider of these services. These agreements are effective as long as eLong Information operates and is in existence. In consideration for the services provided by eLong Information, the VIEs agree to pay service fees to eLong Information based on market rates. Equity Pledge Agreements. The equity shareholders have pledged their respective equity interests in the VIEs to eLong Information as a guarantee for the payment by the VIEs of technical and consulting services fees under the exclusive technical services agreements described above. Additionally, the equity shareholders have agreed not to sell, transfer or assign their rights and interests in the VIEs without prior written consent from eLong Information. Operating Agreements. The VIEs and their equity shareholders have each agreed that they will not enter into any transaction, or fail to take any action, that would substantially affect their assets, rights and obligations, or the operations of VIEs, without eLong Informations prior written consent. In addition, the VIEs will also appoint persons designated by eLong Information as their directors, officers and other senior management, as well as accept eLong Informations guidance regarding the day-to-day operations, financial management and the personnel management of the VIEs. F-8 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) December 31, 2004 and 2005 Loan Agreements. Loans granted to the Chairman of the Board of Directors and employees of the Company were made for the sole and exclusive purpose of providing funds necessary for the equity capitalization and the acquisition of the VIEs. Upon the Chinese government lifting its restrictions on foreign ownership of the air ticketing, travel agency, advertising, or Internet content provision businesses in China, as applicable, the Company, eLong Information or any third party designated by the Company will exercise its unassignable option to purchase all outstanding equity interests of the VIEs for nil consideration and the loans will be discharged. The Company has adopted FASB Interpretation No.46 Revised, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No.51 (FIN 46R). FIN46R requires variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. Since the Company, through eLong Information, is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs, the financial position and results of operations of Beijing Information, Beijing Media, Beijing Airline, GCH, Beijing Travel, ZM VIP and eLong Airline Service have been consolidated in the Companys consolidated financial statements. The long term loans to the Chairman of the Board of Directors and employees of the Company as discussed above are eliminated on consolidation. (2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (a) Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and VIEs. All significant transactions and balances between the Company, its subsidiaries and VIEs have been eliminated on consolidation. (b) Basis of presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP). (c) Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management of the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts and deferred tax assets, provision for loyalty points, stock-based compensation, asset depreciation lives, and carrying values of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangibles, based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates. (d) Foreign currencies The Companys functional and reporting currency is the Renminbi (RMB). Assets and liabilities of the Companys subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs whose functional currency is not the RMB are translated at year end exchange rates. Income and expense items are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. The adjustment resulting from translating the financial statements of such subsidiaries and entities is reflected as a separate component of shareholders equity. Because the local currency of the Companys subsidiaries and consolidated VIEs is also the RMB, there were no adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements of such subsidiaries and entities for the periods presented. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into RMB using the applicable exchange rates quoted by the Peoples Bank of China at the balance sheet dates. All such exchange gains and losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations. F-9 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) December 31, 2004 and 2005 Translations of amounts from RMB into United States dollars (U.S. dollars) are solely for the convenience of the reader and were calculated at the rate of US$1.00 = RMB8.0702, representing the noon buying rate in the City of New York for cable transfers of RMB, as certified for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on December 31, 2005. No such translation is intended to imply that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted, realized or settled into U.S. dollars at that rate on December 31, 2005, or at any other rate. (e) Commitments and contingencies Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. (f) Revenue recognition The Groups revenues are principally derived from the provision of travel services, including hotel reservation, air ticketing and other related travel services. The Group recognizes revenues when all of the following have occurred: persuasive evidence of an agreement or arrangement with the customer exists, services have been performed, the fees for services performed are fixed or determinable and collectibility of the fees is reasonably assured. These criteria as related to the Groups revenues are considered to have been met as follows: Hotel reservation services The Group receives commissions from travel suppliers for hotel room reservations booked through the Groups transaction and service platform. Commissions from hotel reservation services rendered are recognized after hotel customers have completed their stay at the applicable hotel. The Group presents revenues from such transactions on a net basis in the statements of operations, as the Group acts as an agent, does not assume any inventory risks, and has no obligations for cancelled hotel reservations. Contracts with certain travel suppliers contain escalating commissions that are subject to achieving specific performance targets. Such escalating commissions are recognized when the performance targets have been achieved. Air ticketing services The Group receives commissions from travel suppliers for air ticketing services booked through the Groups transaction and service platform. Commissions from air ticketing services rendered are recognized after air tickets are issued and delivered to the customer, net of estimated future cancellations. Estimated future cancellations were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005. The Group presents revenues from such transactions on a net basis in the statements of operations, as the Group acts as an agent, does not assume any inventory risks, and has no obligations for cancelled airline ticket reservations. Other travel services Revenue from the sale of VIP and co-branded membership cards is recognized when the cards are sold, since the Group has no remaining and unfilled contractual obligation to perform services. Other non travel services Other services primarily comprise wireless services and Internet-related advertising services. Revenue from Internet-related advertising contracts, which is paid in cash, is recognized over the period of the advertising contract when the advertisements are displayed. Revenue from the provision of wireless services is recognized when the services have been delivered, the amount can be reliably measured and there is no uncertainty of settlement with the telecom operators. F-10 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) December 31, 2004 and 2005 The Groups service related revenues are subject to a 5% business tax on revenues generated from services in China. In addition, advertising service revenue is subject to a cultural development surcharge at 3% of the advertising service revenue. Business tax and surcharges are reflected as an operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations. (g) Cost of services Cost of services consists primarily of payroll compensation, telecommunication expenses, depreciation, rental, air ticket delivery cost and related expenses incurred by the Groups transaction and service platforms which are directly attributable to the rendering of the Groups travel services and other related services. (h) Service development Service development costs include expenses incurred by the Group to develop the Groups travel supplier transaction and service platforms as well as to maintain, monitor and manage the Groups websites. The Group recognizes website and software development costs in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) No.98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, and Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 00-2, Accounting for Web Site Development Costs. The Group expenses all costs that are incurred in connection with the planning and implementation phases of development and costs that are associated with repair or maintenance of the existing websites. The costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 were nil, nil and RMB1,951,425, respectively. (i) Sales and marketing Sales and marketing costs consist primarily of costs of advertising expenses, commission fees, production costs of marketing materials, expenses associated with the Groups customer loyalty program and payroll and related compensation for the Groups sales and marketing personnel. Promotional, advertising and online search expenditures are expensed as incurred. Internet advertising expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the advertising agreement. (j) Income taxes Deferred income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the amount of deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In accordance with SFAS No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes, the tax benefits associated with the utilization of pre-acquisition net operating losses carryforwards for which a valuation allowance was established at the date of the acquisition are recognized in the consolidated financial statements after the acquisition date as follows: (i) first to reduce to zero any goodwill related to the acquisition; (ii) second to reduce to zero other non-current intangible assets related to the acquisition; and (iii) third to reduce income tax expense. (k) Stock based compensation The Company accounts for employees stock based arrangements using the preferable fair value recognition provision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Under the fair value based method, compensation cost related to employee stock option or similar equity instruments is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and F-11 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) December 31, 2004 and 2005 warrants. Compensation cost related to 2005 employee Performance Units, which are awards in the form of units that are denominated in an equivalent number of the Companys ordinary shares and which are settled in the Companys ordinary shares upon vesting, is determined based on the fair market value of the Companys ordinary shares on the date immediately preceding the grant date. Such compensation cost is recognized over the vesting term on a straight-line basis. The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employee vendors in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and EITF Issue No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services. All transactions in which goods or services are received in exchange for equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date of the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the date on which the counterpartys performance is completed. (l) Provisions for loyalty points Cardholders of the VIP, regular, and co-branded cards issued by the Group earn loyalty points based on their usage of the cards. The Group provides travel awards and other non-cash gifts to the cardholders upon redemption of loyalty points that are accumulated based on cardholders transactions with the Group. The estimated costs to provide free travel and other non-cash gifts are recognized based on historical redemption data and are included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations. (m) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and in bank and certificates of deposit with an initial term of less than three months. For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Group considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents, except for those amounts that are restricted. (n) Trade accounts receivable Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are non-interest bearing. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Groups best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Groups existing accounts receivable. The Group reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts periodically and determines the allowance mainly based on historical write-off experience by customer types, the aging of the accounts receivable balance and customers credit worthiness. Specific accounts are reviewed individually for collectibility. Accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Group does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers. (o) Investment securities Investment securities classified as available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities are determined on a specific identification basis. A decline in the market value of available-for-sale securities below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value. In determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, the Company considers whether it has the ability and intent to hold the investment until a market price recovery and whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary. Evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to year end, and forecasted performance of the investee. The impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established. F-12 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) December 31, 2004 and 2005 (p) Equipment and software Equipment and software are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Equipment held under capital leases is initially recorded at the present value of minimum lease payments, which approximates the fair value at the inception of the lease. Interest expense on capital leases is recognized using the effective interest rate method. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives, taking into account any estimated residual value: Capitalized software development cost 3 years Computer equipment and system software 3-5 years Furniture, fixtures and office equipment 5 years Leasehold improvements are depreciated and amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful lives of the assets, usually 3 to 5 years. (q) Impairment of long-lived assets Separately identifiable intangible assets consist of two customer lists and trade names. These assets have determinable lives and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from 4 to 12 years. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with estimable useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company recognizes impairment of long-lived assets in the event that the carrying value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. An impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. (r) Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired. The Company follows the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if certain circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist. The Company completes its annual impairment assessment for goodwill and intangible assets in December of each year. The Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. In the first step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined based upon a combination of multiple of earnings, discounted future cash flows and the projected profitability of the market in which it operates. In the case that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the book value of the goodwill. In determining the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill, the fair values of the tangible net assets and recognized and unrecognized intangible assets are deducted from the fair value of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and is written down to its implied fair value. The impairment test on an intangible asset that is not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. F-13 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) December 31, 2004 and 2005 (s) Employee benefit plans As stipulated by the regulations of the PRC, the Group participates in various defined contribution plans organized by municipal and provincial governments for its employees. Under these plans, certain pension, medical and other welfare benefits are provided to employees. The Group is required to make contributions to these plans at rates ranging from 33.0% to 44.5% of the salaries, bonuses and certain allowances of the employees. The Group has no other material obligation for the payment of employee benefits associated with these plans beyond the annual contributions described above. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, the Group contributed RMB 3,126,707, RMB 9,251,581 and RMB 12,557,754 to these plans, respectively. (t) Statutory reserves Under PRC law, the Companys wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries are required to provide for certain statutory reserves, namely a general reserve, an enterprise expansion fund and a staff welfare and bonus fund. These subsidiaries are required to allocate at least 10% of their after tax profits on a separate company basis as determined under PRC GAAP to the general reserve and have the right to discontinue allocations to the general reserve if such reserve has reached 50% of registered capital on a separate company basis. Appropriations to the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund are at the discretion of the Board of Directors of these subsidiaries. The Companys VIEs in the PRC are also subject to similar statutory reserve requirements. These reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to the Company in the form of loans, advances, or cash dividends. (u) Earning (loss) per share In accordance with SFAS No.128, Computation of Earnings Per Share, basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) available to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary and dilutive ordinary equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Ordinary equivalent shares consist of the ordinary shares issuable upon the conversion of the preferred shares (using the as-converted method) and ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, stock warrants and the settlement of Performance Units. Ordinary equivalent shares in the diluted income (loss) per share computation are excluded in net loss periods as their effect would be anti-dilutive. Ordinary shares include high-vote ordinary shares. (v) Segment reporting The Group has one reportable operating segment, which is the provision of travel services in the PRC. The Group manages its business as a single operating segment and substantially all of its revenues are derived in China. Accordingly, no segment information is presented. (w) Recently issued accounting standards In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)). The new pronouncement replaces the existing requirements under SFAS No. 123 and APB 25. Under SFAS No. 123(R), all forms of share-based payments to employees, including employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans, are be treated the same as any other form of compensation by recognizing the related cost in the statement of operations. This pronouncement eliminates the ability to account for stock-based compensation transactions using APB No. 25 and requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value based method. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) with respect to the SECs interpretation of SFAS 123 (R) and the valuation of share-based payments for public companies. The Company adopted SFAS No.123(R) on January 1, 2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R) did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements, as the Company already accounts for all stock-based compensations using the fair value-based approach, which is the preferred method under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. F-14 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) December 31, 2004 and 2005 In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets  An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29 (SFAS No.153). This statement eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance  that is, transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity. This Statement will be effective for the Company for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring on or after January 1, 2006. The application of SFAS No.153 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In May 2005, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (SFAS No. 154). SFAS No. 154 establishes, unless impracticable, retrospective application to prior periods as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to a newly adopted accounting principle. This statement will be effective for the Company for all accounting changes and any error corrections occurring after January 1, 2006. (3) ACQUISITIONS (a) Shanghai Xinwang Computer Technology Co., Ltd. (Fortune Trip) and Bravado Investments Limited (Bravado) On July 7, 2005, the Company completed the purchase of 100% of the outstanding equity interests of Fortune Trip and Bravado, which were previously subsidiaries of and owned by Sina Corp. prior to the acquisition date, from Sina Corp. The total purchase price for Fortune Trip and Bravado was, US$2,567,637 (RMB21, 417,606), plus capitalized acquisition costs of RMB1, 394,134. The total purchase price (i) excludes contingent consideration of US$375,000 (RMB 3,026,325) contingent upon certain employment conditions that due to employment conditions not being met will not become payable and (ii) excludes a post-closing purchase price adjustment of US$807,363 (RMB 6,515,581). As of December 31, 2005, US$2,000,000 (RMB 16,553,000) was paid at closing, the remaining US$ 567,637 (RMB 4,864,607) is payable during 2006, subject to further possible adjustments for deficiencies in the net asset value which will be determined in 2006. Fortune Trip and Bravado are together principally engaged in the business of providing online and offline hotel reservation services in the PRC. As a result of the acquisition, the Company was able to expand its online and offline hotel reservation services. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase business combination and the results of operations from the date of acquisition have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements. F-15 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) December 31, 2004 and 2005 The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. The Company obtained third-party valuation of all intangible assets acquired through this acquisition. RMB RMB Total purchase price 21,417,606 Acquisition cost 1,394,134 Current assets acquired 3,300,804 Equipment acquired 1,176,904 Identifiable intangible assets acquired 4,500,000 Total assets acquired 8,977,708 Short-term loan assumed (6,000,000 ) Other current liabilities assumed (3,732,574 ) Total liabilities assumed (9,732,574 ) Net liabilities assumed (754,866 ) Goodwill * 23,566,606 * Goodwill is not tax deductible. The excess of purchase price, including capitalized acquisition cost of RMB1,394,134, over tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired of RMB 8,977,708 and liabilities assumed of RMB 9,732,574 was recorded as goodwill (See Note 8). The goodwill represents the benefits that the acquired business is expected to bring to the Company in the future primarily through increase in volume of reservation business and reduction in operating costs due to synergy. Identifiable intangible assets of RMB 4,500,000, include a customer list valued at RMB 4,100,000, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over five years and a trade name valued at RMB 400,000, which has been determined to have an indefinite life. The short-term loan assumed represented an entrusted loan of RMB 6,000,000, which was borrowed by Fortune Trip, through China Merchant Bank, from a subsidiary of Sina Corp. The short-term loan was non- interest bearing and matures in June 2006. The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information reflects the results of operations for eLong, Inc. for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, as if the acquisition of Fortune Trip and Bravado had occurred on January 1, 2004, and after giving effect to purchase accounting adjustments. These unaudited pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of what operating results would have been had the acquisition actually taken place on January 1, 2004, and may not be indicative of future operating results.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) December 31, 2004 and 2005 (b) RayTime Consultants Limited (RayTime BVI) and Beijing Zhong Ming VIP Marketing Consultants Co., Ltd. (ZM VIP) On November 26, 2004, the Company completed the purchase of 80% of the outstanding equity interest of RayTime BVI and its wholly-owned subsidiary Golden VIP. Prior to this acquisition, the selling shareholders formed RayTime BVI and Golden VIP and, through an assets and business transfer agreement, transferred the predecessor RayTimes membership card business, consisting of customer lists and the tradenames, and certain office equipment to Golden VIP. In connection with the purchase, no other assets or liabilities of the predecessor RayTime business were purchased or assumed by the Company. RayTime BVI is principally engaged as an agent in the sale of membership discount cards between end-customers and hotels in the PRC. As a result of the acquisition, the Company gained access to the membership card business. The final purchase price for RayTime BVI and Golden VIP was RMB17,620,932, including capitalized acquisition costs of RMB1,126,162. The final purchase price (i) excludes contingent consideration of RMB11,289,473 that due to certain post closing milestones not being met will not become payable and (ii) excludes RMB200,000 payable to the selling shareholder for employment services rendered to the Company and (iii) reflects an amendment to the original purchase agreement whereby RMB 3,000,000 originally required to be paid for employment services was no longer contingent on future employment. As of December 31, 2005, RMB 12,694,770 was paid and the remaining RMB 4,000,000 is payable in 2006. As a result of the sale of RayTime BVI in May 2006, the remaining consideration payable has been subsequently cancelled. The purchase price was determined in arms length negotiations between the Company and the shareholders of RayTime BVI. The acquisition of RayTime BVI has been accounted for as a purchase business combination and the results of operations from the date of acquisition have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements.

The impairment charges were all associated with the acquisitions of Raytime BVI, Golden VIP and ZM VIP (Collectively, Raytime). The method used in the Companys testing of identifiable intangible assets impairment are as follows: 1) The testing of identifiable intangible assets impairment was triggered by a significant reduction in forecasted sales and cash flows. The reduction in forecasted sales and cash flows was due to the inability of Raytime entities to attract quality hotels thus restricting its ability to grow its revenues, certain hotels determining to operate their own programs rather than outsourcing to Raytime entities and the costs of maintaining the loyalty membership programs were significantly higher than forecasted resulting in losses on a number of projects; 2) The Company determined whether the carrying amounts of the identifiable intangible assets were recoverable by comparing the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of these assets to the carrying amounts; 3)The Company then determined the fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to the Raytime acquisitions, supported by an independent valuation performed by a third party valuation firm; 4) Finally, the Company compared the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets related to the Raytime entities to the carrying value of these assets. In performing the identifiable intangible assets impairment test for the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recognized an intangible assets impairment of RMB 3,081,943 related to the Raytime acquisitions as the fair value of these intangible assets was determined to be nil.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) December 31, 2004 and 2005 Raytime BVI, Golden VIP and ZM VIP comprise the Raytime reporting unit which is one level below the Companys operating segment. The goodwill arising from these acquisitions and the related assets and liabilities, including intangible assets, were allocated to the Raytime reporting unit. The method used in the Companys testing of goodwill impairment related to the Raytime reporting unit was as follows: 1) The Company, supported by an independent valuation performed by a third party valuation firm, determined the fair value of the Raytime reporting unit by estimating the expected discounted future cash flows of the Raytime reporting unit. In estimating the discounted future cash flows, the Company followed FASB Concepts Statement No. 7, Using Cash Flow Information and Present Value in Accounting Measurements, by taking into account the Companys expectations about possible variations in the amount or timing of those cash flows, and the risk-free interest rate; 2) The Company then compared the fair value of the Raytime reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill; 3) Since the fair value of the Raytime reporting unit was less than the carrying value, the second step was performed in which the Company compared the implied fair value of the Raytime reporting units goodwill to the book value of the goodwill. In performing the goodwill impairment test for the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment of RMB 14,462,720 related to the Raytime reporting unit as the implied fair value of Raytime goodwill was determined to be nil. After recognition of the impairment charges, the carrying values of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill related to Raytime reporting unit were nil as of December 31, 2005.

Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon an assessment of the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible or can be utilized, management has provided a valuation allowance of RMB 21,452,972 and RMB14,927,788 as of December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively. After reducing the deferred tax assets by the valuation allowance, the deferred tax assets of RMB 585,839 and RMB 83,653 as of December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively, represent the deferred tax assets of entities that have been profitable and therefore are more likely than not to be realized. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced. (13) LEASES The Group has several non-cancelable operating leases, primarily for office rent. Lease payments under operating leases net of any incentives, including periodic rent escalation and free rent period, are charged as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The option mirrors the provisions of the option granted to the Companys officers on October 1, 2004. The option becomes exercisable by Expedia Australia each time any such officer exercises any of the 250,000 options. In connection with each exercise by an officer, Expedia Australia is entitled to exercise a portion of its option such that Expedia Australia would receive (if Expedia Australia exercises its option to the fullest extent in connection with such officer exercise) 51% of the aggregate ordinary shares issued to such officer and Expedia Australia in connection with such officer exercise. To the extent that any of the officers options terminate or expire without being exercised, an amount of Expedia Australias option equal to 51% of (i) such officers terminated or expired options divided by (ii) 0.49 will likewise terminate or expire. On the date of grant, the fair value of the 260,204 options granted to Expedia Australia was RMB 6,618,108 and will be recognized over the vesting term.

Warrants In August 2003, the Company issued warrants to purchase 600,000 of the Companys ordinary shares at an exercise price of US$0.75 per share to Broadband Capital Management LLC (Broadband), an investment banking and financial advisory firm, and two outside consultants, one of whom is a non-employee shareholder of the Company, in consideration for investment banking services provided to the Company in respect of the private placement of US$15 million aggregate principal amount of Series A preferred shares in August 2003 (see Note 15). The Company also paid US$250,000 (RMB2,070,000) to Broadband for services provided in connection with this private placement. The Company accounted for the warrants issued to Broadband and the two consultants in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and EITF Issue No. 96-18. The fair value of the warrants granted was RMB4,818,960 on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model (excluding a volatility assumption as the Company was a non-public entity at the date the warrants were issued). The assumptions used in determining the fair value of the warrants were as follows: expected dividend yield 0%, risk free interest rate of 2.9%, and a contractual life of 10 years. The estimated fair value of the warrants of RMB4,818,960 and the cash payment of US$250,000 (RMB2,070,000) was charged against the gross proceeds of the Series A preferred shares as such costs were incremental and specifically and directly attributable to the actual placement of such securities. During the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, 425,366 and 98,973 warrants were exercised into the same number of ordinary shares. As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2005, the number of warrants outstanding and exercisable was 124,634 and 25,661. Preferred Shares In May 2004, certain of the Companys shareholders, Tiger Technology Private Investment Partners, L.P., Tiger Technology II, L.P., Blue Ridge Limited Partnership, Blue Ridge Offshore Master Limited Partnership and RMG Holdings, LLC, collectively sold an aggregate of 150,000 Series A preferred shares to the Companys chief financial officer, at a price of US$1.53 per share. Due to the purchase of these 150,000 Series A preferred shares by the Companys chief financial officer from a principal shareholders group at a price below fair market value, the Company recorded a stock-based compensation expense of RMB3,923,108 in the year ended December 31, 2004. The amount of stock based compensation expense represented the difference between the purchase price of US$1.53 and US$4.69, which was the Companys best estimate of the fair market value of the Series A preferred shares at the time of the sale. F-32 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) December 31, 2004 and 2005 (15) PREFERRED SHARES Series A Preferred Shares On August 29, 2003, the Company received US$ 15,000,000 (RMB124,162,500) from four investorsTiger Technology Private Investment Partners, L.P., Tiger Technology II, L.P., Blue Ridge Limited Partnership, and RMG Holdings, LLC, in exchange for 9,787,494 Series A preferred shares. The Series A preferred shares contained the following terms: Liquidation Preference In the event of any liquidation, winding up, change of control or asset sale situations of the Company, the preferred shareholders were entitled to receive, prior to any distribution to the holders of ordinary shares or any other class or series of shares, an amount equal to the preferred shareholders capital investment, plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon. Thereafter, the remaining assets available for distribution to shareholders would be distributed ratably to all shareholders on an as-converted basis. Conversion Series A preferred shares were convertible at any time into ordinary shares at the option of the preferred shareholders at a rate of one-to-one. Such shares also would be automatically converted into ordinary shares upon the consummation by the Company of an initial public offering. In addition, a majority vote of the Series A preferred shareholders could also trigger automatic conversion. Dividend Rights No dividend, whether in cash, in property or in shares of the capital of the Company, was allowed to be paid on any other class or series of shares of the Company unless and until a dividend in like amount was first paid in full on the Series A preferred shares (on an as converted basis). Voting Rights Each Series A preferred share carried the same number of votes as an ordinary share. Redemption Series A preferred shares were not redeemable at the option of the holder. All of the then-outstanding Series A Preferred Shares were converted into an equal number of ordinary shares effective upon the completion of the Companys initial public offering on November 2, 2004. (See Note 16) Series B Preferred Shares On August 4, 2004, the Company issued and sold 11,188,570 Series B preferred shares to Expedia Australia, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Expedia, Inc. (or Expedia) for an aggregate purchase price of US$58,690,062 (RMB485,777,647), or US$5.25 per Series B preferred share. The terms of Series B preferred shares, including liquidation preference, conversion, dividend rights, voting rights and redemption, are substantially the same as those of the Series A preferred shares. Pursuant to the Expedia Australia purchase agreements, the Company used approximately one-half, or US$29,345,029 (RMB242,888,731), of the proceeds from the sale of the Series B preferred shares to repurchase from existing shareholders an aggregate of 4,012,411 of its ordinary shares and 1,581,874 of the Companys Series A preferred shares at a purchase price of US$5.25 per share. After the share repurchase, the Company retained US$29,345,033 (RMB242,888,916) of the aggregate purchase price. Of that amount US$4,401,754 (RMB 36,433,318) was deposited into an escrow account which was subject to (i) possible claims by Expedia Australia for indemnification under the agreement between the Company and Expedia Australia for representations, warranties and covenants provided by the Company, and (ii) payment to Expedia Australia for certain post-closing matters. On August 4, 2005, 25% of the escrow funds were released to the Company and the F-33 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) December 31, 2004 and 2005 balance of the escrow funds were released after March 31, 2006. The Companys maximum liability for indemnification with respect to breaches of its major representations is US$58,690,062. As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2005, US$84,364 (RMB 698,240) and US$121,418 (RMB1,005,341) was paid by the Company to Expedia Australia through the escrow account as a result of the indemnification. Also in connection with the sale of the Series B preferred shares, on August 4, 2004 the Company granted Expedia Australia a warrant which was exercisable by Expedia Australia during the first 30 business days following the completion of the Companys initial public offering. Expedia Australias warrant entitled it to purchase that number of the Companys high-vote ordinary shares which would result in Expedia Australias holding 51% of the Companys outstanding ordinary shares on a fully-diluted basis after giving effect to the repurchase from existing shareholders of a number of ordinary shares equal to one-half of the shares purchased by Expedia Australia pursuant to its warrant. The exercise price for the warrant was to be calculated as the lower of (a) the initial public offering price or (b) the price determined using: (1) US$205 million, minus the Companys indebtedness, plus the Companys cash and cash equivalents, plus the pro forma consideration that would be received in connection with the exercise of all vested or unvested in-the-money options (but excluding issued upon the closing of the Companys initial public offering), warrants or other convertible securities of the Company, in each case at the time of exercise, divided by (2) the total number of the Companys outstanding ordinary shares on a fully-diluted basis at the time of exercise (but excluding out-of-the-money options, warrants or securities and certain options granted to certain director and employees upon the closing of the Companys initial public offering). The estimated fair value of the warrant was determined to be RMB 84,906,056 as determined by a third party professional valuation firm and accordingly, a portion of the proceeds of the Series B preferred shares relating to the fair value of the warrants has been presented as a separate component in the accompanying consolidated statements of shareholders equity and comprehensive income. Further, in connection with the issuance and sale of the Series B Preferred shares, the Company also granted to Expedia Australia an option to purchase up to 711,429 ordinary shares at a purchase price of US$5.25 per ordinary share. The option becomes exercisable by Expedia Australia each time any officer or employee exercises any of the 1,660,000 options granted to him or her by the Company on July 23, 2004. In connection with each exercise by an employee or officer, Expedia Australia is entitled to exercise a portion of its option such that Expedia Australia would receive (if Expedia Australia exercises its option to the fullest extent in connection with such employee or officer exercise) 30% of the aggregate ordinary shares issued to such employee or officer and Expedia Australia in connection with such employee or officer exercise. To the extent that any such officer or employees options terminate or expire without being exercised, an amount of Expedia Australias options equal to 30% of (i) such employees terminated or expired options divided by (ii) 0.70 will likewise terminate or expire. The estimated fair value of the options determined under the Black-Scholes option pricing model was not material and accordingly, the portion of the proceeds of the Series B preferred shares relating to the fair value of the options was not presented as a separate component within the statement of shareholders equity and comprehensive income. Under the Expedia Australia purchase agreements, Series A preferred shareholders and Expedia Australia each had a right of first offer with respect to any sales or issuances by the Company of any of the Companys securities after August 4, 2004 (including with respect to the issuance on October 1, 2004 of the 250,000 options), which gave each of them the right to buy, on the same terms, up to a portion of such issuance equal to the proportion that the number of shares held by such shareholder bore to the total number of the Companys outstanding ordinary shares, on an as-converted and fully-diluted basis. This right of first offer expired upon the completion of the Companys initial public offering in November 2004. Prior to October 1, 2004, each of the Series A shareholders waived their respective rights of first offer with respect to the issuance by the Company on October 1, 2004, of the 250,000 options to certain of its officers and the issuance by the Company to Expedia Australia of an option to purchase up to 260,204 of the Companys ordinary shares on October 1, 2004, as described in Note 14. As of December 31, 2005, Expedia Australia held options to purchase 916,347 ordinary shares. F-34 Table of Contents eLong, Inc.

As a result of Expedia Australias exercise of its warrant, the Company is controlled by Expedia, and Expedia has the power to control substantially the Companys management and business operations. The Company used approximately one-half of the proceeds from Expedia Australias warrant exercise, or US$53,909,426 (RMB 446,181,365) (US$6.21 per share), to purchase 8,681,067 ordinary shares from certain of the Companys existing shareholders. The repurchases of ordinary shares included the purchase of 40,506 ordinary shares, for an aggregate of $251,313 (RMB 2,079,992) (after taking into consideration the adjustment in the repurchase price), from the Companys chief financial officer, and 4,293,156 ordinary shares, for an aggregate of $26,636,199 (RMB220,454,501) (after taking into consideration the adjustment in the repurchase price), from a company controlled by a former member of the Companys Board of Directors. Of the remaining US$53,909,426 (RMB 446,181,365) paid to the Company, US$8,086,414 (RMB 66,927,205) was deposited into an escrow account which was subject to (i) possible claims by Expedia Australia for indemnification under the agreement between the Company and Expedia Australia for representations, warranties and covenants provided by the Company, and (ii) payment to Expedia Australia for certain post-closing matters. Such warrant exercise price and share repurchase price were subject to a post-closing adjustment based upon the actual indebtedness of the Company as of December 15, 2004. On March 31, 2006, a post-closing adjustment was made such that the warrant exercise price and share repurchase price was adjusted to $6.20434 per share (the equivalent of $12.40868 per ADS). The warrant exercise price and share repurchase price are no longer subject to any adjustments. As of December 31, 2005, as a result of the adjustments to the warrant purchase price and the share repurchase price, the Company recorded US$98,269 (RMB790,236) due to Expedia Australia with a corresponding reduction to additional paid-in capital, and recorded US$49,134 (RMB395,118) due from certain of the Companys existing shareholders with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital.

In addition, certain other shareholders are parties to an investors agreement with Expedia Australia under which they have agreed to vote their ordinary shares in the election of directors designated by Expedia Australia. Expedia F-36 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) December 31, 2004 and 2005 Australia has the ability to control the composition of the Companys Board of Directors, including the right to select six of the thirteen members of the Board, the ability to nominate the remaining directors and vote their shares to elect them and the right to vote their shares to remove members of the Board of Directors. The rights of the ordinary shares and high-vote ordinary shares are the same except that each high-vote ordinary share is entitled to 15 votes, whereas each ordinary share is entitled to one vote.

In 2004 and 2005, ordinary equivalent shares in the diluted income/(loss) per ordinary share computation are excluded as their effect would be anti-dilutive.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) December 31, 2004 and 2005 (18) CONCENTRATION OF RISKS Credit and concentration risks The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and other receivables represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets. As of December 31, 2004 and 2005, substantially all of the Groups cash and cash equivalents were held in major financial institutions located in the PRC Hong Kong and in the United States, which management believes are of high credit quality. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and denominated in RMB, and are derived from revenues earned from operations arising in the PRC. The Group performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable. The Group maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts and actual losses have been within managements expectations. The Group has a diversified base of customers. No individual customer contributed to more than 10% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005. Except for Bearing Point Consulting Co., Ltd, which accounted for 37% of the Groups accounts receivable for the year ended December 31, 2004, no individual customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2004 and 2005. The Group does not have concentrations of available sources of labour, services, franchises, licenses or other rights that could, if suddenly eliminated, severely impact its operations. Business and economic risks The Group conducts its principal operations in the PRC and accordingly is subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated with investments in equity securities of United States and Western European companies. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic, legal environment and social uncertainties in the PRC, influence of the China National Tourism Administration over certain aspects of the Groups operations and competition in the travel agency industry. The Group is currently targeting the Chinese market. The Chinese government regulates Internet access, the distribution of online news and other information, the provision of online commerce and provision of travel agency services through strict business licensing requirements and other governmental regulations. These regulations include limiting foreign ownership in Chinese companies providing Internet access, information and other online Internet services and travel agency services. Management, after consultation and advice from PRC legal counsel, is of the opinion that the Groups business complies with existing Chinese laws and regulations. However, the interpretation and application of current or proposed requirements and regulations may have an adverse effect on the Groups business, financial condition and result of operations. In addition, the ability to negotiate and implement specific business development projects in a timely and favorable manner may be impacted by political considerations unrelated to or beyond the control of the Group. Although the PRC government has been pursuing economic reform policies for the past two decades, no assurance can be given that the PRC government will continue to pursue such policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered. There is also no guarantee that the PRC governments pursuit of economic reforms will be consistent or effective and as a result, changes in the rate or method of taxation, reduction in tariff protection and other import restrictions, and changes in State policies and regulations affecting the travel agency industry may have a negative impact on the Groups operating results and financial condition. Currency risk Substantially all of the revenue-generating operations of the Group are transacted in RMB, which is not fully convertible into foreign currencies. On January 1, 1994, the PRC government abolished the dual rate system and introduced a single rate of exchange as quoted by the Peoples Bank of China. However, the unification of the exchange rate does not imply convertibility of RMB into United States dollars or other foreign currencies. All foreign exchange transactions must take place either through the Peoples Bank of China or other institutions authorized to buy and sell foreign exchange or at a swap center. Approval of foreign currency payments by the Peoples Bank of China or other institutions requires submitting a payment application form together with suppliers invoices, shipping documents and signed contracts. F-38 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) December 31, 2004 and 2005 On July 21, 2005, the Peoples Bank of China announced that the PRC government reformed the exchange rate regime by adopting a managed floating exchange rate with reference to a basket of currencies. The exchange rate of United States dollars against RMB was adjusted to RMB8.11 per United States dollar with effect from July 21, 2005.Due to the amount of cash held in United States dollar by the Company as of December 31, 2005, the continuous appreciation of RMB will have a negative impact on the Groups operating results and financial condition. (19) RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Companies are considered to be related if one company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other company or exercise significant influence over the other company in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence. Because of related party relationships, it is possible that the terms of these transactions are not the same as those that would result from transactions among wholly unrelated parties. The principal related party transactions for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 are as follows: In July 2003, the Company entered into lease agreement with Kun Lun Securities. Mr. Zhong Xiao Jian, a former director of the Company and the principal shareholder of Billable Development, Ltd. which is a shareholder of the Company, indirectly has a minority shareholding interest in Kun Lun Securities. Under the agreement, Kun Lun Securities provided free rent on 195.65 square meters of office space in Shenzhen, China to the Company for twelve months. The arrangement was terminated on May 31, 2004. In June 2004, the Company entered into a subsequent lease agreement with Kun Lun Securities for a term of two years pursuant to which the Company has rented 200 meters of office space at a cost of RMB 15,000 per month. During the second quarter of 2004, the Company advanced approximately RMB1.7 million on an interest free basis to the Companys chief executive officer. The advance was repaid in August 2004. During the second quarter of 2004, the Companys Board of Directors approved the Companys making a one-time payment of the individual income tax obligations of the Companys then chief executive officer and four other senior officers, totaling RMB4.5 million. The amounts were recorded as compensation expenses and included in service development expenses and general and administrative expenses. In August 2004, in connection with the issuance and sale of 11,188,570 Series B preferred shares for US$58.7 million, the Company repurchased 1,581,874 Series A preferred shares and 4,012,411 ordinary shares from certain shareholders. The repurchases included the purchase of 394,314 ordinary shares, for an aggregate of US$2.1 million, from a company controlled by the Companys chief executive officer, and 2,877,041 ordinary shares, for an aggregate of US$15.1 million, from a company controlled by a member of the Companys Board of Directors. During the years ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2005, the Company paid Expedia Australia RMB 698,240 and RMB 729,246, respectively, as indemnification for certain obligations under the Series B preferred shares purchase agreement (See Note 15). In addition, as of December 31, 2004, the Company accrued RMB 44,240 relating to these indemnification obligations. In December 2004, the Company received RMB 2,187,850 from two officers of the Company for the payment of the exercise of stock options by such officers. As of December 31, 2004, the exercise of the stock options and related issuance of the ordinary shares were not completed and therefore the amounts received were recorded as amounts due to these two officers. The options were exercised by the officers and the underlying shares were issued by the Company in 2005. F-39 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) December 31, 2004 and 2005 In January 2005, in connection with the issuance and sale of 17,362,134 high-vote ordinary shares for US$107.8 million, the Company repurchased 8,681,067 ordinary shares from certain shareholders for an aggregate of US$53,909,426 (US$6.21 per share). The repurchases included the purchase of 4,293,156 ordinary shares, for an aggregate of US$26,636,199 (after taking into consideration the adjustment in the repurchase price) from a company controlled by a former member of the Companys Board of Directors, and 40,506 ordinary shares, for an aggregate of US$251,313 (after taking into consideration the adjustment in the repurchase price), from the Companys chief financial officer. As a result of the adjustment in the warrant exercise price and repurchase price described in note 15, the Company refunded to Expedia Australia US$98,269 and certain of the Companys existing shareholders refunded to the Company US$49,134. The Company accrued the amount due to Expedia Australia and recorded a receivable from the selling shareholders as of December 31, 2005 in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet (See Note 15). In March 2005, the Company entered into a termination and settlement agreement with Richard Xue, the Companys former Vice President of Business Development and Strategy, in connection with the termination of Mr. Xues employment with the Company effective March 31, 2005. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Xue provided the Company with a general release. The Company acknowledged that under the terms of the 2001 Plan and the terms of his employment agreement, Sino Faith Asset Limiteds (an entity over which Mr. Xue has ultimate investment power and to whom Mr. Xue had previously transferred his options) option to purchase 180,000 ordinary shares had vested. The Company also agreed that in consideration for the benefits provided by Mr. Xue under the termination and settlement agreement, Sino Faith Asset Limiteds option would also vest with respect to an additional 20,000 ordinary shares. The accelerated options resulted in compensation expenses of RMB275,266 being recognized in 2005. Sino Faith Assets Limited exercised all of its vested options on or before July 23, 2005. In 2005, the Company recorded RMB747,330 (2004:RMB nil) in consulting fees for services provided by Expedia and the amount was unpaid at December 31, 2005. In 2005, the Company paid RMB797,568 (2004: RMB86,903) in rent for accommodations to related parties of the Companys senior management. (20) SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In January 2006, the Company entered into a termination and settlement agreement with Justin Tang, the Companys former President and Chief Executive Officer, in connection with the termination of Mr. Tangs employment with the Company, which was effective as of February 17, 2006. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Tang provided the Company with a general release. The Company acknowledged that (i) under the terms of the 2001 Plan and the terms of his employment agreement, Purple Mountain Holding Ltd.s (an entity over which Mr. Tang has ultimate investment power and to whom Mr. Tang had previously transferred a portion of his options) option to purchase 2,875,000 ordinary shares had vested and (ii) under the terms of the 2004 Plan and the terms of his employment agreement, Mr. Tangs option to purchase 262,500 ordinary shares had vested. The Company also agreed that in consideration for the benefits provided by Mr. Tang under the termination and settlement agreement, Purple Mountain Holding Ltd.s option would also vest with respect to an additional 31,250 ordinary shares and Purple Mountain Holding Ltd. would have until 60 days after Mr. Tang ceases to be a director of the Company for any reason to exercise the outstanding vested options. In addition, the Company agreed that Mr. Tangs option would vest with respect to an additional 43,750 ordinary shares, and that Mr. Tang would have until 60 days after he ceases to be a director of the Company for any reason to exercise the outstanding vested options. The accelerated options resulted in compensation expenses of RMB 410,800 being recognized in 2006. The remaining unvested option to purchase 393,750 ordinary shares was therefore forfeited on February 17, 2006. Finally, the Company agreed to relax the sale restrictions placed on Mr. Tang and Purple Mountain Holding Ltd. to allow for the sale or transfer of enough ordinary shares to cover a cashless option exercise of such portion, as more fully described in the termination and settlement agreement, of the options held by Mr. Tang and Purple Mountain Holding Ltd. in the event Mr. Tang ceases to be a director of the Company as a result of being removed by the Board or our shareholders and not as a result of his resignation. F-40 Table of Contents eLong, Inc. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) December 31, 2004 and 2005 In May 2006, the Company sold RayTime BVI and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Golden VIP, and ZM VIP (collectively, RayTime) for RMB 1,500,000 to the original selling shareholders of RayTime. The sale proceeds or selling price is in the form of a reduction in the remaining RMB 4,000,000 payable to the original selling shareholders of RayTime by RMB 1,500,000. The Company recorded a gain on disposal of approximately RMB 3 million in May 2006, which represents the excess of the selling price over the carrying amount of the Companys investments in these entities on the date of sale. As a result of the sale, all remaining contingent consideration payable has been subsequently cancelled. RayTime contributed RMB 1 million and RMB 13.1 million to the Companys revenues in 2004 and 2005, respectively, and contributed RMB 0.2 million and RMB 3.3 million to the Companys net loss in 2004 and 2005, respectively.

In the event that that Company makes any payment in violation of the 6-month delay rule under Section 409A of the Code such that the Employee becomes subject to any penalties under Section 409A of the Code, the Company promises to reimburse the Employee for the amount of any penalty imposed on the Employee by the Internal Revenue Service under Section 409A of the Code resulting from any failure by the Company to delay for 6-months any payments required to be so delayed and any additional taxes due on such reimbursement. -3- (f) Reimbursement of Expenses. The Company will reimburse the Employee for reasonable expenses incurred by the Employee in the course of, and necessary in connection with, the performance by the Employee of his duties to the Company, provided that such expenses are substantiated in accordance with the Companys policies (which policies have been approved by the Board or the Audit Committee of the Board). For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts paid to the Employee pursuant to this Section 3(f) will not be considered to be Personal Benefits and will not be counted towards the Maximum Amount (each as defined below in Annex 2). 4. Other Employee Benefits. (a) Vacation; Sick Leave. The Employee will be entitled to such number of weeks of paid vacation each year as are set forth on Annex 2.

Subject to the foregoing, any payments which become due and payable by the Company to the Employee pursuant to the terms of this Agreement may be made by any subsidiary or related company of the Company which is formed under the laws of the Peoples Republic of China (the PRC). 5. Certain Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Employee. (a) Related Company Positions. The Employee agrees that the Employee and members of the Employees immediate family will not have any financial interest directly or indirectly (including through any entity in which the Employee or any member of the Employees immediate family has a position or financial interest) in any transactions with the Company or any subsidiaries or affiliates thereof unless all such transactions, prior to being entered into, have been disclosed to the Board and approved by the Audit Committee of the Board and comply with all other Company policies and applicable law as may be in effect from time to time. The Employee also agrees that he will inform the Audit Committee and the finance department of the Company of any -4- transactions involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates in which senior officers, including but not limited to the Employee, or their immediate family members have a financial interest. (b) Discounts, Rebates or Commissions. Unless expressly permitted by written policies and procedures of the Company in effect from time to time, which policies have been approved by the Board or the Audit Committee of the Board, that may be applicable to the Employee, neither the Employee nor any family member will be entitled to receive or obtain directly or indirectly any discount, rebate or commission in respect of any sale or purchase of goods or services effected or other business transacted (whether or not by the Employee) by or on behalf of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, and if the Employee or any immediate family member (or any firm or company in which the Employee or any immediate family member is interested) obtains any such unapproved discount, rebate or commission, the Employee will pay to the Company an amount equal to the amount so received (or the proportionate amount received by any such firm or company to the extent of the Employees or family members interest therein). 6. At-Will; Termination. (a) The Employees employment with the Company will be at will and may be terminated by the Company or the Employee, in each case as set forth in this Section 6. (b) Voluntary Termination by the Employee. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Employee may voluntarily Terminate this Agreement by providing the Company with ninety (90) days advance written notice (Voluntary Termination), in which case the Employee will not be entitled to receive payment of any severance benefits or other amounts by reason of the Termination other than accrued salary and vacation through the date of the Termination. The Employees right to all other benefits will terminate as of the date of Termination, other than any continuation required by applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, if, in connection with a Change in Control, the surviving entity or successor to the Companys business offers the Employee employment whereby the total compensation for such employment is equal to or greater than the total compensation set forth in this Agreement and such offer is not accepted by the Employee, the refusal by the Employee to accept such offer and the subsequent termination of the Employees employment by the Company shall be deemed to be a Voluntary Termination of employment by the Employee and shall not be treated as a termination by the Company without Cause. Without limiting this Section 6(b), if the Company is no longer subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a result of a Rule 13e-3 Transaction initiated by IACT Asia Pacific Limited (IACT) or any Affiliate of IACT and in connection with such Rule 13e-3 Transaction the Employee is offered a position with the Company with the responsibility of running the management and operations of the Companys business (except that the Employee will no longer be the Chief Executive Officer of the Company) and the total compensation to the Employee is equal to or greater than the total compensation set forth in such offer and such offer is not accepted by the Employee, the refusal by the Employee to accept such offer and the subsequent termination of the Employees employment by the Company shall be deemed to be a Voluntary Termination of employment by the Employee and shall not be treated as a termination by the Company without Cause. For the avoidance -5- of doubt, with respect to any equity awards granted to the Employee pursuant to this Agreement, if the third party grants an equity award to the Employee which award has the same or greater value with respect to Performance Units and the same or greater in the money value with respect to the Stock Options then such third party offer as it relates to the equity compensation will be deemed to be of equal or greater value than the value granted under this Agreement. (c) Termination by the Company for Cause. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company may Terminate this Agreement for Cause by written notice to the Employee, effective immediately upon the delivery of such notice. In such case, except as set forth in Section 3(e)(ii), the Employee will not be entitled to receive payment of any severance benefits or other amounts by reason of the Termination other than accrued salary and vacation through the date of the Termination. The Employees right to all other benefits will terminate, other than any continuation required by applicable law. (d) Termination by the Employee with Good Reason or Termination by the Company without Cause. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Employee may Terminate this Agreement for Good Reason, and the Company may Terminate this Agreement without Cause, in either case upon thirty (30) days advance written notice by the party Terminating this Agreement to the other party and the Termination shall be effective as of the expiration of such thirty (30) day period. If the Employee Terminates this Agreement for Good Reason or the Company Terminates this Agreement without Cause, in addition to any benefits the Employee is entitled to receive under Section 3(e)(ii), the Employee will be entitled to continue to receive payment of severance benefits equal to the Employees monthly base salary in effect on the date of such Termination and a pro-rated portion of the Personal Benefits which total Personal Benefits will not exceed US$84,000 for six (6) months (the Severance Period), provided that the Employee complies with the Employee Obligations Agreement and Chinese Obligations Agreement during the Severance Period and executes a release agreement in the form requested by the Company at the time of such Termination that releases the Company from any and all claims arising from or related to the employment relationship and such Termination. Such payments will be made ratably over the Severance Period according to the Companys standard payroll schedule. In the event that the Personal Benefits paid to the Employee pursuant to this Section 6(d) do not equal US$84,000, the Company will pay the difference to the Employee as income at the end of the Severance Period, which would be subject to individual income tax. Health insurance benefits with the same coverage provided to the Employee prior to the Termination (e.g., medical, dental, optical, mental health) and in all other material respects comparable to those in place immediately prior to the Termination will be provided at the Companys expense during the Severance Period. (e) Termination by Reason of Death or Disability. A Termination of the Employees employment by reason of death or Disability shall not be deemed to be a Termination by the Company (for or without Cause) or by the Employee (for or without Good Reason). In the event that the Employees employment with the Company Terminates as a result of the Employees death or Disability, in addition to any benefits the Employee is entitled to receive under Section 3(e)(ii), the Employee or the Employees estate or representative, as applicable, will receive all accrued salary and accrued vacation as of the date of the Employees death or Disability and any other benefits payable under the Companys then existing benefit plans and policies in -6- accordance with such plans and policies in effect on the date of death or Disability and in accordance with applicable law. In addition, the Employee or the Employees estate or representative, as applicable, will receive the bonus for the year in which the death or Disability occurs which bonus will be prorated based on the number of days in which the Employee was employed by the Company during such year and to the extent that a bonus would have been earned had the Employee continued in employment through the end of such year, as determined in good faith by the Companys Board or its Compensation Committee based on the specific corporate and individual performance targets established for such fiscal year, and only to the extent that bonuses are paid for such fiscal year to other similarly situated employees. (f) Misconduct After Termination of Employment. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein to the contrary, if the Employee after the termination of his employment violates or fails to materially comply with the Employee Obligations Agreement or the Chinese Obligations Agreement thereafter (1) the Employee shall not be entitled to any payments from the Company, (2) any insurance or other benefits that have continued shall terminate immediately and (3) the Employee shall promptly reimburse to the Company all amounts that have been paid to the Employee pursuant to this Section 6. 8. Obligations Agreements.
