ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. You should carefully consider the following risks before making an investment in our Company. In addition, you should keep in mind that the risks described below are not the only risks that we face. The risks described below are the risks that we currently believe are material to our business. However, additional risks not presently known to us, or risks that we currently believe are not material, may also impair our business operations. You should also refer to the other information set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the discussions set forth in Business and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as well as our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Our business prospects, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected by any of the following risks. If we are adversely affected by such risks, th en the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Proposed Federal Trade Commission rules could adversely impact the manner in which we solicit potential customers. On April 5, 2006, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), announced proposed rules, if adopted, could be construed or applied in a way which would negatively impact the manner in which we solicit potential customers and offer our customers our products. The FTC is currently requesting comments to the proposed rules. We cannot predict whether the proposed rules will be adopted. The proposed rules, if adopted, may be interpreted or applied in a manner which may limit the manner in which we market our products, which may reduce our revenue and profitability. We have been subject to a number of claims by governmental agencies that we are required to register as a seller of business opportunities, including actions seeking restraining orders or injunctions, and adverse decisions in these matters could adversely affect our business. We have been subject to a number of claims by governmental agencies which we are required to register as a seller of business opportunities. Several states have filed actions seeking injunctions requiring which we register as a business opportunity seller under their particular statutes. We have also been subject to actions seeking temporary restraining orders demanding registration. See Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for a discussion of the pending actions. In addition, no assurances can be given there will not be other jurisdictions which bring actions on similar grounds. We assert we do not sell a business opportunity and have not therefore registered as a seller under the various statutes. We have been limited in our ability to transact business in at least two states as a consequence of a restraining order. Any additional restraining orders entered against the Company could also have a material negative impact on sales and operations of the Company. If it is determined in any state we are required to register as a seller 6 of business opportunities in order to engage in business in that state, the requirement to do so could materially impair us and/or force us to change our business model and consequently may adversely affect our revenue, increase our compliance costs and reduce our profitability. Changes in international and domestic laws and regulations and the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations could adversely impact our financial results or ability to conduct business. We are subject to a variety of international, federal and state laws and regulations as well as oversight from a variety of international and domestic governmental agencies. The laws governing our business may change in ways that harm our business. Federal, state or foreign governmental agencies administering and enforcing such laws may also choose to interpret and apply them in ways that harm our business. These interpretations are also subject to change. Regulatory action could materially impair or force us to change our business model and may adversely affect our revenue, increase our compliance costs and reduce our profitability. In addition, governmental agencies such as the SEC, IRS or state taxing authorities may conclude that we have violated federal laws, state laws or their rules and regulations, and we could be subject to fines, penalties or other actions that could materially harm our business. From time to time we are and have been the subject of governmental inquiries and investigations into our business practices that could require us to change our sales and marketing practices or pay damages or fines, which could negatively impact our financial results or ability to conduct business. From time to time, we receive inquiries from federal, state, city and local government officials in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. These inquiries and investigations generally concern compliance with various city, county, state and/or federal regulations involving sales, representations made, customer service, refund policies, and marketing practices. We respond to these inquiries and have generally been successful in addressing the concerns of these persons and entities, without a formal complaint or charge being made, although there is often no formal closing of the inquiry or investigation. See Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for a discussion of some of these pending matters. There can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these or other inquiries and investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our business or operations, or that a formal complaint will not be initiated. We also receive complaints and inquiries in the ordinary course of our business from both customers and governmental and non-governmental bodies on behalf of customers, and in some cases these customer complaints have risen to the level of litigation. While we attempt to resolve these matters on a mutually satisfactory basis, there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse affect on our business or results of operations. We also are subject to various claims and legal proceedings covering matters which arise in the ordinary course of business. We believe the resolution of these other cases will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, or results of operations. From time to time we are and have been the subject of customer complaints and lawsuits relating to our business practices which could require us to change our sales and marketing practices or pay damages or fines, which could negatively impact our financial results. We sometimes receive complaints and inquiries in the ordinary course of business from both customers and governmental and non-governmental bodies on behalf of customers and, in some cases, these customer complaints have resulted in litigation. Some of these matters are pending. The ultimate resolution of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We may be required to reduce our prices in order to compete which could negatively impact our profits. As competition to our software continues to expand, we may be required to respond to additional competition which could require us to lower prices and engage in price competition. If intense price competition occurs, we may be forced to lower prices, which could result in lower revenue and gross margins. We collect personal and credit card information from our customers and employees which could be subject to misuse. We maintain credit card and other personal information in our systems. We need to preserve and protect our data and our customers data against loss, misuse, corruption, misappropriation caused by systems failures, unauthorized access or misuse. We could be subject to liability claims by individuals and customers whose data resides in our databases for the misuse of that information. We are being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which could subject us to fines, penalties or other actions, which could adversely affect our financial results. 7 On October 24, 2005, the Company announced it had been notified by the SEC that it had issued a formal order of investigation related to the Company. Prior to the order, the Company had announced a change of the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company. The Company also issued a Form 8-K of Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review. Although we have cooperated with the SEC in this matter, and intend to continue to cooperate with the SEC, the SEC may find that we have violated the securities laws. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the investigation, nor can we predict whether other federal, state or foreign governmental authorities will initiate separate investigations. The outcome of the investigation and any related legal and administrative proceedings could include the institution of administrative, civil, injunctive or criminal proceed ings involving us and/or our current or former employees, officers and/or directors, the imposition of fines and other penalties, remedies and/or sanctions, modifications to business practices and compliance programs and/or referral to other governmental agencies for other actions. It is not possible to accurately predict, at this time, when matters relating to the investigation will be completed, the final outcome of the investigation, or what, if any, actions may be taken by the SEC or by other governmental agencies in federal, state or foreign jurisdictions. Such actions may negatively impact our consolidated financial statements, results of operations, business prospects or liquidity. We are subject to claims that our software is defective and difficult to use and that a substantial number of our customers do not activate their web pages. We have been subject to claims by purchasers that our software is defective and difficult to use. Our software is hosted remotely on our servers in Orem, Utah, and as such cannot be selectively defective, but the continual claims of defective software could have a negative effect on our ability to sell licenses. We have also been subject to various claims our software is hard to use. We contend our software is interactive, and can be used properly by our customers. However, the claims of it being difficult to use are investigated by various regulatory agencies, and the persistence of such claims by regulatory agencies, in the news media, and on the Internet, may have a substantial negative impact on our ability to transact business. The claims that a substantial number of our customers do not activate their web sites may impact the manner in which we conduct our seminars and may have a negative impact on our operations. Fluctuations in our operating results may affect our stock price and ability to raise capital. Our operating results for any given quarter or fiscal year should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful as a result of (i) our limited operating history and (ii) the emerging nature of the markets in which we compete. Our future results will fluctuate, and those results may fall below the expectations of investors and may cause the trading price of our common stock to fall. This may impair our ability to raise capital, should we seek to do so. Our quarterly results may fluctuate based on, but not limited to, the following factors: · our ability to attract and retain customers; · negative publicity about our industry, events, or products; · one-time events that negatively impact attendance and sales at our Preview Training Sessions and Internet Training Workshops; · seasonal fluctuations in our business; · number of workshops in a given period; · intense competition; · changes in pricing policies; · regulatory actions and legal proceedings; · Internet and online services usage levels and the rate of market acceptance of these services for transacting commerce; · our ability to timely and effectively upgrade and develop our systems and infrastructure; · changes to our business model resulting from regulatory requirements; · our ability to control our costs; · our ability to attract, train and retain skilled management, as well as strategic, technical and creative professionals; · technical, legal and regulatory difficulties with respect to our workshop distribution channel and Internet use generally; · the availability of working capital and the amount and timing of costs relating to our expansion; and · general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to Internet technology usage and eCommerce. 8 Adverse publicity could reduce customer interest in our workshops and harm our financial results. We have received adverse publicity concerning our business, and may, in the future, receive additional adverse publicity concerning our business. Adverse publicity concerning our business, including our Internet Training Workshops, products, services, management or legal proceedings could reduce the response rates to our advertisements, reduce attendance and purchase rates at our workshops and third-party sales to our customers, and thereby adversely affect our revenues. We do not always know when adverse publicity may occur and cannot accurately predict its impact on our business and results of operations. We may need to monetize a substantial portion of the customer receivables generated by our workshop business. If we are unable to do so we may be required to raise additional working capital. We offer our customers a choice of payment options at our Internet Training Workshops, including an installment payment plan. These installment contracts are either sold to one of several third-party finance companies, with or without recourse, or are retained by us and the collection activity is serviced by a third party. Thereafter, we sometimes seek to sell the serviced contracts to the servicer or other third parties. We have in the past experienced difficulties selling these installment contracts at levels that provide adequate cash flow for our business, and a recurrence of these difficulties would likely require us to raise additional working capital to allow us to service these assets on our own. Since May 2004, we have not sold installment contracts with any recourse provisions. Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be reduced in the event of an ownership change, and could adversely affect our financial results. As of June 30, 2008, the Company had net operating loss (NOL) carry forwards of approximately $8,675,000. None of the NOL carry forwards are subject to annual limitations under Section 382 due to the recognized gains discussed below. Section 382 generally imposes limitations on a corporations ability to utilize its NOL carry forwards if it experiences an ownership change. In general terms, an ownership change results from transactions, which increase the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50% over a three-year period. As a result of significant equity transactions during the life of the Company, the Company has experienced two ownership changes, and as a result of the most recent ownership change, utilization of the Companys NOL is subject to an annual limitation. However, under certain ci rcumstances, the utilization amount may be increased by the recognized built-in gains that occur during the five-year period after the ownership change. Based on the valuation of the Company as of April 3, 2002, the Company has approximately $15,000,000 of recognized built-in gains, thus eliminating any effect of a limitation. Nevertheless, the Internal Revenue Service could disagree with the valuation and limit the use of the NOL carry forwards, which could have a significant impact on both the income statement and balance sheets. Future changes in ownership of more than 50% may also limit the use of these NOL carry forwards. We depend on our senior management and other key personnel, and a loss of these individuals could adversely impact our ability to execute our business plan and grow our business. We depend on the continued services of our key personnel, including but not limited to our President, Brandon Lewis, Chief Executive Officer, Donald Danks, Chief Financial Officer, Robert Lewis, and Chief Technical Officer, David Rosenvall, as well as certain speakers at our Preview Training Sessions and Internet Training Workshops. Each of these individuals has acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to our operations. The loss of one or more of these key personnel could negatively impact our performance. In addition, we expect to hire additional personnel in all areas if we are to continue to successfully execute our strategic plan, particularly if we are successful in expanding our operations. Competition for the limited number of qualified personnel in our industry is intense. At times, we have experienced difficulties in hiring personnel with the necessary training or experience. We may acquire businesses or pursue acquisitions of complementary service or product lines and technologies that may involve financial, integration and transaction completion risks that could adversely affect our operations. From time to time, we have evaluated and in the future may evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses, services, products or technologies. These acquisitions may dilute our existing stockholders or cause us to incur debt and contingent liabilities, and expenses to amortize related tangible or intangible assets. In addition, acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies, the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns, risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company. We have no present commitment or agreement with respect to any material acquisitions of other businesses, services, products or technologies. 9 We are dependent on credit card issuers who provide us with merchant accounts that are used to receive payments from our customers and if we cannot maintain these merchant accounts our business would be harmed. Each financial institution that issues merchant accounts establishes limits on the amount of payments which may be received through the account and requires that we keep reserves on deposit with it to protect the financial institution against losses it may incur with respect to the account. We have, in the past, experienced difficulty in maintaining these merchant accounts in good standing due to changes in the reserve requirements imposed by the issuing banks with whom we have worked, changes in the transaction amount permitted and changes in the rate of charge-backs. If we were to experience a significant reduction in or loss of these merchant accounts our business would be severely and negatively impacted. We might require additional capital to support business growth and fund other needs of the business, and such capital might not be available. We intend to continue to make investments to support business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business opportunities and challenges, which include the opportunity to increase our revenue by increasing the number of customer installment contracts that we retain and carry rather than sell, the need to develop new products or enhance existing products, the need to enhance our operating infrastructure and the opportunity to acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may elect or need to engage in equity or debt financing to secure additional funds. Equity and debt financing, however, might not be available when needed or, if available, might not be available on terms satisfactory to us. If we are unable to obtain financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. Our operations could be hurt by a natural disaster, network security breach, or other catastrophic event. Substantially all of our network infrastructure is located in Utah, an area susceptible to earthquakes. We do not have multiple site capacity if any catastrophic event occurs and, although we do have a redundant network system, this system does not guarantee continued reliability if a catastrophic event occurs. Despite implementation of network security measures, our servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. In addition, if there is a breach or alleged breach of security or privacy involving our services, or if any third party undertakes illegal or harmful actions using our communications or eCommerce services, our business and reputation could suffer substantial adverse publicity and impairment. Our operations could be hurt by terrorist attacks, fear of disease and other activity and events that make air travel difficult or reduce the willingness of customers to attend our workshops. We rely on frequent presentations of our Preview Training Sessions and Internet Training Workshops by a limited number of persons in various cities and these persons generally travel by air. In addition, these Preview Training Sessions and Internet Training Workshops involve large groups of persons in upscale and sometimes marquee hotel facilities. Our business would be materially and adversely affected by air travel becoming less available due to significant cutbacks in the frequency of service or significant increases in processing times at airports due to security or other factors or by air travel becoming unavailable due to governmental or other action as was the case during a brief period in September 2001. In addition, our business would be materially and adversely affected if our potential customers were to become fearful of attending large public meetings in large hotels. The market for our products and services is evolving and its growth is uncertain. The markets for our products and services are continuing to evolve and are increasingly competitive. Demand and market acceptance for recently introduced and proposed new products and services and sales of such products and services internationally are subject to a high level of uncertainty and risk. Our business may suffer if the market develops in an unexpected manner, develops more slowly than in the past or becomes saturated with competitors, if any new products and services do not sustain market acceptance or if our efforts to expand internationally do not sustain market acceptance. We may not have the resources to compete with other companies within our industry. Many of our direct competitors have announced their intention to offer a range of Internet products and services comparable to those offered by us. These competitors at any time could elect to focus additional resources in our target markets, which could materially and adversely affect us. Many of our current and potential competitors have stronger brand recognition, longer operating histories, larger customer bases, longer relationships with customers and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and public relations resources than we do. We believe our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs, devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products and services, initiate or withstand substantial price competition, take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly. 10 Our expansion into international markets and development of country-specific eCommerce products and services may be difficult or unprofitable. We are continuing our operations in selected international markets. There are difficulties inherent in doing business in international markets such as: · cultural, language and other differences between the markets with which we are familiar and these international markets that could result in lower than anticipated attendance at our Preview Training Sessions and Internet Training Workshops and/or lower than anticipated sales; · banking and payment mechanisms that differ from those in the United States and make it more difficult for us to both accept payments by credit card and offer to customers a product that allows customers to accept credit card payments on their websites; · unproven markets for our services and products; · unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; · terrorism, war and international conflict; · potentially adverse tax environment; · export restrictions and tariffs and other trade barriers; · burdens of complying with applicable foreign laws and exposures to different legal standards, particularly with respect to sales and marketing practices, intellectual property, privacy and distribution of potentially offensive or unlawful content over the Internet; · fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and · restrictions on repatriating cash from foreign markets. Our future success depends on continued growth in acceptance of the Internet as a business medium. In order for us to attain success, the Internet must continue to achieve widespread acceptance as a business medium. In addition, the businesses and merchants to whom we market our products and services must be convinced of the need for an online eCommerce presence and must be willing to rely upon third parties to develop and manage their eCommerce offerings and marketing efforts. It remains uncertain whether sustained significant demand for our products and services as sold through our workshop format will exist and whether our distribution channel to our target markets will establish itself as the preferred channel. If we are not successful in responding to the evolution of the Internet and in tailoring our product and services offerings to respond to this evolution, our business will be materially and adversely affected. Evolving regulation of the Internet, including the use of e-mail as a marketing tool, may harm our business. As eCommerce continues to evolve it is subject to increasing regulation by federal, state, and foreign agencies. Areas subject to regulation include but may not be limited to the use of e-mail, user privacy, pricing, content, quality of products and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights, and information security. In particular, our initial contact with many of our customers is through e-mail. The use of e-mail for this purpose has become the subject of a number of recently adopted and proposed laws and regulations. In addition, laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, or processing of personal or consumer information could negatively affect our activities. The perception of security and privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may indirectly inhibit market acceptance of our products. In addition, legislative or regulatory requirements may heighten these concerns if businesses must notify website us ers that the data captured after visiting websites may be used by marketing entities to unilaterally direct product promotion and advertising to that user. Moreover, the applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing issues such as intellectual property ownership and infringement, copyright, trademark, trade secret, obscenity and libel is uncertain and developing. Furthermore, any regulation imposing fees or assessing taxes for Internet use could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of eCommerce. Any new legislation or regulation, or the application or interpretation of existing laws or regulations, may decrease the growth in the use of the Internet, may impose additional burdens on eCommerce or may require us to alter how we conduct our business. This could decrease the demand for our products and services, increase our cost of doing business, increase the costs of products sold through the Internet or otherwise have a negative effect on our business, results of operati ons and financial condition. Internet security issues pose risks to the development of eCommerce and our business. Security and privacy concerns may inhibit the growth of the Internet and other online services generally, especially as a means of conducting commercial transactions. 11 Transmission and analysis of confidential and proprietary information of the consumer, the merchant, or both, as well as our own confidential and proprietary information. Anyone able to circumvent security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations, as well as the operations of the merchant. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to minimize problems caused by security breaches. To the extent that we experience breaches in the security of proprietary information which we store and transmit, our reputation could be damaged and we could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation. We depend upon our proprietary intellectual property rights, none of which can be completely safeguarded against infringement. We rely upon copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, business partners and others to protect our proprietary rights, but we cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate. We do not currently have any patents or registered trademarks, and effective trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are distributed or made available through the Internet. In addition, there can be no assurance that a patent will issue or a trademark will be referred based on our pending applications. We may incur substantial expenses in defending against third-party patent and trademark infringement claims regardless of their merit. From time to time, parties may assert patent infringement claims against us in the form of letters, lawsuits and other forms of communication. Third parties may also assert claims against us alleging infringement of copyrights, trademark rights, trade secret rights or other proprietary rights or alleging unfair competition. If there is a determination that we have infringed third-party proprietary rights, we could incur substantial monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future. We are aware of lawsuits filed against certain of our competitors regarding the presentment of advertisements in response to search requests on keywords that may be trademarks of third parties. It is not clear what, if any, impact an adverse ruling in these recently filed lawsuits would have on us. Many parties are actively developing search, indexing, eCommerce and other web-related technologies. We believe that these parties will continue to take steps to protect these technologies, including seeking patent protection. As a result, we believe that disputes regarding the ownership of these technologies are likely to arise in the future. There are low barriers to entry into the eCommerce services market and, as a result, we face significant competition in a rapidly evolving industry. We have no patented technology, and only a limited amount of other proprietary technology, that would preclude or inhibit competitors from entering our business. In addition, the costs to develop and provide eCommerce services are relatively low. Therefore, we expect that we will continually face additional competition from new entrants into the market in the future. There is also the risk that our employees or independent contractors may leave and start competing businesses. The emergence of these enterprises could have a material adverse effect on us. Existing or future competitors may better address new developments or react more favorably to changes within our industry and may develop or offer eCommerce services providing significant technological, creative, performance, price or other advantages over the services that we offer. Future sales of common stock by our existing stockholders and stock options granted by us could adversely affect our stock price. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. As of August 31, 2008, we had outstanding 11,341,380 shares of common stock. Significant additional dilution will result if outstanding options and warrants are exercised. As of August 31, 2008, we had outstanding stock options to purchase 697,386 shares of common stock. In addition, in the event future financings should be in the form of, convertible into or exchangeable for our equity securities, investors may experience additional dilution. Our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of general economic and market conditions. We are subject to the effects of general global economic and market conditions. Economic conditions may cause small businesses and entrepreneurs to curtail or eliminate spending on eCommerce services or to reduce demand for our products and services. An adverse change in economic conditions may adversely affect our business. 12 Some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may deter takeover attempts that may limit the opportunity of our stockholders to sell their shares at a favorable price. Some of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders by providing them with the opportunity to sell their shares at a premium to the then market price. Our bylaws contain provisions regulating the introduction of business at annual stockholders meetings by anyone other than the board of directors. These provisions may have the effect of making it more difficult, delaying, discouraging, preventing or rendering more costly an acquisition or a change in control of our Company. In addition, our corporate charter provides for a staggered board of directors divided into two classes. Provided that we have at least four directors, it will take at least two annual meetings to effectuate a change in control of the board of directors because a majority of the directors cannot be elected at a single meeting. This extends the time required to effect a change in control of the board of directors and may discourage hostile takeover bids. We currently have five directors. Further, our certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, which may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by the board of directors without further action by stockholders. Such terms may include voting rights, including the right to vote as a series on particular matters, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. No shares of preferred stock are currently outstanding and we have no present plans for the issuance of any preferred stock. However, the issuance of any preferred stock could materially adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock, and therefore could reduce its value. In addition, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell assets to, a third party. The ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock could make it more difficult, delay, discourage, prevent or make it more costly to effect a change in control, thereby preserving the current stockholders control. If we do not successfully expand our sales teams, we may be unable to substantially increase our sales. We sell our products primarily through our training workshops, and we must expand the number of our workshop sales teams to increase revenue substantially. If we are unable to hire or retain qualified speakers and sales team members or if new team members fail to develop the necessary skills to be productive, or if they reach productivity more slowly than anticipated, our ability to increase our revenue and grow our business could be compromised. Our workshop team members may require a long period of time to become productive. The time required to achieve efficiency, as well as the challenge of attracting, training, and retaining qualified candidates, may make it difficult to meet our sales growth targets. Further, we may not generate sufficient sales to offset the increased expense resulting from growing our workshop sales force, or we may be unable to manage a larger workshop sales force. Our stock price could decline further because of the activities of short sellers. Our stock has attracted significant interest from short sellers. The activities of short sellers could further reduce the price of our stock or inhibit increases in our stock price. Our stock price and operations may be affected by potential stock manipulation. We believe certain parties are acting in a manner to attempt to denigrate our business for personal profit. We believe certain parties may have engaged in actions intended to cause harm to the Company, and certain parties have made efforts to decrease the market price of our common stock. To the extent such parties engage in any such actions or take any other actions to interfere with our existing and/or prospective business relationships with regulators, vendors, media, partners, customers, lenders, or others, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may suffer, and the price of our common stock may trade at prices below those that might prevail in the absence of any such efforts. Increased competition, including the entry of new competitors, the introduction of new products by new and existing competitors, or price competition, could have a materially adverse effect on the Company. A number of very large, well capitalized, high profile companies service the eCommerce and technology markets. If any of these companies entered our markets in a focused and concentrated fashion, we could lose customers, particularly more sophisticated and financially stable customers, and our revenue and profitability would suffer. These potential competitors could likely offer a broad array of products and services that would compete favorably with our product offerings. They could also likely offer these products at prices that would be difficult for us to match. Our ability to continue to pay cash dividends may be affected by our operating results and other conditions. In March 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per common share with a record date of the twentieth day of the last month of each quarter. In September 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company increased the quarterly cash dividend to $0.11. Although we expect to continue to pay cash dividends to our stockholders, the ability to do so will depend upon our results of operations, financial conditions, cash requirements, as well as other 13 factors. Also, there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay cash dividends even if the necessary financial conditions are met and if sufficient cash is available for distribution. Our publicly-filed SEC reports are reviewed by the SEC from time to time and any significant changes required as a result of any such review may result in material liability to us and have a material adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock. The reports of publicly-traded companies are subject to review by the SEC from time to time for the purpose of assisting companies in complying with applicable disclosure requirements and to enhance the overall effectiveness of companies public filings, and comprehensive reviews by the SEC of such reports are now required at least every three years under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. SEC reviews often occur at the time companies file registration statements, but reviews may be initiated at any time by the SEC. While we believe that our previously filed SEC reports comply, and we intend that all future reports will comply in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC, we could be required to modify or reformulate information contained in prior filings as a result of an SEC review. Any modification or reformulation of information contained in such reports could be significant and result in a material liabi lity to us and have a material adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock. Our business and results of operations are affected by general economic conditions and are dependent upon the price of postage, air transportation and food service. Continuing high postage, airfare, and food costs or further cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our operating results are affected by general economic conditions, including inflation, recession and currency volatility. Currency fluctuations may make our software product less attractive to international purchasers which could negatively impact our revenues. The economic environment may cause reduced demand for our software and widespread national and international concern over instability in the economy may result in customers declining to pay for our product in cash and using financing options which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. Our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price of postage, airfare and food service costs. Postage, airfare, and food prices have increased substantially in the last five years. These increasing costs have had a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to pass along the increased costs of postage, airfare and food service to our customers is limited by the competitive nature of the software and internet industry. We often have not been able to increase our fees to fully offset the effect of increased costs in the past and we may not be able to do so in the future. Additional increases in postage, air transportation and food service costs or disruptions in air transportation or food service supplies could have additional negative effects on us. We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Because we conduct business outside the United States but report our results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates. As of June 30, 2008, we had approximately $9,115,000 of net trade receivables denominated in foreign currencies and $5,261,000 in cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies. If the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues as cash is collected from net trade receivables, other income, and net income. Similarly, our net revenues as cash is collected from net trade receivables, other income, and net income will be negatively impacted if the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies. Our investments in auction-rate-securities are subject to risks that may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments. As of June 30, 2008, we held $3,800,000 of available-for-sale securities which consist primarily of auction-rate-securities (ARS), long-term variable rate bonds tied to short-term interest rates that are reset through a dutch auction process which generally occurs every 7 to 35 days, and other variable rate debt and equity securities. Despite the underlying long-term contractual maturity of ARS, there has generally been a ready liquid market for these securities based on the interest reset mechanism. Historically, we have not held ARS as of each balance sheet date. However, as a result of current negative liquidity and uncertainty in financial credit markets, we have experienced failed auctions associated with our remaining ARS. In the case of a failed auction, the ARS become illiquid long-term bonds (until a future auction is successful or the security is called prior to the contr actual maturity date by the issuer) and the rates are reset in accordance with terms in the prospectus/offering circular. All ARS consist primarily of fully insured, AAA rated municipal, state agency or corporate issued securities. Although we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our needs for the foreseeable future, if we are unable to liquidate the remaining ARS, we may not have access to our funds until the maturity date of these investments, which could be as late as 2028. Further, in the event that it is unlikely that we will be able to receive the full proceeds from these investments at the maturity date, we may be required to impair the securities. Additionally, in the event we are forced to liquidate these investment prior to the maturity date, we may be required to impair the securities. Based on the nature of the impairment(s), we would record a temporary impairment as an unrealized loss in comprehensive income or an other-than-temporary impairment in earnings, which could materially impact our results of operations. We did not record any impairment related to these investments as we do not believe that the underlying credit quality of the assets has been impacted by the reduced liquidity of these investments. 14 Examinations by relevant tax authorities may result in material changes in related tax reserves for tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns or may impact the valuation of certain deferred income tax assets, such as net operating loss carryforwards. Based on the outcome of examinations by relevant tax authorities, or as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the related tax reserves for tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns will materially change from those recorded in our financial statements. In addition, the outcome of examinations may impact the valuation of certain deferred income tax assets (such as net operating loss carryforwards) in future periods. It is not possible to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
