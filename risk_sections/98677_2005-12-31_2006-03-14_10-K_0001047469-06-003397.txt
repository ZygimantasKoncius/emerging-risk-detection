ITEM 1A. Risk Factors Significant factors that could impact the Company's financial condition or results of operations include, without limitation, the following: Changes in the price of raw materialsThe packaging materials and several of the principal ingredients used by the Company are subject to price volatility. Although the Company engages in commodity hedging transactions and seeks to leverage the high volume of its annual purchases, the Company may experience price increases in these raw materials that it may not be able to offset, which could have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Changes in product performance and competition The Company competes with other well-established manufacturers of confectionery products. A failure of new or existing products to be favorably received, a failure to retain preferred shelf space at retail or a failure to sufficiently counter aggressive competitive actions could have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Discounting and other competitive actionsDiscounting and other competitive actions may make it more difficult for the Company to maintain its operating margins. Dependence on customersThe Company's largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately 24.0% of total net sales in 2005. The loss of Wal-Mart or one or more other large customers, or a material decrease in purchases by one or more large customers, could result in decreased sales and adversely impact the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Changes in consumer preferences and tastesFailure to adequately anticipate and react to changing demographics, consumer trends, consumer health concerns and product preferences could have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Governmental laws and regulationsGovernmental laws and regulations, including food and drug laws, laws related to advertising and marketing practices, accounting standards, taxation requirements, competition laws, employment laws and environmental laws, both in and outside the U.S, could adversely impact the Company's results of operations and ability to compete in domestic or foreign marketplaces. Labor stoppagesTo the extent the Company experiences any material labor stoppages, such disputes or strikes could negatively affect shipments from suppliers or shipments of finished product. Changes to Certain Post-Retirement Benefit ObligationsCash expenditures and costs for post-retirement health insurance benefits could be materially higher than the Company has predicted if health care cost trend assumptions and discount rates prove to be incorrect. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase the Company's obligations to provide these or additional benefits. International operationsWhile the countries in which the Company operates tend to be politically, socially and economically stable, to the extent there is political or social unrest, civil war, terrorism or significant economic instability, the results of the Company's business in such countries could be adversely impacted. Currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. 4 The factors identified above are believed to be significant factors, but not necessarily all of the significant factors, that could impact our business. Unpredictable or unknown factors could also have material effects on the Company. Additional significant factors that may affect the Company's operations, performance and business results include the risks and uncertainties listed from time to time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the risk factors or uncertainties listed herein or listed in any document incorporated by reference herein.
