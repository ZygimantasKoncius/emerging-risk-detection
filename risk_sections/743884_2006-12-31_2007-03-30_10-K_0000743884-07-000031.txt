ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. INVESTING IN OUR COMMON STOCK IS RISKY. IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, YOU SHOULD CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS IN EVALUATING US AND OUR BUSINESS. IF ANY OF THE EVENTS DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS WERE TO OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS LIKELY WOULD SUFFER. IN THAT EVENT, THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE, AND YOU COULD LOSE ALL OR A PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS WE HAVE A HISTORY OF OPERATING LOSSES, EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR LOSSES AND RELY EXTENSIVELY ON EXTERNAL FINANCING TO MAINTAIN OUR OPERATIONS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN EXTERNAL FINANCING, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FURTHER LIMIT, SCALE BACK OR CEASE OUR OPERATIONS ENTIRELY. Since 1981, we have been engaged primarily in research and development and have derived limited revenues from feasibility studies and the licensing of our technology. We have not generated any material revenues from the sale of any products. In addition, we have incurred net operating losses every year since we began doing business and we anticipate that we will continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $81,385,779. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, we had net income of $1,951,279, however, such net income was the result of a non-cash gain in a liability classified warrant caused by a decline in our stock price. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a net loss of $5,760,475 and $8,274,521, respectively. On August 31, 2005, due to our financial condition at the time and our inability to raise sufficient capital to maintain operations, we discontinued all research and development activities and terminated substantially all of our non-management personnel. In December 2005 and February 2006, we raised an aggregate of $8.25 million in a private placement of our securities to institutional investors. As a result of this private placement, we resumed operations with a focus on advancing clinical development of our lead product, EcoNail. Our ability to continue operations after our current capital resources are exhausted depends on our ability to secure additional financing and to become profitable, which we cannot guarantee. Before we or any of our potential licensees may market any of our product candidates, significant additional development efforts and substantial testing will be necessary. We will require substantial additional financing to fund clinical studies on our product candidates. We may not be able to secure financing on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain external financing, we would have to reduce, delay or eliminate our clinical studies. OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF FAILURE INHERENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES. Various pharmaceutical companies have developed systems to enhance the topical delivery of specific drugs, but relatively limited research has been conducted about using topical delivery systems for a wider range of 16 pharmaceutical products. Topical delivery systems currently are used only in a limited number of products. In addition, some topical delivery systems have demonstrated adverse side effects for users, including skin irritation and delivery difficulties. Our product candidates are in the early stages of development and will require significant further research, development, testing and regulatory clearances. Our product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of products based on innovative technologies. These risks include the possibilities that any or all of our product candidates may be found to be ineffective or toxic, or otherwise may fail to receive necessary regulatory clearances. OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES MUST UNDERGO A RIGOROUS REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS, WHICH INCLUDES EXTENSIVE PRE-CLINICAL AND CLINICAL TESTING, TO DEMONSTRATE SAFETY AND EFFICACY BEFORE WE CAN MARKET THEM. IF THE RESULTS OF OUR PRE-CLINICAL AND CLINICAL TESTING INDICATE THAT OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES ARE NOT SAFE OR EFFECTIVE, OUR BUSINESS WILL SUFFER. Each of our product candidates, including EcoNail and Opterone, must undergo a rigorous regulatory approval process, including significant pre-clinical and clinical testing to demonstrate that they are safe and effective for human use, before we can market them. Conducting clinical trials is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. Completion of clinical trials may take several years or more. In addition, our clinical trials may be delayed by many factors, including: o inability to fund clinical trials; o slow or insufficient patient enrollment; o failure of the FDA to approve our clinical trial protocols; o inability to manufacture significant amounts of our product candidates for use in a trial; o safety issues; and o government or regulatory delays. In addition, the results of pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials may not accurately predict results that we will obtain in later testing. A number of other companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after they achieved promising results in earlier trials. If we, the FDA or physicians do not believe that our clinical trials demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FDA SUPERVISION AND MAY NOT SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THE EXTENSIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS REQUIRED PRIOR TO THE MARKETING OF ANY PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT. Our activities are regulated by a number of government authorities in the United States and other countries, including the FDA. The FDA regulates pharmaceutical products, including their manufacture and labeling. Before obtaining regulatory approval to market any product candidate under development, 17 we must demonstrate to the FDA that the product is safe and effective for use in each proposed indication through, among other things, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. Data obtained from testing is subject to varying interpretations which can delay, limit or prevent FDA approval. On October 11, 2002, the FDA advised us that further clinical trials of our drugs containing SEPA had been placed on clinical hold pending review of questions surrounding a 26-week transgenic-mouse (Tg.AC) carcinogenicity study of SEPA we performed in 1999. On April 10, 2003, the FDA lifted this clinical hold. In releasing the hold, the FDA requested additional information on that 1999 study, which we have provided. On December 5, 2005, we received a response from the Division of Reproductive and Urologic Products at the FDA to questions posed by us regarding the proposed Phase 3 clinical program for Opterone, a topical cream for male testosterone deficiency containing SEPA. In the response, the FDA reiterated its safety concerns regarding the skin irritation potential of SEPA related to pre-clinical studies of SEPA, including without limitation, the 26-week transgenic-mouse (Tg.AC) carcinogenicity study of SEPA. The FDA also expressed concern regarding skin irritation observed in some patients in recently completed Opterone clinical studies. To address these concerns as well as other issues related to Opterone's safety and efficacy program, the FDA requested that we, if we intend to pursue clinical development of Opterone, conduct additional investigation into multiple dose safety and pharmacokinetics before beginning any eventual Phase 3 study. The FDA also confirmed the requirement for other clinical pharmacology studies prior to any NDA submission and requested that we revise our proposed Phase 3 protocol to include additional patients and to extend patient exposure and safety follow-up. If we decide to pursue the clinical development of Opterone, the additional investigation and Phase 3 revisions will increase the time and expense associated with the development of Opterone and may materially adversely affect our ability to find a partner to advance the development of Opterone. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the results of the studies, if conducted, will address the FDA's safety concerns or justify further development of Opterone or that any SEPA-based product will be approved by the FDA. To date, neither the FDA nor any of its international equivalents has approved any of our technologies or product candidates for marketing. If the FDA does not approve our product candidates for marketing, we will be materially adversely affected. We face additional risks associated with the regulatory approval process, including: o Changes in existing regulatory requirements could prevent or affect our regulatory compliance. Federal and state laws, regulations and policies may be changed with possible retroactive effect. In addition, how these rules actually operate can depend heavily on administrative policies and interpretations over which we have no control. We also may lack the experience with these policies and interpretations to assess their full impact upon our business. o Obtaining FDA clearances is time-consuming and expensive and we cannot guarantee that such clearances will be granted or, if granted, will not be withdrawn. 18 o The FDA review process may prevent us from marketing our product candidates or may involve delays that significantly and negatively affect our product candidates. We also may encounter similar delays in foreign countries. o Regulatory clearances may place significant limitations on the uses for which any approved products may be marketed. o Any marketed product and its manufacturer are subject to periodic review by the FDA. Any discovery of previously unrecognized problems with a product or a manufacturer could result in suspension or limitation of previously obtained or new approvals. BECAUSE THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS IS COMPLEX, WE CANNOT ACCURATELY PREDICT THE REGULATORY APPROVAL TIMELINE FOR OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES. The laws and regulations administered by the FDA are complex, and compliance with these laws and regulations requires substantial time, effort and expense. Because of this complexity, and because the regulatory approval path for our product candidates has not yet been confirmed by the FDA, we cannot guarantee that our efforts will be sufficient to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, nor can we accurately predict the regulatory approval timeline for our product candidates. IF OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES ARE NOT ACCEPTED BY PHYSICIANS AND PATIENTS, WE MAY NEVER GENERATE PROFITS FROM OPERATIONS. Even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, we may not be able to market them effectively, they may be uneconomical to market or third parties may market equivalent or superior products. We will need to expend significant effort to educate physicians and patients regarding any product candidate that receives regulatory approval. Consequently, unless our product candidates obtain market acceptance, we may never be profitable. IF PHYSICIANS OR PATIENTS PERCEIVE THAT TESTOSTERONE REPLACEMENT THERAPIES CREATE HEALTH RISKS, THE VIABILITY OF OPTERONE MAY BE QUESTIONED, AND OUR BUSINESS AND THE PRICE OF OUR STOCK MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED. Recent studies of female hormone replacement therapy products have reported an associated increase in health risks. As a result of these studies, some companies that sell or develop female hormone replacement products have experienced decreased sales of these products, and in some cases, a decline in their stock. From time to time, publications have suggested potential health risks associated with testosterone replacement therapy, including fluid retention, sleep apnea, breast tenderness or enlargement, increased red blood cells, development of clinical prostate disease, increased cardiovascular disease risk and the suppression of sperm production. It is possible that studies on the effect of testosterone replacement therapy could demonstrate these or other adverse health risks. This, along with the negative publicity surrounding hormone replacement therapy in general, could negatively impact market acceptance of Opterone, which could adversely affect our business and the price of our stock. 19 WE DEPEND ON PATENTS TO PROTECT OUR TECHNOLOGIES AND IF OUR CURRENT PATENTS ARE INEFFECTIVE OR WE ARE UNABLE TO SECURE AND MAINTAIN ADEQUATE PATENT PROTECTION, OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE WITH OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED. We believe that patent protection of our technologies, processes and products is important to our future operations. The success of our product candidates depends, in part, on our ability to secure and maintain adequate patent protection. Although we have filed and intend to file additional patent applications, the patent application process is lengthy and expensive and there is no guarantee that a patent will be issued or, if issued, that it will be of commercial benefit to us. In addition, it is impossible to anticipate the breadth or degree of protection that any patents we obtain may afford us. Further, products that we develop could infringe patents held by third parties. In these cases, we may have to obtain licenses from third parties, which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. We do not maintain separate insurance to cover intellectual property infringement. Our composition of matter patent covering SEPA expired in November 2006. The expiration of that patent will enable competitors to develop SEPA-based product candidates covering applications for which we have not obtained composition and use patents. As a result, our competitive position may be adversely affected. Currently, we are not involved in any litigation, settlement negotiations or other legal action regarding patent issues and are not aware of any patent litigation threatened against us. We may, however, become involved in patent litigation against third parties to enforce our patent rights, to invalidate patents held by those third parties or to defend against claims of those third parties. We intend to enforce our patent position and defend our intellectual property rights vigorously. The cost to us of any patent litigation or similar proceeding could be substantial and it may absorb significant management time. In the event of an unfavorable resolution of any infringement litigation against us, we may be enjoined from manufacturing or selling any products without a license from a third party. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF OUR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND KNOW-HOW, THE VALUE OF OUR TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. In addition to patent protection, we utilize significant unpatented proprietary technology and rely on unpatented trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect certain aspects of our technologies. To the extent that we rely on unpatented proprietary technology, we cannot guarantee that others will not independently develop or obtain substantially equivalent or superior technologies or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, that any obligation of confidentiality will be honored or that we will be able to effectively protect our rights to our proprietary technologies. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO RETAIN OUR KEY PERSONNEL AND/OR RECRUIT ADDITIONAL KEY PERSONNEL IN THE FUTURE, OUR BUSINESS MAY SUFFER. The success of our business depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified senior management personnel and qualified scientific personnel. We consider Robert J. DeLuccia, our President and Chief Executive Officer, to be a key employee and we have entered into an employment agreement 20 with him. We do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees. In our industry, the competition for experienced personnel is intense and can be expected to increase. From time to time we may face, and in the past have faced, difficulties in attracting and retaining employees with the requisite experience and qualifications. If we fail to retain or attract this type of personnel, it could have a significant negative effect on our ability to develop our technologies. OUR FAILURE TO IDENTIFY PHARMACEUTICALS THAT ARE COMPATIBLE WITH OUR DRUG DELIVERY TECHNOLOGIES OR ADDITIONAL PRODUCT CANDIDATES OR TECHNOLOGIES WOULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO GROW. Our growth depends on our ability to identify drugs suitable for delivery using our proprietary drug delivery technologies, our ability to identify other product candidates or technologies, and our ability, financially or otherwise, to obtain such product candidates and technologies. Identifying suitable drugs or product candidates is a lengthy and complex process. Even if identified, the drugs or product candidates may not be available to us or we may otherwise be unable to enter into licenses or other agreements for their use. Other companies, including those with substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources, may compete with us for the licensing or acquisition of drugs and product candidates and we may not be able to enter into licenses or other agreements on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to identify and license or acquire drugs that are compatible with our drug delivery technologies or additional product candidates or technologies, our ability to grow our portfolio of product candidates and our prospects would be adversely affected. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY LABORATORY FACILITIES OR SCIENTIFIC PERSONNEL AND DEPEND ON THIRD PARTIES TO CONDUCT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES FOR OUR TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES. We do not have laboratory facilities or scientific personnel capable of conducting research and development activities for our technologies and product candidates and currently we do not have plans to obtain such facilities and personnel. Accordingly, our ability to conduct research and development activities is and will be limited and we will depend to a significant extent on third-party contractors for such research and development activities. If any of our third-party contractors fails to perform its obligations in a timely fashion or in accordance with applicable regulations, it may adversely affect our business. If we decide to establish internal research and development capabilities, we would need to hire and retain significant additional personnel, locate and acquire appropriate laboratory facilities, comply with extensive government regulations, and obtain additional capital, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND DEPEND ON THIRD PARTIES TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES. We do not have facilities capable of manufacturing any of our product candidates and we do not have plans to obtain these facilities. Accordingly, we will depend on third-party contractors, licensees, or corporate partners to manufacture our products. If any of our third-party manufacturers fails to perform its obligations in a timely fashion or in accordance with applicable regulations, it may delay clinical trials, the commercialization of our product 21 candidates or our ability to supply our product candidates for sale. If we decide to establish a commercial manufacturing facility, we would need to hire and retain significant additional personnel, comply with extensive government regulations, and obtain significant amounts of additional capital, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. WE FACE THE RISK OF PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, AND WE MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE TO COVER SUCH CLAIMS. IT MAY BE EXPENSIVE AND DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE INSURANCE COVERAGE. The design, development, manufacture and sale of our product candidates involve risk of liability claims and associated adverse publicity. We have product liability insurance coverage with an aggregate policy limit of approximately $10,000,000 for claims related to our product candidates that may arise from clinical trials conducted prior to November 1, 2002. We also have product liability insurance coverage with aggregate policy limits between approximately $3,000,000 and $5,000,000 for claims related to our product candidates that may arise from clinical trials conducted after September 25, 2003. In the event that our products receive regulatory approval and become commercialized, we would need to acquire additional coverage. Product liability insurance is expensive, may be difficult to obtain and may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If we obtain coverage, we cannot guarantee that the coverage limits of these insurance policies will be adequate. A successful claim against us if we are uninsured, or which is in excess of our insurance coverage, could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition. WE RELY ON A THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIER FOR A NON-ACTIVE INGREDIENT IN SOME OF OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES AND, IN THE EVENT THE SUPPLIER IS UNABLE TO SUPPLY US WITH ADEQUATE PRODUCT, OUR BUSINESS MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO TIMELY OBTAIN A SUBSTITUTE INGREDIENT. We rely on a third-party supplier, Seppic Inc., for a non-active ingredient that is important to the formulation and production of some of our topical product candidates. While we believe similar products are available from other suppliers, if Seppic Inc. were unable or unwilling to supply its product in sufficient quantities at a reasonable price, our results could suffer, as we may encounter significant costs and delays in identifying and measuring the efficacy of replacement third party products. TOGETHER, CERTAIN OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS OWN A MAJORITY OF OUR STOCK AND COULD ULTIMATELY CONTROL DECISIONS REGARDING US. In our private placement which closed in December 2005 and February 2006, we issued 825.5 shares of our Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase 7,861,912 shares of our common stock. The Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of common stock and votes together with the common stock on an as-if-converted to common stock basis. Unless a holder of Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock elects otherwise, its ability to convert its Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock into common stock or to vote on an as-if-converted to common stock basis is restricted to the extent that such conversion would result in the holder owning more than 4.95% of our issued and outstanding common stock or voting together with the common stock on an as-if-converted to common stock basis in respect of more than 4.95% of our issued and outstanding common stock. 22 The warrants issued in the private placement are subject to a similar restriction on their exercise. SCO Capital Partners LLC, Beach Capital LLC and Perceptive Life Sciences Master Fund Ltd. ("Perceptive") have elected not to be governed by these restrictions, although we have entered into an agreement with Perceptive whereby Perceptive's ability to convert or vote their shares of Series C Preferred Stock will be subject to a beneficial ownership cap of 9.95% instead of 4.95%. Consequently, as of March 7, 2007, giving effect to the beneficial ownership cap restrictions, the Series C Preferred Stock acquired by the investors is convertible into 4,967,920 shares of common stock and the holders of the Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock vote on an as-converted basis with the holders of our common stock, and therefore hold approximately 63.5% of the voting power of our outstanding securities. Assuming both the conversion of the Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock and the exercise of all of the Warrants held by the investors, in each case without regard to the beneficial ownership cap restrictions as of March 7, 2007, the investors would hold approximately 84.9% of the outstanding common stock of the Company. In addition, for so long as 20% of the Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock issued in the private placement remains outstanding, SCO Capital Partners LLC has the right to designate two members to our board of directors. Jeffrey B. Davis and Howard S. Fischer are currently serving on our board of directors as the designees of SCO Capital Partners LLC. Because of the voting rights of the Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock and the fact that the parties described above currently own a large portion of our voting stock, they may be able to generally determine or they will be able to significantly influence the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval. As a result, these parties may be in a position to control matters affecting our company, including amendments to our articles of incorporation and bylaws; payment of dividends on our common stock; and acquisitions, sales of all or substantially all of our assets, mergers or similar transactions, including transactions involving a change of control. As a result, some investors may be unwilling to purchase our common stock. In addition, if the demand for our common stock is reduced because of these shareholders' control of the Company, the price of our common stock could be materially depressed. CERTAIN OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS OWN LARGE BLOCKS OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND OWN SECURITIES CONVERTIBLE OR EXERCISABLE INTO SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AND ANY EXERCISES, CONVERSIONS OR SALES BY THESE SHAREHOLDERS COULD SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. Several of our shareholders, including those shareholders that acquired Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants to acquire common stock in our recent private placement, own large blocks of our voting stock. The shares of our common stock owned by these shareholders (or issuable to them upon exercise or conversion of warrants or Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock) will be registered. Future sales of large blocks of our common stock by any of the above investors could substantially depress our stock price. 23 RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY OUR INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND OUR COMPETITORS HAVE OR MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE RESOURCES THAN WE HAVE. We compete with a number of firms, many of which are large, multi-national organizations with worldwide distribution. We believe that our major competitors in the drug delivery sector of the health care industry include Bentley Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Biosante Pharmaceuticals, Inc., NexMed, Inc., Connetics Corporation, Antares Pharma, Inc. and Barrier Therapeutics, Inc. Competitors with approved products in the therapeutic areas that our clinical stage product candidates seek to address include, with respect to onychomycosis: o Novartis AG, maker of Lamisil(R), an oral therapy; o Johnson & Johnson, maker of Sporanox(R), an oral therapy; and o Sanofi Aventis (Dermik Laboratories), maker of Penlac, a topical nail lacquer. and with respect to male hypogonadism: o Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc., maker of Androgel(R), a topical gel therapy; o Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., maker of Testim(R), a topical gel therapy; o Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., maker of Androderm(R), a transdermal patch; and o Columbia Laboratories, Inc., maker of Striant(R), a buccal film which is placed between the patient's cheek and gum; A number of companies, including NexMed, Inc./Novartis AG, IVREA/MediQuest Therapeutics, Inc., and Schering-Plough/Anacor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are also developing topical therapies for onychomycosis. In addition, a number of other companies, including Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., are also developing topical and/or transmucosal testosterone products. These companies have or may have substantially greater capital resources, research and development and technical staff, facilities and experience in obtaining regulatory approvals, as well as in manufacturing, marketing and distributing products, than we do. Recent trends in this industry are toward further market consolidation of large drug companies into a smaller number of very large entities, further concentrating financial, technical and market strength and increasing competitive pressure in the industry. Academic institutions, hospitals, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also are conducting research and seeking patent protection and may develop competing products or technologies of their own through joint ventures or other arrangements. In addition, recently developed technologies, or technologies that may be developed in the future, may or could be the basis for competitive products which may be more effective or less costly to use than any products that we currently are developing. We expect any future products approved for sale to compete primarily on the basis of product efficacy, safety, patient compliance, reliability, price and patent position. Generally, the first pharmaceutical product to reach the market in a therapeutic or preventive area often has a significant commercial advantage 24 compared with later entrants to the market. Our competitive position also will depend on our ability to resume research and development activities, engage third parties to conduct research and development activities, attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel, develop effective proprietary products, implement production and marketing plans, obtain patent protection and secure adequate capital resources. GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE INITIATIVES TO REDUCE HEALTH CARE COSTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING AND ON OUR OPERATIONS. The future revenues and profitability of, and availability of capital for, biomedical and pharmaceutical companies may be affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and private third-party payers to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means. Reimbursement by payors such as government and managed care organizations has become an increasingly important factor in the success of a drug, as has the listing of new products on large formulary lists (as well as their designated "Tier" on such lists), including those of managed care organizations, pharmaceutical benefit providers and group buying organizations. Failure of a pharmaceutical product to be included on formulary lists, to obtain a Tier position on such formulary lists which provides for a sufficiently low patient cost, or to be reimbursed by government or managed care organizations, could negatively impact the profitability of a drug. Furthermore, in some foreign markets pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control and to possible reform in the health care system. Frequently, it is not possible to obtain pricing in foreign markets that is as favorable as that obtainable in the U.S. In the U.S., there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to impose similar governmental control. While we cannot predict whether any of these legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our prospects. If we succeed in bringing to market one or more of our product candidates, we cannot assure you that these product candidates will be cost effective or that reimbursement to the consumer will be available or will be sufficient to allow us to sell these products on a profitable basis. 25 RISKS RELATED TO THE SECURITIES MARKET OUR STOCK PRICE HAS BEEN, AND LIKELY WILL CONTINUE TO BE, HIGHLY VOLATILE, AND AS A RESULT, AN INVESTMENT IN OUR STOCK IS SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL RISK. The market price of our stock has been, and will likely continue to be, highly volatile due to the risks and uncertainties described in this section of this document, as well as other factors, including: o the discontinuance in August 2005 of all of our research and product development activities and our dependence on additional external funding in resuming such activities; o the results of our previously conducted clinical trials for our SEPA-based formulations; o conditions and publicity regarding the pharmaceutical industry generally as well as the specific therapeutic areas our product candidates seek to address; o price and volume fluctuations in the stock market at large which do not relate to our operating performance; and o our ability to raise additional capital. Over the two-year period ending December 31, 2006, the closing price of our common stock as reported on The Nasdaq National Market, The Nasdaq Capital Market, the Pink Sheets LLC and the OTC Bulletin Board ranged from a high of $33.60 to a low of $$0.26. On March 16, 2007, the closing price for our common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board was $0.55. In the past, companies that have experienced stock price volatility have sometimes been the subject of securities class action litigation. If litigation were instituted on this basis, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources. As a result of this volatility, an investment in our stock is subject to substantial risk. ON NOVEMBER 22, 2005, OUR COMMON STOCK WAS DELISTED FROM THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET FOR FAILURE TO MEET ITS LISTING STANDARDS. OUR COMMON STOCK CURRENTLY IS QUOTED ON THE OTC BULLETIN BOARD, WHICH INVESTORS MAY PERCEIVE AS LESS DESIRABLE AND WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE LIQUIDITY OF AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK. Our listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market was conditioned on our compliance with Nasdaq's continued listing requirements. The minimum standards for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market include stockholders' equity of $2.5 million or market capitalization of $35 million and a minimum bid price of $1.00. On October 18, 2005, we received a Nasdaq Staff Determination indicating that our securities were subject to delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market as we did not comply with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing. We requested a hearing before a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel to review the Staff Determination. On November 21, 2005, we withdrew our appeal of the Nasdaq Staff Determination and our common stock was delisted from quotation on the Nasdaq Capital Market effective as of Tuesday, November 22, 2005. 26 Immediately thereafter, our common stock was quoted on the Pink Sheets LLC, and on December 22, 2005, our stock became eligible for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board and presently trades under the symbol "MACM.OB." The over-the-counter market is generally considered to be a less efficient system than markets such as Nasdaq or other national exchanges because of lower trading volumes, transaction delays and reduced security analyst and news media coverage. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our common stock. Additionally, trading of our common stock in an over-the-counter market may make us less desirable to institutional investors and may, therefore, limit our future equity funding options. WE ARE CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO ISSUE SHARES IN THE FUTURE, DILUTING YOUR INTEREST IN US. As of March 7, 2007, our Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into an aggregate of, giving effect to the beneficial ownership restrictions on conversion, 4,967,920 shares of common stock (7,442,853 shares of common stock without regard to the beneficial ownership restrictions on conversion). In addition, we are required to issue quarterly dividends on our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, which we may elect to pay in shares of our common stock. In addition, as of March 7, 2007, there are outstanding and exercisable warrants to purchase approximately 8,701,573 shares of our common stock, at a weighted average exercise price of $1.48 per share. As of March 7, 2007, there also are outstanding and exercisable options to purchase approximately 724,850 shares of our common stock, at a weighted average exercise price of $14.04 per share. Moreover, we expect to issue additional options to purchase shares of our common stock to compensate employees, consultants and directors and may issue additional shares to raise capital, acquire other companies or technologies, to pay for services, or for other corporate purposes. Any such issuances will have the effect of further diluting the interest of common stockholders. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. Not applicable.
