Item 1A. Risk Factors. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before purchasing our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could fall, and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS The dialysis provider market is highly concentrated in national and regional dialysis chains that account for the majority of our domestic revenue. Our business is substantially dependent on one of our customers that accounts for a substantial portion of our sales. The loss of this customer would have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and cash flow. Our revenue is highly concentrated in a few customers and the loss of any of those customers could adversely affect our results. One customer in particular accounted for 51% of our total sales during 2008. If we were to lose this customer or our relationship with any of our other major national and regional dialysis chain customers, it would have a substantial negative impact on our cash flow and operating results and could have a detrimental impact on our ability to continue our operations in their current form or to continue to execute our business strategy. If we lost a substantial portion of our business, we would be required to take actions to conserve our cash resources and to mitigate the impact of any such losses on our business operations. We operate in a very competitive market against substantially larger competitors with greater resources. There is intense competition in the hemodialysis product market and our competitors are large diversified companies which have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, research and development and management resources than we do. We may not be able to successfully compete with these other companies. Our national competitors have historically used product bundling and low pricing as marketing techniques to capture market share of the products we sell and as we do not manufacture or sell the same breadth of products as our competitors, we may be at a disadvantage in competing against their marketing strategies. 12 Table of Contents Our new drug product requires FDA approval and expensive clinical trials before it can be marketed. We are seeking FDA approval for SFP, a drug used in the treatment of anemia. Obtaining FDA approval for any drug is expensive and can take a long time. We may not be successful in obtaining FDA approval for SFP. The FDA may change, expand or alter its requirements for testing which may increase the scope, duration and cost of our clinical development plan. Clinical trials are expensive and time consuming to complete, and we may not be able to raise or obtain sufficient funds to complete the clinical trials to obtain marketing approval. Our clinical trials might not prove successful. In addition, the FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time. Many products that undergo clinical trials are never approved for patient use. Thus, it is possible that our new proprietary products may never be approved to be marketed. If we are unable to obtain marketing approval, our entire investment in new products may be worthless and our licensing rights could be forfeited. Even if our new drug product is approved by the FDA it may not be successfully marketed. Several drugs currently dominate treatment for iron deficiency and new drugs treating this indication will have to compete against existing products. It may be difficult to gain market acceptance of a new product. Nephrologists, anemia managers and dialysis chains may be slow to change their clinical practice protocols for new products or may not change their protocols at all. Dialysis providers are dependent upon government reimbursement practices for the majority of their revenue. Even if we obtain FDA approval for our new product, there is no guarantee that our customers would receive reimbursement for the new product, even though the current treatment method is reimbursed by the government. Without such reimbursement, it is unlikely that our customers would adopt a new treatment method. There is a risk that our new product may not receive reimbursement or may not receive the same level of reimbursement that is currently in place. We may not be successful in improving our gross profit margins and our business may remain unprofitable. A significant portion of our costs are for chemicals and fuel which are subject to pricing volatility based on demand and are highly influenced by the overall level of economic activity. Since 2007, we have experienced dramatic increases in our costs which we have not yet been able to fully recover from our customers through price increases. While we have recently changed certain vendors and realized cost decreases in several of our key cost inputs, we may be subject to future cost increases which may negatively impact our results if we are unable to recover those cost increases. If we are unable to improve our gross profit margins by reducing our costs and increasing our prices, our business may remain unprofitable. Our products are distribution-intensive, resulting in a high cost to deliver relative to the selling prices of our products. The cost of diesel fuel represents a significant operating cost for us. If oil costs increase or if oil prices spike upward, we may be unable to recover those increased costs through higher pricing. Also, as we increase our business in certain markets and regions, which are farther from our manufacturing facilities than we have historically served, we may incur additional costs that are greater than the additional revenue generated from these initiatives. Our customer mix may change to a less favorable customer base with lower gross profit margins. Our competitors have often used bundling techniques to sell a broad range of products and have often offered low prices on dialysis concentrate products to induce customers to purchase their other higher margin products, such as dialysis machines and dialyzers. It may be difficult for us to raise prices due to these competitive pressures. Our suppliers may increase their prices faster than we are able to raise our prices to offset such increases. We may have limited ability to gain a raw material pricing advantage by changing vendors for certain chemicals and packaging materials. As we increase our manufacturing and distribution infrastructure we may incur costs for an indefinite period that are greater than the incremental revenue we derive from these expansion efforts. 13 Table of Contents We depend on government funding of healthcare. Many of our customers receive the majority of their funding from the government and are supplemented by payments from private health care insurers. Our customers depend on Medicare and Medicaid funding to be viable businesses. If Medicare and Medicaid funding were to be materially decreased, our customers would be severely impacted and could be unable to pay us. We may not have sufficient cash to fund future growth or SFP development. Our research and development plan for SFP is expected to result in significant cash outlays beyond 2009. We expect to spend between $3.5-$4.0 million in 2009 on SFP product development and approval. We believe we have adequate cash resources to fund the testing and regulatory approval for SFP in 2009. However, for us to complete our Phase III clinical development plan we will need to obtain additional funding. SFP development costs for Phase III and to obtain FDA approval are projected from 2010 until approval to be $15 million or more. Also, if our current clinical trial efforts do not achieve acceptable results, we may have to do more testing and, depending on the scope and duration of any additional testing, our available cash resources may not be sufficient to fund that additional testing. We are likely to require additional capital in 2010. If conditions in the credit and equity markets do not improve during 2009, we may be unable to obtain the financing we will need in future years on terms we deem acceptable or in the best interests of our Company and our shareholders, or such financing may not be available to us at all. If such financing is not available, we may have to take action to conserve capital, such as alter our strategy, delay spending on development initiatives or take other actions to conserve cash resources. Orders from our international distributors may not result in recurring revenue. Our revenue from international distributors may not recur consistently or may not recur at all. Such revenue is often dependent upon government funding in those nations and there may be local, regional or geopolitical changes that may impact funding of healthcare expenditures in those nations. We depend on key personnel. Our success depends heavily on the efforts of Robert L. Chioini, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Richard Yocum MD, our Vice President of Drug Development & Medical Affairs, and Thomas E. Klema, our Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer. Mr. Chioini is primarily responsible for managing our sales and marketing efforts. Dr. Yocum is primarily responsible for managing our product development efforts. None of our executive management are parties to a current employment agreement with the Company. If we lose the services of Mr. Chioini, Dr. Yocum or Mr. Klema, our business, product development efforts, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our business is highly regulated. The testing, manufacture and sale of the products we manufacture and distribute are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and by other federal, state and foreign authorities. Before medical devices can be commercially marketed in the United States, the FDA must give either 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval for the devices. If we do not comply with these requirements, we may be subject to a variety of sanctions, including fines, injunctions, seizure of products, suspension of production, denial of future regulatory approvals, withdrawal of existing regulatory approvals and criminal prosecution. Our business could be adversely affected by any of these actions. Although our hemodialysis concentrates have been cleared by the FDA, it could rescind these clearances and any new products or modifications to our current products that we develop could fail to receive FDA clearance. If the FDA rescinds or denies any current or future clearances or approvals for our products, we would be prohibited from selling those products in the United States until we obtain such clearances or approvals. Our business would be adversely affected by any such prohibition, any delay in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, and any limits placed by the FDA on our intended use. Our products are also subject to federal regulations regarding 14 Table of Contents manufacturing quality. In addition, our new products will be subject to review as a pharmaceutical drug by the FDA. Changes in applicable regulatory requirements could significantly increase the costs of our operations and may reduce our profitability if we are unable to recover any such cost increases through higher prices. We depend on contract research organizations and consultants to manage and conduct our clinical trials and if they fail to follow our protocol or meet FDA regulatory requirements our clinical trial data and results could be compromised causing us to delay our development plans or have to do more testing than planned. We utilize a contract research organization to conduct our clinical trials in accordance with a specified protocol. We also contract with other third party service providers for clinical trial material production, packaging and labeling, lab testing, data management services as well as a number of other services. There can be no assurance that these organizations will fulfill their commitments to us on a timely basis or that the accuracy and quality of the clinical data they provide us will not be compromised by their failure to fulfill their obligations. If these service providers do not perform as contracted, our development plans could be adversely affected. Foreign approvals to market our new drug products may be difficult to obtain. The approval procedures for the marketing of our new drug products in foreign countries vary from country to country, and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Even after foreign approvals are obtained, further delays may be encountered before products may be marketed. Many countries require additional governmental approval for price reimbursement under national health insurance systems. Additional studies may be required to obtain foreign regulatory approval. Further, some foreign regulatory agencies may require additional studies involving patients located in their countries. Health care reform could adversely affect our business. The federal and state governments in the United States, as well as many foreign governments, from time to time explore ways to reduce medical care costs through health care reform. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate features of reform initiatives and their enactment and implementation, we cannot predict what impact any reform proposal ultimately adopted may have on the pharmaceutical and medical device industry or on our business or operating results. We may not have sufficient products liability insurance. As a supplier of medical products, we may face potential liability from a person who claims that he or she suffered harm as a result of using our products. We maintain products liability insurance in the amount of $3 million per occurrence and $3 million in the aggregate. We cannot be sure that it will remain economical to retain our current level of insurance, that our current insurance will remain available or that such insurance would be sufficient to protect us against liabilities associated with our business. We may be sued, and we may have significant legal expenses that are not covered by insurance. In addition, our reputation could be damaged by product liability litigation and that could harm our marketing ability. Any litigation could also hurt our ability to retain products liability insurance or make such insurance more expensive. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by an uninsured or inadequately insured product liability claim in the future. Our Board of Directors is subject to potential deadlock. Our Board of Directors presently has four members, and under our bylaws, approval by a majority of the Directors is required for many significant corporate actions. It is possible that our Board of Directors may be unable to obtain majority approval in certain circumstances, which would prevent us from taking action. 15 Table of Contents RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK Shares eligible for future sale may affect the market price of our common shares. We are unable to predict the effect, if any, that future sales of common shares, or the availability of our common shares for future sales, will have on the market price of our common shares from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of our common shares (including shares issued upon the exercise of stock options or warrants), or the possibility of such sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common shares and also impair our ability to raise capital through an offering of our equity securities in the future. As of December 31, 2008 an additional 1,204,169 shares may be issued upon exercise of outstanding warrants. In addition, as of December 31, 2008, there were an additional 955,000 warrants that become exercisable over the next two years. In the future, we may issue additional shares or warrants in connection with investments, repayment of our debt or for other purposes considered advisable by our Board of Directors. Any substantial sale of our common shares may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares. In addition, as of December 31, 2008, there were 3,121,364 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding and exercisable stock options, 941,667 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options that are not yet exercisable and 435,000 additional shares available for grant under our 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan. Additional grants were made in 2009. The market price of the common shares may be depressed by the potential exercise of these options. The holders of these options are likely to exercise them when we would otherwise be able to obtain additional capital on more favorable terms than those provided by the options. Further, while the options are outstanding, we may be unable to obtain additional financing on favorable terms. The market price of our securities may be volatile. The historically low trading volume of our common shares may also cause the market price of the common shares to fluctuate significantly in response to a relatively low number of trades or transactions. Voting control and anti-takeover provisions reduce the likelihood that you will receive a takeover premium. As of December 31, 2008, our officers and directors beneficially owned approximately 23.2% of our voting shares (assuming the exercise of exercisable options granted to such officers and directors). Accordingly, they may be able to effectively control our affairs. Our shareholders do not have the right to cumulative voting in the election of directors. In addition, the Board of Directors has the authority, without shareholder approval, to issue shares of preferred stock having such rights, preferences and privileges as the Board of Directors may determine. Any such issuance of preferred stock could, under certain circumstances, have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and may adversely affect the rights of holders of common shares, including by decreasing the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of common shares and adversely affect the relative voting power or other rights of the holders of the common shares. In addition, we are subject to Michigan statutes regulating business combinations which might also hinder or delay a change in control. Anti-takeover provisions that could be included in the preferred stock when issued and the Michigan statutes regulating business combinations, takeovers and control share acquisitions can have a depressive effect on the market price of our common shares and can limit shareholders ability to receive a premium on their shares by discouraging takeover and tender offers. Our directors serve staggered three-year terms, and directors may not be removed without cause. Our Articles of Incorporation also set the minimum and maximum number of directors constituting the entire Board at three and fifteen, respectively, and require approval of holders of a majority of our voting shares to amend these provisions. These provisions could have an anti-takeover effect by making it more difficult to acquire us by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise, or to remove incumbent directors. These provisions could delay, deter or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his or her best interests, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the common shares. 16 Table of Contents We do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future. Since inception, we have not paid any cash dividend on our common shares and do not anticipate paying such dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and requirements, future prospects, restrictions in future financing agreements, business conditions and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. We intend to retain earnings and cash resources, if any, to finance our operations and, therefore, it is highly unlikely we will pay cash dividends. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.
