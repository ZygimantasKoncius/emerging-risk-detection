RISK FACTORS Set out below are certain risk factors which could affect NatWest Group’s future results and cause them to be materially different from expected results. NatWest Group’s results are also affected by competition and other factors. The factors discussed in this report should not be regarded as a complete and comprehensive statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. NatWest Group's business and earnings are affected by general business and geopolitical conditions The performance of NatWest Group is influenced by economic conditions particularly in the UK, US and Europe. Downturns in these economies could result in a general reduction in business activity and a consequent loss of income for NatWest Group. It could also cause a higher incidence of credit losses and losses in NatWest Group's trading portfolios. Geopolitical conditions can also affect NatWest Group’s earnings. Terrorist acts and threats and the response of Governments in the UK, US and elsewhere to them could affect the level of economic activity. NatWest Group's business is also exposed to the risk of business interruption and economic slowdown following the outbreak of a pandemic. The financial performance of NatWest Group is affected by borrower credit quality Risks arising from changes in credit quality and the recoverability of loans and amounts due from counterparties are inherent in a wide range of NatWest Group’s businesses. Adverse changes in the credit quality of NatWest Group’s borrowers and counterparties or a general deterioration in UK, or global economic conditions, or arising from systemic risks in the financial systems, could affect the recoverability and value of NatWest Group’s assets and require an increase in the provision for impairment losses and other provisions. Changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and other market factors affect NatWest Group’s business The most significant market risks NatWest Group faces are interest rate, foreign exchange and bond and equity price risks. Changes in interest rate levels, yield curves and spreads may affect the interest rate margin realised between lending and borrowing costs. Changes in currency rates, particularly in the sterling-dollar and sterling-euro exchange rates, affect the value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and affect earnings reported by NatWest Group’s non-UK subsidiaries, mainly RBS Greenwich Capital and Ulster Bank, and may affect income from foreign exchange dealing. The performance of financial markets may cause changes in the value of NatWest Group’s investment and trading portfolios. NatWest Group has implemented risk management methods to mitigate and control these and other market risks to which NatWest Group is exposed. However, it is difficult to predict with accuracy changes in economic or market conditions and to anticipate the effects that such changes could have on NatWest Group’s financial performance and business operations. 6 Table of Contents NatWest Group’s borrowing costs and its access to the debt capital markets depend significantly on its credit ratings On 22 April 2008, Moody’s rating service announced that it was placing the long-term ratings of the Bank under review for possible downgrade. A reduction in the long-term credit ratings may increase borrowing costs, limit access to the capital markets and trigger additional collateral requirements in derivative contracts and other secured funding arrangements. Credit ratings are also important to NatWest Group when competing in certain markets, such as longer-term over-the-counter derivatives. Therefore, further reductions in the NatWest Group’s credit ratings could adversely affect its access to liquidity and competitive position and, hence, negatively impact its earnings. NatWest Group’s business performance could be affected if its capital resources are not managed effectively NatWest Group’s capital is critical to its ability to operate its businesses, to grow organically and to take advantage of strategic opportunities. NatWest Group is required by regulators in the UK and in other jurisdictions in which it undertakes regulated activities to maintain adequate capital resources. NatWest Group mitigates the risk by careful management of its balance sheet and capital resources, through capital raising activities, disciplined capital allocation and the hedging of capital currency exposures. Liquidity risk is inherent in NatWest Group’s operations Liquidity risk is the risk that NatWest Group will be unable to meet its obligations as they fall due. This risk is inherent in banking operations and can be heightened by a number of enterprise specific factors such as an over reliance on a particular source of funding, changes in credit ratings or by marketwide phenomena such as market dislocation and major disasters. NatWest Group’s liquidity management focuses on maintaining a diverse and appropriate funding strategy for its assets, in controlling the mis-match of maturities and from carefully monitoring its undrawn commitments and contingent liabilities. NatWest Group’s future earnings could be affected by market illiquidity Financial markets are sometimes subject to significant stress conditions where steep falls in perceived or actual asset values are accompanied by severe reduction in market liquidity, such as recent events in the US sub-prime residential mortgage market. In dislocated markets, hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective as they are in normal market conditions. Severe market events are difficult to foresee and, if they occur, could result in NatWest Group incurring significant losses. In 2007, NatWest Group recorded significant write-downs on its trading portfolios. As market conditions change the fair value of NatWest Group’s instruments could fall further. Furthermore, recent market volatility and illiquidity has made it difficult to value certain of NatWest Group’s financial instruments. Valuations in future periods, reflecting prevailing market conditions, may result in significant changes in the fair values of these instruments. In addition, the value ultimately realised by NatWest Group will depend on the market price at that time and may be materially lower than current fair value. Any of these factors could require NatWest Group to recognise further write-downs which may adversely affect NatWest Group’s future results. 7 Table of Contents Operational risks are inherent in NatWest Group’s business NatWest Group’s businesses are dependent on the ability to process a very large number of transactions efficiently and accurately. Operational losses can result from fraud, errors by employees, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper authorisation, failure to comply with regulatory requirements and Conduct of Business rules, equipment failures, natural disasters or the failure of external systems, for example, NatWest Group’s suppliers or counterparties. Although NatWest Group has implemented risk controls and loss mitigation actions, and substantial resources are devoted to developing efficient procedures and to staff training, it is only possible to be reasonably, but not absolutely, certain that such procedures will be effective in controlling each of the operational risks faced by NatWest Group. Each of NatWest Group’s businesses is subject to substantial regulation and regulatory oversight. Any significant regulatory developments could have an effect on how NatWest Group conducts its business and on NatWest Group’s results of operations NatWest Group is subject to financial services laws, regulations, administrative actions and policies in each location in which NatWest Group operates. This supervision and regulation, in particular in the UK, if changed could materially affect NatWest Group’s business, the products and services offered or the value of assets. In the normal course of business NatWest Group and its subsidiaries co-operate with regulatory authorities in various jurisdictions in their enquiries or investigations into alleged or possible breaches of regulations. NatWest Group has co-operated fully with various regulatory reviews of the operation of retail banking and consumer credit industries in the UK and elsewhere. The outcome of these reviews is outside the Group’s control and it is not possible to predict the effect, if any, on the Group’s operations of future changes in regulatory actions and policies. Future growth in NatWest Group’s earnings and shareholder value depends on strategic decisions regarding organic growth and potential acquisitions NatWest Group devotes substantial management and planning resources to the development of strategic plans for organic growth and identification of possible acquisitions, supported by substantial expenditure to generate growth in customer business. If these strategic plans do not meet with success, NatWest Group’s earnings could grow more slowly or decline. The risk of litigation is inherent in NatWest Group’s operations In the ordinary course of NatWest Group’s business, legal actions, claims against and by NatWest Group and arbitrations arise; the outcome of such legal proceedings could affect the financial performance of NatWest Group. NatWest Group is exposed to the risk of changes in tax legislation and its interpretation and to increases in the rate of corporate and other taxes in the jurisdictions in which it operates NatWest Group’s activities are subject to tax at various rates around the world computed in accordance with local legislation and practice. Action by governments to increase tax rates or to impose additional taxes would reduce the profitability of NatWest Group. Revisions to tax legislation or to its interpretation might also affect NatWest Group's results in the future. 8 Table of Contents
