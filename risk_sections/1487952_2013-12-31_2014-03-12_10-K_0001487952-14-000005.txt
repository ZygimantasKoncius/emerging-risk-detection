Item 1A. RISK FACTORSYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating our company and common stock. Any of the following risks, as well as additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition and could also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.Risks Related to Our BusinessWe face intense competition in our business.We face various degrees and types of competition in our different businesses. In some cases our products compete directly with those of third party competitors. In other cases, competition in one segment, such as in our Weighing and Control Systems segment, may affect not only the sales of our systems within that segment, but also sales of products that we incorporate in those systems from other segments, such as load cells and strain gages.We have a significant market position in foil resistors and foil strain gages. Foil resistors and foil strain gages are also produced by competitors, principally located in China. We believe that our foil technology products provide superior performance relative to our competitors, but that could change if our competitors succeed in developing and introducing innovative competitive offerings. Also, our foil strain gages compete with other types of strain gages, such as semiconductor strain gages, which we do not manufacture. We believe that other types of strain gages are not as reliable or stable as our foil strain gages, but that could change as the technology for these other products continues to evolve. If our competitors are able to improve the quality, performance, or pricing of their products relative to our offerings, our results of operations could be adversely affected.The market for transducer/load cell products is highly fragmented and very competitive. Our load cell modules and systems face competition from numerous other load cell module and systems manufacturers. Competition for modules and systems is most often based on customer relationships, product reliability, technical performance, and the ability to anticipate and satisfy customer needs for specific design configurations. Many other manufacturers have more experience in particular geographic markets and specific applications than we do, and may be better positioned to compete in these areas. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully grow our business in the face of these competitive challenges.Our vertical product integration exposes us to certain risks.Our business organization is focused on vertical product integration. For example, we use our strain gages in our force sensor products and our force sensor business is our largest customer (by volume) for our strain gages. Similarly, our weighing and control systems business primarily uses our force sensor products in its systems. Many of the acquisitions which form the core operations of our business in recent years, including our January 2013 acquisition of the KELK business, have been directed towards furthering our vertical integration. While we believe this has been, and will continue to be, a sound business strategy, vertical product integration and the resulting interdependencies of our divisions exposes us to certain risks. As a consequence of our vertical integration, our force sensors business may compete with certain of our customers and potential customers for strain gages while our systems business may compete with certain of our customers and potential customers for force sensors, who, for that reason, may elect not to do business with us. In the past we have grown through successful integration of acquired businesses, but this may not continue.Our long-term historical growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted in large part from our strategy of expansion through acquisitions. We cannot assure that we will identify, have the financial capabilities to acquire, or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future. We also cannot assure that acquisitions that we will complete in the future will be successful.Such acquisitions or investments, including our acquisition of KELK, involve a number of risks, including the following: •we may be unable to achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquisition or investment; •we may have difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business, and may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business; •we may have difficulty incorporating the acquired technologies or products with our existing solutions; •our ongoing business and management's attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations; and•we may lose customers of those companies due to the change in control or for other reasons. - 11 - The factors noted above could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition, such as the KELK acquisition. From time to time, we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated. These negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time, as well as out-of-pocket costs.Future acquisitions may require us to incur or issue additional indebtedness or issue additional equity.We financed a portion of the purchase price paid in the KELK acquisition with additional borrowings under our credit agreement. If we were to undertake future substantial acquisitions for cash, these acquisitions would likely need to be financed in part through bank borrowings or the issuance of public or private debt. This acquisition financing would likely decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other credit metrics. Our revolving credit facilities require us to obtain the lenders’ consent for certain additional debt financing and to comply with other covenants, including the application of specific financial ratios. We cannot assure that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms, if and when, required. If we were to make an acquisition with equity, the acquisition may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common stock. We might require additional capital to support business growth and this capital might not be available.We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges or opportunities, including the need to develop new offerings or enhance our existing offerings, enhance our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions.In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. We may encounter difficulties in the implementation or operation of new enterprise resource planning systems. During the third fiscal quarter of 2013, we implemented a new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system in our Foil Technology Products segment at three global locations. This ERP system is integral to our ability to accurately and efficiently manage our manufacturing and sales activities for this segment and provide critical business information to management. The implementation of the ERP system has caused, and may continue to cause, us to incur additional costs, shipment delays, and related customer dissatisfaction; expend employee (including Company management) time and attention; and otherwise burden our internal resources. Any difficulties we encounter with the continued implementation or successful operation of the ERP system could damage the effectiveness of our business processes and could adversely impact our ability to accurately and effectively forecast and manage sales demand, manage our supply chain, and report management information on an accurate and timely basis, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. If we implement additional ERP systems relating to other portions of our business in the future, we may encounter similar difficulties and associated possible adverse impacts.To remain successful, we must continue to innovate, and our investments in new technologies may not prove successful. Our future operating results depend on our ability to continually develop, introduce and market new and innovative products, to modify existing products, to respond to technological change, and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements. There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands. If this occurs, we could lose customers and experience adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. Our success is dependent upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property. We rely on a combination of the protections provided by applicable patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as on confidentiality procedures and other contractual arrangements, to establish and protect our rights in our technology and related materials and information. We enter into agreements with our customers and distributors. These agreements contain confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions, a limited warranty covering our products and indemnification for the customer from infringement actions related to our products. - 12 - Despite our efforts, it may be possible for others to copy portions of our products, reverse engineer them or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary, all of which could adversely affect our competitive position. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop technology similar to ours. The laws of certain countries in which we manufacture do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. In the Office of the United States Trade Representative (“USTR”) annual "Special 301" Report released in May 2013, the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection in a number of foreign countries were analyzed. A number of countries in which we manufacture are identified in the report as being on the Priority Watch List. In China, for instance, the USTR is concerned about the existence of serious obstacles to the effective protection of intellectual property rights, including the concern that China may treat foreign owned intellectual property differently than that owned or developed in China. The USTR has also expressed an escalating concern about the theft of trade secrets in China (especially via cyber theft), with some theft possibly involving the Chinese government. The USTR also expressed concern that India continues to have a weak legal framework and enforcement system. Argentina, Chile, Indonesia, Russia, Thailand, and Venezuela were also identified because of problems in intellectual property enforcement, and the Ukraine was the first country named on the Priority Foreign Country list in seven years due to a culmination of several years of growing concern over widespread intellectual property theft that is facilitated by government there. The absence of harmonized intellectual property protection laws and effective enforcement makes it difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent and other intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis. As a result, it is possible that we will not be able to enforce our rights against third parties that misappropriate our proprietary technology in those countries. The success of our business is highly dependent on maintenance of intellectual property rights. The unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. We seek to protect trade secrets and our other proprietary technology in part by requiring each of our employees to enter into non-disclosure and intellectual property assignment agreements. In these agreements, the employee agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all of our proprietary information and, subject to certain exceptions, to assign to us all rights in any proprietary information or technology made or contributed by the employee during his or her employment. Generally, we do not enter into non-compete arrangements with our employees, with the exception of certain executives and, in some cases, one or more of the principals of the businesses that we acquire. All of these types of agreements may be breached or be found unenforceable, and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach of, or inability to enforce, these agreements. We may initiate, or be subject to, claims or litigation for infringement of proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights, which could result in significant expense to us, cause product shipment delays, require us to enter royalty or licensing agreements, and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel from productive tasks, whether or not such litigation were determined in our favor. We may be exposed to product liability claims. While our agreements with our customers and distributors typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential material product liability claims, including appropriate warranty, indemnification, damages waiver and limitation of liability provisions, it is possible that such provisions may not be effective under the laws of some jurisdictions, thus exposing us to substantial liability. Moreover, defending a suit, regardless of its merits, could entail substantial expense and require the time and attention of key management personnel. If product liability claims are brought against us, the costs associated with defending such claims may adversely affect our results of operations and future cash flows. We must expend significant resources to obtain design wins without assurance that we will be successful.In many cases, we must initiate communication with our customers, and convince the customer that our products and systems will offer solutions for its business that are technically superior and more cost effective compared to their existing arrangements. To do so, we must often expend significant financial and human resources to develop technologically compelling products or systems with no guarantee that they will be adopted by our customers. The non-recurring engineering (“NRE”) costs for product development in these cases could be substantial and may adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these costs.Also, customers will often require a lengthy period of onsite testing before committing to purchase a product or system, during which period we will not receive material revenue from the customer. While a design win for our products and systems may result in a long period of recurring revenue during which we hope to recover our costs, we must often internally finance our development costs over significant time periods. If our products or systems fail to gain acceptance with our customers, we will be forced to absorb any NRE costs, which could adversely affect our business if these costs are substantial. - 13 - The long development times for certain of our products and systems may result in unpredictable fluctuations in revenue and results of operations. Our force sensor products and weighing and control systems often involve long product development cycles, both to develop the product or system and to secure customer acceptance following what may be a lengthy onsite testing period. During product development and testing, we may incur substantial costs without corresponding revenues. If our custom product or system is ultimately accepted by the customer, we may then begin to realize substantial revenues from our development efforts.In particular, our weighing and control systems can be priced for several hundred thousand dollars per unit, so that a contract to acquire one or more units can materially contribute to our revenues during the period or periods that we are permitted to recognize the contract revenues for accounting purposes. The nature of our weighing and control products and systems, and in particular, the products and systems manufactured by the KELK business, may therefore result in substantial fluctuations in our operating results, including revenues and profitability, from period to period, even though there has been no fundamental change in our business or its prospects. This may make it difficult for investors to undertake period-to-period comparisons of our performance. Also, the fluctuating nature of key components of our revenues may limit the visibility of our management regarding performance in future periods and make it more difficult for our management to provide guidance to our investors. We may not have adequate facilities to satisfy future increases in demand for our products. Our business is cyclical and in periods of a rising economy, we may experience intense demand for our products. During such periods, we may have difficulty expanding our manufacturing capacity to satisfy demand. Factors which could limit such expansion include delays in procurement of manufacturing equipment, shortages of skilled personnel, and physical constraints on expansion at our facilities. If we are unable to meet our customers’ requirements and our competitors sufficiently expand production, we could lose customers and/or market share. These losses could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Also, capacity that we add during upturns in the business cycle may result in excess capacity during periods when demand for our products recedes, resulting in inefficient use of capital adversely affecting our business.The nature of the market for our products may render them particularly susceptible to downturns in the economic environment.Our products are designed to replace and provide superior functionality over existing product infrastructure utilized by our customers. Often, it is only after introductory demonstrations by our sales and engineering teams that our customers come to appreciate the advantages of our products and systems and the long-term benefits of their adoption. An economic downturn or extended period of economic uncertainty may make customers less receptive to adopting new technological solutions at our suggestion; even ones with demonstrated operational and financial advantages. During these periods, customers may defer or even cancel orders for products and systems for which they have previously contracted or given indications of interest.Also, because our business is concentrated largely in the industrial sector, we do not benefit from countervailing fluctuations in consumer demand. As a result, our business may be more significantly affected by the consequences of a general economic slowdown than other segments of our industry and may also take longer to recover from the effects of a slowdown.Our backlog is subject to customer cancellation. Many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be canceled by our customers without penalty. Our customers, particularly for our foil technology products, often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive, a situation that we have experienced during periods of economic slowdown. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog accurately forecasts the level of orders that will ultimately be delivered. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog. The complexity of our sophisticated weighing and control systems may require costly corrections if design flaws are found. Our weighing and control systems combine sophisticated electronic hardware and computer software. We believe that the sophistication of our systems contributes to their competitive advantage over similar products offered by other system integrators. We go to substantial lengths to assure that our system products are free of design flaws when they are delivered to our customers for installation and testing. However, due to the systems’ complexity, design flaws may occur and require correction. If the requisite corrections are substantial or difficult to implement due to the systems’ complexity, we may not be able to recover the costs of correction and retesting, with the result that our profit margins on these systems could be substantially reduced, or even negated by losses, and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. - 14 - Our results are sensitive to raw material availability, quality, and cost. Although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources, certain materials are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers. The materials that are only available from a limited number of sources include certain molding compounds, metal package suppliers, low resistance switches, polyimide film and laminating adhesives. We generally maintain a supply of strategic raw materials for continuity and risk management. Our customers would need significant advance notification to qualify alternative materials, if we had to use them. Alternative suppliers are available worldwide for most of our raw materials, but significant time (between 3 to 12 months) would be required to qualify new suppliers and establish efficient production scheduling. Certain metals used in the manufacture of our products are traded on active markets, and can be subject to significant price volatility. Our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, if the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, if there are significant price changes for these raw materials, or if compliance with the laws and regulations described below proves costly and time-consuming. For periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising, we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers, which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used. For periods in which the prices are declining, we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials, since we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market. Depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost, this write-down could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings. We also may need to record losses for adverse purchase commitments for these materials in periods of declining prices. Pursuant to the SEC’s “conflict minerals” rules, reporting companies that determine that certain metals, dubbed “conflict minerals” by the SEC (which include tantalum, gold, tin and tungsten sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries), are necessary to the functionality or production of a product they manufacture or contract to have manufactured must file a specialized disclosure form with the SEC. The implementation of these requirements has increased our legal compliance costs and may affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our products. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all metals used in our products.Our product sales may be adversely affected by changes in product classification levels under various qualification and specification standards. Certain of our products must be qualified or approved under various military and aerospace specifications and other standards. We have qualified certain of our foil resistor products under various military specifications approved and monitored by the DLA, and under certain European military specifications, and various aerospace standards approved by NASA and the ESA. Qualification and specification levels are based in part upon product failure rate. We must continuously perform tests on our products, and for products that are qualified, the results of these tests must be reported to the qualifying organization. Certain of our force sensor products are approved by the NTEP and OIML. Our on-board weighing systems must meet approved standards to make them legal-for-trade. If a product fails to meet the requirements for the applicable classification level or other approval, the product’s classification or approval may be suspended or reduced to a lower level. During the time that the classification is suspended or reduced to a lower level, net revenues and earnings attributable to that product may be adversely affected. Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, managerial, marketing, finance, and administrative personnel. The competitive environment of our business requires us to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to develop technological innovations and bring them to market on a timely basis. Our complex operations also require us to attract and retain highly qualified administrative personnel in functions such as legal, tax, accounting, financial reporting, and treasury. The market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive. We have not entered into employment agreements with many of our key personnel. The loss of the services of, or the failure to effectively recruit, qualified personnel, including for key executive positions, could have a material adverse effect on our business. - 15 - Failure to maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our ability to meet our reporting requirements. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports, and to effectively prevent fraud. Internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our operating results could be harmed. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our acquisition of new businesses, such as our acquisition of KELK, requires the integration and harmonization of the acquired business’ internal controls with our existing internal controls in order to properly account for the acquired business’ assets and operations. If we fail to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on our stock price. Future changes in our environmental liability and compliance obligations may harm our ability to operate or increase costs.Our manufacturing operations, products and/or packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes, workplace health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products or packaging, restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or packaging, and responsibility for disposal of products or packaging. We establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities which we believe are adequate. Nevertheless, new liabilities could arise, and we may have unavoidably inherited certain pre-existing environmental liabilities, generally based on successor liability doctrines. Although we have never been involved in any environmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations, there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future operation, acquisition or otherwise, we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our operations. In addition, more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations. Our credit facilities subject us to financial and operating restrictions. We maintain revolving credit agreements and term loans with banks that we use, or may use, for working capital, acquisition financing and other purposes. These credit facilities subject us to certain restrictions which may affect, and in some cases significantly limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to: •borrow additional funds; •pay dividends or make other distributions; •repurchase our common stock;•make investments, including capital expenditures; •complete acquisitions; •engage in transactions with affiliates or subsidiaries; or •create liens on our assets. The credit facilities also require us to maintain certain financial ratios. If we fail to comply with the covenant restrictions contained in either credit facility, that failure could result in defaults under both credit facilities that would accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness for those facilities. Unexpected events, such as a natural disaster, could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations.We have manufacturing and other facilities in countries around the world. Unexpected events, including fires or explosions at facilities; natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes; war or terrorist activities; unplanned outages; supply disruptions; and failures of equipment or systems at any of our facilities could adversely affect our results of operation. If adverse conditions were to arise with respect to any of our facilities as a result of a natural disaster or other unexpected event, they may result in customer disruption, physical damage to one or more key operating facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities, the temporary disruptions of information systems, and/or an adverse effect on our results of operations.- 16 - Changes in our tax rate or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and changes in tax laws. We and our subsidiaries are engaged in certain intercompany transactions. Although we believe that these transactions reflect arm’s length terms and that proper transfer pricing documentation is in place which should be respected for tax purposes, the transfer prices and conditions may be scrutinized by local tax authorities, which could result in additional taxes becoming due. Any of these factors may adversely affect our tax rate and decrease our profitability. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by foreign tax authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities.The Obama administration has announced proposals to tax profits of U.S. companies earned abroad. While it is not possible to predict whether any such proposals will be implemented and how they will ultimately impact us, they may adversely impact our results of operations.Risks relating to our operations outside the United States We obtain substantial benefits by operating in Israel, but these benefits may not continue. We have substantial operations in Israel. The low tax rates in Israel applicable to earnings of our operations in that country, compared to the rates in the United States, have the general effect of increasing our net earnings. Any significant increase in the Israeli tax rates could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. There can also be no assurance that in the future the Israeli government will offer new tax incentive programs applicable to us or that, if it does, such programs will provide the same level of benefits we have historically received prior to 2013, or that we will be eligible to benefit from them. We attempt to improve profitability by operating in countries in which labor costs are low, but the shift of operations to these regions may entail considerable expense. Our strategy is aimed at achieving significant production cost savings through the transfer and expansion of manufacturing operations to and in countries with lower production costs or other incentives, such as Costa Rica, India, Israel, the People’s Republic of China, and the Republic of China (Taiwan). During this process, we may experience under-utilization of certain plants and factories in higher-labor-cost regions and capacity constraints in plants and factories located in lower-labor-cost regions. Also, we may experience delays in the expected transition from a higher cost location to a lower cost one that result in greater than expected use of the higher cost facility. This transitional utilization may result initially in production inefficiencies and higher costs. These costs include those associated with compensation in connection with workforce reductions and plant closings in the higher-labor-cost regions, and start-up expenses, manufacturing and construction delays, and increased depreciation costs in connection with the initiation or expansion of production in lower-labor-cost regions. In addition, as we implement transfers of certain of our operations we may experience strikes or other types of labor unrest as a result of layoffs or termination of our employees in higher-labor-cost countries. In connection with the transfer of manufacturing operations to lower-labor-cost countries and the upgrading of existing facilities in high-labor-cost countries, we are also increasing the level of automation in our plants for the purpose of seeking to optimize our capital and labor resources in production, inventory management, quality control, and warehousing. Although we have substantial experience with automation in several of our plants in higher-labor-cost countries, there are risks in seeking to increase the level of automation in plants which previously did not use a significant amount of automation. These risks include the possibility of inefficiencies and higher operating costs in the transition from manual to automated operations, and if the transition extends longer than anticipated, we could suffer product yield inefficiencies, contributing to higher product costs and increasing the time it will take for us to achieve a return on our investment in the capital equipment involved in the automation process. Furthermore, any layoffs or termination of our employees as a result of increased automation may lead to strikes or other types of labor unrest. We are subject to the risks of political, economic, and military instability in countries outside the United States in which we operate. Some of our products are produced in Israel, India, China, and other countries which are particularly subject to risks of political, economic, and military instability. This instability could result in wars, riots, nationalization of industry, currency fluctuations, and labor unrest. These conditions could have an adverse impact on our ability to operate in these regions and, depending on the extent and severity of these conditions, could materially and adversely affect our overall financial condition and operating results.Our business has been in operation in Israel for over 40 years. We have never experienced any material interruption in our operations attributable to these factors, in spite of several Middle East crises, including wars. However, we might be adversely affected if events were to occur in the Middle East that interfered with our operations in Israel. - 17 - We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risks which may impact our results of operations. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries. Our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Israel, Japan, and India. We finance our operations in Europe, Canada and certain locations in Asia in local currencies. Our operations in Israel and certain locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, but these subsidiaries also have significant transactions in local currencies. Our exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated to the extent that the costs incurred and the revenues earned in a particular currency offset one another. Our exposure to foreign currency risk is more pronounced in situations where, for example, production labor costs are predominantly paid in local currencies while the sales revenue for those products is denominated in U.S. dollars. This situation in particular applies to our operations in Canada, India, Israel, China, and Taiwan. As of December 31, 2013, we did not have in place any arrangements to mitigate or hedge against exposures relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate. A change in the mix of the currencies in which we transact our business could have a material effect on results of operations. Furthermore, the timing of cash receipts and disbursements could have a material effect on our results of operations, particularly if there are significant changes in exchange rates in a short period of time. Risks Stemming from the Spin-off Background On October 27, 2009, Vishay Intertechnology announced its intention to spin-off its precision measurement and foil resistor businesses into an independent, publicly-traded company to be named Vishay Precision Group, Inc. On July 6, 2010, Vishay Intertechnology completed the spin-off through a tax-free stock dividend to Vishay Intertechnology’s stockholders.Prior to the spin-off, we entered into a series of agreements that, among other things, allocated assets, liabilities and obligations between Vishay Intertechnology and us and required cooperation between the parties to fulfill the terms of the spin-off and specified the conditions to the spin-off. For a more detailed description of these agreements see our information statement filed with the SEC on June 22, 2010 as Exhibit 99.1 to our registration statement on Form 10.We have a short operating history as an independent company upon which you can evaluate our performance and, accordingly, our prospects must be considered in light of the risks that any newly independent company encounters.Prior to July 6, 2010, we operated as part of Vishay Intertechnology. Accordingly, we have a short experience operating as an independent company and performing various corporate functions, including human resources, tax administration, legal, treasury administration, investor relations, insurance, information technology and telecommunications services, as well as the accounting for many items such as equity compensation, income taxes, derivatives, intangible assets and pensions. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties encountered by companies in the early stages of independent business operations, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We use the mark Vishay under license from Vishay Intertechnology, which could result in product and market confusion.We use the mark Vishay as part of our name and in connection with many of our products. Our use of the Vishay mark is governed by an agreement between us and Vishay Intertechnology, giving us a perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide license for the use of the mark. We believe that it is important that we continue the use of the Vishay name to a certain extent in order to benefit from the reputation of the Vishay brand, which was first used in connection with our foil resistors and strain gages when Vishay Intertechnology was founded 50 years ago.There are risks associated with our use of the Vishay mark, however, both for us and for Vishay Intertechnology. Because both we and Vishay Intertechnology use the Vishay mark, confusion could arise in the market regarding the products offered by the two companies, and there could be a misplaced perception of our continuing to be associated with Vishay Intertechnology. Also, any negative publicity associated with one of the two companies in the future could adversely affect the public image of the other. Finally, Vishay Intertechnology will have the right to terminate the license agreement in certain extreme circumstances if we are in material and repeated breach of the terms of the agreement, which would likely have an adverse effect on us and our business. - 18 - Risks Relating to Our Common Stock Our smaller size may affect the trading market for our shares. We are considered a “microcap” company and our trading volume is likely to fluctuate. Also, it is possible that there will be less market and institutional interest in our shares, and that we will not attract substantial coverage in the analyst community. As a result, the trading market for our shares may be less liquid, making it more difficult for investors to dispose of their shares at favorable prices, and investors may have less independent information and analysis available to them concerning our company. Our stock price could become more volatile and investments could lose value.The market price of our common stock and the number of shares traded each day has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly.

The holders of Class B convertible common stock have effective voting control of our company. We have two classes of common stock: common stock and Class B convertible common stock. The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held, while the holders of Class B convertible common stock are entitled to 10 votes for each share held. The ownership of Class B convertible common stock is highly concentrated, and holders of Class B convertible common stock effectively can cause the election of directors and approve other actions as stockholders without the approval of our other stockholders. Mrs. Ruta Zandman, the wife of the late founder of our technology, Dr. Felix Zandman, controls the voting of, solely or on a shared basis with Marc Zandman (our Chairman) and Ziv Shoshani (our Chief Executive Officer), approximately 76.8% of our Class B convertible common stock, representing 34.3% of the total voting power of our capital stock. Your percentage ownership of our common stock may be diluted in the future. Your percentage ownership of our common stock may be diluted in the future because of equity awards that we expect will be granted to our directors, officers and employees, as well as due to certain convertible or exchangeable debt instruments. The Vishay Precision Group, Inc. 2010 Stock Incentive Program provides for the grant of equity-based awards, including restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options, and other equity-based awards to our directors, officers and other employees, advisors and consultants. Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that you might consider favorable. Our bylaws contain provisions that could be considered “anti-takeover” provisions because they make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors. Under these by-law provisions: •stockholders may not change the size of the board of directors or, except in limited circumstances, fill vacancies on the board of directors; •stockholders may not call special meetings of stockholders; •stockholders must comply with advance notice provisions for nominating directors or presenting other proposals at stockholder meetings; and •our Board of Directors, may without stockholder approval, issue preferred shares and determine their rights and terms, including voting rights, or adopt a stockholder rights plan. These provisions could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be considered favorable by our stockholders.- 19 - Item 1B.
