ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS AND UNCERTAINTIES Risks related to Midways business Readers should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before deciding whether to invest in our common shares. Our failure to successfully address the risks and uncertainties described below would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations, and the trading price of our common shares may 13 decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment. We cannot assure you that we will successfully address these risks or other unknown risks that may affect our business. Estimates of mineralized material are forward-looking statements inherently subject to error. Unforeseen events and uncontrollable factors can have a significant impact on mineralized material estimates and actual results may differ from estimates. We have a history of losses and will require additional financing to fund exploration and, if warranted, development. The Companys consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008 have been prepared on the basis that the Company is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of its assets and the settlement of its liabilities in the normal course of operations. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is uncertain and dependent upon obtaining the financing necessary to meet its financial commitments and to complete the development of its properties and/or realizing proceeds from the sale of one or more of the properties. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations, confirmation of the Companys interests in the underlying properties, and the attainment of profitable operations. As at December 31, 2008, the Company had cash of $2,416,438, working capi tal of $1,156,536, and has accumulated losses of $53,235,472 since inception. Management anticipates that the minimum cash requirements to fund its proposed exploration program and continued operations will exceed the amount of cash on hand at December 31, 2008. Accordingly, the Company does not have sufficient funds to meet planned expenditures over the next twelve months, and will need to seek additional debt or equity financing to meet its planned expenditures. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to raise sufficient cash to fund its future exploration programs and operational expenditures. The Company has 12,500,000 share purchase warrants outstanding with an exercise price of $0.28 that expire on May 12, 2009. The market price at December 31, 2008 was $0.59 and there is a reasonable expectation that these warrants will be exercised to raise $3,500,000 of which $1,000,000 will be dedicated to repay the balance of the promissory note. By the first week of May the Company will assess the situation and should the share pu rchase warrants not be exercised the Company will further reduce its staffing and curtail its budget to the available remaining cash until additional funds can be raised through the sale of equity. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Our auditors report on our 2008 consolidated financial statements include an additional explanatory paragraph that states that our recurring losses from operation raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have not commenced commercial production on any of our mineral properties. We have no revenues from operations and anticipate we will have no operating revenues until we place one or more of our properties into production. All of our properties are in the exploration stage, which means that we have known mineral reserves on our properties. We currently do not have sufficient funds to fully complete exploration and development work on any of our properties, which means that we will be required to raise additional capital, enter into joint venture relationships or find alternative means to finance placing one or more of our properties into commercial production, if warranted. We anticipate raising additional funds in 2009 to continue our exploration at recent levels. . If the Company fails to raise additional funds it will curtail its activities and may risk being unable to maintain its interests in its mineral properties. Failure to obtain sufficient financing may result in the delay or indefinite postponement of exploration, and, development or production on one or more of our properties and any properties we may acquire in the future or even a loss of property interests. This includes our leases over claims covering the principal deposits on our properties, which may expire unless we expend minimum levels of expenditures over the terms of such leases. We cannot be certain that additional capital or other types of financing will be available if needed or that, if available, the terms of such financing will be favorable or acceptable to us. Future financings may cause dilution to our shareholders. We have no history of producing metals from our mineral properties. 14 We have no history of producing metals from any of our properties. Our properties are all exploration stage properties in various stages of exploration. Our Midway, Spring Valley, Pan and Golden Eagle properties are exploratory stage exploration projects with identified gold mineralization, and our Thunder Mountain, Roberts Creek, Burnt Canyon and Gold Rock projects are each early stage exploration projects. Advancing properties from exploration into the development stage requires significant capital and time and successful commercial production from a property, if any, will be subject to completing feasibility studies, permitting and construction of the mine, processing plants, roads, and other related works and infrastructure. As a result, we are subject to all of the risks associated with developing and establishing new mining operations and business enterprises including: · completion of feasibility studies to verify reserves and commercial viability, including the ability to find sufficient gold reserves to support a commercial mining operation; · the timing and cost, which can be considerable, of further exploration, preparing feasibility studies, permitting and construction of infrastructure, mining and processing facilities; · the availability and costs of drill equipment, exploration personnel, skilled labor and mining and processing equipment, if required; · the availability and cost of appropriate smelting and/or refining arrangements, if required; · compliance with environmental and other governmental approval and permit requirements; · the availability of funds to finance exploration, development and construction activities, as warranted; · potential opposition from non-governmental organizations, environmental groups, local groups or local inhabitants which may delay or prevent development activities; and · potential increases in exploration, construction and operating costs due to changes in the cost of fuel, power, materials and supplies. The costs, timing and complexities of exploration, development and construction activities may be increased by the location of our properties and demand by other mineral exploration and mining companies. It is common in exploration programs to experience unexpected problems and delays during drill programs and, if warranted, development, construction and mine start-up. Accordingly, our activities may not result in profitable mining operations and we may not succeed in establish mining operations or profitably producing metals at any of our properties. Increased costs could affect our financial condition. We anticipate that costs at our projects that we may explore or develop, will frequently be subject to variation from one year to the next due to a number of factors, such as changing ore grade, metallurgy and revisions to mine plans, if any, in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body. In addition, costs are affected by the price of commodities such as fuel, rubber and electricity. Such commodities are at times subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable. A material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on our profitability. A shortage of equipment and supplies could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. We are dependent on various supplies and equipment to carry out our mining exploration and, if warranted, development operations. The shortage of such supplies, equipment and parts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to carry out our operations and therefore limit or increase the cost of production. Mining and resource exploration is inherently dangerous and subject to conditions or events beyond our control, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and plans. Mining and mineral exploration involves various types of risks and hazards, including: § environmental hazards; § power outages; § metallurgical and other processing problems; § unusual or unexpected geological formations; § flooding, fire, explosions, cave-ins, landslides and rock-bursts; 15 § inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment, or labor; § metals losses; and § periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions. These risks could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties, production facilities or other properties, personal injury, environmental damage, delays in mining, increased production costs, monetary losses and possible legal liability. We may not be able to obtain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums. Insurance against certain environmental risks, including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of the disposal of waste products occurring from production, is not generally available to us or to other companies within the mining industry. We may suffer a material adverse effect on our business if we incur losses related to any significant events that are not covered by our insurance policies. The figures for our resources are estimates based on interpretation and assumptions and may yield less mineral production under actual conditions than is currently estimated. Unless otherwise indicated, mineralization figures presented in this Annual Report and in our filings with securities regulatory authorities, press releases and other public statements that may be made from time to time are based upon estimates made by independent geologists and our internal geologists. When making determinations about whether to advance any of our projects to development, we must rely upon such estimated calculations as to the mineral reserves and grades of mineralization on our properties. Until ore is actually mined and processed, mineral reserves and grades of mineralization must be considered as estimates only. Estimates can be imprecise and depend upon geological interpretation and statistical inferences drawn from drilling and sampling analysis, which may prove to be unreliable. We cannot assure you that: § these estimates will be accurate; § resource or other mineralization estimates will be accurate; or § this mineralization can be mined or processed profitably. Any material changes in mineral resource estimates and grades of mineralization will affect the economic viability of placing a property into production and a propertys return on capital. Because we have not completed feasibility studies on any of our properties and have not commenced actual production, mineralization estimates, including resource estimates, for our properties may require adjustments or downward revisions. In addition, the grade of ore ultimately mined, if any, may differ from that indicated by our feasibility studies and drill results. Minerals recovered in small scale tests may not be duplicated in large scale tests under on-site conditions or in production scale. The resource estimates contained in this report have been determined and valued based on assumed future prices, cut-off grades and operating costs that may prove to be inaccurate. Extended declines in market prices for gold, silver or other commodities may render portions of our mineralization and resource estimates uneconomic and result in reduced reported mineralization or adversely affect the commercial viability determinations we reach. Any material reductions in estimates of mineralization, or of our ability to extract this mineralization, could have a material adverse effect on our share price and the value of our properties. There are differences in U.S. and Canadian practices for reporting reserves and resources. Our reserve and resource estimates are not directly comparable to those made in filings subject to SEC reporting and disclosure requirements, as we generally report reserves and resources in accordance with Canadian practices. These practices are different from the practices used to report reserve and resource estimates in reports and other materials filed with the SEC. It is Canadian practice to report measured, indicated and inferred resources, which are generally not permitted in disclosure filed with the SEC by United States issuers. In the United States, mineralization may not be classified as a reserve unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. United States investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated resources will ever be converted into reserves. 16 Further, inferred resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. Disclosure of contained ounces is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC only permits issuers to report resources as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. Accordingly, information concerning descriptions of mineralization, reserves and resources contained in this report, or in the documents incorporated herein by reference, may not be comparable to information made public by other United States companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC. Our exploration activities on our properties may not be commercially successful, which could lead us to abandon our plans to develop the property and our investments in exploration. Our long-term success depends on our ability to identify mineral deposits on our existing properties and other properties we may acquire, if any, that we can then develop into commercially viable mining operations. Mineral exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and is frequently nonproductive. These risks include unusual or unexpected geologic formations, and the inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment or labor. The success of gold, silver and other commodity exploration is determined in part by the following factors: § the identification of potential mineralization based on surficial analysis; § availability of government-granted exploration permits; § the quality of our management and our geological and technical expertise; and § the capital available for exploration and development work. Substantial expenditures are required to establish proven and probable reserves through drilling and analysis, to develop metallurgical processes to extract metal, and to develop the mining and processing facilities and infrastructure at any site chosen for mining. Whether a mineral deposit will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors, which include, without limitation, the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; metal prices, which fluctuate widely; and government regulations, including, without limitation, regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection. We may invest significant capital and resources in exploration activities and abandon such investments if we are unable to identify commercially exploitable mineral reserves. The decision to abandon a project may have an adverse effect on the market value of our securi ties and the ability to raise future financing. We may encounter archaeological issues and claims relating to our Midway property, which may delay our ability to conduct further exploration or developmental activities or could affect our ability to place the property into commercial production, if warranted Our exploration and development activities may be delayed due to the designation of a portion of the Midway property as a site of archaeological significance. A cultural inventory of the Midway project has identified a prehistoric site associated with a dune field in the Ralston Valley, adjacent to the Midway property. An intensive cultural and geomorphological inspection was conducted of the project area to determine archaeologically significant areas. Techniques and methods used during the inventory were sufficient to identify most cultural resources and features in the area. Should sufficient mineral resources be identified on the Midway property, a complete archaeological inventory and evaluation would be required, including the possibility of curating the site. Our Midway property is in close proximity to a municipal water supply, which may delay our ability to conduct further exploration or developmental activities or could affect our ability to place the property into commercial production, if warranted The Midway property lies within a basin from which the town of Tonopah obtains its municipal water supply. To date, Midway's exploration activities have not been restricted due to the proximity of the activities to this basin. As Midway's exploration and development activities expand, there is an increased risk that the activities may interfere with the water supply. As part of the mining development work on the Midway property, Midway completed a hydrologic review of the basin and will establish a strategy for preventing exploration and development activities from interfering with the water supply. Any damage to, or contamination of, the water supply caused by Midway's activities could result in Midway incurring significant liability. We cannot predict the magnitude of such liability or 17 the impact of such liability on our business, prospects or financial condition. Midway has applied for water right permits in the Ralston Basin, which is currently under protest by the town of Tonopah. Midway is currently negotiating with the town about any future pumping of water in the basin. Midway is currently reviewing and negotiating dewatering options with the town of Tonopah that would be agreeable and beneficial for both parties. If Midway were not able to secure dewatering rights for the Midway project, the project may be restricted and could affect our ability to place the property into commercial production, if warranted. Changes in the market price of gold, silver and other metals, which in the past has fluctuated widely, will affect the profitability of our operations and financial condition. Our profitability and long-term viability depend, in large part, upon the market price of gold and other metals and minerals produced from our mineral properties. The market price of gold and other metals is volatile and is impacted by numerous factors beyond our control, including: § expectations with respect to the rate of inflation; § the relative strength of the U.S. dollar and certain other currencies; § interest rates; § global or regional political or economic conditions; § supply and demand for jewelry and industrial products containing metals; and § sales by central banks and other holders, speculators and producers of gold and other metals in response to any of the above factors. We cannot predict the effect of these factors on metal prices. Gold and silver prices have fluctuated during the last several years. The price of gold (London Fix) has ranged from US$712.50 to US$1,011.25 per ounce during the period from January 1 through December 31, 2008, closing at US$869.75 on December 30, 2008. The price of gold (London Fix) has ranged from $608 to $842 per ounce during the period from January 1 through December 31, 2007, closing at $836 on December 31, 2007. During 2006 gold had a high of $725 and a low of $525 to end the year at $632 per ounce on December 31, 2006. A decrease in the market price of gold and other metals could affect the commercial viability of our properties and our anticipated development of such properties in the future. Lower gold prices could also adversely affect our ability to finance exploration and development of our properties. We do not maintain insurance with respect to certain high-risk activities, which exposes us to significant risk of loss Mining operations generally involve a high degree of risk. Hazards such as unusual or unexpected formations or other conditions are often encountered. Midway may become subject to liability for pollution, cave-ins or hazards against which it cannot insure or against which it cannot maintain insurance at commercially reasonable premiums. Any significant claim would have a material adverse effect on Midway's financial position and prospects. Midway is not currently covered by any form of environmental liability insurance, or political risk insurance, since insurance against such risks (including liability for pollution) is prohibitively expensive. Midway may have to suspend operations or take cost interim compliance measures if Midway is unable to fully fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem, if it occurs. We may not be able to obtain all required permits and licenses to place any of our properties into production Our current and future operations, including development activities and commencement of production, if warranted, require permits from governmental authorities and such operations are and will be governed by laws and regulations governing prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection, permission to develop a decline beneath a state highway, mine safety and other matters. Companies engaged in property exploration and the development or operation of mines and related facilities generally experience increased costs, and delays in production and other schedules as a result of the need to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permits. We cannot predict if all permits which we may require for continued exploration, development or construction of mining facilities and conduct of mining operations will be obtainable on reasonable terms or that suc h laws and regulations. Costs related 18 to applying for and obtaining permits and licenses may be prohibitive and could delay our planned exploration and development activities. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment, or remedial actions. Parties engaged in mining operations may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of the mining activities and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations. Amendments to current laws, regulations and permits governing operations and activities of mining companies, or more stringent implementation thereof, could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cause increases in capital expenditures or production costs or reduction in levels of production at producing properties or require abandonment or delays in development of new mining properties. We are subject to significant governmental regulations, which affect our operations and costs of conducting our business Our current and future operations are and will be governed by laws and regulations, including: § laws and regulations governing mineral concession acquisition, prospecting, development, mining and production; § laws and regulations related to exports, taxes and fees; § labor standards and regulations related to occupational health and mine safety; § environmental standards and regulations related to waste disposal, toxic substances, land use and environmental protection; and § other matters. Companies engaged in exploration activities often experience increased costs and delays in production and other schedules as a result of the need to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permits. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permits may result in enforcement actions, including the forfeiture of claims, orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities requiring operations to cease or be curtailed, and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or costly remedial actions. We may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of its mineral exploration activities and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of such laws, regulations and permits. Existing and possible future laws, regulations and permits governing operations and activities of exploration companies, or more stringent implementation, could have a material adverse impact on our business and cause increases in capital expenditures or require abandonment or delays in exploration. Our activities are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may increase our costs of doing business and restrict our operations. All phases of our operations are subject to environmental regulation in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. These laws address emissions into the air, discharges into water, management of waste, management of hazardous substances, protection of natural resources, antiquities and endangered species and reclamation of lands disturbed by mining operations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations and future changes in these laws and regulations may require significant capital outlays and may cause material changes or delays in our operations and future activities. It is possible that future changes in these laws or regulations could have a significant adverse impact on our properties or some portion of our business, causing us to re-evaluate those activities at that time. Land reclamation requirements for our properties may be burdensome and expensive. Although variable depending on location and the governing authority, land reclamation requirements are generally imposed on mineral exploration companies (as well as companies with mining operations) in order to minimize long 19 term effects of land disturbance. Reclamation may include requirements to: § control dispersion of potentially deleterious effluents; and § reasonably re-establish pre-disturbance land forms and vegetation. In order to carry out reclamation obligations imposed on us in connection with our potential development activities, we must allocate financial resources that might otherwise be spent on further exploration and development programs. We plan to set up a provision for our reclamation obligations on our properties, as appropriate, but this provision may not be adequate. If we are required to carry out unanticipated reclamation work, our financial position could be adversely affected. Increased competition could adversely affect our ability to attract necessary capital funding or acquire suitable producing properties or prospects for mineral exploration in the future. The mining industry is intensely competitive. Significant competition exists for the acquisition of properties producing or capable of producing, gold or other metals. We may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring additional mining properties because we must compete with other individuals and companies, many of which have greater financial resources, operational experience and technical capabilities than us. We may also encounter increasing competition from other mining companies in our efforts to hire experienced mining professionals. Competition for exploration resources at all levels is currently very intense, particularly affecting the availability of manpower, drill rigs, mining equipment and production equipment. Increased competition could adversely affect our ability to attract necessary capital funding or acquire suitable producing properties or prospects for mineral exploration in the future. We compete with larger, better capitalized competitors in the mining industry. The mining industry is competitive in all of its phases, including financing, technical resources, personnel and property acquisition. It requires significant capital, technical resources, personnel and operational experience to effectively compete in the mining industry. Because of the high costs associated with exploration, the expertise required to analyze a projects potential and the capital required to develop a mine, larger companies with significant resources may have a competitive advantage over us. We face strong competition from other mining companies, some with greater financial resources, operational experience and technical capabilities than us. As a result of this competition, we may be unable to maintain or acquire financing, personnel, technical resources or attractive mining properties on terms we consider acceptable or at all. Midway may enter into joint venture and option agreements with other parties, which could decrease our ownership interest and control over such properties We may, in the future, be unable to meet its share of costs incurred under option or joint venture agreements to which it is a party and we may have our interest in the properties subject to such agreements reduced or terminated as a result. Furthermore, if other parties to such agreements do not meet their share of such costs, we may be unable to finance the cost required to complete recommended programs. In many joint ventures or option arrangements, we would give up control over decisions to commence work and the timing of such work, if any. Our directors and officers may have conflicts of interest as a result of their relationships with other companies. Certain or our officers and directors are also directors, officers or shareholders of other companies that are similarly engaged in the business of acquiring, developing and exploiting natural resource properties. For example, Alan Branham, our President, CEO and Director, also serves as a director for Rocky Mountain Resources Corp.; Doris Meyer, our CFO and Corporate Secretary, also serves as Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary of AuEx Ventures Inc., Crescent Resources Corp., Kalimantan Gold Corporation Limited, Miranda Gold Corp., Potash North Resource Corporation, Regency Gold Corp., Rolling Rock Resources Corporation, Sunridge Gold Corp. and Tournigan Energy Ltd. and in addition is also a director of Kalimantan Gold Corporation Limited, Regency Gold Corp. and Sunridge Gold Corp., George Hawes, also serves as a director for Proginet Corporation and Rocky 20 Mountain Resources Corp. Consequently, there is a possibility that our directors and/or officers may be in a position of conflict in the future. We may experience difficulty attracting and retaining qualified management to meet the needs of our anticipated growth, and the failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition We are dependent on a relatively small number of key employees, including Alan Branham, our President and CEO and Doris Meyer, our CFO. The loss of Mr. Branham or Ms. Meyer could have an adverse effect on Midway. Midway does not have any key person insurance with respect to any of its key employees. Our results of operations could be affected by currency fluctuations We arrange our equity funding and pay most of our administrative costs in Canadian dollars. However our properties are all located in the United States and most costs associated with these properties are paid in U.S. dollars. There can be significant swings in the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canadian dollar. There are no plans at this time to hedge against any exchange fluctuations in currencies. Title to our properties may be subject to other claims, which could affect our property rights and claims. There are risks that title to our properties may be challenged or impugned. Most of our properties are located in Nevada and may be subject to prior unrecorded agreements or transfers or native land claims and title may be affected by undetected defects. There may be valid challenges to the title of our properties which, if successful, could impair development and/or operations. This is particularly the case in respect of those portions of the our properties in which we hold our interest solely through a lease with the claim holders, as such interest is substantially based on contract and has been subject to a number of assignments (as opposed to a direct interest in the property). Several of the mineral rights to our properties consist of "unpatented" mining claims created and maintained in accordance with the U.S. General Mining Law. Unpatented mining claims are unique property interests, and are generally considered to be subject to greater title risk than other real property interests because the validity of unpatented mining claims is often uncertain. This uncertainty arises, in part, out of the complex federal and state laws and regulations under the U.S. General Mining Law, including the requirement of a proper physical discovery of valuable minerals within the boundaries of each claim and proper compliance with physical staking requirements. Also, unpatented mining claims are always subject to possible challenges by third parties or validity contests by the federal government. The validity of an unpatented mining or millsite claim, in terms of both its location and its maintenance, is dependent on strict compliance with a complex body of U.S. federal and state statutory and decisional law. In addition, there are few public records that definitively determine the issues of validity and ownership of unpatented mining claims. Should the Federal government impose a royalty or additional tax burdens on the properties that lie within public lands, the resulting mining operations could be seriously impacted, depending upon the type and amount of the burden. Midway may be a passive foreign investment company for United States federal income tax purposes. Midway may be a passive foreign investment company, or "PFIC," for United States Federal income tax purposes. If so, Midway will continue to be so until it generates sufficient revenue from its mineral exploration and extraction activities. However, the actual determination of PFIC status is fundamentally factual in nature and cannot be made until the close of the applicable taxable year. If Midway is a PFIC, any gain recognized by a U.S. holder of common shares of Midway upon a sale or other disposition of common shares of Midway may be ordinary (rather than capital), and any resulting United States federal income tax may be increased by an interest charge. Rules similar to those applicable to dispositions generally will apply to certain excess distributions in respect of a common share of Midway. A United States person generally may take steps to avoid these unfavourable United States federal income tax consequences. Recent market events and general economic conditions 21 The recent unprecedented events in global financial markets have had a profound impact on the global economy. Many industries, including the gold mining industry, are impacted by these market conditions. Notwithstanding various actions by the U.S. and foreign governments, concerns about the general condition of the capital markets, financial instruments, banks, investment banks, insurers and other financial institutions could cause the broader credit markets to further deteriorate and stock markets to decline substantially. In addition, general economic indicators have deteriorated, including declining consumer sentiment, increased unemployment and declining economic growth and uncertainty about corporate earnings. These unprecedented disruptions in the current credit and financial markets have had a significant material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and have limited access to capital and credit for many companies. These disruptions could, among other things, make it more difficult for us to obtain, or increase its cost of obtaining, capital and financing for its operations. A continued or worsened slowdown in the financial markets or other economic conditions, including but not limited to, consumer spending, employment rates, business conditions, inflation, fuel and energy costs, consumer debt levels, lack of available credit, the state of the financial markets, interest rates, and tax rates may adversely affect our growth and profitability. Specifically: · The global credit/liquidity crisis could impact the cost and availability of financing and our overall liquidity; · the volatility of gold prices may impact our revenues, profits and cash flow; · volatile energy prices, commodity and consumables prices and currency exchange rates impact potential production costs; and · the devaluation and volatility of global stock markets impacts the valuation of our equity securities These factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Midways Securities We do not intend to pay cash dividends. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on Midways common shares. We currently intend to retain future earnings to finance the operation, development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends on Midways common shares in the foreseeable future. Payment of future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of Midways board of directors and will depend on Midways financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors that our board of directors considers relevant. Accordingly, investors will only see a return on their investment if the value of Midways securities appreciates. The market for our common shares has been volatile in the past, and may be subject to fluctuations in the future. The market price of Midways common shares has ranged from a high of $3.22 and a low of $0.18 during the twelve month period ended March 16, 2009. We cannot assure you that the market price of our common shares will not significantly fluctuate from its current level. The market price of our common shares may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts, or other events or factors. In addition, the financial markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations for a number of reasons, including the failure of the operating results of certain companies to meet market expectations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many exploration companies that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market fluctuations, or any industry-specific market fluctuations, may adversely affec t the market price of our common shares. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities, class action securities litigation has been instituted against such a company. Such litigation, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources, which would have a 22 material adverse affect on our business, operating results and financial condition. If we raise additional funding through equity financings, then our current shareholders will suffer dilution. We believe the only realistic source of future funds presently available to us is through the sale of equity capital. Any sale of equity capital will result in dilution to existing shareholders. The only other alternative for the financing of further exploration would be the offering by us of an interest in our properties to be earned by another party or parties carrying out further exploration thereof. We are a foreign corporation and have officers and directors resident outside the United States, which could make it difficult for you to effect service of process or enforce a judgment by a U.S. court. We are incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada and some of our directors and officers are residents in jurisdictions outside the United States. Consequently, it may be difficult for United States investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or upon certain of our directors or officers who are not residents of the United States, or to realize in the United States upon judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities under the laws of the United States. A judgment of a U.S. court predicated solely upon such civil liabilities would probably be enforceable in Canada by a Canadian court if the U.S. court in which the judgment was obtained had jurisdiction, as determined by the Canadian court, in the matter.
