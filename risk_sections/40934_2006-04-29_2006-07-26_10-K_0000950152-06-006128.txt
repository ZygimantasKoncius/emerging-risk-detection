Item 1A. Risk Factors The Corporation has only one director and one officer and the loss of either of their services could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation. There are risks associated with the estimates of the net assets of the Corporation in liquidation, the amount and timing of the payment of additional liquidating distributions and the Corporation's operating costs through final dissolution, including the additional wind-up costs, which will vary with the length of time it operates.

The Corporation is subject to a number of other significant risks. These include, without limitation, possible contingent liabilities and post-closing indemnification and other obligations arising from the sale of the Corporation's operating businesses and other assets; the risk that federal, state or local taxing authorities will audit the income, sales, use and/or other tax returns filed by the Corporation resulting in additional taxes being assessed against the Corporation; the risk that the Corporation may not be able to realize its current estimate of the net value of its assets; the risk that the Corporation may have underestimated the settlement expense of its obligations and liabilities, including without limitation, accrued compensation and tax liabilities; risks associated with the liquidation and dissolution of the Corporation, including without limitation, settlement of the Corporation's liabilities and obligations, costs, including professional fees, incurred in connection with carrying out the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution and additional run-out expenses and contingent liabilities associated with the winding up and dissolution of the Corporation.
