ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) ‚óè Our effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors that could have a material impact on our financial results and could increase the volatility of those results. Due to the global nature of our business, we are subject to national and local taxation in many different countries and we file a significant number of tax returns that are subject to audit by the tax authorities in those countries. Tax audits are often complex and may require several years to resolve. There is no assurance that all or any of these tax audits will be resolved in our favor. Our financial results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the periods when the tax assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitations on the tax assessments expire. The outcome of these tax assessments could have a material positive or negative impact on our earnings and increase the volatility of our earnings relative to prior periods. ITEM 1B.
