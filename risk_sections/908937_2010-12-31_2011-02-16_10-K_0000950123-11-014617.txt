ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the information under the caption Competition, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. We face substantial competition and that competition is likely to increase over time. We face substantial competition in the audio entertainment business. Our ability to retain and attract subscribers depends on our success in creating and providing popular or unique music, entertainment, news and sports programming. Our subscribers can obtain certain similar content for free through terrestrial radio stations. In addition, audio entertainment delivered via the Internet, including through mobile devices, is becoming increasingly competitive with our services. A number of automakers have introduced, or will shortly introduce, factory-installed radios capable of accessing Internet-delivered audio entertainment. A summary of various services that compete with us is contained in the section entitled Business  Competition. Competition could result in lower subscription, advertising or other revenue or increase our marketing, promotion or other expenses and, consequently, lower our earnings and free cash flow. We cannot assure you we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our business depends in large part upon automakers and demand for our service is difficult to predict. Most of our new subscription growth has come from purchasers and lessees of new and used automobiles; as a result, the sale and lease of vehicles with satellite radios is an important source of subscribers for our satellite radio service. We have agreements with every major automaker to include satellite radios in new vehicles, although these agreements do not require automakers to install specific or minimum quantities of radios in any given period. Automotive production and sales are dependent on many factors, including the availability of consumer credit, general economic conditions, consumer confidence and fuel costs. To the extent vehicle sales by automakers decline, or the penetration of factory-installed satellite radios in those vehicles is reduced, subscriber growth for our satellite radio services will be adversely impacted if there is no offsetting growth in vehicle sales or increased penetration by other automakers. We cannot estimate with any certainty whether demand for our services will be sufficient for us to continue to increase the number of subscribers to our services. General economic conditions can affect our business. The purchase of a satellite radio subscription is discretionary, and our business and our financial condition can be affected by adverse general economic conditions. For example, the dramatic slowdown in auto sales negatively impacted our subscriber growth in 2008 and 2009. 13 Failure of our satellites would significantly damage our business and potential satellite losses may not be covered by insurance. The useful lives of our satellites will vary and depend on a number of factors, including:  degradation and durability of solar panels;  quality of construction;  random failure of satellite components, which could result in significant damage to or loss of a satellite;  amount of fuel the satellites consume; and  damage or destruction by electrostatic storms or collisions with other objects in space. Three of the SIRIUS in-orbit satellites have experienced circuit failures on their solar arrays. The circuit failures these satellites have experienced do not affect current operations. Additional circuit failures on the first three SIRIUS satellites could reduce the estimated useful lives of those satellites. We have entered into an agreement with Space Systems/Loral to design and construct a new satellite for the SIRIUS system that is expected to be launched in the fourth quarter of 2011. Satellite launches have significant risks, including launch failure, damage or destruction of the satellite during launch and failure to achieve a proper orbit or operate as planned. Our agreement with Space Systems/Loral does not protect us against the risks inherent in a satellite launch or in-orbit operations. Our XM-1 and XM-2 satellites have experienced progressive degradation problems common to early Boeing 702 class satellites and now serve as in-orbit spares. We estimate that the XM-3 and XM-4 satellites will meet their 15-year predicted useful lives, and that the XM-1 and XM-2 satellites useful lives will end in 2013. Our XM-5 satellite serves as an in-orbit spare for both of our services. In the event of a failure of XM-3, XM-4 or any of the SIRIUS satellites, service would be maintained through XM-5. In addition, our networks of terrestrial repeaters each communicates with one third-party satellite. If the satellites communicating with the applicable repeater network fail unexpectedly, the services would be disrupted for several hours or longer. In the ordinary course of operation, satellites experience failures of component parts and operational and performance anomalies. Components on our in-orbit satellites have failed and from time to time we have experienced anomalies in the operation and performance of these satellites. These failures and anomalies are expected to continue in the ordinary course, and we cannot predict if any of these future events will have a material adverse effect on our operations or the useful life of our existing in-orbit satellites. We maintain in-orbit insurance policies covering only our XM-4, XM-5 and FM-5 satellites. In addition, we may not renew this in-orbit insurance when the policies expire. Any insurance proceeds will not fully cover our losses in the event of a satellite failure or significant degradation. For example, the policies covering the insured satellites do not cover the full cost of constructing, launching and insuring new satellites, nor will they cover, and we do not have protection against, business interruption, loss of business or similar losses. Our insurance contains customary exclusions, material change and other conditions that could limit recovery under those policies. Further, any insurance proceeds may not be received on a timely basis in order to launch a spare satellite or construct and launch a replacement satellite or take other remedial measures. In addition, the policies are subject to limitations involving uninsured losses, large satellite performance deductibles and policy limits. Higher than expected costs of attracting new subscribers or higher subscriber turnover (i.e., churn) could each adversely affect our financial performance and operating results. We are spending substantial funds on advertising and marketing and in transactions with automakers, retailers and others to obtain and attract subscribers. If the costs of attracting new subscribers are greater than expected, our financial performance and operating results could be adversely affected. 14 We are experiencing, and expect to continue to experience, subscriber turnover (i.e., churn). If we are unable to retain current subscribers, or the costs of retaining subscribers are higher than expected, our financial performance and operating results could be adversely affected. We cannot predict how successful we will be at retaining customers who purchase or lease vehicles that include a subscription to our satellite radio service. During 2010, we converted approximately 46.2% of the customers who received a promotional subscription as part of the purchase or lease of a new vehicle to a self-paying subscription. Over the same period, we have experienced churn of our self-pay subscribers of approximately 1.9% per month. We cannot predict the amount of churn we will experience over the longer term. Our inability to retain our existing self-pay subscribers, customers who either purchase or lease vehicles with our service beyond the promotional period, or customers who purchase or lease a vehicle that includes a prepaid subscription to our service could adversely affect our financial performance and results of operations. Our ability to retain subscribers and maintain our average monthly revenue per subscriber is uncertain. During 2010, we added 1,418,206 net subscribers to our satellite radio service. Our ability to retain our subscribers, or increase the number of subscribers to our service, in any given period is subject to many factors, including:  the health of the economy;  the production and sale of new vehicles in the United States;  our ability to convince owners and lessees of new and used vehicles that include satellite radios to purchase subscriptions to our service;  the effectiveness of our marketing programs;  the entertainment value of our programming; and  actions by our competitors, such as terrestrial radio and other audio entertainment providers. Average monthly revenue per subscriber, which we refer to as ARPU, is one of the key metrics we use to evaluate our business and the trends in our business. Over the past several years, we have focused substantial attention and efforts on maintaining and increasing ARPU. Our ability to maintain ARPU at present levels is uncertain and depends upon various factors, including:  the value consumers perceive in our service;  our ability to add and retain compelling programming;  the increasing competition we experience from terrestrial radio and other providers of audio entertainment; and  pricing and other offers we may make to attract new subscribers and retain existing subscribers. Our business only recently began to generate free cash flow. If we are unable to consistently generate sufficient revenues to be profitable, the value of our common stock could decline, and without sufficient cash flow we may not be able to make the required payments on our indebtedness and could ultimately default on our commitments. Royalties for music rights may increase. We must maintain music programming royalty arrangements with, and pay license fees to, BMI, ASCAP and SESAC. These organizations negotiate with copyright users, collect royalties and distribute them to songwriters and music publishers. We have agreements with ASCAP and SESAC through December 2011. We do not have a definitive agreement with BMI and continue to operate under an interim agreement. There can be no assurance that the royalties we pay to ASCAP, SESAC and BMI will not increase. Under the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, we pay royalties to copyright owners of sound recordings. Those royalty rates may be established through negotiation or, if negotiation is unsuccessful, by the CRB. Owners of copyrights in sound recordings have 15 created SoundExchange, a collective organization, to collect and distribute royalties. SoundExchange is exempt by statute from US antitrust laws and exercises significant market power in the licensing of sound recordings. A rate setting proceeding commenced in January 2011, and, if negotiations with SoundExchange prove unsuccessful, new royalty rates will be determined by the CRB, will be effective for the five-year period beginning in 2013, and may be higher than current royalty rates. Failure to comply with FCC requirements could damage our business. We hold FCC licenses and authorizations to operate commercial satellite radio services in the United States, including authorizations for satellites and terrestrial repeaters, and related authorizations. The FCC generally grants licenses and authorizations for a fixed term. Although we expect our licenses and authorizations to be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Any assignment or transfer of control of any of our FCC licenses or authorizations must be approved in advance by the FCC. The operation of our satellite radio systems is subject to significant regulation by the FCC under authority granted through the Communications Act and related federal law. We are required, among other things, to operate only within specified frequencies; to meet certain conditions regarding the interoperability of our satellite radios with those of other licensed satellite radio systems; to coordinate our satellite radio services with radio systems operating in the same range of frequencies in neighboring countries; and to coordinate our communications links to our satellites with other systems that operate in the same frequency band. Non-compliance by us with these requirements or other conditions or with other applicable FCC rules and regulations could result in fines, additional license conditions, license revocation or other detrimental FCC actions. There is no guarantee that Congress will not modify the statutory framework governing our services, or that the FCC will not modify its rules and regulations in a manner that would have a material impact on our operations. The terms of our licenses, the order of the FCC approving the Merger, and the consent decrees we entered into with the FCC require us to meet certain conditions. Non-compliance with these conditions could result in fines, additional license conditions, license revocation or other detrimental FCC actions. The unfavorable outcome of pending or future litigation could have a material adverse effect. We are parties to several legal proceedings arising out of various aspects of our business, including class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal antitrust laws and state consumer protection statutes. We are defending all claims against us. The outcome of these proceedings may not be favorable, and an unfavorable outcome may have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results. Rapid technological and industry changes could adversely impact our services. The audio entertainment industry is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product innovations, changes in customer requirements and expectations, and evolving standards. If we are unable to keep pace with these changes, our business may be unsuccessful. Products using new technologies, or emerging industry standards, could make our technologies less competitive in the marketplace. Failure of other third parties to perform could adversely affect our business. Our business depends, in part, on various other third parties, including:  manufacturers that build and distribute satellite radios;  companies that manufacture and sell integrated circuits for satellite radios;  programming providers and on-air talent;  retailers that market and sell satellite radios and promote subscriptions to our services; and  vendors that have designed or built, and vendors that support or operate, important elements of our systems, such as our satellites and customer service facilities. 16 If one or more of these third parties do not perform in a sufficient or timely manner, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, a number of third parties on which we depend have experienced, and may in the future experience, financial difficulties or file for bankruptcy protection. Such third parties may not be able to perform their obligations to us in a timely manner, if at all, as a result of their financial condition or may be relieved of their obligations to us as part of seeking bankruptcy protection. We design, establish specifications, source or specify parts and components, and manage various aspects of the logistics and production of radios. As a result of these activities, we may be exposed to liabilities associated with the design, manufacture and distribution of radios that the providers of an entertainment service would not customarily be subject to, such as liabilities for design defects, patent infringement and compliance with applicable laws, as well as the costs of returned product. Interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could negatively impact our results and our brand. We operate a complex and growing business. We offer a wide variety of subscription packages at different price points. Our business is dependent on the operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of third party service providers. Any degradation in the quality, or any failure, of our systems could reduce our revenues, cause us to lose customers and damage our brand. Although we have implemented practices designed to maintain the availability of our information technology systems and mitigate the harm of any unplanned interruptions, we do not have complete redundancy for all of our information technology systems, and our disaster recovery planning cannot anticipate all eventualities. We occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties. We could also experience loss of data or processing capabilities, which could cause us to lose customers and could materially harm our reputation and our operating results. We are involved in continuing efforts to upgrade and maintain our information technology systems. These maintenance and upgrade activities are costly, and problems with the design or implementation of system enhancements could harm our business and our results of operations. Our data centers and our information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, malicious attacks, fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses or other attempts to harm our systems. If hackers were able to circumvent our security measures, we could lose proprietary information or personal information or experience significant disruptions. If our systems become unavailable or suffer a security breach, we may be required to expend significant resources to address these problems, including notification under various federal and state data privacy regulations, and our reputation and operating results could suffer. We rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers, distributors and service providers to take, fulfill and handle customer service requests and host certain online activities. Any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems could prevent us from servicing customers or cause data to be unintentionally disclosed. We may from time to time modify our business plan, and these changes could adversely affect us and our financial condition. We regularly evaluate our plans and strategy. These evaluations often result in changes to our plans and strategy, some of which may be material. These changes in our plans or strategy may include: the acquisition or termination of unique or compelling programming; the introduction of new features or services; significant new or enhanced distribution arrangements; investments in infrastructure, such as satellites, equipment or radio spectrum; and acquisitions, including acquisitions that are not directly related to our satellite radio business. 17 Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our operations and could limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry. As of December 31, 2010, we had an aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.3 billion of indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness has important consequences. For example, it:  increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;  requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on indebtedness, reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, marketing and other general corporate activities;  limits our ability to borrow additional funds or make capital expenditures;  limits our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the audio entertainment industry; and  may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other competitors. The instruments governing our indebtedness contain covenants that, among other things, place certain limitations on our ability to incur more debt, pay dividends, make distributions, make investments, repurchase stock, create liens, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into sale lease-back transactions, merge or consolidate, and transfer or sell assets. Failure to comply with the covenants associated with this debt could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could cause us to seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws, discontinue operations or seek a purchaser for our business or assets. Changes in consumer protection laws and their enforcement could damage our business. We engage in extensive marketing efforts to attract and retain subscribers to our services. We employ a wide variety of communications tools as part of our marketing campaigns, including telemarketing efforts; print, television, radio and online advertising; and email solicitations. Consumer protection laws, rules and regulations are extensive and have developed rapidly, particularly at the State level. Consumer protection laws in certain jurisdictions cover nearly all aspects of our marketing efforts, including the content of our advertising, the terms of consumer offers and the manner in which we communicate with subscribers and prospective subscribers. We are engaged in considerable efforts to ensure that all our activities comply with federal and state laws, rules and regulations relating to consumer protection, including laws relating to privacy. Modifications to federal and state laws, rules and regulations concerning consumer protection, including decisions by federal and state courts and agencies interpreting these laws, could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain subscribers to our services. While we monitor the changes in and interpretations of these laws in consumer-related settlements and decisions, and while we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurances that new laws or regulations will not be enacted or adopted, preexisting laws or regulations will not be more strictly enforced or that our varied operations will continue to comply with all applicable laws, which might adversely affect our operations. A Multistate Working Group of 28 State Attorneys General, led by the Attorney General of the State of Ohio, is investigating certain of our consumer practices. The investigation focuses on practices relating to the cancellation of subscriptions; automatic renewal of subscriptions; charging, billing, collecting, and refunding or crediting of payments from consumers; and soliciting customers. A separate investigation into our consumer practices is being conducted by the Attorney General of the State of Florida. In addition, the Attorney General of the State of Missouri has commenced an action against us regarding our telemarketing practices to residents of the State of Missouri. Our broadcast studios, terrestrial repeater networks, satellite uplink facilities or other ground facilities could be damaged by natural catastrophes or terrorist activities. An earthquake, tornado, flood, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could damage our broadcast studios, terrestrial repeater networks or satellite uplink facilities, interrupt our service and harm our business. We do not have replacement or redundant facilities that can be used to assume the functions of our terrestrial repeater 18 networks. We do have redundant facilities that can be used to assume immediately many of the functions of the broadcast studios and satellite uplink facilities in the event of a catastrophic event. Any damage to the satellites that transmit to our terrestrial repeater networks would likely result in degradation of the affected service for some subscribers and could result in complete loss of service in certain or all areas. Damage to our satellite uplink facilities could result in a complete loss of either of our services until we could transfer operations to suitable back-up facilities. Electromagnetic interference from others could damage our business. Our satellite radio service may be subject to interference caused by other users of radio frequencies, such as RF lighting, ultra-wideband technology and Wireless Communications Service (WCS) users. The FCC has approved modifications to the rules governing the operations of WCS devices in the spectrum adjacent to satellite radio, including rule changes that facilitate mobile broadband services in the WCS frequencies. We have opposed certain of the changes out of a concern for their impact on the reception of satellite radio service; and have filed a petition with the FCC asking the Commission to reconsider certain of the changes. We cannot predict the outcome of our petition for reconsideration. The ultimate impact of certain of these rules changes on satellite radio reception is impossible to predict and dependent on numerous factors outside of our control, such as the design and implementation of WCS systems and devices, the applications deployed through WCS devices, and ultimately the number of WCS devices ultimately adopted by consumers. Our business may be impaired by third-party intellectual property rights. Development of our systems has depended upon the intellectual property that we have developed, as well as intellectual property licensed from third parties. If the intellectual property that we have developed or use is not adequately protected, others will be permitted to and may duplicate portions of our satellite radio systems or services without liability. In addition, others may challenge, invalidate, render unenforceable or circumvent our intellectual property rights, patents or existing sublicenses or we may face significant legal costs in connection with defending and enforcing those intellectual property rights. Some of the know-how and technology we have developed, and plan to develop, is not now, nor will it be, covered by U.S. patents or trade secret protections. Trade secret protection and contractual agreements may not provide adequate protection if there is any unauthorized use or disclosure. The loss of necessary technologies could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality performance standards, at greater cost or on a delayed basis, which could harm us. Other parties may have patents or pending patent applications, which will later mature into patents or inventions that may block our ability to operate our system or license technologies. We may have to resort to litigation to enforce our rights under license agreements or to determine the scope and validity of other parties proprietary rights in the subject matter of those licenses. This may be expensive. Also, we may not succeed in any such litigation. Third parties may assert claims or bring suit against us for patent, trademark or copyright infringement, or for other infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights. Any such litigation could result in substantial cost, and diversion of effort and adverse findings in any proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties; require us to seek licenses from third parties; block our ability to operate our systems or license our technology; or otherwise adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market our satellite radio systems. Liberty Media Corporation has significant influence over our business and affairs and its interests may differ from ours. Liberty Media Corporation holds preferred stock that is convertible into 2,586,976,000 shares of common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the preferred stock held by Liberty Media, we cannot take certain actions, such as certain issuances of equity or debt securities, without the consent of Liberty Media. Additionally, Liberty Media has the right to designate a corresponding percentage of our board of directors. As a result, Liberty Media has significant influence over our business and affairs. The interests of Liberty Media may differ from our interests. The extent of Liberty Medias stock ownership in us also may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire control of us. 19 Our net operating loss carryforwards could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. We have generated a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $8.1 billion through the year ended December 31, 2010, and we may generate net operating loss carryforwards in future years. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock over a three-year period, to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes among stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company. If we undergo an ownership change for purposes of Section 382 as a result of future transactions involving our common stock, including purchases or sales of stock between 5% stockholders, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and to recognize certain built-in losses would be subject to the limitations of Section 382. Depending on the resulting limitation, a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them. Our inability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards could have a negative impact on our long-term financial position and results of operations. We have adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to preserve shareholder value and the value of certain tax assets primarily associated with net operating loss carryforwards and built-in losses under Section 382 of the Code. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
