ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous uncertainties and risks. The following risks and uncertainties may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. You should consider these risks and uncertainties carefully, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K before you decide whether to purchase any of our securities. If any of the risks or uncertainties we face were to occur, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Risk related to our business We are substantially dependent on two wireless carrier partners for a large portion of our revenue and if these wireless carrier partners were to limit or terminate our relationships with them or to offer LBS directly or from other vendors, our revenue and net income would be adversely affected. We are substantially dependent on two wireless carrier partners for a large portion of our revenue. In fiscal 2008, 2009 and 2010, Sprint represented 62%, 61% and 55% of our revenue, respectively. Effective September 1, 2010, we amended our agreement with Sprint to, among other things, extend the term of our agreement from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012. Pursuant to the terms of our agreement with Sprint, we are Sprints preferred supplier of navigation applications until December 31, 2012 and Sprint is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to feature our navigation services more prominently than other navigation applications on handsets and to preload certain of our products on handsets. Sprint is entitled to expand the number of bundles in which our navigation services are offered. For bundled navigation services, Sprint will pay us a fixed annual fee regardless of the number of subscribers (up to specified thresholds). Sprint may terminate our agreement for any reason, beginning June 30, 2012, by providing notice at least 30 business days prior to termination. We anticipate that our amended agreement with Sprint would result in declines in ARPU and significant reductions in revenue from Sprint for bundled basic navigation services compared to the most recent quarter, but would also likely result in continued increases in the number of subscribers. Although we are entitled to receive more revenue from Enterprise LBS, mobile commerce and premium navigation services than we were previously, we may not be able to realize these benefits in the short term or at all. We cannot predict the ultimate financial impact of our amended agreement with Sprint. Our failure to renew or renegotiate this agreement on or after June 30, 2012 on favorable terms or at all, a termination of our agreement by Sprint or our failure to otherwise maintain our relationship with Sprint would substantially reduce our revenue and significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In connection with our amended agreement with Sprint, we and Sprint have agreed to transition Sprint Navigation branded services to TeleNav branded navigation services. The branding transition may not increase end user recognition of our brand and may result in confusion that results in reduced or more limited adoption of our services by Sprints subscribers. In March 2008, Sprint began offering the Simply Everything plans which currently include our LBS. As a result, we have experienced a significant increase in end users and benefitted from increased marketing exposure since the Simply Everything plans introduction. If Sprint reduces its expenditures for marketing our LBS, changes its Simply Everything plans to eliminate our services, prices our LBS at a level that makes them less attractive or offers and promotes competing LBS, in lieu of, or to a greater degree than, our LBS, our revenue would be materially reduced and our business, operating results and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. In fiscal 2008, 2009 and 2010, AT&T represented 26%, 29% and 34% of our total revenue, respectively. AT&T is not required to offer our LBS. Our current agreement with AT&T expires on March 19, 2011 and during the term of our agreement, we are the exclusive provider of white label GPS navigation services to AT&T. If AT&T were to terminate its agreement with us or fail to renew or renegotiate the agreement on favorable terms when it expires, we would lose a substantial portion of our revenue and our business operating 17 Table of Contents results and financial condition could be harmed. Furthermore, our failure to otherwise maintain our relationship with AT&T would substantially harm our business. We operate in a highly competitive market, including competitors that offer their services for free, which could make it difficult for us to acquire and retain wireless carrier partners and end users. The market for development, distribution and sale of LBS is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, public relations, sales, distribution and other resources than we do. Competitors could begin offering LBS that have at least equivalent functionality to ours for free. For example, Google offers free voice guided, turn by turn navigation as part of its Google Maps product for mobile devices based on the Android 1.6 and higher operating system platform and Nokia provides a download for its latest version of Ovi Maps on its smartphones which also provides turn by turn navigation functions. Microsoft also provides a free turn by turn navigation solution with its current Windows Mobile operating system. Competition from these free offerings may reduce our revenue and harm our business. If our wireless carrier partners can offer these LBS to their subscribers for free, they may elect to cease their relationships with us, alter or reduce the manner or extent to which they market or offer our services or require us to substantially reduce our subscription fees or pursue other business strategies that may not prove successful. Our primary competitors include providers of LBS such as Google, Microsoft, Navigon, Nokia, TCS, through its acquisition of NIM, Telmap and TomTom; PND providers such as Garmin and TomTom; integrated navigation mobile phone providers such as Garmin and Nokia; providers of Internet and mobile based maps and directions such as AOL/Mapquest, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo!; and wireless carriers and communication solutions providers developing their own LBS, such as TCS through its acquisition of NIM. Some of our competitors and our potential competitors advantages over us, either globally or in particular geographic markets, include the following:  the provision of their services at no or low cost to consumers;  significantly greater revenue and financial resources;  stronger brand and consumer recognition regionally or worldwide;  the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and nonmobile products;  access to core technology and intellectual property, including more extensive patent portfolios;  access to custom or proprietary content;  quicker pace of innovation;  stronger wireless carrier and handset manufacturer relationships;  greater resources to make and integrate acquisitions;  lower labor and development costs; and  broader global distribution and presence. Our competitors and potential competitors advantages over us could make it more difficult for us to sell our LBS, and could result in increased pricing pressures, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses and failure to increase, or the loss of, market share or expected market share, any of which would likely cause harm to our business, operating results and financial condition. 18 Table of Contents Our wireless carrier partners may change the pricing and other terms by which they offer our LBS, which could result in increased end user turnover, lower revenue and adverse effects on our business. Several of our wireless carrier partners sell unlimited data service plans, which include our LBS. As a result, end users do not have to pay a separate monthly fee to use our services. If our wireless carrier partners were to eliminate our services from their unlimited data service plans, such as the Sprint Simply Everything plans, we could lose end users as they would be required to pay a separate monthly fee to continue to use our services. In addition, we could be required to change our fee structure to retain end users, which could negatively affect our gross margins. For example, effective September 1, 2010, we amended our agreement with Sprint to, among other things, provide bundled navigation services for a fixed annual fee from Sprint regardless of the number of subscribers (up to specified thresholds), rather than the per subscriber per month fee structure we and Sprint had previously employed. We anticipate that our future revenue from Sprint and our ARPU and gross margins will be negatively affected as a result of the shift to a fixed fee model for services we provide to bundled subscribers. Our wireless carrier partners may also seek to reduce the monthly fees per subscriber that they pay us if their subscribers do not use our services as often as the wireless carriers expect or for any other reason in order to reduce their costs. Our wireless carrier partners may also decide to raise prices, impose usage caps or discontinue unlimited data service plans, which could cause our end users who receive our services through those plans to move to a less expensive plan that does not include our services or terminate their relationship with the wireless carrier. If imposed, these pricing changes or usage restrictions could make our LBS less attractive and could result in current end users abandoning our LBS. If end user turnover increased, the number of our end users and our revenue would decrease and our business would be harmed. We are also required to give AT&T certain most favored customer pricing on specified products and in certain markets. In certain circumstances this may require us to reduce the price per end user under the AT&T contract. We are substantially dependent on our wireless carrier partners to market and distribute our LBS to end users and our business may be harmed if our wireless carrier partners elect not to broadly offer our services. We rely on our wireless carrier partners to introduce, market and promote our LBS to end users. None of our wireless carrier partners are contractually obligated to continue to do so. If wireless carrier partners do not introduce, market and promote mobile phones that are GPS enabled and on which our client software is preloaded and do not actively market our LBS, our LBS will not achieve broader acceptance and our revenue may not grow as fast as anticipated, or may decline. Wireless carriers, including those with which we have existing relationships, may decide not to offer our services and may enter into exclusive relationships with one or more of our competitors. While our LBS may still be available to customers of those wireless carriers as downloads from application stores or our website, sales of our LBS would likely be much more limited than if our LBS were preloaded as a white label service actively marketed by the carrier or were included as part of a bundle of services. Our inability to offer our LBS through a white label offering or as part of a bundle on popular mobile phones would harm our operating results and financial condition. If we are unable to manage our costs in light of the anticipated reduction in average revenue per user, or ARPU, or a potential increase in end user activity, our gross margin would decline and our operating results would be adversely affected. Our ARPU has declined over time due to a number of factors, including the bundling of our LBS with voice and other data services and the introduction of white label services. We expect the current trend of declining ARPU to continue. Our wireless carrier partners have the ability to lower end user pricing on our LBS which would have an immediate adverse effect on our ARPU. As a result of the recent Sprint amendment that provides us with a fixed annual fee for bundled navigation services, we believe that future ARPU and average monthly paying end users may not be comparable to earlier periods or be a meaningful indicator of our financial performance. Our gross margin may decrease if the average cost per end user to provide our services does not 19 Table of Contents decline proportionately. These costs include third party map and other data costs and internal costs to provide our services. Many of these costs increase as the number of end users increases, and also increase based on incremental usage by end users, both of which could have a negative effect on our gross margins. Although we have taken action to increase the predictability of certain of our third party map and other data costs for Sprint bundles, we may not have adequately aligned our cost of providing our LBS and may not be successful in maintaining or reducing the decline in our gross margin. Our success depends on significantly increasing the number of end users that purchase our LBS from our wireless carrier partners. Our revenue is derived almost exclusively from subscription fees that we receive from our wireless carrier partners for end users who subscribe to our service on a stand alone basis or in a bundle with other services. Depending on the wireless carrier contracts, we receive revenue per end user as a fixed fee or a revenue sharing arrangement. To date, a relatively small number of end users have subscribed for our services in connection with their wireless plans compared to the total number of mobile phone users. Our near term success depends heavily on achieving significantly increased subscriber adoption of our LBS either through stand alone subscriptions to our services or as part of bundles from our existing wireless carrier partners. Our success also depends on achieving widespread deployment of our LBS by attracting and retaining additional wireless carrier partners. The use of our LBS will depend on the pricing and quality of those services, subscriber demand for those services, which may vary by market, as well as the level of subscriber turnover experienced by our wireless carrier partners. If subscriber turnover increases more than we anticipate, our financial results could be adversely affected. If our current and future wireless carrier partners do not successfully market our LBS, particularly GPS Navigator, to their customers or if we are not successful in maintaining and expanding our relationships with our wireless carrier partners, we will not be able to maintain or increase the number of end users that use our LBS and our business, operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected. If our wireless carrier partners lose net subscribers, such as the losses Sprint has experienced, or if their subscribers do not continue to purchase service plans that include our LBS and we are unable to develop relationships with other significant wireless carriers, we will lose end users and our revenue and operating results will be adversely affected. Wireless carriers relationships with subscribers have been threatened by several factors, including strong competition, lack of subscriber loyalty and the development of direct relationships between mobile phone manufacturers and mobile phone operating system providers and consumers. A loss of net subscribers by one or more of our wireless carrier partners could harm our business as we rely on our wireless carrier partners to market our products. For example, one of our key wireless carrier partners, Sprint, has been experiencing losses in net subscribers. If Sprint continues to lose net subscribers or if Sprint subscribers do not continue to purchase service plans that include our LBS, we may also lose end users and experience a decline in revenue to the extent we are unable to develop similar relationships with other significant wireless carriers which include our services in attractive bundled or other LBS offerings that generate comparable revenue. A significant decrease in the number of our end users will adversely affect our revenue and operating results. Our ability to increase or maintain our end user base and revenue will be impaired if mobile phone manufacturers do not allow us to customize our services for their new devices. We typically deliver our services through client software that has been customized to work with a given mobile phones operating system, features and form factors. Wireless carrier partners often insist that mobile phone manufacturers permit us to customize our client software for their devices in order to provide the end user with a positive experience. Wireless carriers or mobile phone manufacturers may enter into agreements with 20 Table of Contents other providers of LBS for new or popular mobile phones. For this reason or others, some mobile phone manufacturers may refuse to permit us to access preproduction models of their mobile phones or the mobile phone manufacturers may offer a competing service. If mobile phone manufacturers do not permit us to customize our client software and preload it on their devices, we may have difficulty attracting end users because of poor user experiences or an inconvenient provisioning process. If we are unable to provide seamless provisioning or end users cancel their subscriptions to our services because they have poor experiences, our revenue may be harmed. New entrants and the introduction of other distribution models in the LBS market may harm our competitive position. The markets for development, distribution and sale of LBS are rapidly evolving. New entrants seeking to gain market share by introducing new technology and new products may make it more difficult for us to sell our LBS, and could create increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses or the loss of market share or expected market share, any of which may significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Although historically wireless carriers controlled provisioning and access to the applications that could be used on mobile phones connected to their networks, in recent years consumers have been able to download and provision applications from individual provider websites and to select from a menu of applications through the Apple iTunes App Store, the Blackberry App World and other application aggregators. Increased competition from providers of LBS which do not rely on a wireless carrier may result in fewer wireless carrier subscribers electing to purchase their wireless carriers branded LBS, which could harm our business and revenue. In addition, these LBS may be offered for free or on a one time fee basis, which could force us to reduce monthly subscription fees or migrate to a one time fee model to remain competitive. We may also lose end users or face erosion in ARPU if these competitors deliver their products without charge to the consumer by generating revenue from advertising or as part of other applications or services. Finally, we may not be successful at generating revenue from premium navigation services if end users believe that free services are comparable or adequate. Our operating income and net income could decline as a percentage of revenue as we make further expenditures to enhance and expand our operations in order to support additional growth in our business. As a percentage of revenue, our operating income was 10%, 38% and 40% and our net income was 10%, 27% and 24% in fiscal 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. Since June 30, 2008, we have made significant investments in new operating and information systems and additional data centers, hired substantial numbers of new research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative personnel and expanded our operations outside the United States. Efforts to develop new services and products and attract new wireless carrier partners require investments in anticipation of longer term revenue. We intend to make additional investments in systems and personnel and continue to expand our operations to support anticipated growth in our business. We also expect to incur additional operating costs as a public reporting company as a result of the closing of our initial public offering, or IPO, on May 18, 2010. As a result of these factors, we believe our operating income and net income may decline as a percentage of revenue at least through fiscal 2011. Furthermore, our investments and expenditures may not result in the growth that we anticipate. We also will not be able to reduce our expenditures on a timely basis, if at all, if we do not generate anticipated revenue. We are substantially dependent on revenue from our GPS Navigator service, our flagship LBS, and, if we fail to generate significant revenue from other services, our operating results may be harmed if revenue from GPS Navigator declines. Although revenue in absolute dollars from sources other than GPS Navigator rose in all periods presented, revenue from our GPS Navigator service represented 84%, 92% and 94% of our revenue in fiscal 2008, 2009 and 21 Table of Contents 2010, respectively. If we were unable to be the exclusive provider of white label navigation services to our major wireless carrier partners or the number of end users for GPS Navigator were to decline, our revenue would be substantially harmed. We have experienced a reduction of ARPU from GPS Navigator over time as our wireless carrier partners implement white label and more bundled offerings, for which we typically receive a lower monthly subscription fee or a fixed annual fee regardless of the number of end users (subject to specified thresholds) to which we provide our services. We may be unable to increase our revenue from our MRM services, and we may not be successful in our efforts to diversify into areas such as in-dash navigation. If we were unable to offset declining ARPU from GPS Navigator by increasing the number of end users or the amount of revenue that our other services and products represent, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed. We rely on our wireless carrier partners for timely and accurate subscriber information. A failure or disruption in the provisioning of this data to us would materially and adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively. We rely on our wireless carrier partners to bill subscribers and collect monthly fees for our LBS, either directly or through third party service providers. If our wireless carrier partners or their third party service providers provide us with inaccurate data or experience errors or outages in their own billing and provisioning systems when performing these services, our revenue may be less than anticipated or may be subject to adjustment with the wireless carrier. In the past, we have experienced errors in wireless carrier reporting. If we are unable to identify and resolve discrepancies in a timely manner, our revenue may vary more than anticipated from period to period and this could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. We rely on a proprietary provisioning and reporting system to track end user activation, deactivation and usage data and any material failures in this system could harm our revenue, affect our costs and impair our ability to manage our business effectively. Our provisioning and reporting system that authenticates end users and tracks the number of end users and their use of our services is a proprietary and customized system that we developed internally. Although we believe that the flexibility of this service to integrate tightly with wireless carriers reporting and provisioning systems gives us a competitive advantage, we might lose revenue and the ability to manage our business effectively if the system were to experience material failures or be unable to scale as our business grows. In addition, we may not be able to report our financial results on a timely basis if our wireless carrier partners question the accuracy of our records or we experience significant discrepancies between the data generated by our provisioning and reporting systems and data generated by the wireless carriers systems, or if our systems fail or we are unable to report timely and accurate information to our third party data providers. The inability to timely report our financial results would impair the quality of our financial reporting and could result in the delisting of our common stock. Our profitability may decline as we expand into other service and product areas and we may be unable to recoup our investments. We receive a substantial majority of our revenue from monthly subscription fees paid by wireless carrier partners who bill their subscribers for our services on a stand alone or bundled basis. As we expand our LBS offerings to enable end users to purchase our services from application stores outside of wireless carriers sales platforms, we may have to adapt our revenue model to a one time fee for services. In addition, as we enter the in-dash navigation market or other markets for LBS, we may be required to adopt pricing models other than monthly subscription fees and may incur cost of revenue substantially different than that which we have experienced historically due in part to third party content costs. These different pricing models and increased costs of revenue may result in declines in our gross margins. We have limited experience in selling our services and products outside of the wireless carrier application platform. As we expand into new service and product areas, such as in-dash navigation systems, we may not be 22 Table of Contents able to compete effectively with existing market participants and may not be able to realize a positive return on the investment we have made in these products or services. If our introduction of a new product or service is not successful or we are not able to achieve the revenue or margins we expect, our operating results may be harmed and we may not recover our product development and marketing expenditures. We may not be able to enhance our LBS to keep pace with technological and market developments, or develop new LBS in a timely manner or at competitive prices. The market for LBS is emerging and is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles. To keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasing customer requirements and achieve product acceptance, our future success depends upon our ability to enhance our current LBS platform and to continue to develop and introduce new LBS offerings and enhanced performance features and functionality on a timely basis at competitive prices. Our inability, for technological or other reasons, to enhance, develop, introduce or deliver compelling LBS in a timely manner, or at all, in response to changing market conditions, technologies or consumer expectations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or could result in our LBS becoming obsolete. Our ability to compete successfully will depend in large measure on our ability to maintain a technically skilled development and engineering team and to adapt to technological changes and advances in the industry, including providing for the continued compatibility of our LBS platform with evolving industry standards and protocols and competitive network operating environments. Development and delivery schedules for LBS are difficult to predict. We have in the past and may in the future fail to deliver new versions of our services in a timely fashion. If new releases of our LBS are delayed or our services are not preloaded on mobile phones upon their initial commercial release, our wireless carrier partners may curtail their efforts to market and promote our LBS and end users may switch to competing services, any of which would result in a delay or loss of revenue and could harm our business. In addition, we cannot assure you that the technologies and related LBS that we develop will be brought to market by our wireless carrier partners as quickly as anticipated or that they will achieve broad acceptance among wireless carriers or consumers. We rely on third party data and content to provide our services and if we were unable to obtain content at reasonable prices, or at all, our gross margins and our ability to provide our services would be harmed. We rely on third party data and content to provide our services including map data, POI, traffic information, gas prices and weather information. If our suppliers of this data or content were to enter into exclusive relationships with other providers of LBS or were to discontinue providing such information and we were unable to replace them cost effectively, or at all, our ability to provide our services would be harmed. Our gross margins may also be affected if the cost of third party data and content increases substantially. We obtain map data from Tele Atlas and NAVTEQ, which are companies owned by our current and potential competitors TomTom and Nokia, respectively. Accordingly, these third party data and content providers may act in a manner that is not in our best interest. For example, they may cease to offer their map data to us. We may not be able to upgrade our LBS platform to support certain advanced features and functionality without obtaining technology licenses from third parties. Obtaining these licenses may be costly and may delay the introduction of such features and functionality, and these licenses may not be available on commercially favorable terms, or at all. The inability to offer advanced features or functionality, or a delay in our ability to upgrade our LBS platform, may adversely affect consumer demand for our LBS and, consequently, harm our business. 23 Table of Contents We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our financial performance may suffer. We have substantially expanded our overall business, end user base, headcount and operations in recent periods. We increased our total number of full time employees from 332 at June 30, 2007 to 897 at June 30, 2010. During this same period, we made substantial investments in our information systems and significantly expanded our operations outside the United States, including an expansion of our research and development activities in China. For example, we added 146 new employees in China during fiscal 2010. Our expansion has placed, and our expected future growth will continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. If we are unable to manage our growth successfully, our operating results will suffer. Network failures, disruptions or capacity constraints in our third party data center facilities or in our servers could affect the performance of our LBS and harm our reputation and our revenue. Our LBS are provided through a combination of our servers, which we house at third party data centers, and the networks of our wireless carrier partners. Our operations rely to a significant degree on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of the third party data centers we use. Our hosted data centers are currently located in third party facilities located in the San Francisco Bay Area. We have recently added third party data center facilities in the Sacramento, California area to provide for disaster recovery and, which we expect, in the long term, to accommodate the anticipated growth of our LBS. Depending on the growth rate in the number of our end users and their usage of our services, if we do not timely complete and open additional data centers, we may experience capacity issues, which could lead to service failures and disruptions. In addition, if we are unable to secure data center space with appropriate power, cooling and bandwidth capacity, we may be unable to efficiently and effectively scale our business to manage the addition of new wireless carrier partners, increases in the number of our end users or increases in data traffic. Our data centers are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources including fire, flood, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications or computer systems failure, human error, terrorist acts or other events. We have not yet completed a comprehensive business continuity plan and there can be no assurance that the measures implemented by us to date, or measures implemented by us in the future, to manage risks related to network failures or disruptions in our data centers will be adequate, or that the redundancies built into our servers will work as planned in the event of network failures or other disruptions. In particular, if we experienced damage or interruptions to our data centers in the San Francisco Bay Area, or were unable to commence recovery operations in our new data center in Sacramento, California, our ability to provide efficient and uninterrupted operation of our services would be significantly impaired. We could also experience failures of our data centers or interruptions of our services, or other problems in connection with our operations, as a result of:  damage to or failure of our computer software or hardware or our connections and outsourced service arrangements with third parties;  errors in the processing of data by our servers;  computer viruses or software defects;  physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events; or  errors by our employees or third party service providers. Poor performance in or disruptions of our services could harm our reputation, delay market acceptance of our services and subject us to liabilities. Our wireless carrier agreements require us to meet at least 99.9% operational uptime requirements, excluding scheduled maintenance periods, or be subjected to penalties. For example, in August 2009 we experienced a four hour interruption of service, although no penalties were applied. 24 Table of Contents If we are unable to meet these requirements, our wireless carrier partners could terminate our agreements or we may be required to refund a portion of monthly subscriptions fees they have paid us. In addition, if our end user base continues to grow, additional strain will be placed on our technology systems and networks, which may increase the risk of a network disruption. Any outage in a network or system, or other unanticipated problem that leads to an interruption or disruption of our LBS, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. If our LBS platform does not scale as anticipated, or we are unable to grow data center capacity as needed, our business will be harmed. Despite frequent testing of the scalability of our LBS platform in a test environment, the ability of our LBS platform to scale to support a substantial increase in the use of our services or number of users in an actual commercial environment is unproven. If our LBS platform does not efficiently and effectively scale to support and manage a substantial increase in the use of our services or number of users while maintaining a high level of performance, our business will be seriously harmed. Our quarterly revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline. Our quarterly revenue and operating results may vary significantly in the future. Therefore, you should not rely on the results achieved in any one quarter as an indication of future performance. Period to period comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful. Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, those listed below, many of which are outside of our control:  changes in the pricing of our services or products or those of our competitors and changes in the pricing and content of bundled LBS offerings of our wireless carrier partners, such as the revenue model changes resulting from our recent contract amendment with Sprint;  loss of subscribers by our wireless carrier partners or a reduction in the number of subscribers to plans that include our services;  the timing and quality of information we receive from our wireless carrier partners;  our inability to attract new end users;  the timing and success of new service introductions by us or our competitors;  the timing and success of new mobile phone introductions by our wireless carrier partners;  the loss of our relationship with any particular wireless carrier partner;  the timing and success of wireless carrier partners marketing expenditures;  the extent of any interruption in our services;  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our operations and infrastructure;  the timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies, products or businesses;  potential foreign currency exchange gains and losses associated with expenses and sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar;  general economic, industry and market conditions that impact expenditures for smartphones and LBS in the United States and other countries where we sell our services and products; 25 Table of Contents  changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact our return on our investments in cash and marketable securities;  changes in our effective tax rates; and  the impact of new accounting pronouncements. Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results might lead analysts to change their models for valuing our common stock. As a result, our stock price could decline rapidly and we could face costly securities class action suits or other unanticipated issues. If a substantial number of end users change mobile phones or if our wireless carrier partners switch to subscription plans that require active monthly renewal by end users, our revenue could suffer. Subscription fees represent the vast majority of our revenue. As mobile phone development continues and new mobile phones are offered at subsidized rates to subscribers in connection with plan renewals, an increasing percentage of end users who already subscribe to our services will likely upgrade from their existing mobile phones. With some wireless carriers, subscribers are unable to automatically transfer their existing subscriptions from one mobile phone to another. In addition, wireless carriers may switch to subscription billing systems that require subscribers to actively renew, or opt-in, each month from current systems that passively renew unless subscribers take some action to opt-out of their subscriptions. In either case, unless we or our wireless carrier partners are able to resell subscriptions to these subscribers or replace these subscribers with other subscribers, our revenue would suffer and this could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. If we are unable to attract new wireless carrier partners, our revenue growth may be adversely affected and our net income could decline. If we do not add new wireless carrier partners and increase the number of end users who receive our services through those new wireless carrier partners, we may not be able to increase our revenue in the longer term. Our sales and marketing efforts may not be successful in establishing relationships with new wireless carrier partners. We will not be successful in expanding into new geographic markets without developing relationships with successful wireless carriers in those markets. We expect to incur significant additional expenses in hiring additional personnel and expanding our international operations in order to attract new wireless carrier partners in different geographic markets to achieve revenue growth. If we fail to attract new successful wireless carrier partners and their subscribers or our new service introductions are not successful, we may be unable to increase our revenue and our operating results may be adversely affected. Our lengthy sales cycle makes it difficult for us to predict when we will generate revenue from new wireless carrier partners. We have a lengthy and complex sales process. The integration and testing of our LBS platform with a prospective wireless carrier requires substantial time and expense before launching our LBS with that wireless carrier. In new geographic markets, our sales cycles are typically longer and may involve more challenges such as language or government regulation/compliance requirements. Even after a wireless carrier decides to launch our LBS, the integration of our LBS platform with a wireless carriers network and billing systems generally requires several months to complete. Moreover, launch of our LBS by a wireless carrier typically will be timed to coincide with a new mobile phone launch, over which we have no control. Because of this lengthy cycle, we may experience delays from the time we begin the sales process and incur increased costs and expenses to obtain a new wireless carrier as a customer and integrate our LBS platform until the time we generate revenue from such wireless carrier. These delays may make it difficult to predict when we will generate revenue from new wireless carrier partners. 26 Table of Contents The failure of mobile phone providers selected by our wireless carrier partners to keep pace with technological and market developments in mobile phone design may negatively affect the demand for our LBS. Wireless carriers select various mobile phones to run on their wireless networks. Our future success will depend on these mobile phone providers ability to design and manufacture mobile phones that meet the demands of wireless carriers and their subscribers. In order to continue their relationships with the wireless carriers, these mobile phone providers will have to continue to invest in developing mobile phones that are compatible with the advanced network technology that wireless carriers are deploying to increase network capacity and speed. If our wireless carrier partners fail to select mobile phone providers whose products have superior GPS capabilities or fail to adopt other advanced technologies, our ability to sell our LBS may suffer. If we do not extend our client software to these devices in a timely and efficient manner before the initial commercial launch of the mobile phone, our adoption rates will suffer. In addition, if our wireless carrier partners select mobile phones that are incompatible with our LBS client software, we will incur additional time and expenses to extend our services to those devices, which may cause us to incur unanticipated operating expenses and miss product launch windows. Because of short product life cycles in the wireless communications industry, if we fail to integrate our software on a mobile phone prior to its commercial launch or if it is preloaded with another providers LBS, we may lose a substantial opportunity to gain end users who purchase that device and our revenue may suffer. Successful sales of our LBS depend on our wireless carrier partners keeping pace with changing consumer preferences for mobile phones. If our wireless carrier partners do not select mobile phones with the design attributes attractive to consumers, such as thin form factors, high resolution screens and desired functionality, customers may select wireless carriers with whom we do not have a relationship and subscriptions for our LBS may decline and, consequently, our business may be harmed. A large percentage of our research and development operations are conducted in China and our ability to introduce new services and support our existing services cost effectively depends on our ability to manage those remote development sites successfully. Our success depends on our ability to enhance our current services and develop new services and products rapidly and cost effectively. We opened two research and development centers in China, in addition to our existing facility, for the purpose of conducting more fundamental product development in those locations. We currently have a majority of our research and development personnel in China. As we do not have substantial experience managing core product development operations that are remote from our U.S. headquarters, we may not be able to manage these remote centers successfully. We could incur unexpected costs or delays in product development that could impair our ability to meet market windows or cause us to forego certain new product opportunities. Because our long term success depends on our ability to increase the number of end users located outside of the United States, our business will be susceptible to risks associated with international operations. As of June 30, 2010, we had international operations in China, the United Kingdom and Brazil. Our experience with wireless carriers outside the United States is limited. Although we have entered into agreements with 14 wireless carriers to provide our LBS in 29 countries and in absolute dollars our revenue from international operations increased in each of the periods presented, our revenue from the United States constituted 97%, 96% and 97% of our total revenue for fiscal 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. Our limited experience in operating our business outside the United States increases the risk that our current and future international expansion efforts may not be successful. In particular, our business model may not be successful in particular countries or regions outside the United States for reasons that we currently do not anticipate. In addition, conducting international operations subjects us to risks that we have not generally faced in the United States. These include:  fluctuations in currency exchange rates;  unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements; 27 Table of Contents  difficulties in managing the staffing of remote operations;  potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems, restrictions on the repatriation of earnings and changes in tax rates;  dependence on foreign wireless carriers with different pricing models;  availability of reliable 2G, 3G and 4G mobile networks in those countries;  requirements that we comply with local telecommunication regulations in those countries;  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and different legal standards;  increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;  political, social and economic instability in some jurisdictions;  terrorist attacks and security concerns in general; and  reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries. The occurrence of any one of these risks could negatively affect our international business and, consequently, our operating results. Additionally, operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources. We cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to establish, acquire or integrate operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability. We rely on our management team and need additional personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business. Our success and future growth depend on the skills, working relationships and continued services of our management team and in particular, our founders, Y.C. Chao, H.P. Jin and Robert Rennard. Our future performance will depend on our ability to continue to retain our senior management. Our future success also will depend on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled personnel in the United States and internationally. All of our employees work for us on an at will basis. Competition for personnel is intense, particularly in the software industry and for persons with experience with GPS and LBS. As a result, we may be unable to attract or retain qualified personnel. Our inability to attract and retain the necessary personnel could adversely affect our business. We do not maintain key person insurance for any of our personnel. If we are unable to integrate future acquisitions successfully, our operating results and prospects could be harmed. We have not made any acquisitions to date and we do not have any current plans, proposals or understandings relating to any material acquisitions or licenses. In the future, we may make acquisitions to improve our LBS offerings or expand to new markets. Our future acquisition strategy will depend on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate acquisitions and, if necessary, to obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing to fund those acquisitions. Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky, and any mergers and acquisitions we complete may not be successful. Any mergers and acquisitions we may pursue would involve numerous risks, including the following:  difficulties in integrating and managing the operations, technologies and products of the companies we acquire;  diversion of our managements attention from normal daily operation of our business;  our inability to maintain the key business relationships and the reputations of the businesses we acquire;  our inability to retain key personnel of the acquired company; 28 Table of Contents  uncertainty of entry into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience and in which competitors have stronger market positions;  our dependence on unfamiliar affiliates and partners of the companies we acquire;  insufficient revenue to offset our increased expenses associated with acquisitions;  our responsibility for the liabilities of the businesses we acquire, including those which we may not anticipate; and  our inability to maintain internal standards, controls, procedures and policies. We may be unable to secure the equity or debt funding necessary to finance future acquisitions on terms that are acceptable to us. If we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders will likely experience dilution, and if we finance future acquisitions with debt funding, we will incur interest expense and may have to comply with financial covenants and secure that debt obligation with our assets. If our end users increase their usage of our services, our net operating income may decline because the fees we receive from our wireless carrier partners generally do not depend on usage. With limited exceptions, our wireless carrier partners pay us fees that do not vary depending on whether or how often an end user uses our services. Historically, end users using certain mobile phones or under certain service plans tended to use our services more than other end users. We budget and operate our services by making certain assumptions about usage patterns. Over time, usage by subscribers who have access to our services under bundled plans has increased. If our end users were to further increase their usage of our services substantially, we would incur additional expenses to expand our server capacity, operate additional data centers and pay additional third party content fees. These additional costs would harm our operating results and financial condition. We may be required to incur unanticipated capital expenditures. Circumstances may arise that require us to make unanticipated capital expenditures including:  the implementation of our equipment at new data centers and expansion of our operations at data centers;  the replacement of outdated or failing equipment; and  the acquisition of key technologies to support or expand our LBS. We rely on network infrastructures provided by our wireless carrier partners and mobile phones for the delivery of our LBS to end users. We generally provide our services from our own servers, which require close integration with the wireless carriers networks. We may be unable to provide high quality services if the wireless carriers networks perform poorly or experience delayed response times. Our future success will depend on the availability and quality of our wireless carrier partners networks in the United States and abroad to run our LBS. This includes deployment and maintenance of reliable 2G, 3G and 4G networks with the speed, data capacity and security necessary to provide reliable wireless communications services. We do not establish or maintain these wireless networks and have no control over interruptions or failures in the deployment and maintenance by wireless carrier partners of their network infrastructure. In addition, these wireless network infrastructures may be unable to support the demands placed on them if the number of subscribers increases, or if existing or future subscribers increase their use of limited bandwidth. Market acceptance of our LBS will depend in part on the quality of these wireless networks and the ability of our wireless carrier partners to effectively manage their subscribers expectations. 29 Table of Contents Wireless communications have experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of infrastructure and equipment failures and could face outages and delays in the future. These outages and delays could affect our ability to provide our LBS successfully. In addition, changes by a wireless carrier to network infrastructure may interfere with the integration of our servers with their network and delivery of our LBS and may cause end users to lose functionality for services they have already purchased. Any of the foregoing could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. We cannot control the quality standards of our wireless carrier partners, their mobile phone providers and other technology partners. We cannot guarantee that the mobile phones are free from errors or defects. If errors or defects occur in mobile phones or services offered by our wireless carrier partners, it could result in consumers terminating our services, damage to our reputation, increased customer service and support costs, warranty claims, lost revenue and diverted development resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Mergers, consolidations or other strategic transactions in the wireless communications industry could weaken our competitive position, reduce the number of our wireless carrier partners and adversely affect our business. The wireless communications industry continues to experience consolidation and an increased formation of alliances among wireless carriers and between wireless carriers and other entities. Should one of our wireless carrier partners consolidate or enter into an alliance with another carrier, this could have a material adverse impact on our business. For example, our wireless carrier partner Alltel was acquired by Verizon in early 2009. Although we had an agreement with Alltel to be the exclusive white label provider of navigation services, Verizon elected to discontinue selling mobile phones preloaded with our LBS. We have experienced a decline in our revenue from the combined entity as a result of this decision, and expect this decline to continue. Such a consolidation or alliance may cause us to lose a wireless carrier partner or require us to reduce prices as a result of enhanced customer leverage, which would have a negative effect on our business. We may not be able to expand our base of wireless carrier partners to offset revenue declines if we lose a wireless carrier partner or if the number of end users for our services declines. In addition, if two or more of our competitors or wireless carrier partners were to merge or partner, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with their wireless carrier partners, sales channel partners or other parties with whom we have strategic relationships, thereby limiting our ability to promote our LBS. These events could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our operating results. Reduced expenditures for mobile phones or wireless services due to adverse or uncertain economic conditions may negatively affect our business and results of operations. Recent adverse economic conditions and future uncertainties may directly affect the marketing and distribution of mobile phones and our LBS by our wireless carrier partners. As current and future conditions in the domestic and global economies remain uncertain, it is difficult to estimate the level of economic growth, which may cause some wireless carriers to emphasize marketing basic voice services rather than data services, such as LBS. In addition, subscribers may try to reduce their monthly expenses by reducing spending on discretionary wireless services, such as ours. Accordingly, the future direction of the overall domestic and global economies will have an impact on our overall performance. Economic conditions are beyond our control. If these economic conditions worsen or fail to improve, we may experience reduced demand for and pricing pressure on our LBS, which could harm our operating results. 30 Table of Contents Risks related to our intellectual property and regulation We operate in an industry with extensive intellectual property litigation. Claims of infringement against us or our wireless carrier partners may cause our business, operating results and financial condition to suffer. Our commercial success depends in part upon us and our customers not infringing intellectual property rights owned by others and being able to resolve claims of intellectual property infringement without major financial expenditures. We operate in an industry with extensive intellectual property litigation and it is not uncommon for our wireless carrier partners and competitors to be involved in infringement lawsuits by or against third parties. Many industry participants that own, or claim to own, intellectual property aggressively assert their rights, and our wireless carrier partners, which we agree in certain circumstances to indemnify for intellectual property infringement claims related to our services, are often targets of such assertions. We cannot determine with certainty whether any existing or future third party intellectual property rights would require us to alter our technologies, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. We have received, and may in the future receive, claims from third parties asserting infringement and other related claims. For example, on November 17, 2009, WRE-Hol, LLC filed a complaint against us in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington (Case No. 2:09-cv-01642-MJP) alleging that we infringe a patent owned by WRE-Hol, LLC. According to the patent, the invention generally relates to a system and method for providing navigation and automated guidance to a mobile user. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, fees and expenses, and injunctive relief against us. On January 25, 2010, we answered the WRE-Hol complaint asserting that the patent-in-suit is not infringed and is invalid and unenforceable. On March 11, 2010, WRE-Hol amended its complaint to add a new defendant, and we subsequently answered, repeating our assertions that the patent-in-suit is not infringed and is invalid and unenforceable. On April 27, 2010, we filed a reexamination request for all of the claims of the asserted patent before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. On April 29, 2010, we filed a motion to stay the litigation pending the reexamination. On May 3, 2010, WRE-Hol filed a motion for leave to amend the complaint against us, seeking to add claims for misappropriation of trade secrets against us and our founders, Y.C. Chao, H.P. Jin and Robert Rennard. WRE-Hols motion for leave to amend also seeks to add a breach of contract claim against us and a claim for wrongful inventorship involving two of our patents, requesting a declaratory judgment that a WRE-Hol inventor be named as an inventor on these patents. On July 19, 2010, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued an order granting inter partes reexamination of all 51 claims of the WRE-Hol 625 patent. On July 23, 2010, the district court issued an order granting WRE-Hols motion for leave to amend its complaint, but at the same time stayed the entire litigation pending completion of the reexamination. The stay of the litigation extends to the new claims the court allowed. On September 13, 2010, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office rejected 44 of the 51 WRE-Hol patent claims in a non-final first office action and confirmed seven of the 51 claims. Additionally, on December 31, 2009, Vehicle IP, LLC filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (Case No. 1:09-cv-01007-JJF) alleging that certain of our navigation services, including our GPS Navigator, infringe a patent owned by Vehicle IP, LLC. According to the patent, the invention generally relates to a navigation system that determines an expected time of arrival. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, fees and expenses and injunctive relief against us. On March 11, 2010, we answered the complaint, asserting that the patent-in-suit is not infringed and is invalid. Vehicle IP denied these counterclaims and requested that they be dismissed. Verizon Wireless was named as a co-defendant in the Vehicle IP litigation based on the VZ Navigator product and has demanded that we indemnify and defend Verizon against Vehicle IP. AT&T Mobility was also named as a co-defendant in the Vehicle IP litigation based on the AT&T Navigator product. AT&T Mobility has tendered the defense of the litigation to us and we are defending the case on behalf of AT&T Mobility. The court has not yet ordered a scheduling conference for the litigation. Furthermore, on April 30, 2010, Traffic Information, LLC filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (Case No. 2:10-cv-00145-TJW). The suit alleges that certain of our products and/or services infringe U.S. Patent No. 6,785,606, and that we induce infringement and contribute to the infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,785,606 by others. According to the patent, the invention generally relates to a system for providing traffic information to a plurality of mobile users connected to a network. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, fees and expenses and injunctive relief against us. On May 28, 2010, Traffic Information, 31 Table of Contents LLC filed an amended complaint, adding a new claim that certain of our products and/or services infringe U.S. Patent No. 6,466,862, and that we induce infringement and contribute to the infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,466,862 by others. According to the patent, the invention generally relates to a system for providing traffic information to a plurality of mobile users connected to a network. The amended complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, fees and expenses and injunctive relief against us. Due to the preliminary status of these lawsuits and uncertainties related to litigation, we are unable to evaluate the likelihood of either favorable or unfavorable outcomes. Accordingly, we are unable at this time to estimate the effects of these lawsuits on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. These cases and future litigation may make it necessary to defend ourselves and our wireless carrier partners by determining the scope, enforceability and validity of third party proprietary rights or to establish our proprietary rights. Some of our competitors may have substantially greater resources than we do and may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could. In addition, patent holding companies that focus solely on extracting royalties and settlements by enforcing patent rights may target us or our wireless carrier partners. These companies typically have little or no product revenue and therefore our patents may provide little or no deterrence against such companies filing patent infringement lawsuits against us. Regardless of whether claims that we are infringing patents or other intellectual property rights have any merit, these claims are time consuming and costly to evaluate and defend and could:  adversely affect our relationships with our current or future wireless carrier partners;  cause delays or stoppages in the shipment of TeleNav enabled mobile phones, or cause us to modify or suspend the provision of our LBS;  cause us to incur significant expenses in defending claims brought against our wireless carrier partners or us;  divert managements attention and resources;  subject us to significant damages or settlements;  require us to enter into settlements, royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms; or  require us to cease certain activities. In addition to liability for monetary damages against us or, in certain circumstances, our wireless carrier partners, we may be prohibited from developing, commercializing or continuing to provide certain of our LBS unless we obtain licenses from the holders of the patents or other intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any such licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we do not obtain such licenses, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected and we could, for example, be required to cease offering our LBS or be required to materially alter our LBS, which could involve substantial costs and time to develop. Indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement, damages caused by defective software and other losses. Our agreements with our wireless carrier partners include indemnification provisions. We agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred in connection with our LBS, including as a result of intellectual property infringement, damages caused by defects and damages caused by viruses, worms and other malicious software. The term of these indemnity provisions is generally perpetual after execution of the corresponding agreement, and the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is generally substantial and may be unlimited. In addition, some of these agreements permit our indemnitees to terminate their agreements with us if they determine that the use of our LBS infringes third party intellectual property. 32 Table of Contents We have received, and expect to receive in the future, demands for indemnification under these agreements. These demands can be very expensive to settle or defend, and we have in the past incurred substantial legal fees in connection with certain of these indemnity demands. For example, we have been notified by several wireless carriers that they have been named as defendants in three patent infringement cases for which they may seek indemnification from us. See the section entitled Legal Proceedings. These indemnity demands relate to pending litigation and remain outstanding and unresolved as of the date of this Form 10-K. Large future indemnity payments and associated legal fees and expenses, including potential indemnity payments and legal fees and expenses relating to the current or future notifications, could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition. We may in the future agree to defend and indemnify our wireless carrier partners in connection with the pending notifications or future demands, irrespective of whether we believe that we have an obligation to indemnify them or whether we believe that our services and products infringe the asserted intellectual property rights. Alternatively, we may reject certain of our wireless carrier partners indemnity demands, which may lead to disputes with our wireless carrier partners and may negatively impact our relationships with them or result in litigation against us. Our wireless carrier partners may also claim that any rejection of their indemnity demands constitutes a material breach of our agreements with them, allowing them to terminate such agreements. Our agreements with Sprint and AT&T may be terminated in the event an infringement claim is made against us and it is reasonably determined that there is a possibility our technology or services infringed upon a third partys rights. If, as a result of indemnity demands, we make substantial payments, our relationships with our wireless carrier partners are negatively impacted or if any of our wireless carrier agreements is terminated, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. See the section entitled Legal Proceedings. Changes in government regulation of the wireless communications industry may adversely affect our business. It is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted in the United States and elsewhere that could restrict the wireless communications industry, including laws and regulations regarding lawful interception of personal data, use of mobile phones while driving, privacy, taxation, content suitability, copyright and antitrust. Furthermore, the growth and development of electronic storage of personal information may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours that store personal information. We anticipate that regulation of our industry will increase and that we will be required to devote legal and other resources to address this regulation. Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the United States or elsewhere regarding the wireless communications industries may lessen the growth of wireless communications services and may materially reduce our ability to increase or maintain sales of our LBS. We may become subject to significant product liability costs. If our LBS or products contain defects, there are errors in the maps supplied by third party map providers or if our end users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products, collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. If any of these events occurs, we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and under certain circumstances could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages. We maintain limited insurance against accident related risks involving our products. However, we cannot assure you that this insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs. If we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover an award, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 33 Table of Contents Government regulation designed to protect end user privacy may make it difficult for us to provide our services or adopt advertising based revenue models. We transmit and store a large volume of personal information in the course of providing our LBS. This information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world. This government action is typically intended to protect the privacy and security of personal information that is collected, stored and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. Legislation may also be adopted in various jurisdictions that prohibits use of personal information and search histories to target end users with tailored advertising, or provide advertising at all. Although our current business model does not rely on advertising revenue, we may explore advertising revenue in the future to improve ARPU in certain markets. We could be adversely affected if domestic or international legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business. For example, the USA PATRIOT Act provides certain rights to U.S. law enforcement authorities to obtain personal information in the control of U.S. persons and entities without notifying the affected individuals. If we are required to allocate significant resources to modify the delivery of our services to enable enhanced legal interception of the personal information that we transmit and store, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition, because various foreign jurisdictions have different laws and regulations concerning the storage and transmission of personal information, we may face unknown requirements that pose compliance challenges in new international markets that we seek to enter. Such variation could subject us to costs, delayed service launches, liabilities or negative publicity that could impair our ability to expand our operations into some countries and therefore limit our future growth. As privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues, we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of personal information. These and other privacy concerns could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, our competitive position and our business could be harmed. We rely primarily on a combination of patent laws, trademark laws, copyright laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology. However, our issued patents and any future patents that may issue may not survive a legal challenge to their scope, validity or enforceability, or provide significant protection for us. The failure of our patents to adequately protect our technology might make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products or technologies. In addition, patents may not issue from any of our current or any future applications. Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. The steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. We may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Our competitors may also independently develop similar technology. In addition, the laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering products that incorporate our most technologically advanced features, which could seriously reduce demand for our LBS. In addition, we may in the future need to initiate infringement claims or litigation. Litigation, whether we are a plaintiff or a defendant, can be expensive, time consuming and may divert the efforts of our technical staff and managerial personnel, which could harm our business, whether or not such litigation results in a determination favorable to us. 34 Table of Contents Confidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information. We have devoted substantial resources to the development of our proprietary technology, including the proprietary software components of our LBS and related processes. In order to protect our proprietary technology and processes, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, licensees, independent contractors and other advisors. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. We use open source software in our LBS platform and client applications that may subject our LBS platform and client applications to general release or require us to re-engineer our LBS platform and client applications, which may cause harm to our business. We use open source software in our LBS platform and client applications and may use more open source software in the future. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. If we combine our proprietary software products with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release our proprietary source code. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software. Open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. If we were found to have inappropriately used open source software, we may be required to release our proprietary source code, re-engineer our LBS platform and client applications, discontinue the sale of our service in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. The occurrence or perception of a security breach or disclosure of confidential information could harm our business. Our LBS include the transmission and storage of personal, private and confidential information primarily related to the location of our end users. If there is a security breach or if there is an inappropriate disclosure of any of these types of information, we could be exposed to investigations, litigation, fines and penalties. Remediation of and liability for loss or misappropriation of end user or employee personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Even if we were not held liable for such event, a security breach or inappropriate disclosure of personal, private or confidential information could harm our reputation and our relationships with current and potential end users. Even the perception of a security risk could inhibit market acceptance of our LBS. In addition, we may be required to invest additional resources to protect against damages caused by any actual or perceived disruptions of our LBS or security breaches. We may also be required to provide information about the location of an end users mobile phone (or vehicle, with respect to certain TeleNav Track services) to government authorities, which could result in public perception that we are providing the government with intelligence information and deter some end users from using our services. Any of these developments could harm our business. 35 Table of Contents Risks related to being a publicly traded company and holding our common stock As a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal controls over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock. We will be required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2011. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. Our auditors will also have to issue an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We are in the very early stages of the costly and challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our auditors were to express an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls because we had one or more material weaknesses, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline. We are currently subject to securities class action litigation and may be subject to similar litigation in the future. If the outcome of this litigation is unfavorable, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. On September 2, 2010, a purported stockholder class action was filed by David Smith in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (Case No. 3:10-CV-03942-SC) against us, certain of our officers and directors, and certain of our underwriters for our May 13, 2010 IPO. The complaint purports to be brought on behalf of all persons who acquired shares of our common stock pursuant to our May 13, 2010 IPO, traceable to our Form S-1/A Registration Statement and Prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on May 13, 2010. The complaint alleges that we, certain of our officers and directors, and certain of our underwriters for the IPO violated the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, by issuing the Registration Statement and Prospectus, which the plaintiff alleges contained material misstatements and omissions in violation of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act. Specifically, the complaint alleges that we failed to disclose in our May 13, 2010 Registration Statement and Prospectus that we would soon be renegotiating our current contract with Sprint, our largest customer, which would result in our revenue being reduced. The complaint seeks class certification, compensatory damages, attorneys fees and costs, rescission or a rescissory measure of damages, equitable and/or injunctive relief, and such other relief as the court may deem proper. We expect that other purported plaintiffs will file claims in this case. We deny these allegations and believe that our defenses to this action have merit. We intend to vigorously defend against this action and file a motion to dismiss the complaint. Due to the preliminary status of the lawsuit and uncertainties related to litigation, we are unable to evaluate the likelihood of either a favorable or unfavorable outcome. We cannot currently estimate a range of any possible losses we may experience in connection with this case. Accordingly, we are unable at this time to estimate the effects of this complaint on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In the future, especially following periods of volatility in the market price of our shares, other purported class action or derivative complaints may be filed against us. The outcome of the pending and potential future litigation is difficult to predict and quantify and the defense of such claims or actions can be costly. In addition to diverting financial and management resources and general business disruption, we may suffer from adverse publicity that could harm our brand or reputation, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable. A judgment or settlement that is not covered by or is significantly in excess of our 36 Table of Contents insurance coverage for any claims, or our obligations to indemnify the underwriters and the individual defendants, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In the past, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and if in the future we identify material weaknesses our ability to operate our business may be adversely affected. In the past, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which we have remediated. We may in the future identify additional material weaknesses. Implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls to address such a material weakness may distract our officers and employees, entail substantial costs to modify our existing processes and add necessary personnel as well as take significant time to complete. These changes may not, however, be effective in achieving or maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and harm our business. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal controls in the future. If we fail to address material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, our ability to operate our business may be adversely affected. We will incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could harm our operating results. As a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also have incurred and will incur costs associated with current corporate governance requirements, including requirements under Section 404 and other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and the stock exchange on which our common stock is traded. The expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes have increased dramatically over the past several years. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs substantially and to make some activities more time consuming and costly. We are unable currently to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. We also expect that, as a public company, it will be more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers. Regulations relating to offshore investment activities by residents of China may limit our ability to acquire Chinese companies and could adversely affect our business. In October 2005, SAFE, a Chinese government agency, promulgated Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents Corporate Financing and Roundtrip Investment Through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular 75, that states that if Chinese residents use assets or equity interests in their Chinese entities as capital contributions to establish offshore companies or inject assets or equity interests of their Chinese entities into offshore companies to raise capital overseas, they must register with local SAFE branches with respect to their overseas investments in offshore companies. They must also file amendments to their registrations if their offshore companies experience material events involving capital variation, such as changes in share capital, share transfers, mergers and acquisitions, spinoff transactions, long term equity or debt investments or uses of assets in China to guarantee offshore obligations. Under this regulation, their failure to comply with the registration procedures set forth in such regulation may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant Chinese entity, including restrictions on the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent, as well as restrictions on the capital inflow from the offshore entity to the Chinese entity. We attempt to comply, and attempt to ensure that our stockholders who are subject to Circular 75 and other related rules comply, with the relevant requirements. However, we cannot provide any assurances that all of our stockholders who are Chinese residents have complied or will comply with our request to make or obtain any applicable registrations or comply with other requirements required by Circular 75 or other related rules. Any 37 Table of Contents future failure by any of our stockholders who is a Chinese resident, or controlled by a Chinese resident, to comply with relevant requirements under this regulation could subject us to fines or sanctions imposed by the Chinese government, including restrictions on our Chinese subsidiarys ability to pay dividends or make distributions to us. We may be subject to fines and legal sanctions if we or our employees who are Chinese citizens fail to comply with Chinese regulations relating to employee stock options granted to Chinese citizens. On December 25, 2006, the PBOC, a Chinese government agency, issued the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control, and its implementation rules were issued by SAFE and took effect as of February 1, 2007. Under these regulations, all foreign exchange matters involved in an employee stock option plan or similar plan in which Chinese citizens participate requires approval from the SAFE or its authorized branch. On March 28, 2007, SAFE promulgated the Application Procedure of Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Employee Stock Holding Plan or Stock Option Plan of Overseas-Listed Company, or the Stock Option Rule. Under the Stock Option Rule, Chinese citizens who are granted stock options or restricted share units, or issued restricted shares by an overseas publicly listed company are required to complete certain procedures and transactional foreign exchange matters upon the examination by, and approval of, SAFE. We and our employees who are Chinese citizens who have been granted stock options are subject to the Stock Option Rule. Although we have made an application to SAFE, our request may not be granted in a timely manner, if at all. If the relevant Chinese regulatory authority determines that our Chinese employees who hold such options or our Chinese subsidiaries fail to comply with these regulations after our listing, such employees and our Chinese subsidiaries may be subject to fines and legal sanctions. If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. We expect that the trading price for our common stock will be affected by any research or reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who may elect to cover us downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. For example, in late July 2010, we announced that we were in discussions with Sprint to renegotiate our agreement and several financial analysts published research reports downgrading our stock. After our announcement and the publication of these reports, our stock price fell almost 40% in a single day. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, our stock may lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause its price to decline. If our stock continues to trade at prices below $5.00 per share, financial analysts may terminate coverage of our company due to internal policies within their investment banks, which could result in further stock price declines. Our stock price has fluctuated and declined significantly since our IPO in May 2010, and may continue to fluctuate or decline in the future. Our common stock was sold in our IPO at $8.00 per share. Although our common stock traded at prices as high as $11.48 per share shortly after our IPO, it has also traded at prices as low as $4.65 more recently. Future fluctuations or declines in the trading price of our common stock may result from a number of events or factors, including those discussed in the preceding risk factors relating to our operations, as well as:  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;  changes in the financial projections we may provide to the public or our failure to meet these projections;  announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital raising activities or capital commitments;  the publics response to our press releases or other public announcements, including our filings with the SEC; and  lawsuits threatened or filed against us. 38 Table of Contents General market conditions and domestic or international macroeconomic factors unrelated to our performance, such as the continuing unprecedented volatility in the financial markets, may also affect our stock price. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent trends to predict future stock prices or financial results. Investors in our common stock may not be able to dispose of the shares they purchased at prices above the IPO price, or, depending on market conditions, at all. The concentration of ownership of our capital stock limits your ability to influence corporate matters. Our executive officers, directors, current 5% or greater stockholders and entities affiliated with them beneficially owned (as determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC) approximately 65.6% of our common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2010. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders. Also, these stockholders, acting together, will be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if that change of control would benefit our other stockholders. Our stock price could decline due to the large number of outstanding shares of our common stock eligible for future sale. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market following our IPO, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. These sales could also make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. Upon completion of the release of the underwriters lockup from our IPO on or about November 14, 2010, 34,929,223 shares will be eligible for sale upon the expiration of lock-up agreements, subject in some cases to volume and other restrictions of Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act.
