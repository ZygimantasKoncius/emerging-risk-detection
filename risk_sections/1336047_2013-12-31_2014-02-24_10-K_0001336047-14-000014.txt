Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business faces many risks. We have described below the material risks which we and our subsidiaries face. Each of the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or circumstances that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, including our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.All of the information included in this report and any subsequent reports we may file with the SEC or make available to the public should be carefully considered and evaluated before investing in any securities issued by us.Business RisksWe may not have sufficient available cash to continue making distributions to unitholders at the current distribution rate, or at all. The amount of cash we have available to distribute to our unitholders principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations and financing activities and the amount of cash we require, or determine to use, for other purposes, all of which fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Some of the factors that influence the amount of cash we have available for distribution in any quarter include: •fluctuations in cash generated by our operations, including, as a result of the seasonality of our business, customer payment issues, general business conditions and market conditions, which impact, for example, contract renewals, basis spreads, time period price spreads, market rates and supply and demand for natural gas and our services;•the level of capital expenditures we make or anticipate making, including for expansion and growth projects;•the amount of cash necessary to meet current or anticipated debt service requirements and other liabilities;•fluctuations in our working capital needs; •our ability to borrow funds and/or access capital markets on acceptable terms to fund operations or capital expenditures, including acquisitions, and restrictions contained in our debt agreements; and•the cost and form of payment for pending or anticipated acquisitions and growth or expansion projects and the timing and commercial success of any such initiatives.There is no guarantee that unitholders will receive quarterly distributions from us. Our distributions are determined each quarter by the board of directors of our general partner based on the board’s consideration of our financial position, earnings, cash flow, current and future business needs and other relevant factors at that time. In February 2014, we declared a quarterly distribution of $0.10 per unit, which was less than the quarterly distributions of $0.5325 per unit that we declared and paid in recent prior periods. We may reduce or eliminate distributions at any time we determine that our cash reserves are insufficient or are otherwise required to fund current or anticipated future operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, growth or expansion projects, debt repayment or other business needs.We may not be able to replace expiring gas transportation and storage contracts at attractive rates or on a long-term basis and may not be able to sell short-term services at attractive rates or at all due to narrower basis differentials which adversely affect the value of our transportation services and narrowing of price spreads between time periods and reduced volatility which adversely affect our storage services. New sources of natural gas continue to be identified and developed in the U.S., including the Marcellus and Utica shale plays which are closer to the traditional high value markets we serve than the supply basins connected to our facilities. As a result, pipeline infrastructure has been, and continues to be, developed to move gas and NGLs from these supply basins to market areas, resulting in changes in pricing dynamics between supply basins, pooling points and market areas. Additionally, these new supplies of natural gas have reduced production or slowed production growth from supply areas connected to our pipelines and have caused some of the gas production that is supplied to our system to be diverted to other market areas. These factors have adversely affected, and are expected to continue to adversely affect, the value of our transportation and storage services and have lowered the volumes we have transported on our pipelines, as further discussed below.12Transportation Services:A key market driver that influences the rates and terms of our transportation contracts is the current and anticipated basis differentials - generally meaning the difference in the price of natural gas at receipt and delivery points on our natural gas pipelines - which influence how much customers are willing to pay to transport gas between those points. Basis differentials can be affected by, among other things, the availability and supply of natural gas, the proximity of supply areas to end use markets, competition from other pipelines, including pipelines under development, available transportation and storage capacity, storage inventories, regulatory developments, weather and general market demand in markets served by our pipeline systems. As a result of the new sources of supply and related pipeline infrastructure discussed above, basis differentials on our pipeline systems have narrowed significantly in recent years, reducing the transportation rates and other contract terms we can negotiate with our customers for available transportation capacity and for contracts due for renewal for our firm transportation services. The narrowing of basis differentials has also adversely affected the rates we are able to charge for our interruptible and short-term firm transportation services. Each year, a portion of our firm natural gas transportation contracts expire and need to be renewed or replaced. For the reasons discussed above and elsewhere in this Report, in recent periods we have renewed many expiring contracts at lower rates and for shorter terms than in the past, which has materially adversely impacted our transportation revenues. We expect this trend to continue and therefore may not be able to sell our available capacity, extend expiring contracts with existing customers or obtain replacement contracts at attractive rates or for the same term as the expiring contracts, which would continue to adversely affect our business. In 2008 and 2009, we placed into service a number of large new pipelines and expansions of our system, including our East Texas Pipeline, Southeast Expansion, Gulf Crossing Pipeline, and Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals. These projects were supported by firm transportation agreements with anchor shippers, typically having a term of ten years and pricing and other terms negotiated based on then current market conditions, which included wider basis spreads and, correspondingly, higher transportation rates than those prevailing in the current market. As a result, in 2018 and 2019, we will have significantly more contract expirations than other years. We cannot predict what market conditions will prevail at the time such contracts expire and what pricing and other terms may be available in the marketplace for renewal or replacement of such contracts. If we are unable to renew or replace these and other expiring contracts when they expire, or if the terms of any such renewal or replacement contracts are not as favorable as the expiring agreements, our revenues and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.Storage and PAL Services:We own and operate substantial natural gas storage facilities. The market for the storage and PAL services that we offer is also impacted by the factors discussed above, as well as natural gas price differentials between time periods, such as winter to summer (time period price spreads), and the volatility in time period price spreads. Recently, the market conditions described above have caused time period price spreads to narrow considerably and price volatility of natural gas to decline significantly, reducing the rates we can charge for our storage and PAL services and adversely impacting the value of these services. These market conditions, together with regulatory changes in the financial services industry, have also caused a number of gas marketers, which have traditionally been large consumers of our storage and PAL services, to exit the market, further impacting the market for those services. We expect the conditions described above to continue in 2014 and cannot give assurances they will not continue beyond 2014. These market factors and conditions adversely impact our revenues, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and distributable cash flow and could impact us on a long-term basis.We may not be successful in executing our strategy to grow and diversify our business. We rely primarily on the revenues generated from our long-haul natural gas transportation and storage services. As a result, negative developments in these services have significantly greater impact on our financial condition and results of operations than if we maintained more diverse assets. We are pursuing a strategy of growing and diversifying our business through acquisition and development of assets in complementary areas of the midstream energy sector, such as liquids transportation and storage assets, among others. We may not be successful in acquiring or developing such assets or may do so on terms that ultimately are not profitable.In pursuing our growth and diversification strategy, we have been pursuing development (together with a joint venture partner) of a large capital project, which we call our Bluegrass Project, consisting of a pipeline that would deliver NGLs from the Marcellus and Utica shale production areas of Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia to end use markets in the Gulf Coast area, and constructing new fractionation, liquids storage and export facilities located in the Gulf Coast region. We continue to have 13ongoing discussions with potential customers regarding commitments that would support constructing this project and have not made any external commitments to proceed with the project. We may incur substantial costs in developing this or other projects or otherwise pursuing growth and diversification opportunities; however, we can give no assurance that any such project will be completed, in whole or in part, or, if completed, that any such project or acquisition will be on attractive terms or generate a positive return for us.Changes in the prices of natural gas and NGLs impacts supply of and demand for those commodities, which impact our business. The prices of natural gas and NGLs fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors, including: •worldwide economic conditions; •weather conditions, seasonal trends and hurricane disruptions; •the relationship between the available supplies and the demand for natural gas and NGLs; •new supply sources;•the availability of adequate transportation capacity; •storage inventory levels; •the price and availability of oil and other forms of energy; •the effect of energy conservation measures; •the nature and extent of, and changes in, governmental regulation, new regulations adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for example, greenhouse gas legislation and taxation; and •the anticipated future prices of natural gas, oil and other commodities. It is difficult to predict future changes in natural gas and NGLs prices. However, the economic environment that has existed over the last several years generally indicates a bias toward continued downward pressure on natural gas prices. Sustained low natural gas prices could negatively impact producers, including those directly connected to our pipelines that have contracted for capacity with us which could adversely impact our revenues, EBITDA and distributable cash flow. Conversely, future increases in the price of natural gas could make alternative energy sources more competitive and reduce demand for natural gas. A reduced level of demand for natural gas could reduce the utilization of capacity on our systems, reduce the demand for our services and could result in the non-renewal of contracted capacity as contracts expire and affect our midstream businesses.Our revolving credit facility contains operating and financial covenants that restrict our business and financing activities. Our revolving credit facility contains operating and financial covenants that may restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to expand or pursue our business activities. For example, our credit agreement limits our ability to make loans or investments, make material changes to the nature of our business, merge, consolidate or engage in asset sales, or grant liens or make negative pledges. The agreement also requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) of no more than five to one, which limits the amount of additional indebtedness we can incur, including to grow our business, and could require us to prepay indebtedness if our EBITDA decreases to a level that would cause us to breach this covenant. Future financing agreements we may enter into may contain similar or more restrictive covenants or may not be as favorable as those under our existing indebtedness.Our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our credit agreement may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions or our financial performance deteriorate further, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If we are not able to incur additional indebtedness we may need to sell additional equity securities to raise needed capital, which would be dilutive to our existing equity holders, or to seek other sources of funding that may be on terms that materially adversely affect our financial condition or our ability to pay future distributions. If we default under our credit agreement or another financing agreement, significant additional restrictions may become applicable, including a restriction on our ability to make distributions to unitholders. In addition, a default could result in a significant portion of our indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable, and our lenders could terminate their commitment to make further loans to us. In such event, we would not have, and may not be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.14A significant portion of our debt will mature over the next five years and will need to be paid or refinanced.A significant portion of our debt is set to mature in the next five years, including our revolving credit facility. We may not be able to refinance our maturing debt upon commercially reasonable terms, or at all, depending on numerous factors, including our financial condition and prospects at the time and the then current state of the bank and capital markets in the U.S. Further, our liquidity may be adversely affected if we are unable to replace our revolving credit facility upon acceptable terms when it matures.In addition, most of our debt is rated by independent credit rating agencies. Our borrowing costs can be affected by ratings assigned by the rating agencies. In February 2014, two of the major rating agencies that rate our indebtedness lowered our credit ratings, citing the challenges to our business discussed above. These ratings decreases, and any further decrease in our credit ratings, could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult to refinance our debt. Limited access to the debt and equity markets could adversely affect our business.Changes in the debt and equity markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, and interest rate volatility, may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt. Instability in the financial markets may increase our cost of capital while reducing the availability of funds. This may affect our ability to raise capital and reduce the amount of cash available to fund our operations or growth projects. Reduced access to the debt and equity markets could limit our ability to grow our business through acquisitions and growth projects. If the debt and equity markets were not available, it is not certain if other adequate financing options would be available to us on terms and conditions that are acceptable. We have historically relied on our cash flow from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from debt and equity offerings to execute our growth strategy and to meet our financial commitments and other short-term liquidity needs. We cannot be certain that additional capital will be available to us to the extent required and on acceptable terms. Any disruption could require us to take additional measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until we can arrange alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs. Such measures could include reducing or delaying business activities, reducing our operations to lower expenses, and reducing other discretionary uses of cash. We may be unable to execute our growth strategy or take advantage of business opportunities, any of which could negatively impact our business. Changes in the pipeline safety laws and regulations requiring substantial changes to existing integrity management programs or safety technologies could subject us to increased capital and operating costs and require us to use more comprehensive and stringent safety controls.Our pipelines are subject to regulation by PHMSA of the DOT under the NGPSA with respect to natural gas and the HLPSA with respect to NGLs, both as amended. The NGPSA and HLPSA govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of natural gas and NGLs pipeline facilities. These amendments have resulted in the adoption of rules through PHMSA, that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections, correction of identified anomalies and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in high consequence areas, such as high population areas, areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage and commercially navigable waterways. These regulations have resulted in an overall increase in our maintenance costs. Due to recent highly publicized incidents on certain pipelines in the U.S., it is possible that PHMSA may develop more stringent regulations. We could incur significant additional costs if new or more stringent pipeline safety requirements are implemented. The 2011 Act was enacted and signed into law in early 2012. Under the 2011 Act, maximum civil penalties for certain violations have been increased to $200,000 per violation per day, and from a total cap of $1.0 million to $2.0 million. In addition, the 2011 Act reauthorized the federal pipeline safety programs of PHMSA through September 30, 2015, and directs the Secretary of Transportation to undertake a number of reviews, studies and reports, some of which may result in additional natural gas and hazardous liquids pipeline safety rulemaking in 2014 or soon thereafter. A number of the provisions of the 2011 Act have the potential to cause owners and operators of pipeline facilities to incur significant capital expenditures and/or operating costs. Further, we have entered into firm transportation contracts with shippers which utilize the design capacity of certain of our pipeline assets, assuming that we operate those pipeline assets at higher than normal operating pressures (up to 0.80 of the pipeline's SMYS). We have authority from PHMSA to operate those pipeline assets at such higher pressures, however PHMSA retains discretion to withdraw or modify this authority. If PHMSA were to withdraw or materially modify such authority, we may not be able to transport all of our contracted quantities of natural gas on our pipeline assets and could incur significant additional costs to re-obtain such authority or to develop alternate ways to meet our contractual obligations.15Our natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to extensive regulation by FERC, including rules and regulations related to the rates we can charge for our services and our ability to construct or abandon facilities. FERC's rate-making policies could limit our ability to recover the full cost of operating our pipelines, including earning a reasonable return.Our natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to extensive regulation by FERC, including the types and terms of services we may offer to our customers, construction of new facilities, creation, modification or abandonment of services or facilities, recordkeeping and relationships with affiliated companies. FERC action in any of these areas could adversely affect our ability to compete for business, construct new facilities, offer new services or recover the full cost of operating our pipelines. This regulatory oversight can result in longer lead times to develop and complete any future project than competitors that are not subject to FERC's regulations. FERC can also deny us the right to remove certain facilities from service.FERC also regulates the rates we can charge for our natural gas transportation and storage operations. For our cost-based services, FERC establishes both the maximum and minimum rates we can charge. The basic elements that FERC considers are the costs of providing service, the volumes of gas being transported, the rate design, the allocation of costs between services, the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn. We may not be able to recover all of our costs, including certain costs associated with pipeline integrity, through existing or future rates. FERC can challenge the existing rates on any of our pipelines. Such a challenge against us could adversely affect our ability to charge rates that would cover future increases in our costs or even to continue to collect rates to maintain our current revenue levels that are designed to permit a reasonable opportunity to recover current costs and depreciation and earn a reasonable return. If any of our pipelines under FERC jurisdiction were to file a rate case, or if they have to defend their rates in a proceeding commenced by FERC, we would be required, among other things, to establish that the inclusion of an income tax allowance in our cost of service is just and reasonable. Under current FERC policy, since we are a limited partnership and do not pay U.S. federal income taxes, this would require us to show that our unitholders (or their ultimate owners) are subject to federal income taxation. To support such a showing, our general partner may elect to require owners of our units to re-certify their status as being subject to U.S. federal income taxation on the income generated by us or we may attempt to provide other evidence. We can provide no assurance that the evidence we might provide to FERC will be sufficient to establish that our unitholders (or their ultimate owners) are subject to U.S. federal income tax liability on the income generated by our jurisdictional pipelines. If we are unable to make such a showing, FERC could disallow a substantial portion of the income tax allowance included in the determination of the maximum rates that may be charged by our pipelines, which could result in a reduction of such maximum rates from current levels.Investments that we make, whether through acquisitions, growth projects or joint ventures, that appear to be accretive may nevertheless reduce our distributable cash flows.Our future growth depends on our ability to grow and diversify our business by among other things, investing in assets through acquisitions or joint ventures and organic growth projects. Our ability to grow, diversify and increase distributable cash flows will depend, in part, on our ability to close and execute on accretive acquisitions and projects. Any such transaction involves potential risks that may include, among other things: •the diversion of management's and employees' attention from other business concerns;•inaccurate assumptions about volume, revenues and project costs, including potential synergies;•a decrease in our liquidity as a result of our using available cash or borrowing capacity to finance the acquisition or project;•a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance the acquisition or project;•inaccurate assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt;•an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate the acquired business and assets or the developed assets;•unforeseen difficulties operating in new product areas or new geographic areas; and•changes in regulatory requirements or delays of regulatory approvals.Additionally, acquisitions contain the following risks:•an inability to integrate successfully the businesses we acquire;16•the assumption of unknown liabilities for which we are not indemnified, for which our indemnity is inadequate or for which our insurance policies may exclude from coverage;•limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller; and•customer or key employee losses of an acquired business.There is no certainty that we will be able to complete these acquisitions or projects on schedule, on budget or at all. Our business requires the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce and the loss of such workforce could result in the failure to implement our business plans. Our operations and management require the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce including engineers, technical personnel and other professionals. We compete with other companies for this skilled workforce. In addition, many of our current employees are approaching retirement age and have significant institutional knowledge that must be transferred to other employees. If we are unable to (a) retain our current employees, (b) successfully complete the knowledge transfer and/or (c) recruit new employees of comparable knowledge and experience, our business could be negatively impacted. In addition, we could experience increased costs to retain and recruit these professionals.A failure in our computer systems or a cyber security attack on any of our facilities, or those of third parties, may affect adversely our ability to operate our business.We have become more reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our businesses. Our businesses are dependent upon our operational and financial computer systems to process the data necessary to conduct almost all aspects of our business, including the operation of our pipeline and storage facilities and the recording and reporting of commercial and financial transactions. Any failure of our computer systems, or those of our customers, suppliers or others with whom we do business, could materially disrupt our ability to operate our business. It has been reported that unknown entities or groups have mounted so-called “cyber attacks” on businesses and other organizations solely to disable or disrupt computer systems, disrupt operations and, in some cases, steal data. Any cyber attacks that affect our facilities, or those of our customers, suppliers or others with whom we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause us a financial loss and/or damage our reputation. We are exposed to credit risk relating to nonperformance by our customers. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations. Our exposure generally relates to receivables for services provided, future performance under firm agreements and volumes of gas or other products owed by customers for imbalances or product loaned by us to them under certain of our services. For our FERC-regulated business, our tariffs only allow us to require limited credit support in the event that our transportation customers are unable to pay for our services. If any of our significant customers have credit or financial problems which result in a delay or failure to pay for services provided by us or contracted for with us, or to repay the product they owe us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, as contracts expire, the credit or financial failure of any of our customers could also result in the non-renewal of contracted capacity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Item 7A of this Report contains more information on credit risk arising from products loaned to customers. We depend on certain key customers for a significant portion of our revenues. The loss of any of these key customers could result in a decline in our revenues. We rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of revenues. Our largest customer in terms of revenue, Devon Gas Services, LP, represented over 11% of our 2013 revenues. Our top ten customers comprised approximately 46% of our revenues in 2013. We may be unable to negotiate extensions or replacements of contracts with key customers on favorable terms which could materially reduce our contracted transportation volumes and the rates we can charge for our services. 17Failure to comply with existing or new environmental laws or regulations or an accidental release of pollutants into the environment may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities.Our operations are subject to extensive federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment. These laws include, for example, the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Clean Water Act, CERCLA, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and analogous state laws. These laws and regulations may restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, including requiring the acquisition of permits or other approvals to conduct regulated activities, restricting the manner in which we dispose of wastes, requiring remedial action to remove or mitigate contamination resulting from a spill or other release, requiring capital expenditures to comply with pollution control requirements, and imposing substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could result in increased operating and capital costs and reduced demand for our pipeline and storage services.The U.S. Congress and the EPA as well as some states and regional groupings of states have in recent years considered legislation or regulations to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). These efforts have included cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes and GHG reporting and tracking programs. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, demand for our services, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHG in the atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climate events that could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.We compete with other energy companies.The principal elements of competition among pipeline systems are availability of capacity, rates, terms of service, access to supplies, flexibility and reliability of service. Additionally, FERC's policies promote competition in natural gas markets by increasing the number of natural gas transportation options available to our customer base. Increased competition could reduce the volumes of product we transport or store or, in instances where we do not have long-term contracts with fixed rates, could cause us to decrease the transportation or storage rates we can charge our customers. Competition could intensify the negative impact of factors that adversely affect the demand for our services, such as adverse economic conditions, weather, higher fuel costs and taxes or other regulatory actions that increase the cost, or limit the use, of products we transport and store. Our operations are subject to catastrophic losses, operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be adequately insured. There are a variety of operating risks inherent in our transportation and storage operations such as leaks and other forms of releases, explosions, fires and mechanical problems. Additionally, the nature and location of our business may make us susceptible to catastrophic losses from hurricanes or other named storms, particularly with regard to our assets in the Gulf Coast region, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, and severe winter weather. Any of these or other similar occurrences could result in the disruption of our operations, substantial repair costs, personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial financial losses. The location of pipelines near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could significantly increase the level of damages resulting from some of these risks. We currently possess property, business interruption and general liability insurance, but proceeds from such insurance coverage may not be adequate for all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost. Moreover, such insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable costs and terms. The insurance coverage we do obtain may contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain hazards or all potential losses. 18Possible terrorist activities or military actions could adversely affect our business. The continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the U.S. and its allies might lead to increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in prices for natural gas, which could affect the markets for our natural gas transportation and storage services. While we are taking steps that we believe are appropriate to increase the security of our assets, we may not be able to completely secure our assets or completely protect them against a terrorist attack. Partnership Structure RisksOur general partner and its affiliates own a controlling interest in us, have conflicts of interest and owe us only limited fiduciary duties, which may permit them to favor their own interests.BPHC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Loews, owns approximately 53% of our equity interests, excluding the IDRs, and owns and controls our general partner, which controls us. Although our general partner has a fiduciary duty to manage us in a manner beneficial to us and our unitholders, the directors and officers of our general partner have a fiduciary duty to manage our general partner in a manner beneficial to BPHC. Furthermore, certain directors and officers of our general partner are also directors or officers of affiliates of our general partner. Conflicts of interest may arise between BPHC and its subsidiaries, including our general partner, on the one hand, and us and our unitholders, on the other hand. In resolving these conflicts, our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of our unitholders. These potential conflicts include, among others, the following situations: •BPHC and its affiliates may engage in competition with us;•neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires BPHC or its affiliates (other than our general partner) to pursue a business strategy that favors us. Directors and officers of BPHC and its affiliates have a fiduciary duty to make decisions in the best interest of BPHC shareholders, which may be contrary to our interests;•our general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us, such as BPHC and its affiliates, in resolving conflicts of interest, which has the effect of limiting its fiduciary duty to our unitholders;•some officers of our general partner who provide services to us may devote time to affiliates of our general partner and may be compensated for services rendered to such affiliates;•our partnership agreement limits the liability and reduces the fiduciary duties of our general partner and the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that, without these limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. By purchasing common units, unitholders are consenting to some actions and conflicts of interest that might otherwise constitute a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable law;•our general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, borrowings, repayments of indebtedness, issuances of additional partnership securities and cash reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is available for distribution to our unitholders;•our general partner determines the amount and timing of any capital expenditures and whether an expenditure is for maintenance capital, which reduces operating surplus, or a capital improvement expenditure, which does not. Such determination can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders;•in some instances, our general partner may cause us to borrow funds in order to permit the payment of cash distributions, even if the purpose or effect of the borrowing is to make incentive distributions;•our general partner determines which costs, including allocated overhead, incurred by it and its affiliates are reimbursable by us;•our partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered on terms that are fair and reasonable to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf, and provides that reimbursement to Loews for amounts allocable to us consistent with accounting and allocation methodologies generally permitted by FERC for rate-making purposes and past business practices is deemed fair and reasonable to us;•our general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by it and its affiliates;•our general partner intends to limit its liability regarding our contractual obligations;•our general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us; and19•our general partner may exercise its rights to call and purchase (1) all of our common units if, at any time, it and its affiliates own more than 80% of the outstanding common units or (2) all of our equity securities (including common units), if it and its affiliates own more than 50% in the aggregate of the outstanding common units and any other classes of equity securities and it receives an opinion of outside legal counsel to the effect that our being a pass-through entity for tax purposes has or is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the maximum applicable rates we can charge our customers.Our partnership agreement limits our general partner's fiduciary duties to unitholders and restricts the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. Our partnership agreement contains provisions that reduce the standards to which our general partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement: •permits our general partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to its capacity as our general partner. This entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires, and it has no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting us, our affiliates or any limited partner. Decisions made by our general partner in its individual capacity will be made by a majority of the owners of our general partner, and not by the board of directors of our general partner. Examples of these kinds of decisions include the exercise of its call rights, its voting rights with respect to the units it owns and its registration rights and the determination of whether to consent to any merger or consolidation of the partnership; •provides that our general partner shall not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as general partner so long as it acted in good faith, meaning it believed that the decisions were in the best interests of the partnership; •generally provides that affiliate transactions and resolutions of conflicts of interest not approved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner and not involving a vote of unitholders must be on terms no less favorable to us than those generally provided to or available from unrelated third parties or be “fair and reasonable” to us and that, in determining whether a transaction or resolution is “fair and reasonable,” our general partner may consider the totality of the relationships between the parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly advantageous or beneficial to us; and •provides that our general partner and its officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us, our limited partners or assignees for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the general partner or those other persons acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct. We have a holding company structure in which our subsidiaries conduct our operations and own our operating assets, which may affect our ability to make distributions. We are a partnership holding company and our operating subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own all of our operating assets. We have no significant assets other than the ownership interests in our subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to make distributions to our unitholders depends on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to us. The ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us may be restricted by, among other things, the provisions of existing and future indebtedness, applicable state partnership and limited liability company laws and other laws and regulations, including FERC policies. Tax Risks Our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, as well as our not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation by individual states. If the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, or if we were to become subject to additional amounts of entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, then our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced. The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Despite the fact that we are a limited partnership under Delaware law, we would be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes unless we satisfy a “qualifying income” requirement. Based upon our current operations, we believe we 20satisfy the qualifying income requirement. Failing to meet the qualifying income requirement or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity.If we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 35%, and would likely pay additional state income tax at varying rates. Distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses, deductions or credits would flow through to our unitholders. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced. Thus, treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flows and after-tax return to our unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units. Our partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to a material amount of entity-level taxation for federal, state or local income tax purposes, the target distribution amounts will be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us. At the state level, several states have been evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise, or other forms of taxation. Imposition of a similar tax on us in the jurisdictions in which we operate or in other jurisdictions to which we may expand could substantially reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders.The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.The present federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations at any time. For example, from time to time, members of Congress propose and consider substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships. One such legislative proposal would have eliminated the qualifying income exception to the treatment of all publicly traded partnerships as corporations, upon which we rely for our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will be reintroduced or will ultimately be enacted. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units. Any modification to the federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible to meet the exception for certain publicly traded partnerships to be treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. If the IRS contests the federal income tax positions we take, the market for our common units may be adversely impacted and the costs of any IRS contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders. The IRS may adopt positions that differ from the positions that we take. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take. A court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take. Any contest with the IRS may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the price at which they trade. Our costs of any contest by the IRS will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner, because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders. Our unitholders will be required to pay taxes on their share of our taxable income even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us. Unitholders will be required to pay federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes on their share of our taxable income, whether or not they receive cash distributions from us. Unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to such unitholders' share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from such unitholders' share of our taxable income. 21Tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected. If our unitholders sell their common units, they will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and their tax basis in those common units. Because distributions in excess of a unitholder's allocable share of our net taxable income result in a decrease to such unitholder's tax basis in their common units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the units they sell will, in effect, become taxable income to the unitholder if they sell such units at a price greater than their tax basis in those units, even if the price they receive is less than their original cost. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing a gain, may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture of depreciation deductions and certain other items. In addition, because the amount realized includes a unitholder's share of our nonrecourse liabilities, if our unitholders sell their units, they may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash they receive from the sale.Tax-exempt entities and non-U.S. persons face unique tax issues from owning common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them. Investments in common units by tax-exempt entities, such as employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts (known as "IRAs") and non-U.S. persons, raises issues unique to them. For example, virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax, including IRAs and other retirement plans, will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them. Allocations and/or distributions to non-U.S. persons will be reduced by withholding taxes imposed at the highest effective tax rate applicable to non-U.S. persons, and each non-U.S. person will be required to file federal tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income. If you are a tax exempt entity or a non-U.S. person, you should consult your tax advisor before investing in our common units. We will treat each purchaser of common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units. Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units and because of other reasons, we will adopt depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform with all aspects of existing Treasury Regulations. A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to our unitholders. It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from a unitholder's sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders' tax returns. We prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first business day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.We generally prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first business day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing Treasury Regulations. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued proposed Treasury Regulations that provide a safe harbor pursuant to which a publicly traded partnership may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to allocate tax items among transferor and transferee unitholders. If the IRS were to successfully challenge our proration method or new Treasury Regulations were issued, we may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.A unitholder whose units are the subject of a securities loan, (e.g., a loan to a “short seller” to cover a short sale of units) may be considered as having disposed of those units. If so, the unitholder would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition.Because there are no specific rules governing the federal income tax consequences of loaning a partnership interest, a unitholder whose units are the subject of a securities loan may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units. In that case, the unitholder may no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their units.22We have adopted certain valuation methodologies that may result in a shift of income, gain, loss and deduction between the general partner and the unitholders. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units. When we issue additional units or engage in certain other transactions, we determine the fair market value of our assets and allocate any unrealized gain or loss attributable to our assets to the capital accounts of our unitholders and our general partner. Our methodology may be viewed as understating the value of our assets. In that case, there may be a shift of income, gain, loss and deduction between certain unitholders and the general partner, which may be unfavorable to such unitholders. Moreover, under our valuation methods, subsequent purchasers of common units may have a greater portion of their Internal Revenue Code Section 743(b) adjustment allocated to our tangible assets and a lesser portion allocated to our intangible assets. The IRS may challenge our valuation methods, or our allocation of the Section 743(b) adjustment attributable to our tangible and intangible assets and allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction between the general partner and certain of our unitholders. A successful IRS challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders. It also could affect the amount of gain from our unitholders' sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders' tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions.The sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profit interests during any twelve-month period will result in the termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes. We will be considered to have terminated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a twelve-month period. For purposes of determining whether the 50% threshold has been met, multiple sales of the same interest will be counted only once. Our termination would, among other things, result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders, which would result in us filing two tax returns for one calendar year, and may result in a significant deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income. In the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a calendar year, the closing of our taxable year may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being includable in his taxable income for the year of termination. Our termination currently would not affect our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, but it would result in our being treated as a new partnership for tax purposes. If we were treated as a new partnership, we would be required to make new tax elections and could be subject to penalties if we were unable to determine that a termination occurred. The IRS has recently announced a relief procedure whereby a publicly traded partnership that has technically terminated may be permitted to provide only a single Schedule K-1 to unitholders for the two tax years within the fiscal year in which the termination occurs. Our unitholders may be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements as a result of investing in our common units. In addition to federal income taxes, our unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes, including state and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or own property now or in the future, even if our unitholders do not reside in any of those jurisdictions. Our unitholders will likely be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions. Further, unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. We conduct business in thirteen states. We may own property or conduct business in other states or foreign countries in the future. It is our unitholders' responsibility to file all federal, state and local tax returns. 23Item 1B.
