Item 1A. RISK FACTORSOur business exposes us to certain risks. The following is a discussion of what we currently believe are the most significant risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or the value of our common stock.The slow pace of the economic recovery could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations or market price of our stock. 15The national economy and the financial services sector in particular, are still facing significant challenges. Substantially all of our loans are to businesses and individuals in northern, southwestern and south central Idaho, eastern Washington and southwestern Oregon. These markets continue to face many of the same challenges as the national economy, including continued relatively high levels of unemployment and a slow recovery in commercial and residential real estate. Although some economic indicators are moderately improved both nationally and in the markets we serve, unemployment remains high and there remains substantial uncertainty regarding when and how strongly a sustained economic recovery will occur. A further deterioration in economic conditions in the nation as a whole or in the markets we serve could result in the following consequences, any of which could have an adverse impact, which may be material, on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and could also cause the market price of our stock to decline:•economic conditions may worsen, increasing the likelihood of credit defaults by borrowers;•loan collateral values, especially as they relate to commercial and residential real estate, may decline, thereby increasing the severity of loss in the event of loan defaults;•nonperforming assets and write-downs of assets underlying troubled credits could adversely affect our earnings;•demand for banking products and services may decline, including services for low cost and non-interest-bearing deposits; and•changes and volatility in interest rates may negatively impact the yields on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses, which could adversely affect our earnings.We maintain an allowance for loan losses in an amount that we believe is adequate to provide for losses inherent in our loan portfolio. While we strive to carefully manage and monitor credit quality and to identify loans that may be deteriorating, at any time there are loans included in the portfolio that may result in losses, but that have not yet been identified as potential problem loans. Through established credit practices, we attempt to identify deteriorating loans and adjust the loan loss reserve accordingly. However, because future events are uncertain, there may be loans that deteriorate in an accelerated time frame. As a result, future additions to the allowance may be necessary. Because the loan portfolio contains a number of loans with relatively large balances, deterioration in the credit quality of one or more of these loans may require a significant increase to the allowance for loan losses. Future additions to the allowance may also be required based on changes in the financial condition of borrowers, such as have resulted due to the current economic conditions or as a result of actual events turning out differently than forecasted in the assumptions we use to determine the allowance for loan losses. With respect to real estate loans and property taken in satisfaction of such loans (“other real estate owned” or “OREO”), we can be required to recognize significant declines in the value of the underlying real estate collateral or OREO quite suddenly as new appraisals are performed in the normal course of monitoring the credit quality of the loans. Our ability to recover on real estate loans by selling or disposing of the underlying real estate collateral is adversely impacted by declining appraised values, which increases the likelihood we will suffer losses on defaulted loans beyond the amounts provided for in the allowance for loan losses. This, in turn, could require material increases in our provision for loan losses.Additionally, federal banking regulators, as an integral part of their supervisory function, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. These regulatory agencies may require us to recognize further loan loss provisions or charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may be different from ours. Any increase in the allowance for loan losses would have a negative effect, which may be material, on our financial condition and results of operations.Additional provisions for credit loss may be necessary to supplement the allowance for loan and lease losses in the future, which could affect our financial condition.We have incurred significant losses in recent years. While there has been continued improvement in the quality of our loan portfolio and a corresponding improvement in operating results, economic conditions remain uncertain. As such, significant additional provisions for credit losses may be necessary to supplement the allowance for loan and lease losses in the future, which could cause us to incur a net loss in the future and could adversely affect the price of, and market for, our common stock.Concentration in real estate loans and any further deterioration in the real estate markets we serve could require material increases in our allowance for loan losses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.The sluggish recovery of the economy continues to affect our market areas. At December 31, 2013, 62.4% of our loans were secured with real estate as the primary collateral. Any further deterioration or a continued slow recovery in the local economies we serve could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations due to a weakening of our borrowers' ability to repay these loans and a decline in the value of the collateral securing them. In light of the continuing effects of the recent economic downturn, real estate values have been significantly affected. As we have experienced, significant declines in real estate collateral can occur quite suddenly as new appraisals are performed in the normal course of monitoring the credit quality of the loan. This, in turn, could require material increases in our allowance for loan losses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, perhaps materially. 16Our ability to receive dividends from our banking subsidiary accounts for most of our revenue and could affect our liquidity and ability to pay future dividends.We are a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking subsidiary, Panhandle State Bank. We receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from our banking subsidiary. Under normal circumstances, these dividends are the principal source of funds to fund holding company expenses and pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and principal and interest on our outstanding debt. The other primary sources of liquidity for the parent Company are capital or borrowings. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay us. For example, Idaho law limits a bank's ability to pay dividends subject to surplus reserve requirements. Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors. Limitations on our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiary could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and on our ability to pay future dividends on common or preferred stock. Additionally, if our subsidiary's earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels, we may not be able to make future dividend payments to our common and preferred shareholders or principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt.As of December 31, 2013 we are current on our dividend payments on our trust preferred securities. However, in the future, if we do not make payments on our trust preferred securities for over 20 consecutive quarters, we could be in default under those securities.A tightening of credit markets and liquidity risk could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.A tightening of the credit markets or any inability to obtain adequate funds for continued loan growth at an acceptable cost could negatively affect our asset growth and liquidity position and, therefore, our earnings capability. In addition to core deposit growth, maturity of investment securities and loan payments, the Bank also relies on alternative funding sources including unsecured borrowing lines with correspondent banks, borrowing lines with the Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank, public time certificates of deposits and out of area and brokered time certificates of deposit. Our ability to access these sources could be impaired by deterioration in our financial condition as well as factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations for the financial services industry or serious dislocation in the general credit markets. In the event such disruption should occur, our ability to access these sources could be negatively affected, both as to price and availability, which would limit, and/or potentially raise the cost of, the funds available to the Company. The FDIC has increased insurance premiums and imposed special assessments to rebuild and maintain the federal deposit insurance fund, and any additional future premium increases or special assessments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The Dodd-Frank Act broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments and assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act established 1.35% as the minimum deposit insurance fund reserve ratio. The FDIC has determined that the fund reserve ratio should be 2.0% and has adopted a plan under which it will meet the statutory minimum fund reserve ratio of 1.35% by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2020. Although the Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with assets less than $10 billion of the increase in the statutory minimum fund reserve ratio to 1.35% from the former statutory minimum of 1.15%, the overall impact may result in an increase in the deposit insurance assessments to be paid by the Company.On February 7, 2011, the FDIC issued final rules, effective April 1, 2011, implementing changes to the assessment rules resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act. The adopted regulations: (1) modify the definition of an institution's deposit insurance assessment base; (2) alter certain adjustments to the assessment rates; (3) revise the assessment rate schedules in light of the new assessment base and altered adjustments; and (4) provide for the automatic adjustment of the assessment rates in the future when the reserve ratio reaches certain milestones.Despite the FDIC's actions to restore the deposit insurance fund, the fund will suffer additional losses in the future due to failures of insured institutions. There may be additional significant deposit insurance premium increases, special assessments or prepayments in order to restore the insurance fund's reserve ratio. Any significant premium increases or special assessments could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.We may be required, in the future, to recognize impairment with respect to investment securities, including the FHLB stock we hold.Our available-for-sale securities portfolio has decreased to $251.6 million at December 31, 2013 or 26.8% of our assets from $280.2 million at December 31, 2012 or 28.8% of our assets. This decrease is largely because of the principal payments on our mortgage-backed securities portfolio, moving a portion of our available-for sale portfolio to held-to-maturity, and adding new investments to the held-to-maturity portfolio. Our securities portfolio contains whole loan private mortgage-backed securities and currently includes securities with unrecognized losses. The national downturn in real estate markets and elevated mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates have increased credit losses in the portfolio of loans underlying these securities and resulted in 17substantial discounts in their market values. Any further deterioration in the loans underlying these securities and resulting market discounts could lead to other-than-temporary impairment in the value of these investments. We evaluate the securities portfolio for any other-than-temporary impairment each reporting period, as required by generally accepted accounting principles, and as of December 31, 2013, no securities had been determined to be other than temporarily impaired (“OTTI”). Future evaluations of our securities portfolio may require us to recognize additional impairment charges with respect to other holdings. For example, it is possible that government-sponsored programs to allow mortgages to be refinanced to lower rates could materially adversely impact the yield on our portfolio of mortgage-backed securities, since a significant portion of our investment portfolio is composed of such securities.In addition, as a condition to membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle (“FHLB”), we are required to purchase and hold a certain amount of FHLB stock. Our stock purchase requirement is based, in part, upon the outstanding principal balance of advances from the FHLB. At December 31, 2013, we had stock in the FHLB of Seattle totaling $2.2 million. The FHLB stock held by us is carried at cost and is subject to recoverability testing under applicable accounting standards. The FHLB recently began paying dividends on the stock again, and it has been repurchasing stock since mid 2012. As of December 31, 2013, we did not recognize an impairment charge related to our FHLB stock holdings. However, future negative changes to the financial condition of the FHLB may require us to recognize an impairment charge with respect to FHLB stock. Recent levels of market volatility were unprecedented and we cannot predict whether they will return.The capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption from time-to-time over the last several years, at times reaching unprecedented levels. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain companies without regard to those companies' underlying financial strength. If similar levels of market disruption and volatility return, we may experience various adverse effects, which may be material, on our ability to access capital and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We operate in a highly regulated environment and we cannot predict the effects of recent and pending federal legislation.We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities. As a publicly traded company, we are subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, we began trading our stock on the NASDAQ stock exchange on January 9, 2013 and are therefore subject to additional regulations. Any change in applicable regulations or federal, state or local legislation, or in policies or interpretations or regulatory approaches to compliance and enforcement, income tax laws and accounting principles, could have a substantial impact on us and our operations. Changes in laws and regulations may also increase our expenses by imposing additional fees or taxes or restrictions on our operations. Additional legislation and regulations that could significantly affect our powers, authority and operations may be enacted or adopted in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Failure to appropriately comply with any such laws, regulations or principles could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies or damage to our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.In that regard, sweeping financial regulatory reform legislation was enacted in July 2010. Among other provisions, the legislation (i) created a new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection with broad powers to regulate consumer financial products such as credit cards and mortgages, (ii) created a Financial Stability Oversight Council comprised of the heads of other regulatory agencies, (iii) will lead to new capital requirements from federal banking agencies, (iv) places new limits on electronic debit card interchange fees, and (v) requires the Securities and Exchange Commission and national stock exchanges to adopt significant new corporate governance and executive compensation reforms. The third installment of the Basel Accords (the “Basel III”) for U.S. financial institutions is expected to be phased in between 2013 and 2019. Basel III sets forth more robust global regulatory standards on capital adequacy, qualifying capital instruments, leverage ratios, market liquidity risk, and stress testing, which may be stricter than standards currently in place. The implementation of these new standards could have an adverse impact on our financial position and future earnings due to, among other things, the increased minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirements that will be implemented. The new legislation and regulations are expected to increase the overall costs of regulatory compliance.Further, regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws or regulations by financial institutions and holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. Recently, these powers have been utilized more frequently due to the serious national, regional and local economic conditions we are facing. The exercise of regulatory authority may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, our business is affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. federal government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board.We cannot predict the full effects of recent legislation or the various other governmental, regulatory, monetary and fiscal initiatives which have been and may be enacted on the financial markets generally, or on the Company and on the Bank specifically. The terms and costs of these activities, or the failure of these actions to help stabilize the financial markets, asset prices, market 18liquidity and a continuation or worsening of current financial market and economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock.Changes in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements.From time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be very difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements. Fluctuating interest rates could adversely affect our profitability and the market value of our investment securities portfolio.Our profitability is dependent to a large extent upon our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and interest paid on deposits, borrowings, and other interest-bearing liabilities. Because of the differences in maturities and re-pricing characteristics of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Accordingly, fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest margin, and, in turn, our profitability. We manage our interest rate risk within established guidelines and generally seek an asset and liability structure that insulates net interest income from large deviations attributable to changes in market rates. However, our interest rate risk management practices may not be effective in a highly volatile rate environment.The current unusual interest rate environment poses particular challenges. Market rates remain low right now and the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that it will likely maintain low short-term interest rates for the foreseeable future. The Federal Reserve is also purchasing significant amounts of Treasury and Agency bonds in the public market, lowering yields on these instruments and on most other longer-term fixed income instruments as well. This extended period of low rates, when combined with keen competition for high-quality borrowers, may cause additional downward pressure on the yield on the Company's loan and investment portfolios. In addition, low rates accelerate prepayment rates on our mortgage-backed securities, which also negatively impacts yields. Since the Company's cost of interest-bearing liabilities is already at record lows, the impact of decreasing asset yields may have a more adverse impact on the Company's net interest income.In addition, the current low level of market rates poses risk to the value of our investment securities portfolio, and as a result, our capital levels. Any increase in rates, and particularly a significant increase, will have a negative impact on the market value of the Company's available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. Since this portfolio is carried at market value on the balance sheet, a reduction in its value will reduce the Company's capital levels. Alternatively, attempts to mitigate this risk by shortening the duration of the portfolio or purchasing more variable rate securities will have an adverse impact on current earnings, because current yields are low. We face strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services.The banking and financial services businesses in our market area are highly competitive and increased competition may adversely impact the level of our loans and deposits. Ultimately, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. These competitors include national banks, foreign banks, regional banks, and other community banks. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, and other financial intermediaries. In particular, our competitors include both major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns, and credit unions, whose tax-advantaged status allow them to compete aggressively. Areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits, efforts to obtain loan and deposit customers, and a range in quality of products and services provided, including new technology-driven products and services. If we are unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may be unable to maintain or grow our loans or deposits.We may not be able to successfully implement our internal growth strategy.Over the long-term, we have pursued and intend to continue to pursue an internal growth strategy, the success of which will depend primarily on generating an increasing level of loans and deposits at acceptable risk levels and terms without proportionate increases in non-interest expenses. We may not be successful in implementing our internal growth strategy. Furthermore, the success of our growth strategy will depend on maintaining sufficient regulatory capital levels and on favorable economic conditions in our market areas.Unexpected losses, our inability to successfully implement our tax planning strategies in future reporting periods, or IRS Section 382 limitations resulting from the successful completion of the 2012 capital raise may require us to establish a tax valuation allowance in the future. 19At December 31, 2013, we maintained $21.7 million in net deferred income tax assets, of which $13.5 million was related to net operating losses sustained in 2009, 2010, and 2012. We evaluate our deferred income tax assets for recoverability based on all available evidence. This process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws, our ability to successfully implement tax planning strategies, or variances between our future projected operating performance and our actual results. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets may not be realized. In determining the more-likely-than-not criterion, we evaluate all positive and negative available evidence as of the end of each reporting period. In this regard, we had maintained a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets until its reversal at the end of 2013. The potential establishment of a new deferred income tax asset valuation allowance in the future will be determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred income tax assets. The realization of the deferred income tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law. Due to the significant estimates involved in evaluating the future recoverability of the deferred tax assets, it is possible that we will be required to establish a new valuation allowance in future reporting periods that would materially reduce our capital ratios. Such a charge could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and capital position.The future annual recoverability of tax benefits resulting from net operating loss carryforwards is also limited by the sale of securities pursuant to the Purchase Agreements that were executed in 2012 to raise capital, because such sale caused an “ownership change”, as defined in IRC Section 382. These IRC Section 382 limitations will impact the timing of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. We are subject to a variety of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal risk and compliance risk, and the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.We are exposed to many types of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems.If personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information of customers in our possession were to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties.Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. Our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions and our large transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. We may also be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages, or natural disasters, disease pandemics or other damage to property or physical assets) which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. We are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as we are) and to the risk that we (or our vendors') business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. The occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability of us to operate our business (for example, by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect), as well as potential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, perhaps materially.A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems, or those of our third party service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.As a financial institution, the Company's operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Any failure, interruption or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our online banking system, customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit and loan servicing and other systems. The security and integrity of our systems could be threatened by a variety of interruptions or information security breaches, including those caused by computer hacking, cyber attacks, electronic fraudulent activity or attempted theft of financial assets. We cannot assure you that any such failures, interruption or security breaches will not occur, or if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. While we have certain protective policies and procedures in place, the nature and sophistication of the threats continue to evolve. The Company may be required to expend significant additional resources in the future to modify and enhance our protective measures. 20Additionally, we face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems. Two examples highlight the risk and exposure currently facing the Company and all financial institutions:•In 2012, the computer system of one of the Company's customers was hacked into and the online banking system compromised. As a result, the hacker was able to electronically deposit fraudulent funds into the account and simultaneously electronically withdraw those funds. While the Company was able to recover the majority of the funds through its own collection efforts and from its insurance, the Company still incurred a loss as a result of the breach of the customer's computer. In response, the Company further tightened its online banking system security by installing and implementing additional security technology, resulting in additional costs and more complex customer processing requirements.•As is currently common in the industry, the Company is also frequently notified by its own third-party providers and other unaffiliated data networks of potential breaches of customer's debit and credit card account information. In some cases, only the account number is breached, and in others, more detailed and specific identifying information is released. In the final months of 2013, one large regional retailer and one large national retailer suffered breaches of their customers' debit and credit card data. Because we issued cards to customers who were impacted by these breaches, we suffered additional loss and expense in closing and replacing the impacted cards. Depending on the type of information that is released, the Company generally informs the impacted customers, closes the impacted accounts, reimburses any loss suffered by the customers, and/or provides recommendations on other potential actions customers can take. The actions taken result in added cost for the Company and its customers, and may negatively impact the reputation of the Company and the broader financial industry. As highlighted in the examples above, any failures, interruptions or security breaches in our information systems could damage our reputation, result in additional operating losses or loss of customer business, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, or expose us to civil litigation, regulatory fines or losses not covered by insurance. As a result of the transactions completed by the securities purchase agreements dated January 23, 2012 with certain investors ("Purchase Agreements"), Castle Creek Capital Partners IV, L.P. (“Castle Creek”) and affiliates of Stadium Capital Management LLC (“Stadium”) became substantial holders of our Common Stock.Upon the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreements, Castle Creek and Stadium each became holders of a 33.3% ownership interest, and 9.9% and 14.9% voting interest, respectively, in Intermountain (after giving effect to the exercise of certain warrants issued thereby). Each of these two companies have a representative on our board and each has a representative on the Bank's Board of Directors. Although Castle Creek and Stadium each entered into certain passivity agreements with the Federal Reserve in connection with their investments in us, Castle Creek and Stadium each have substantial influence over our corporate policy and business strategy. In pursuing their economic interests, Castle Creek and Stadium may have interests that are different from the interests of our other shareholders.Resales of our Common Shares in the public market may cause the market price of our Common Shares to fall.We issued a large number of shares of Common Stock and securities that have converted into Non-Voting Common Stock to the investors pursuant to the Purchase Agreements. The investors have certain registration rights with respect to the shares of Common Stock held by them. The registration rights for certain Investors will allow them to sell their shares without compliance with the volume and manner of sale limitations under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act. The market value of our Common Stock could decline as a result of sales by the Investors from time to time of a substantial amount of the shares of Common Stock held by them.The market for our Common Stock historically has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations.The market for our Common Stock historically has experienced and may continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations similar to those experienced by the broader stock market in recent years. Generally, the fluctuations experienced by the broader stock market have affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and may adversely affect the price of our Common Stock. In addition, our announcements of our quarterly operating results, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets and other developments affecting us, our affiliates or our competitors could cause the market price of our Common Stock to fluctuate substantially.We may pursue additional capital in the future, which could dilute the holders of our outstanding Common Stock and may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. 21Although we recently completed a significant capital raise, in the current economic environment we may consider alternatives for raising capital when opportunities to raise capital at attractive prices present themselves, in order to further strengthen our capital and better position ourselves to take advantage of opportunities that may arise in the future. Such alternatives may include issuance and sale of common stock or preferred stock, or borrowings by the Company, with proceeds contributed to the Bank. Any such capital raising alternatives could dilute the holders of our outstanding common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our common stock is subordinate to our indebtedness and preferred stock.Shares of our common stock are equity interests in the Company and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, shares of our common stock will rank junior to all indebtedness and other non-equity claims on the Company with respect to assets available to satisfy claims on the Company, including in a liquidation of the Company. Additionally, holders of our common stock are subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of any holders of our preferred stock then outstanding. Certain provisions in our Articles of Incorporation could make a third party acquisition of us difficult.Our Articles of Incorporation contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest, merger or otherwise (even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders) and for holders of our common stock to receive any related takeover premium for their common stock. These provisions may have the effect of lengthening the time required for a person to acquire control of us through a tender offer, a proxy contest, merger or otherwise, and may deter any potentially hostile offers or other efforts to obtain control of us. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNot applicable.
