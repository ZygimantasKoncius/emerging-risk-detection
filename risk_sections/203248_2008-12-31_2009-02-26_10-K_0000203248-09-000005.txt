ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones faced by the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that the Company is unaware of, or that it currently deems immaterial, may become important factors that affect it. If any of the following risks occur, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. RISKS THAT RELATE TO SOUTHERN UNION Southern Union has substantial debt and may not be able to obtain funding or obtain funding on acceptable terms because of deterioration in the credit and capital markets. This may hinder or prevent Southern Union from meeting its future capital needs. Southern Union has a significant amount of debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2008, consolidated debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet totaled $3.7 billion outstanding, compared to total capitalization (long and short-term debt plus stockholders' equity) of $6.1 billion. Some of the Company’s debt obligations contain financial covenants concerning debt-to-capital ratios and interest coverage ratios. The Company’s failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations or render the Company unable to borrow under certain credit agreements. Any such acceleration or inability to borrow could cause a material adverse change in the Company’s financial condition. The Company relies on access to both short-term and long-term credit as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from its operations. A deterioration in the Company’s financial condition could hamper its ability to access the capital markets. 17 Table of Contents Global financial markets and economic conditions have been, and may continue to be, disrupted and volatile. The debt and equity capital markets have been exceedingly distressed. These issues, along with significant write-offs in the financial services sector, the re-pricing of credit risk and the current weak economic conditions have made, and may continue to make, it more difficult to obtain funding. As a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically, the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets generally has increased as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates, enacted tighter lending standards, refused to refinance existing debt at maturity at all or on terms similar to current debt and reduced and, in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers. Due to these factors, the Company cannot be certain that funding will be available if needed and, to the extent required, on acceptable terms. If funding is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, the Company may be unable to refinance its debt, grow its existing business, complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s revenues and results of operations. Further, because of the need for certain state regulatory approvals in order to incur long-term debt and issue capital stock, the Company may not be able to access the capital markets on a timely basis. Restrictions on the Company’s ability to access capital markets could affect its ability to execute its business plan or limit its ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions on which it may otherwise rely for future growth. See additional related information in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financial Sector Exposure. Credit ratings downgrades could increase the Company’s financing costs and limit its ability to access the capital markets. As of December 31, 2008, both Southern Union’s and Panhandle’s debt is rated Baa3 by Moody's Investor Services, Inc. and BBB- by Standard & Poor's. Fitch Ratings has rated Southern Union’s debt BBB- and Panhandle’s debt is rated BBB. If the Company’s credit ratings are downgraded below investment grade or if there are times when it is placed on "credit watch," both borrowing costs and the costs of maintaining certain contractual relationships could increase. Lower credit ratings could also adversely affect the Distribution segment’s relationships with state regulators, who may be unwilling to allow the Company to pass along increased debt service costs to natural gas customers. The Company’s growth strategy entails risk for investors. The Company may actively pursue acquisitions in the energy industry to complement and diversify its existing businesses. As part of its growth strategy, Southern Union may: · examine and potentially acquire regulated or unregulated businesses, including transportation and storage assets and gathering and processing businesses within the natural gas industry; · enter into joint venture agreements and/or other transactions with other industry participants or financial investors; · selectively divest parts of its business, including parts of its core operations; and · continue expanding its existing operations. The Company’s ability to acquire new businesses will depend upon the extent to which opportunities become available, as well as, among other things: · its success in bidding for the opportunities; · its ability to assess the risks of the opportunities; · its ability to obtain regulatory approvals on favorable terms; and · its access to financing on acceptable terms. 18 Table of Contents Once acquired, the Company’s ability to integrate a new business into its existing operations successfully will depend on the adequacy of implementation plans, including the ability to identify and retain employees to manage the acquired business, and the ability to achieve desired operating efficiencies. The successful integration of any businesses acquired in the future may entail numerous risks, including, among others: · the risk of diverting management's attention from day-to-day operations; · the risk that the acquired businesses will require substantial capital and financial investments; · the risk that the investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations; and · the risk of substantial difficulties in the transition and integration process. These factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time. Additionally, if the Company expands its existing operations, the success of any such expansion is subject to substantial risk and may expose the Company to significant costs. The Company cannot assure that its development or construction efforts will be successful. The consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects the Company’s financial results. To the extent it issues shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock, including options or other rights, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease. In addition, acquisitions or expansions may result in the incurrence of additional debt. The Company depends on distributions from its subsidiaries and joint ventures to meet its needs. The Company is dependent on the earnings and cash flows of, and dividends, loans, advances or other distributions from its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet its obligations. The availability of distributions from such entities is subject to their earnings and capital requirements, the satisfaction of various covenants and conditions contained in financing documents by which they are bound or in their organizational documents, and in the case of the regulated subsidiaries, regulatory restrictions that limit their ability to distribute profits to Southern Union. The Company owns 50 percent of Citrus, the holding company for Florida Gas. As such, the Company cannot control or guarantee the receipt of distributions from Florida Gas through Citrus. The Company is subject to operating risks. The Company’s operations are subject to all operating hazards and risks incident to handling, storing, transporting and providing customers with natural gas or NGL, including adverse weather conditions, explosions, pollution, release of toxic substances, fires and other hazards, each of which could result in damage to or destruction of its facilities or damage to persons and property. If any of these events were to occur, the Company could suffer substantial losses. Moreover, as a result, the Company has been, and likely will be, a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the Company maintains insurance coverage, such coverage may be inadequate to protect the Company from all expenses related to these risks. The Company is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations regulating the environmental aspects of its business that may increase its costs of operation, expose it to environmental liabilities and require it to make material unbudgeted expenditures. The Company is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations regulating the environmental aspects of its business (including air emissions), which are complex and have tended to become increasingly strict over time. These laws and regulations have necessitated, and in the future may necessitate, increased capital expenditures and operating costs. In addition, certain environmental laws may result in liability without regard to fault concerning contamination at a broad range of properties, including currently or formerly owned, leased or operated properties and properties where the Company disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, waste. 19 Table of Contents The Company is currently monitoring or remediating contamination at a number of its facilities and at third party waste disposal sites pursuant to environmental laws and regulations and indemnification agreements. The Company cannot predict with certainty the sites for which it may be responsible, the amount of resulting cleanup obligations that may be imposed on it or the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental remediation because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs and the uncertainty of payment by other potentially responsible parties. Costs and obligations also can arise from claims for toxic torts and natural resource damages or from releases of hazardous materials on other properties as a result of ongoing operations or disposal of waste. Compliance with amended, new or more stringently enforced existing environmental requirements, or the future discovery of contamination, may require material unbudgeted expenditures. These costs or expenditures could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, particularly if such costs or expenditures are not fully recoverable from insurance or through the rates charged to customers or if they exceed any amounts that have been reserved. Terrorist attacks, such as the attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, have resulted in increased costs, and the consequences of the War on Terror and the Iraq conflict may adversely impact the Company’s results of operations. The impact that terrorist attacks, such as the attacks of September 11, 2001, may have on the energy industry in general, and on the Company in particular, is not known at this time. Uncertainty surrounding military activity may affect the Company’s operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets and the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines, LNG facilities, gathering facilities and processing plants, could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror or a retaliatory strike. The Company may have to incur significant additional costs in the future to safeguard its physical assets. Federal, state and local jurisdictions may challenge the Company’s tax return positions The positions taken by the Company in its tax return filings require significant judgment, use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. Despite management’s belief that the Company’s tax return positions are fully supportable, certain positions may be successfully challenged by federal, state and local jurisdictions. The success of the pipeline and gathering and processing businesses depends, in part, on factors beyond the Company’s control. Third parties own most of the natural gas transported and stored through the pipeline systems operated by Panhandle and Florida Gas. Additionally, third parties produce all the natural gas or NGL gathered and processed by SUGS, and third parties provide all of the fractionation services for SUGS. As a result, the volume of natural gas or NGL transported, stored, gathered, processed or fractionated depends on the actions of those third parties and is beyond the Company’s control. Further, other factors beyond the Company’s and those third parties’ control may unfavorably impact the Company’s ability to maintain or increase current transmission, storage, gathering or processing rates, to renegotiate existing contracts as they expire or to remarket unsubscribed capacity. The success of the pipeline and gathering and processing businesses depends on the continued development of additional natural gas reserves in the vicinity of their facilities and their ability to access additional reserves to offset the natural decline from existing wells connected to their systems. The amount of revenue generated by Panhandle and Florida Gas ultimately depends upon their access to reserves of available natural gas. Additionally, the amount of revenue generated by SUGS depends substantially upon the volume of natural gas or NGL gathered and processed. As the reserves available through the supply basins connected to these systems naturally decline, a decrease in development or production activity could cause a decrease in the volume of natural gas available for transmission, gathering or processing. Investments by 20 Table of Contents third parties in the development of new natural gas reserves connected to the Company’s facilities depend on many factors beyond the Company’s control. The financial soundness of the Company’s customers could affect its business and operating results. As a result of the disruptions in the financial markets and other macro-economic challenges currently affecting the economy of the United States and other parts of the world, the Company’s customers may experience cash flow concerns. As a result, if customers’ operating and financial performance deteriorates, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable owed to the Company. Any inability of the Company’s customers to pay for services may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The pipeline and gathering and processing businesses revenues are generated under contracts that must be renegotiated periodically. The revenues of Panhandle, Florida Gas and SUGS are generated under contracts that expire periodically. Although the Company will actively pursue the renegotiation, extension and/or replacement of most or all of its contracts, it cannot assure that it will be able to extend or replace these contracts when they expire or that the terms of any renegotiated contracts will be as favorable as the existing contracts. If the Company is unable to renew, extend or replace these contracts, or if the Company renews them on less favorable terms, it may suffer a material reduction in revenues and earnings. The expansion of the Company’s pipeline and gathering and processing systems by constructing new facilities subjects the Company to construction and other risks that may adversely affect the financial results of the pipeline and gathering and processing businesses. During 2007 and 2008, the domestic energy industry experienced an unprecedented level of expansion activity, including new natural gas and LNG pipelines and compression infrastructure projects. In such an environment, requirements for material, equipment and construction resources could be constrained and result in significant industry-wide cost increases. While the Company’s project cost estimates include provisions for cost escalation, future costs are uncertain. Further, the Company’s construction productivity was adversely affected in 2007 and 2008 by contractor employee turnover and shortages of experienced contractor staff, as well as other factors beyond the Company’s control, such as weather conditions. These factors could affect the ultimate cost and timing of the Company’s expansion projects. The inability to continue to access independently owned and publicly owned lands could adversely affect the Company’s ability to operate and/or expand its pipeline and gathering and processing businesses. The ability of Panhandle, Florida Gas or SUGS to operate in certain geographic areas will depend on their success in maintaining existing rights-of-way and obtaining new rights-of-way. Securing additional rights-of-way is also critical to the Company’s ability to pursue expansion projects. Even for Panhandle and Florida Gas, which generally have the right of eminent domain, the Company cannot assure that it will be able to acquire all of the necessary new rights-of-way or maintain access to existing rights-of-way upon the expiration of the current grants or that all of the rights-of-way will be obtainable in a timely fashion. The Company’s financial position could be adversely affected if the costs of new or extended rights-of-way grants materially increase or the Company is unable to obtain or extend the rights-of-way grants timely. RISKS THAT RELATE TO THE COMPANY’S TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE BUSINESS The Company’s transportation and storage business is highly regulated. The Company’s transportation and storage business is subject to regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. FERC, the U.S. Department of Transportation and various state and local regulatory agencies regulate the interstate pipeline business. In particular, FERC has authority to regulate rates charged by Panhandle and Florida Gas for the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce. FERC also has authority over the construction, acquisition, operation and disposition of these pipeline and storage assets. In addition, the U.S. Coast Guard has oversight over certain issues related to the importation of LNG. 21 Table of Contents The Company’s rates and operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal regulators as well as the actions of Congress and state legislatures and, in some respects, state regulators. The Company cannot predict or control what effect future actions of regulatory agencies may have on its business or its access to the capital markets. Furthermore, the nature and degree of regulation of natural gas companies has changed significantly during the past 25 years and there is no assurance that further substantial changes will not occur or that existing policies and rules will not be applied in a new or different manner. Should new and more stringent regulatory requirements be imposed, the Company’s business could be unfavorably impacted and the Company could be subject to additional costs that could adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations if these costs are deemed unrecoverable in rates. The Company’s transportation and storage business is influenced by fluctuations in costs, including operating costs such as insurance, postretirement and other benefit costs, wages, outside contractor services costs and other operating costs. The profitability of regulated operations depends on the business’ ability to collect such increased costs as a part of the rates charged to its customers. To the extent that such operating costs increase in an amount greater than that for which revenue is received, or for which rate recovery is allowed, this differential could impact operating results. The lag between an increase in costs and the ability of the Company to file to obtain rate relief from FERC to recover those increased costs can have a direct negative impact on operating results. As with any request for an increase in rates in a regulatory filing, once granted, the rate increase may not be adequate. In addition, FERC may prevent the business from passing along certain costs in the form of higher rates. The pipeline businesses are subject to competition. The interstate pipeline businesses of Panhandle and Florida Gas compete with those of other interstate and intrastate pipeline companies in the transportation and storage of natural gas. The principal elements of competition among pipelines are rates, terms of service and the flexibility and reliability of service. Natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to the Company’s customers and end-users, including electricity, coal and fuel oils. The primary competitive factor is price. Changes in the availability or price of natural gas and other forms of energy, the level of business activity, conservation, legislation and governmental regulations, the capability to convert to alternate fuels and other factors, including weather and natural gas storage levels, affect the demand for natural gas in the areas served by Panhandle and Florida Gas. Substantial risks are involved in operating a natural gas pipeline system. Numerous operational risks are associated with the operation of a complex pipeline system. These include adverse weather conditions, accidents, the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, the performance of pipeline facilities below expected levels of capacity and efficiency, the collision of equipment with pipeline facilities (such as may occur if a third party were to perform excavation or construction work near the facilities) and other catastrophic events beyond the Company’s control. In particular, the Company’s pipeline system, especially those portions that are located offshore, may be subject to adverse weather conditions including hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, extreme temperatures and other natural phenomena, making it more difficult for the Company to realize the historic rates of return associated with these assets and operations. A casualty occurrence might result in injury or loss of life, extensive property damage or environmental damage. Insurance proceeds may be inadequate to cover all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost. Fluctuations in energy commodity prices could adversely affect the pipeline businesses. If natural gas prices in the supply basins connected to the pipeline systems of Panhandle and Florida Gas are higher than prices in other natural gas producing regions able to serve the Company’s customers, the volume of gas transported by the Company may be negatively impacted. Natural gas prices can also affect customer demand for the various services provided by the Company. 22 Table of Contents The pipeline businesses are dependent on a small number of customers for a significant percentage of their sales. Panhandle’s top three customers accounted for 42 percent of its 2008 revenue. Florida Gas’ top two customers accounted for 55 percent of its 2008 revenue. The loss of any one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company is exposed to the credit risk of its transportation and storage customers in the ordinary course of business. Transportation service contracts obligate customers to pay charges for reservation of capacity, or reservation charges, regardless of whether they transport natural gas on the pipeline system. Customers with natural gas imbalances on the pipeline system may also owe natural gas to the Company. As a result, the Company’s profitability will depend upon the continued financial performance and creditworthiness of its customers rather than just upon the amount of capacity provided under service contracts. Generally, customers are rated investment grade or, as permitted by the Company’s tariff, are required to make pre-payments or deposits, or to provide collateral, if their creditworthiness does not meet certain criteria. Nevertheless, the Company cannot predict to what extent future declines in customers' creditworthiness may negatively impact its business. RISKS THAT RELATE TO THE COMPANY’S GATHERING AND PROCESSING BUSINESS The Company’s gathering and processing business is unregulated. Unlike the Company’s returns on its regulated transportation and distribution businesses, the natural gas and NGL gathering and processing operations conducted at SUGS are not regulated for cost-based ratemaking purposes and may potentially have a higher level of risk in recovering incurred costs than the Company’s regulated operations. Although SUGS operates in an unregulated market, the business is subject to certain regulatory risks, most notably environmental and safety regulations. Moreover, the Company cannot predict when additional legislation or regulation might affect the gathering and processing industry, nor the impact of any such changes on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company’s gathering and processing business is subject to competition. The gathering and processing industry is expected to remain highly competitive. Most customers of SUGS have access to more than one gathering and/or processing system. The Company’s ability to compete depends on a number of factors, including the infrastructure and contracting strategies of competitors in the Company’s gathering region; the efficiency, quality and reliability of the Company’s plant and gathering system. In addition to SUGS’ current competitive position in the gathering and processing industry, its business is subject to pricing risks associated with changes in the supply of, and the demand for, natural gas and NGL. If natural gas or NGL prices in the producing areas connected to the Company’s gathering system are comparatively higher than prices in other natural gas producing regions, the volume of gas that SUGS chooses to process may, to the extent that is operationally feasible, be reduced to maximize returns to the Company. Similarly, since the demand for natural gas or NGL is primarily a function of commodity prices (including prices for alternative energy sources), customer usage rates, weather, economic conditions and service costs, the volume processed, or the NGL extracted during processing, by SUGS may be reduced based on these market conditions on a daily basis after analysis by the Company. 23 Table of Contents The Company’s profit margin in the gathering and processing business is highly dependent on energy commodity prices. SUGS’ gross margin is largely derived from (a) percentage of proceeds arrangements based on the volume of gas gathered and/or NGL recovered through its facilities and (b) specified fee arrangements for a range of services. Under percent-of-proceeds arrangements, SUGS generally gathers and processes natural gas from producers for an agreed percentage of the proceeds from the sales of the resulting residue gas and NGL. The percent-of-proceeds arrangements, in particular, expose SUGS’ revenues and cash flows to risks associated with the fluctuation of the price of natural gas, NGL, crude oil and their relationships to each other. The markets and prices for natural gas and NGL depend upon factors beyond the Company’s control. These factors include demand for these commodities, which fluctuate with changes in market and economic conditions, and other factors, including: · the impact of seasonality and weather; · general economic conditions; · the level of domestic crude oil and natural gas production and consumption; · the level of worldwide oil production and consumption; · the availability and level of natural gas and NGL storage; · the availability of imported natural gas, NGL and crude oil; · actions taken by foreign oil and natural gas producing nations; · the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems; · the availability of NGL transportation and fractionation capacity; · the availability and marketing of competitive fuels; · the impact of energy conservation efforts; and · the extent of governmental regulation and taxation. To manage its commodity price risk related to natural gas and NGL, the Company uses a combination of puts, fixed-rate (i.e., receive fixed price) or floating-rate (i.e. receive variable price) index and basis swaps, NGL gross processing spread puts and fixed-rate swaps and exchange-traded futures and options. These derivative financial instruments allow the Company to preserve value and protect margins because changes in the value of the derivative financial instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in physical market commodity prices and reducing basis risk. Basis risk exists primarily due to price differentials between cash market delivery locations and futures contract delivery locations. For information related to derivative financial instruments, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 11 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities – Gathering and Processing Segment. A reduction in demand for NGL products by the petrochemical, refining or heating industries could materially adversely affect the Company’s gathering and processing business. The NGL products the Company produces have a variety of applications, including for use as heating fuels, petrochemical feed stocks and refining blend stocks. A reduction in demand for NGL products, whether because of general economic conditions, new government regulations, reduced demand by consumers for products made with NGL products, increased competition from petroleum-based products due to pricing differences, mild winter weather, severe weather such as hurricanes causing damage to Gulf Coast petrochemical facilities or other reasons, could result in a decline in the value of the NGL products the Company sells and/or reduce the volume of NGL products the Company produces. 24 Table of Contents Operational risks are involved in operating a gathering and processing business. Numerous operational risks are associated with the operation of a natural gas gathering and processing business. These include adverse weather conditions, accidents, the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, the performance of processing facilities below expected levels of capacity or efficiency, the collision of equipment with facilities and catastrophic events such as explosions, fires, earthquakes, floods, landslides, tornadoes, lightning or other similar events beyond the Company’s control. A casualty occurrence might result in injury or loss of life, extensive property damage or environmental damage. Insurance proceeds may be inadequate to cover all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost. The Company does not typically obtain independent evaluations of natural gas reserves dedicated to its gathering and processing business, potentially resulting in future volumes of natural gas available to the Company being less than anticipated. The Company does not typically obtain independent evaluations of natural gas reserves connected to its gathering systems due to the unwillingness of producers to provide reserve information, as well as the cost of such evaluations. Accordingly, the Company does not have independent estimates of total reserves dedicated to its gathering systems or the anticipated life of such reserves. If the total reserves or estimated lives of the reserves connected to the Company’s gathering systems are less than anticipated and the Company is unable to secure additional sources of natural gas, then the volumes of natural gas in the future could be less than anticipated. A decline in the volumes of natural gas and associated NGL in the Company’s gathering and processing business could have a material adverse effect on its business. The Company’s gathering and processing business accepts some credit risk in dealing with customers. SUGS derives its revenues from customers engaged primarily in the natural gas and utility industries and extends payment credit to these customers. SUGS’ accounts receivable primarily consist of mid- to large-size domestic customers with credit ratings of investment grade or better. Moreover, SUGS maintains trading relationships with counterparties that include reputable U.S. broker-dealers and other financial institutions and evaluates the ability of each counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative agreements. Nevertheless, the Company cannot predict to what extent future declines in customers’ creditworthiness may negatively impact its business. The Company depends on one natural gas producer for a significant portion of its supply of natural gas. The loss of this producer or the replacement of its contracts on less favorable terms could result in a decline in the Company’s volumes and/or gross margin. SUGS’ largest natural gas supplier for the year ended December 31, 2008 accounted for approximately 14.7 percent of the Company’s wellhead throughput under multiple contracts. The loss of all or even a portion of the natural gas volumes supplied by this producer or the extension or replacement of these contracts on less favorable terms, if at all, as a result of competition or otherwise, could reduce the Company’s gross margin. Although this producer represents a large volume of natural gas, the gross margin per unit of volume is significantly lower than the average gross margin per unit of volume on the Company’s gathering and processing system due to the lack of need for services required to make the natural gas merchantable (e.g. high pressure, low NGL content, essentially transmission pipeline quality natural gas). RISKS THAT RELATE TO THE COMPANY’S DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS The distribution business is highly regulated and the Company’s revenues, operating results and financial condition may fluctuate with the distribution business’ ability to achieve timely and effective rate relief from state regulators. The Company’s distribution business is subject to regulation by the MPSC and the MDPU. These authorities regulate many aspects of the Company’s distribution operations, including construction and maintenance of facilities, operations, safety, the rates that can be charged to customers and the maximum rates of return that the Company is allowed to realize. The ability to obtain rate increases and rate supplements to maintain the current rate of return depends upon regulatory discretion. 25 Table of Contents The distribution business is influenced by fluctuations in costs, including operating costs such as insurance, postretirement and other benefit costs, wages, changes in the provision for the allowance for doubtful accounts associated with volatile natural gas costs and other operating costs. The profitability of regulated operations depends on the business’ ability to pass through to its customers costs related to providing them service. To the extent that such operating costs increase in an amount greater than that for which rate recovery is allowed, this differential could impact operating results until the business files for and is allowed an increase in rates. The lag between an increase in costs and the rate relief obtained from the regulators can have a direct negative impact on operating results. As with any request for an increase in rates in a regulatory filing, once granted, the rate increase may not be adequate. In addition, regulators may prevent the business from passing along some costs in the form of higher rates. The distribution business’ operating results and liquidity needs are seasonal in nature and may fluctuate based on weather conditions and natural gas prices. The natural gas distribution business is a seasonal business and is subject to weather conditions. The utilities’ operations have historically been sensitive to weather and are seasonal in nature, with a significant percentage of annual operating revenues and EBIT occurring in the traditional winter heating season in the first and fourth calendar quarters. However, the MPSC approved distribution rates effective April 3, 2007 for Missouri Gas Energy’s residential customers (which comprise approximately 87 percent of its total customers and approximately 67 percent of its operating revenues) that eliminate the impact of weather and conservation for residential margin revenues and related earnings in Missouri. The business is also subject to seasonal and other variations in working capital due to changes in natural gas prices and the fact that customers pay for the natural gas delivered to them after they use it, whereas the business is required to pay for the natural gas before delivery. As a result, fluctuations in weather between years may have a significant effect on results of operations and cash flows. In years with warm winters, revenues may be adversely affected. Operational risks are involved in operating a distribution business. Numerous risks are associated with the operations of a natural gas distribution business. These include adverse weather conditions, accidents, the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, the performance of suppliers’ processing facilities below expected levels of capacity or efficiency, the collision of equipment with facilities and catastrophic events such as explosions, fires, earthquakes, floods, landslides, tornadoes, lightning or other similar events beyond the Company’s control. A casualty occurrence might result in injury or loss of life, extensive property damage or environmental damage. Insurance proceeds may be inadequate to cover all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost. 26 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS The disclosure and analysis in this Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions. From time to time, Southern Union also provides forward-looking statements in other materials it releases to the public as well as oral forward-looking statements. Such statements give the Company’s current expectations or forecasts of future events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Southern Union has tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “will” and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, future performance or results of current and anticipated services, expenses, interest rates, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. Southern Union cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although management believes that the Company has been prudent in its plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties should materialize, or if underlying assumptions should prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. Readers should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements. Southern Union undertakes no obligation to update publicly forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Readers are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures the Company makes on related subjects in its Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K reports to the SEC. Also note that Southern Union provides the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to its businesses. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, management believes could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. Southern Union notes these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
