This increase was primarily due to the growth in our subscriber base by 11.4% to 91.33 million as of December 31, 2008 from 81.97 million as of December 31, 2007. The growth in our subscriber base was mainly attributable to our sales and marketing efforts and the expansion of our network. A portion of the revenue growth was also due to the significant increase in the interconnect fees we received for the termination of incoming traffic from other operators, which increased to $1,422.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $1,069.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, mainly due to the increased usage of mobile services. In addition, revenue from value-added services increased to $1,379.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $1,026.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, or 34.4%, mainly due to our marketing efforts aimed at stimulating usage of value-added services and our increased value-added service offerings. Growth in subscription fees to $1,175.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $890.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 also impacted the total revenue growth and was mainly due to the expansion of services with subscription fees offered by us to subscribers. Revenue growth was also attributable to an increase in roaming revenues from our subscribers to $1,059.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $808.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was in line with the increase in both our subscriber base and overall usage. Our acquisition of K-Telekom in September 2007 contributed an additional $190.1 million to our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The depreciation of the average U.S. dollar versus ruble exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 also contributed to the growth in our revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2008, service revenues and connection fees increased by $2,003.7 million, or 24.5%, to $10,176.3 million compared to $8,172.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 mainly due to the growth in the number of our subscribers and the increases in subscription and interconnect fees, as described above. Revenues from the sales of handsets and accessories decreased by $10.7 million, or 13.4%, to $69.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $79.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, mainly due to a change in our strategy for sales of handsets and accessories in the year ended December 31, 2008, as described above. Consolidated cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 28.2% to $2,417.6 million from $1,885.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in costs was primarily attributable to growth of our subscriber base and the consequent growth in traffic-related expenses, in particular interconnect costs and line rental expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2008, interconnect expenses grew to $1,424.4 million from $1,077.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 due to increased traffic volume. Line rental expenses grew to $134.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $103.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Cost of value-added services also grew to $247.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $164.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 due to the increased usage of value-added services by our subscribers. The increase in cost of services for the year ended December 31, 2008 was also due to a growth in other direct costs to $192.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $140.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 due to higher fees payable for our use of radio frequencies and higher electricity costs. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the cost of handsets and accessories sold, including SIM cards provided to customers, slightly increased to $169.6 million from $158.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 mainly due to the launch of iPhone 3G sales in October 2008, which was partially 99 Table of Contents offset by the decreased selling activity for handsets and accessories in the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 2007. Russia revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 26.9% to $7,840.2 million from $6,181.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in Russia revenues was primarily due to the growth of our subscriber base in Russia, which increased by 12.5% to 64.6 million as of December 31, 2008 from 57.4 million as of December 31, 2007, as well as growth in interconnect revenues and the adoption of new marketing initiatives aimed at stimulating higher usage of mobile and value-added services among our subscribers. Russia cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 28.6% to $1,809.6 million from $1,407.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increased costs were mainly the result of a $275.9 million increase in interconnect costs and $27.8 million increase in line rental costs due to increased traffic volume, and a $9.0 million increase in roaming expenses mainly due to an increase in both the number of subscribers and volume of network traffic. Interconnect expenses increased to $1,042.9 million, or 13.3% of segment total revenues, in the year ended December 31, 2008 from $767.0 million, or 12.4% of segment total revenues, in the year ended December 31, 2007 mainly due to the growth in outgoing network traffic. The cost of value-added services for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by $58.3 million to $199.9 million, or 2.5% of segment total revenues, from $141.6 million, or 2.3% of segment total revenues, in the year ended December 31, 2007 mainly due to the increased usage of value-added services by subscribers, which resulted from our marketing efforts and the rising awareness and popularity of certain value-added services. Cost of handsets, accessories and SIM-cards increased slightly by $3.6 million to $105.6 million, or 1.3% of segment total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $102.0 million, or 1.7% of segment total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2007 due to the launch of iPhone 3G sales in October 2008. Ukraine revenues increased by 3.4% to $1,662.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2008 from $1,608.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to an increase in the usage of value-added services and interconnect revenues, partially offset by a decrease in usage fees due to lower tariffs caused by the highly competitive environment in Ukraine. Ukraine cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories increased by 18.1% to $511.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2008 from $433.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2007. The growth occurred primarily due to a $43.3 million increase in interconnect expenses, $4.6 million increase in roaming expenses and $20.0 million increase in the cost of value-added services. Interconnect expenses increased to $327.2 million, or 19.7% of segment total revenues, in the year ended December 31, 2008 from $283.9 million, or 17.7% of segment total revenues, in the year ended December 31, 2007 mainly due to the growth in outgoing network traffic. Cost of value-added services increased to $37.5 million, or 2.3% of segment total revenues, in the year ended December 31, 2008 from $17.5 million, or 1.1% of segment total revenues, in the year ended December 31, 2007 mainly due to the growth in value-added services usage. Cost of handsets, accessories and SIM-cards remained stable at $49.6 million, or 3.0% of segment total revenues, in the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $48.9 million, or 3.1% of segment total revenues, in the year ended December 31, 2007. Other countries revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 61.2% to $779.5 million from $483.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was due primarily to our acquisition of K-Telecom in September 2007, which contributed an additional $190.1 million of growth to other country revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The remaining portion of growth was primarily due to the growth in our subscriber base in Uzbekistan. The growth of revenues in Uzbekistan and Armenia was partially offset by the revenues of MTS-Turkmenistan, which declined significantly due to the change in the official exchange rate of the Turkmenistan manat to the U.S. dollar. On January 1, 2008, the 100 Table of Contents Central Bank of Turkmenistan changed the official exchange rate of the Turkmenistan manat to the U.S. dollar from 5,200 to 6,250. On May 1, 2008, another decree was passed by the President of Turkmenistan establishing the official rate at 14,250 manat per one U.S. dollar. As a result, we experienced a significant currency exchange loss when translating the manat revenue of MTS-Turkmenistan to U.S. dollars, our reporting currency. Other countries cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 99.5% to $131.5 million from $65.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase occurred primarily due to the acquisition of K-Telecom, which contributed $44.0 million of the increase, as well as a $21.7 million increase in other cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories in Uzbekistan partially offset by the decrease in Turkmenistan due to the reasons described above. The increase in cost of services and cost of handsets and accessories was mainly due to an increase in the number of subscribers and overall traffic growth in those countries' networks. Sundry operating expenses Consolidated sundry operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 27.2% to $1,804.9 million from $1,418.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase of $386.0 million in sundry operating expenses was primarily attributable to a general increase in expenses caused by the growth in our operations. In addition, the consolidation of K-Telekom's financial results in 2008 contributed an additional $31.5 million to the growth of consolidated sundry operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008. Salary expenses and related social contributions increased by $137.3 million to $700.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $562.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 due to an increase in personnel compensation levels and the number of employees. Rent expenses increased by $50.9 million to $230.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $179.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 due to the increased rent expenses for base station sites and the overall number of sites used. Provision for bad debt also increased by $88.5 million to $147.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $58.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 due to the write-off of a $28.2 million loan given by us to Beta Link, which filed for bankruptcy in March 2009, as well as write-off of certain advances given to dealers. Sundry operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased slightly to 17.6% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 17.2% in the year ended December 31, 2007. Russia sundry operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 30.0% to $1,468.4 million from $1,129.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Russia sundry operating expenses as a percentage of segment total revenues increased to 18.7% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 18.3% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase of $338.5 million in absolute terms was mainly attributable to an increase in employee compensation and related social contributions of $112.6 million, an increase of provision for bad debt of $87.4 million due to the reasons described above, as well as a $32.4 million increase in rent expenses and a $49.4 million increase in taxes other than income tax mainly due to the write-off of non-recoverable VAT receivables. The growth in Russia sundry operating expenses was also attributable to a $49.1 million growth in other operating expenses mainly due to an increase in obligatory revenue-based Unified Services Fund contributions, as well as an increase in outsourcing expenses. Ukraine sundry operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 9.9% to $200.9 million from $182.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Ukraine sundry operating expenses as a percentage of segment total revenues increased to 12.1% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 11.4% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in these expenses in absolute terms in the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily due to a $14.6 million increase in rent expenses and a $15.9 million increase in other operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $12.8 million in repair and maintenance costs. 101 Table of Contents Other countries sundry operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 27.7% to $135.6 million from $106.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Other countries sundry operating expenses as a percentage of other countries total revenues decreased to 17.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 22.0% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in these expenses in absolute terms in the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily due to the consolidation of K-Telekom's financial results starting from September 14, 2007, which contributed an additional $31.5 million to the growth of sundry operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008, partially offset by generally lower sundry operating costs in Turkmenistan in 2008. However, the decrease in sundry operating expenses as a percentage of other countries total revenues to 17.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 22.0% for the same period in 2007 was primarily attributable to the relatively low level of taxes other than income tax and state fees contributed by K-Telekom to total sundry operating expenses due to favorable business development conditions in Armenia. Sales and marketing expenses Consolidated sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 21.9%, or $158.4 million, to $882.5 million from $724.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This growth was due to an increase in commissions payable to dealers and advertising and promotion expenses by $102.7 million and $55.7 million, respectively. The increase in dealer commissions was generally in line with the growth of our subscriber base. The increase in advertising and promotion expenses was primarily attributable to our increased marketing efforts, as well as growth in the cost of advertising on television. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained relatively stable at 8.6% for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 8.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Russia sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 30.8% to $646.1 million from $494.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 due to increases in dealer commission payments and advertising and promotion expenses, as described above. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of segment total revenues increased to 8.2% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 8.0% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Dealer commissions as a percentage of segment total revenues increased to 4.3% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007 mainly due to our increased efforts aimed at stimulating the performance and sales of regional dealers. However, advertising and marketing expenses as a percentage of segment total revenues decreased to 3.9% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 4.1% for the year ended December 31, 2007 due to effective marketing management. Ukraine sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased to $190.2 million, or 11.4% of segment total revenues, from $210.3 million, or 13.1% of segment total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses in absolute terms and as a percentage of segment total revenues was primarily the result of our effective use of marketing resources. Other countries sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 148.7% to $55.7 million from $22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 due to the expansion of our operations in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. A portion of the growth was also attributable to the acquisition of K-Telekom in Armenia, which contributed $16.1 million to the abovementioned growth. In particular, we increased our advertising campaigns in these countries in order to promote our services and, consequently, incurred increased advertising expenses. Dealer commissions also increased due to the growth in our subscriber base in each of these countries. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of segment total revenues increased to 7.1% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2007 due to the foregoing reasons. 102 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization expenses Consolidated depreciation and amortization of property, network equipment, telephone numbering capacity, license costs and other intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 30.0% to $1,936.8 million from $1,489.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was mainly attributable to our increased asset base resulting from the continued expansion of our network through buildouts and acquisitions. Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to 18.9% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 18.0% for the year ended December 31, 2007 due to reasons described below. Russia depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 21.9% to $1,312.4 million from $1,076.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 mainly due to significant investments in our fixed and intangible assets related mainly to new telecommunication equipment. Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of segment total revenues decreased to 16.7% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 17.4% for the year ended December 31, 2007 mainly due to the decrease in license amortization expenses, which are now fully amortized. Ukraine depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $438.0 million, or 26.4% of segment total revenues, and $325.0 million, or 20.2% of segment total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Growth in depreciation and amortization expense in absolute terms and as a percentage of segment total revenues was mainly due to the accelerated depreciation of certain equipment intended to be withdrawn from operations, as well as the continued buildout of our network in Ukraine. Other countries depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 111.8% to $186.4 million from $88.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and increased as a percentage of segment total revenues to 23.9% from 18.2%. Growth in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of segment total revenues was primarily attributable to the acquisition of K-Telekom, which contributed $82.9 million to growth in depreciation and amortization expense in 2008 mainly due to the accelerated depreciation of equipment intended to be withdrawn from operations. Operating Income Consolidated operating income increased by 17.2% to $3,203.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $2,733.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 31.3% for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 33.1% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The growth of operating income in absolute terms was mainly driven by growth in revenues. The decrease in the operating income margin was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization, provision for bad debt and interconnect expenses as a percentage of total revenues. Russia operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 25.6% to $2,603.8 million from $2,073.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Russia operating income decreased as a percentage of segment revenues to 33.2% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 33.5% for the year ended December 31, 2007, mainly due to an increase in interconnect and provision for bad debt expenses as a percentage of total revenues, which was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of total revenues. Ukraine operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased by 29.7% to $321.3 million from $456.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Ukraine operating income decreased as a percentage of segment revenues to 19.3% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 28.4% for the year ended December 31, 2007. These decreases were largely due to the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses, the increase in interconnect expenses and cost of value-added services, as well as lower subscriber tariffs driven by the highly competitive environment in Ukraine. 103 Table of Contents Other countries operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 34.5% to $270.3 million from $201.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in operating income in absolute terms was primarily due to an increase in the number of subscribers in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, as well as to our entry into the Armenian market with the acquisition of K-Telecom. Other countries operating income decreased as a percentage of segment revenues to 34.7% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 41.6% for the year ended December 31, 2007 mainly due to the historically lower gross margin level in Armenia, as discussed above. Currency exchange and transaction losses Consolidated currency exchange and transaction losses for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $563.3 million, compared to $163.1 million in gains for the year ended December 31, 2007. We conduct our operations primarily within the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Armenia, and we are therefore subject to currency fluctuations. Change in currency exchange and transaction losses was mainly attributable to the significant fluctuations of the U.S. dollar and euro versus ruble/hryvnia/som/manat/dram in year ending December 31, 2008 compared to the year 2007. The major portion of the loss was due to the translation effect of our U.S. dollar-denominated debt as of December 31, 2008 due to the significant depreciation of local currencies against the U.S. dollar during the fourth quarter of 2008. Interest expense Consolidated interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by $18.7 million, or 13.9% to $153.3 million from $134.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily as a result of the increase in our total indebtedness during the year 2008. Equity in net income of associates Consolidated equity in net income of associates for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by $3.3 million, or 4.5% to a gain of $76.0 million, compared to a gain of $72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the increase in profit of MTS Belarus for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Other expenses (income), net Consolidated other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased to $25.3 million, as compared to $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in the conversion of Turkmenistan manats, which previously originated from the significant difference between the official and commercial exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the Turkmenistan manat.
