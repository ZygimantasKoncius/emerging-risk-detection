ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. RISKS RELATING TO THE INDUSTRIES AND BUSINESSES OF THE COMPANY Some of the Companys products are vulnerable to long-term declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials. The Companys paper business competes with electronic transmission and document storage alternatives, as well as with paper grades it does not produce, such as uncoated groundwood. As a result of such competition, the Company is experiencing on-going decreasing demand for most of its existing paper products. As the use of these alternatives grows, demand for paper products is likely to further decline. Declines in demand for our paper products may adversely affect the Companys business, results of operations and financial position. Failure to successfully implement our business diversification initiatives could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial results or condition. We are pursuing strategic initiatives that management considers important to our long-term success including, but not limited to, optimizing and expanding our operations in markets with positive demand dynamics to help grow our business and counteract secular demand decline in our core North American paper business. These initiatives may involve organic growth, select joint ventures and strategic acquisitions. The success of these initiatives will depend, among other things, on our ability to identify potential strategic initiatives, understand the key trends and principal drivers affecting businesses to be acquired and to execute the initiatives in a cost effective manner. There are significant risks involved with the execution of these initiatives, including significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. Strategic acquisitions may expose us to additional risks. We may have to compete for acquisition targets and any acquisitions we make may fail to accomplish our strategic objectives or may not perform as expected. In addition, the costs of integrating an acquired business may exceed our estimates and may take significant time and attention from senior management. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether we will succeed in implementing these strategic initiatives. If we fail to successfully diversify our business, it may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, financial condition and operating results. The pulp and paper industry is highly cyclical. Fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for the Companys products could result in lower sales volumes and smaller profit margins. The pulp and paper industry is highly cyclical. Historically, economic and market shifts, fluctuations in capacity and changes in foreign currency exchange rates have created cyclical changes in prices, sales volume and margins for the Companys products. The length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time and by product, but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions and levels of industry capacity. Most of the Companys paper products are commodities that are widely available from other producers. Even the Companys non-commodity products, such as value-added papers, are susceptible to commodity dynamics. Because commodity products have few distinguishing qualities from producer to producer, competition for these products is based primarily on price, which is determined by supply relative to demand. The overall levels of demand for the products the Company manufactures and distributes, and consequently its sales and profitability, reflect fluctuations in levels of end-user demand, which depend in part on general 18 Table of Contents macroeconomic conditions in North America and worldwide, the continuation of the current level of service and cost of postal services, as well as competition from electronic substitution. See Conditions in the global capital and credit markets, and the economy generally, can adversely affect the Company business, results of operations and financial position and Some of the Companys products are vulnerable to long-term declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials. For example, demand for cut-size office paper may fluctuate with levels of white-collar employment. Industry supply of pulp and paper products is also subject to fluctuation, as changing industry conditions can influence producers to idle or permanently close individual machines or entire mills. Such closures can result in significant cash and/or non-cash charges. In addition, to avoid substantial cash costs in connection with idling or closing a mill, some producers will choose to continue to operate at a loss, sometimes even a cash loss, which could prolong weak pricing environments due to oversupply. Oversupply can also result from producers introducing new capacity in response to favorable short-term pricing trends. Industry supply of pulp and paper products is also influenced by overseas production capacity, which has grown in recent years and is expected to continue to grow. As a result, prices for all of the Companys products are driven by many factors outside of its control, and the Company has little influence over the timing and extent of price changes, which are often volatile. Because market conditions beyond the Companys control determine the prices for its commodity products, the price for any one or more of these products may fall below its cash production costs, requiring the Company to either incur cash losses on product sales or cease production at one or more of its manufacturing facilities. The Company continuously evaluates potential adjustments to its production capacity, which may include additional closures of machines or entire mills, and the Company could recognize significant cash and/or non-cash charges relating to any such closures in future periods. See Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation, under Closure and restructuring activities. Therefore, the Companys profitability with respect to these products depends on managing its cost structure, particularly wood fiber, chemical and energy costs, which represent the largest components of its operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond its control, as described below. If the prices of or demand for its products decline, or if its wood fiber, chemical or energy costs increase, or both, its sales and profitability could be materially and adversely affected. Conditions in the global capital and credit markets, and the economy generally, can adversely affect the Companys business, results of operations and financial position. A significant or prolonged downturn in general economic conditions may affect the Companys sales and profitability. The Company has exposure to counterparties with which we routinely execute transactions. Such counterparties include commercial banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions, some of which may be exposed to bankruptcy or liquidity risks. While the Company has not realized any significant losses to date, a bankruptcy or illiquidity event by one of its significant counterparties may materially and adversely affect the Companys access to capital, future business and results of operations. In addition, our customers and suppliers may be adversely affected by severe economic conditions. This could result in reduced demand for our products or our inability to obtain necessary supplies at reasonable costs or at all. The Company faces intense competition in its markets, and the failure to compete effectively would have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. The Company competes with both U.S. and Canadian producers and, for many of its product lines, global producers, some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than the Company. The principal basis for competition is selling price. The Companys ability to maintain satisfactory margins depends in large part on its ability to control its costs. The Company cannot provide assurance that it will compete effectively and maintain current levels of sales and profitability. If the Company cannot compete effectively, such failure will have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. 19 Table of Contents The Companys manufacturing businesses may have difficulty obtaining wood fiber at favorable prices, or at all. Wood fiber is the principal raw material used by the Company, comprising approximately 20% of the total cost of sales during 2011. Wood fiber is a commodity, and prices historically have been cyclical. The primary source for wood fiber is timber. Environmental litigation and regulatory developments, alternative use for energy production and reduction in harvesting related to the housing market, have caused, and may cause in the future, significant reductions in the amount of timber available for commercial harvest in the United States and Canada. In addition, future domestic or foreign legislation and litigation concerning the use of timberlands, the protection of endangered species, the promotion of forest health and the response to and prevention of catastrophic wildfires could also affect timber supplies. Availability of harvested timber may be further limited by adverse weather, fire, insect infestation, disease, ice storms, wind storms, flooding and other natural and man made causes, thereby reducing supply and increasing prices. Wood fiber pricing is subject to regional market influences, and the Companys cost of wood fiber may increase in particular regions due to market shifts in those regions. Any sustained increase in wood fiber prices would increase the Companys operating costs, and the Company may be unable to increase prices for its products in response to increased wood fiber costs due to additional factors affecting the demand or supply of these products. The Company currently meets its wood fiber requirements by purchasing wood fiber from third parties and by harvesting timber pursuant to its forest licenses and forest management agreements. If the Companys cutting rights, pursuant to its forest licenses or forest management agreements are reduced, or any third-party supplier of wood fiber stops selling or is unable to sell wood fiber to the Company, our financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. An increase in the cost of the Companys purchased energy or chemicals would lead to higher manufacturing costs, thereby reducing its margins. The Companys operations consume substantial amounts of energy such as electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, coal and hog fuel. Energy comprised approximately 6% of the total cost of sales in 2011. Energy prices, particularly for electricity, natural gas and fuel oil, have been volatile in recent years. As a result, fluctuations in energy prices will impact the Companys manufacturing costs and contribute to earnings volatility. While the Company purchases substantial portions of its energy under supply contracts, most of these contracts are based on market pricing. Other raw materials the Company uses include various chemical compounds, such as precipitated calcium carbonate, sodium chlorate and sodium hydroxide, sulfuric acid, dyes, peroxide, methanol and aluminum sulfate. Purchases of chemicals comprised approximately 13% of the total consolidated cost of sales in 2011. The costs of these chemicals have been volatile historically, and they are influenced by capacity utilization, energy prices and other factors beyond the Companys control. Due to the commodity nature of the Companys products, the relationship between industry supply and demand for these products, rather than solely changes in the cost of raw materials, will determine the Companys ability to increase prices. Consequently, the Company may be unable to pass on increases in its operating costs to its customers. Any sustained increase in chemical or energy prices without any corresponding increase in product pricing would reduce the Companys operating margins and may have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. The Company depends on third parties for transportation services. The Company relies primarily on third parties for transportation of the products it manufactures and/or distributes, as well as delivery of its raw materials. In particular, a significant portion of the goods it manufactures and raw materials it uses are transported by railroad or trucks, which are highly regulated. If any of its third-party transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods the Company manufactures or distributes in a timely manner, the Company may be unable to sell those products at full value, or at all. Similarly, if any of 20 Table of Contents these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to the Company in a timely manner, it may be unable to manufacture its products in response to customer demand. In addition, if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with the Company, it may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost. Any failure of a third-party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could harm the Companys reputation, negatively impact its customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results. The Company could experience disruptions in operations and/or increased labor costs due to labor disputes or restructuring activities. Employees at 23 of the Companys facilities, representing a majority of the Companys 8,700 employees, are represented by unions through collective bargaining agreements generally on a facility basis. Certain of these agreements expired in 2011 and others will expire between 2012 and 2015. Currently, 12 collective bargaining agreements representing 2,280 employees are up for renegotiation of which six, representing 1,205 employees, are currently under negotiation. The Company may not be able to negotiate acceptable new collective bargaining agreements, which could result in strikes or work stoppages or other labor disputes by affected workers. Renewal of collective bargaining agreements could also result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members. In addition, labor organizing activities could occur at any of the Companys facilities. Therefore, the Company could experience a disruption of its operations or higher ongoing labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition. In connection with the Companys restructuring efforts, the Company has suspended operations at, or closed or announced its intention to close, various facilities and may incur liability with respect to affected employees, which could have a material adverse effect on its business or financial condition. In addition, the Company continues to evaluate potential adjustments to its production capacity, which may include additional closures of machines or entire mills, and the Company could recognize significant cash and/or non-cash charges relating to any such closures in the future. The Company relies heavily on a small number of significant customers, including one customer that represented approximately 10% of the Companys sales in 2011. A loss of any of these significant customers could materially adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations. The Company heavily relies on a small number of significant customers. The Companys largest customer, Staples, represented approximately 10% of the Companys sales in 2011. A significant reduction in sales to any of the Companys key customers, which could be due to factors outside its control, such as purchasing diversification or financial difficulties experienced by these customers, could materially adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations. A material disruption at one or more of the Companys manufacturing facilities could prevent it from meeting customer demand, reduce its sales and/or negatively impact its net income. Any of the Companys pulp or paper manufacturing facilities, or any of its machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:  unscheduled maintenance outages;  prolonged power failures;  equipment failure;  chemical spill or release;  explosion of a boiler;  the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on its water supply; 21 Table of Contents  labor difficulties;  government regulations;  disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels;  adverse weather, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other catastrophes;  terrorism or threats of terrorism; or  other operational problems, including those resulting from the risks described in this section. Events such as those listed above have resulted in operating losses in the past. Future events may cause shutdowns, which may result in additional downtime and/or cause additional damage to the Companys facilities. Any such downtime or facility damage could prevent the Company from meeting customer demand for its products and/or require it to make unplanned capital expenditures. If one or more of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime, it may have a material adverse effect on the Company financial results and financial position. The Companys operations require substantial capital, and it may not have adequate capital resources to provide for all of its capital requirements. The Companys businesses are capital intensive and require that it regularly incur capital expenditures in order to maintain its equipment, increase its operating efficiency and comply with environmental laws. In 2011, the Companys total capital expenditures were $144 million (2010$153 million). In addition, $83 million was spent under the Pulp and Paper Green Transformation Program (2010$51 million), which is reimbursed by the Government of Canada. If the Companys available cash resources and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to fund its operating needs and capital expenditures, the Company would have to obtain additional funds from borrowings or other available sources or reduce or delay its capital expenditures. The Company may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, the Companys debt service obligations will reduce its available cash flows. If the Company cannot maintain or upgrade its equipment as it requires or allocate funds to ensure environmental compliance, it could be required to curtail or cease some of its manufacturing operations, or it may become unable to manufacture products that compete effectively in one or more of its product lines. The Company and its subsidiaries may incur substantially more debt. This could increase risks associated with its leverage. The Company and its subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the revolving credit facility contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had no borrowings and had outstanding letters of credit amounting to $29 million under its revolving credit facility, resulting in $571 million of availability for future drawings under this credit facility. Also, the Company can use securitization of certain receivables to provide additional liquidity to fund its operations. At December 31, 2011 the Company had no borrowings and $28 million of letters of credit outstanding under the securitization program (2010nil and nil), resulting in $122 million of availability for future drawings under this program. Other new borrowings could also be incurred by Domtar Corporation or its subsidiaries. Among other things, the Company could determine to incur additional debt in connection with a strategic acquisition. If the Company incurs additional debt, the risks associated with its leverage would increase. 22 Table of Contents The Companys ability to generate the significant amount of cash needed to pay interest and principal on the Companys unsecured long-term notes and service its other debt and financial obligations and its ability to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness or obtain additional financing depends on many factors beyond the Companys control. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had approximately $74 million of annual interest payments and its aggregate debt service obligations are approximately $70 million each year from 2012 through 2015, $50 million in 2016 and $20 million in 2017. The Companys ability to make payments on and refinance its debt, including the Companys unsecured long-term notes and amounts borrowed under its revolving credit facility, if any, and other financial obligations and to fund its operations will depend on its ability to generate substantial operating cash flow. The Companys cash flow generation will depend on its future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond its control. The Companys business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to the Company under its revolving credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable the Company to service its indebtedness, including the Companys unsecured long-term notes, and borrowings, if any, under its revolving credit facility or to fund its other liquidity needs. If the Company cannot service its debt, the Company will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing its debt or seeking additional equity capital. Any of these remedies may not be effected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and may impede the implementation of its business strategy. Furthermore, the revolving credit facility may restrict the Company from adopting any of these alternatives. Because of these and other factors that may be beyond its control, the Company may be unable to service its indebtedness. The Company is affected by changes in currency exchange rates. The Company manufactures a significant portion of pulp and paper in Canada. Sales of these products by the Companys Canadian operations will be invoiced in U.S. dollars or in Canadian dollars linked to U.S. pricing but most of the costs relating to these products will be incurred in Canadian dollars. As a result, any decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar will reduce the Companys profitability. Exchange rate fluctuations are beyond the Companys control. From 2007 to 2011, the Canadian dollar had appreciated over 15% relative to the U.S. dollar. In 2011, when compared to 2010, the Canadian dollar decreased in value by approximately 2% relative to the U.S. dollar. The level of the Canadian dollar can have a material adverse effect on the sales and profitability of the Canadian operations. The Company has liabilities with respect to its pension plans and the actual cost of its pension plan obligations could exceed current provisions. As of December 31, 2011, the Companys defined benefit plans had a surplus of $53 million on certain plans and a deficit of $143 million on others on an ongoing basis. The Companys future funding obligations for the defined benefit pension plans depend upon changes to the level of benefits provided by the plans, the future performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the level of interest rates used to determine minimum funding levels, actuarial data and experience, and any changes in government laws and regulations. As of December 31, 2011, the Companys Canadian defined benefit pension plans held assets with a fair value of $1,445 million (CDN $1,470 million), including a fair value of $205 million (CDN $208 million) of asset backed commercial paper (ABCP). Most of the ABCP investments were subject to restructuring (under the court order governing the Montreal Accord that was completed in January 2009) while the remainder is in conduits restructured outside the Montreal Accord or subject to litigation between the sponsor and the credit counterparty. 23 Table of Contents At December 31, 2011, the Company determined that the fair value of these ABCP investments was $205 million (CDN $208 million) (2010$214 million (CDN $213 million)). Possible changes that could have a material effect on the future value of the ABCP include (1) changes in the value of the underlying assets and the related derivative transactions, (2) developments related to the liquidity of the ABCP market, and (3) a severe and prolonged economic slowdown in North America and the bankruptcy of referenced corporate credits. The Company does not expect any potential short-term liquidity issues to affect the pension funds since pension fund obligations are primarily long-term in nature. Losses in pension fund investments, if any, would result in future increased contributions by the Company or its Canadian subsidiaries. Additional contributions to these pension funds would be required to be paid over 5 year or 10 year periods, depending upon the applicable provincial requirement for funding solvency deficits. Losses, if any, would also impact operating results over a longer period of time and immediately increase liabilities and reduce equity. The Company could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with, violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and regulations. It could also incur costs as a result of asbestos-related personal injury litigation. The Company is subject, in both the United States and Canada, to a wide range of general and industry-specific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and natural resources, including those governing air emissions, greenhouse gases and climate change, wastewater discharges, harvesting, silvicultural activities, the storage, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites, landfill operation and closure obligations, forestry operations and endangered species habitat, and health and safety matters. In particular, the pulp and paper industry in the United States is subject to the United States Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) Cluster Rules. The Company has incurred, and expects that it will continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations as a result of remedial obligations. The Company incurred approximately $62 million of operating expenses and $8 million of capital expenditures in connection with environmental compliance and remediation in 2011. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had a provision of $92 million for environmental expenditures, including certain asset retirement obligations (such as for landfill capping and asbestos removal) ($107 million as of December 31, 2010). The Company also could incur substantial costs, such as civil or criminal fines, sanctions and enforcement actions (including orders limiting its operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions), cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations. The Companys ongoing efforts to identify potential environmental concerns that may be associated with its past and present properties will lead to future environmental investigations. Those efforts will likely result in the determination of additional environmental costs and liabilities which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. As the owner and operator of real estate, the Company may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup, closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances, including asbestos, on or from its properties or operations. The amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and, in some cases, the Companys liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether it knew of, or caused, the release of hazardous substances and may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself. The discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at the Companys or third-party sites may result in significant additional costs. Any material liability the Company incurs could adversely impact its financial condition or preclude it from making capital expenditures that would otherwise benefit its business. In addition, the Company may be subject to asbestos-related personal injury litigation arising out of exposure to asbestos on or from its properties or operations, and may incur substantial costs as a result of any defense, settlement, or adverse judgment in such litigation. The Company may not have access to insurance proceeds to cover costs associated with asbestos-related personal injury litigation. 24 Table of Contents Enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations, or interpretation thereof, might require significant expenditures. For example, changes in climate change regulationSee Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, under the caption Climate change regulation, and see Part II, Item 8, Note 22 Commitments and Contingencies Industrial Boiler Maximum Achievable Controlled Technology Standard (MACT). The Company may be unable to generate funds or other sources of liquidity and capital to fund environmental liabilities or expenditures. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial results or condition. In addition to environmental laws, our business and operations are subject to a broad range of other laws and regulations in the United States and Canada as well as other jurisdictions in which we operate, including antitrust and competition laws, occupational health and safety laws and employment laws. Many of these laws and regulations are complex and subject to evolving and differing interpretation. If the Company is determined to have violated any such laws or regulations, whether inadvertently or willfully, it may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including substantial fines, or claims for damages by third parties which may have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Companys intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of its products and its brands. The Company relies on patent, trademark and other intellectual property laws of the United States and other countries to protect its intellectual property rights. However, the Company may be unable to prevent third parties from using its intellectual property without its authorization, which may reduce any competitive advantage it has developed. If the Company had to litigate to protect these rights, any proceedings could be costly, and it may not prevail. The Company cannot guarantee that any United States or foreign patents, issued or pending, will provide it with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties. Additionally, the Company has obtained and applied for United States and foreign trademark registrations, and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional service marks and trademarks, as appropriate. The Company cannot guarantee that any of its pending patent or trademark applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities and, even if the applications are approved, third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge these registrations. The failure to secure any pending patent or trademark applications may limit the Companys ability to protect the intellectual property rights that these applications were intended to cover. If the Company is unable to successfully retain and develop executive leadership and other key personnel, it may be unable to fully realize critical organizational strategies, goals and objectives. The success of the Company is substantially dependent on the efforts and abilities of its key personnel, including its executive management team, to develop and implement its business strategies and manage its operations. The failure to retain key personnel or to develop successors with appropriate skills and experience for key positions in the Company could adversely affect the development and achievement of critical organizational strategies, goals and objectives. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain or develop the key personnel it needs and the failure to do so may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. A third party has demanded an increase in consideration from Domtar Inc. under an existing contract. In July 1998, Domtar Inc. (now a 100% owned subsidiary of Domtar Corporation) acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of E.B. Eddy Limited and E.B. Eddy Paper, Inc. (E.B. Eddy), an integrated producer of specialty paper and wood products. The purchase agreement includes a purchase price adjustment whereby, in 25 Table of Contents the event of the acquisition by a third-party of more than 50% of the shares of Domtar Inc. in specified circumstances, Domtar Inc. may be required to pay an increase in consideration of up to a maximum of $118 million (CDN$120 million), an amount gradually declining over a 25-year period. At March 7, 2007, the maximum amount of the purchase price adjustment was approximately $108 million (CDN$110 million). On March 14, 2007, the Company received a letter from George Weston Limited (the previous owner of E.B. Eddy and a party to the purchase agreement) demanding payment of $108 million (CDN$110 million) as a result of the consummation of the series of transactions whereby the Fine Paper Business of Weyerhaeuser Company was transferred to the Company and the Company acquired Domtar Inc. (the Transaction). On June 12, 2007, an action was commenced by George Weston Limited against Domtar Inc. in the Superior Court of Justice of the Province of Ontario, Canada, claiming that the consummation of the Transaction triggered the purchase price adjustment and sought a purchase price adjustment of $108 million (CDN$110 million) as well as additional compensatory damages. The Company does not believe that the consummation of the Transaction triggers an obligation to pay an increase in consideration under the purchase price adjustment and intends to defend itself vigorously against any claims with respect thereto. However, the Company may not be successful in its defense of such claims, and if the Company is ultimately required to pay an increase in consideration, such payment may have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. On March 31, 2011, George Weston Limited filed a motion for summary judgment which the Company expects to be resolved by the Court in due course. No provision is recorded for this potential purchase price adjustment. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
