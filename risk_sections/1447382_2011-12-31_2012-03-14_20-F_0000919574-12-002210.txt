D. Risk factors." A. Operating results Overview We are an international offshore drilling contractor providing oilfield services and drilling vessels for offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production drilling, and specializing in the ultra-deepwater and harsh-environment segment of the offshore drilling industry. We currently own and operate two modern, fifth generation ultra-deepwater semi-submersible offshore drilling rigs, the Leiv Eiriksson and the Eirik Raude, and four sixth generation advanced capability ultra-deepwater drillships, the Ocean Rig Corcovado, which was delivered to us on January 3, 2011, the Ocean Rig Olympia, which was delivered to us on March 30, 2011, the Ocean Rig Poseidon, which was delivered to us on July 28, 2011, and the Ocean Rig Mykonos, which was delivered to us on September 30, 2011. We have newbuilding contracts with Samsung for the construction of three seventh generation, advanced capability ultra-deepwater drillships. These newbuilding drillships are currently scheduled for delivery in July 2013, September 2013, and November 2013, respectively. 50 History of our company We were formed under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands on December 10, 2007, under the name Primelead Shareholders Inc. and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of DryShips. Our predecessor, Ocean Rig ASA, was incorporated on September 26, 1996 under the laws of Norway and contracted for the construction of our two operating drilling rigs, the Leiv Eiriksson and the Eirik Raude. The shares of Ocean Rig ASA traded on the Oslo Stock Exchange from January 1997 to July 2008. In December 2007, Primelead Limited, our wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired approximately 30.4% of the outstanding capital stock of Ocean Rig ASA from Cardiff, a company controlled by the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of DryShips and us. After acquiring more than 33% of Ocean Rig ASA's outstanding shares through a series of transactions through April 2008, we launched a mandatory offer for the remaining shares of Ocean Rig ASA at a price of NOK45 per share, or $8.89 per share, as required by Norwegian law. We gained control over Ocean Rig ASA on May 14, 2008. As of July 10, 2008, we held 100% of the shares of Ocean Rig ASA, or 163.6 million shares, which we acquired at a total cost of $1.4 billion. With respect to the acquisition of Ocean Rig ASA, discussed above, DryShips purchased 4.4% of the share capital of Ocean Rig ASA from companies affiliated with our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. In March 2009, DryShips contributed to us all of its equity interests in the newbuilding vessel-owning companies of the Ocean Rig Poseidon and Ocean Rig Mykonos. In May 2009, we acquired the equity interests of Drillships Holdings Inc., the owner of the Ocean Rig Corcovado and the Ocean Rig Olympia, from third parties and entities affiliated with our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and, in exchange, we issued to the sellers common shares equal to 25% of our total issued and outstanding common shares as of May 15, 2009. In connection with the acquisition the Ocean Rig Corcovado and the Ocean Rig Olympia, we incurred debt obligations of $230.0 million, which has been repaid in full. In July 2009, DryShips acquired the remaining 25% of our total issued and outstanding capital stock from the minority interests held by third parties and entities controlled by our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer for a $50.0 million cash payment and the issuance of DryShips Series A Convertible Preferred Shares with an aggregate face value of $280.0 million, following which we became a wholly-owned subsidiary of DryShips. On December 21, 2010, we completed the sale of an aggregate of 28,571,428 of our common shares (representing approximately 22% of our outstanding common shares) in the private offering. A company controlled by our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. George Economou, purchased 2,869,428 common shares, or 2.38% of our outstanding common shares, in the private offering at the offering price of $17.50 per share. We received approximately $488.3 million of net proceeds from the private offering, of which we used $99.0 million to purchase an option contract from DryShips, our parent company, for the construction of up to four ultra-deepwater drillships, as discussed below. We applied the remaining proceeds to partially fund remaining installment payments for our newbuilding drillships and general corporate purposes. Following the completion of our private offering on December 21, 2010, DryShips owned approximately 78% of our outstanding common shares. 51 On April 27, 2011, we completed the issuance of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.5% senior unsecured notes due 2016 offered in a private placement. The net proceeds from the notes offering of approximately $487.5 million were used to finance our newbuilding drillships program and for general corporate purposes. See "—B. Liquidity and capital resources—Credit facilities—9.5% senior unsecured notes due 2016." On August 26, 2011, we commenced the Exchange Offer to exchange up to 28,571,428 shares of our new common stock that were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form F-4 (Registration No. 333-175940), for an equivalent number of our common shares previously sold in the private offering in December 2010. On September 29, 2011, an aggregate of 28,505,786 common shares were exchanged in the Exchange Offer. On October 5, 2011, DryShips completed the partial spin off of our Company by distributing an aggregate of 2,967,291 common shares of the Company, representing approximately a 2.25% stake in the Company, after giving effect to the treatment of fractional shares, on a pro rata basis to DryShips's shareholders of record as of September 21, 2011. In lieu of fractional shares, DryShips's transfer agent aggregated all fractional shares that would otherwise be distributable to DryShips's shareholders and sold a total of 105 common shares on behalf of those shareholders who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of our Company. Following the distribution, each such shareholder received a cash payment in an amount equal to its pro rata share of the total net proceeds of the sale of fractional shares. On September 19, 2011, our common shares commenced "when issued" trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker "ORIGV." Our common shares commenced "regular way" trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol "ORIG" on October 6, 2011. On November 3, 2011, the merger of Pelican Stockholdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of DryShips, and OceanFreight was completed, following approval by shareholders of OceanFreight at a special meeting of shareholders held on November 3, 2011. Following the completion of the merger, OceanFreight is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DryShips. Under the terms of the merger agreement, OceanFreight shareholders received $11.25 in cash and 0.52326 of a share of our common shares per share of OceanFreight common shares previously owned. Our common shares that comprised the stock portion of the merger consideration were previously outstanding shares that were owned by DryShips. Prior to the completion of the merger, on August 24, 2011, DryShips acquired from entities controlled by Mr. Anthony Kandylidis, the Chief Executive Officer of OceanFreight, all of their shares of OceanFreight, representing a majority of the outstanding shares of OceanFreight, for the same consideration per share that the OceanFreight shareholders received in the OceanFreight merger. Mr. Kandylidis is the son of one of the directors of DryShips and the nephew of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. George Economou. The Company's shares paid by DryShips to the entities controlled by Mr. Kandylidis were subject to a six-month lock-up period that expired in February 2012. On December 6, 2011, we announced that our board of directors had approved a repurchase program for up to a total of $500.0 million of our common shares and 9.5% senior unsecured notes due 2016. Our common shares and unsecured notes may be purchased under the program from time to time through December 31, 2013. Purchases made by us will be made for cash in open market transactions at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of purchases under the program will be determined by our management based on market conditions and other factors. We are not required to purchase any specific number or amount of common shares or unsecured notes under the program and the program may be suspended without our having purchased any common shares or unsecured notes or reinstated at any time in our discretion and without notice. As of March 6, 2012, we had not purchased any common shares or unsecured notes under the program described above. As of March 6, 2012, Dryships owned approximately 73.9% of our common shares. 52 Our drilling rigs Our drilling rigs are marketed for offshore exploration and development drilling programs worldwide, with particular focus on drilling operations in ultra-deepwater and harsh environments. The Leiv Eiriksson, delivered in 2001, has a water depth drilling capacity of 7,500 feet. Since 2001, it has drilled 39 deepwater and ultra-deepwater wells in a variety of locations, including Angola, Congo, Greenland, Turkey, Norway, the United Kingdom and Ireland, in addition to five shallow-water wells. In October 2009, the Leiv Eiriksson completed the Shell contract. In April 2009, the Leiv Eiriksson entered into a three-year contract with Petrobras Oil & Gas, or the Petrobras contract, for drilling operations in the Black Sea, offshore of Turkey, which was originally scheduled to expire in October 2012, but pursuant to an agreement with Petrobras Oil & Gas, the Petrobras contract terminated on April 10, 2011. The Leiv Eiriksson is currently employed under contract with Borders & Southern for drilling operations offshore the Falkland Islands that is scheduled to expire in the third quarter of 2012. The Eirik Raude, delivered in 2002, has a water depth drilling capacity of 10,000 feet. Since 2002, it has drilled 60 deepwater and ultra-deepwater wells in countries such as Canada, Ghana, Norway, Ivory Coast and the United Kingdom, and the Gulf of Mexico, in addition to six shallow-water wells. In October 2008, the Eirik Raude commenced a three-year contract with Tullow Oil. We amended the Tullow Oil contract to extend the term until mid-January 2012 for the drilling of one well offshore of West Africa, following which the Eirik Raude commenced a contract with Anadarko for drilling two wells offshore of West Africa. Our drillships We took delivery of the Ocean Rig Corcovado, the Ocean Rig Olympia, the Ocean Rig Poseidon and the Ocean Rig Mykonos, our four sixth generation advanced capability ultra-deepwater drillships on January 3, 2011, March 30, 2011, July 28, 2011 and September 30, 2011, respectively. In addition, we have entered into contracts with Samsung for the construction of three seventh generation advanced capability ultra-deepwater drillships, which are scheduled for delivery in July 2013, September 2013 and November 2013, respectively. We have secured employment for our operating drillships but not for our seventh generation newbuilding drillships. The total cost of construction and construction-related expenses for the Ocean Rig Corcovado the Ocean Rig Olympia, the Ocean Rig Poseidon and the Ocean Rig Mykonos amounted to approximately $755.7 million, $756.9 million, $791.8 million and $784.4 million, respectively. Construction-related expenses include equipment purchases, commissioning, supervision and commissions to related parties, excluding financing costs. As of December 31, 2011, we had made an aggregate of $726.7 million of the estimated total construction and construction-related payments relating to our three seventh generation drillships to be constructed by Samsung. On November 22, 2010, DryShips, our parent company, entered into a contract with Samsung that granted DryShips options for the construction of up to four additional ultra-deepwater drillships, which would be "sister-ships" to our operating drillships with certain upgrades to vessel design and specifications. The option agreement was novated by DryShips to us on December 30, 2010, at a cost of $99.0 million, which we paid from the net proceeds of a private offering of our common shares that we completed in December 2010. In addition, we paid additional deposits totaling $20.0 million to Samsung in the first quarter of 2011 to maintain favorable costs and yard slot timing under the option contract. On May 16, 2011, we entered into an addendum to the option contract with Samsung, pursuant to which Samsung granted us the option for the construction of up to two additional ultra-deepwater drillships, which would be "sister-ships" to its drillships and its seventh generation hulls, with certain upgrades to vessel design and specifications. We did not pay slot reservation fees in connection with the entry into this addendum. 53 As of March 6, 2012, we had exercised three of the six options and, as a result, have entered into shipbuilding contracts for our seventh generation hulls with deliveries scheduled in July 2013, September 2013 and November 2013, respectively. We have made payments of $726.7 million to the shipyard in connection with our exercise of the three newbuilding drillship options. The estimated total project cost per drillship for our seventh generation hulls under construction, excluding financing costs, ranges between $668.0 million and $678.0 million, consisting of $608.0 million of construction costs, upgrade costs to the existing drillship specifications of between $10.0 million and $20.0 million and construction-related expenses of $50.0 million. These upgrades include a seven ram blowout preventer, or BOP, a dual mud system and, with the purchase of additional equipment, the capability to drill up to 12,000 feet water depth. On January 27, 2012, we entered into a second addendum to our option contract with Samsung to extend the deadline for exercising the remaining three options for the construction of up to three additional seventh generation ultra-deepwater drillships from January 31, 2012 to April 2, 2012, with the first vessel being delivered in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the second and third vessels being delivered on the earliest available delivery dates based on the production schedule, as determined Samsung in its reasonable discretion. We estimate the total project cost per drillship for the remaining three optional drillships, excluding financing costs, to range between $668.0 million and $678.0 million, based on the construction expenses for our seventh generation hulls described above and assuming the drillships are built with the same specifications as the seventh generation hulls. As part of the novation of the contract described above, the benefit of the slot reservation fees passed to us. The amount of the slot reservation fees for the seventh generation hulls has been applied towards the contract prices of the three drillships under construction and the amount of the slot reservation fees applicable to one of the remaining three newbuilding drillship options will be applied towards the drillship contract price if the option is exercised. Management of our drilling units Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Ocean Rig AS, provides supervisory management services including onshore management, to our operating drilling rigs and drillships pursuant to separate management agreements entered into with each of the drilling unit-owning subsidiaries. In addition, Ocean Rig AS provides supervisory management services for our newbuilding drillships. Under the terms of these management agreements, Ocean Rig AS, through its offices in Stavanger, Norway, Aberdeen, United Kingdom and Houston, Texas, is responsible for, among other things, (i) assisting in construction contract technical negotiations, (ii) securing contracts for the future employment of the drillships; and (iii) providing commercial, technical and operational management for the drillships. Pursuant to the Global Services Agreement between DryShips and Cardiff, a company controlled by our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. George Economou, effective December 21, 2010, DryShips has engaged Cardiff to act as consultant on matters of chartering and sale and purchase transactions for the offshore drilling units operated by us. Under the Global Services Agreement, Cardiff, or its subcontractor, will (i) provide consulting services related to identifying, sourcing, negotiating and arranging new employment for offshore assets of DryShips and its subsidiaries, including our drilling units; and (ii) identify, source, negotiate and arrange the sale or purchase of the offshore assets of DryShips and its subsidiaries, including our drilling units. In consideration for such services, DryShips will pay to Cardiff a fee of 1% in connection with employment arrangements and 0.75% in connection with sale and purchase activities. We do not pay or reimburse DryShips or its affiliates for services provided under the Global Services Agreement. We do not pay for services provided in accordance with this agreement. The costs of services we receive under the Global Services Agreement are expensed in our consolidated statement of operations or capitalized as directly attributable to construction costs under "Rig under construction". The payment by DryShips for services provided to us under the agreement is deemed an equity contribution to us and is recorded as shareholders' contribution to shareholders' equity. See "Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related party transactions—Global Services Agreement." 54 The services provided by Ocean Rig AS and Cardiff overlap mainly with respect to negotiating shipyard orders and providing marketing for potential contractors. Cardiff has an established reputation within the shipping industry, and has developed expertise and a network of strong relationships with shipbuilders and oil companies, which supplement the management capabilities of Ocean Rig AS. Previously, we had management agreements with Cardiff pursuant to which Cardiff provided supervisory services in connection with the construction of the Ocean Rig Corcovado and the Ocean Rig Olympia. These agreements were terminated effective December 21, 2010. See "—Management Fees to Related Party" below. Factors affecting our results of operations We charter our drilling units to customers primarily pursuant to long-term drilling contracts. Under the drilling contracts, the customer typically pays us a fixed daily rate, depending on the activity and up-time of the drilling unit. The customer bears all fuel costs and logistics costs related to transport to and from the unit. We remain responsible for paying the unit's operating expenses, including the cost of crewing, catering, insuring, repairing and maintaining the unit, the costs of spares and consumable stores and other miscellaneous expenses. We believe that the most important measures for analyzing trends in the results of our operations consist of the following: · Employment Days: We define employment days as the total number of days the drilling units are employed on a drilling contract. · Dayrates or maximum dayrates: We define drilling dayrates as the maximum rate in U.S. Dollars possible to earn for drilling services for one 24 hour day at 100% efficiency under the drilling contract. Such dayrate may be measured by quarter-hour, half-hour or hourly basis and may be reduced depending on the activity performed according to the drilling contract. · Earnings efficiency / Earnings efficiency on hire: Earnings efficiency measures the effective earnings ratio, expressed as a percentage of the full earnings rate, after reducing for certain operations paid at a reduced rate, non-productive time at zero rate, or off hire without dayrates. Earnings efficiency on hire measures the earning efficiency only for the period during which the drilling unit is on contract and does not include off-hire periods. · Mobilization / demobilization fees: In connection with drilling contracts, we may receive revenues for preparation and mobilization of equipment and personnel or for capital improvements to the drilling vessels, dayrate or fixed price mobilization and demobilization fees. · Revenue: For each contract, we determine whether the contract, for accounting purposes, is a multiple element arrangement, meaning it contains both a lease element and a drilling services element, and, if so, identify all deliverables (elements). For each element we determine how and when to recognize revenue. Term contracts: These are contracts pursuant to which we agree to operate the unit for a specified period of time. For these types of contracts, we determine whether the arrangement is a multiple element arrangement. For revenues derived from contracts that contain a lease, the lease elements are recognized as "Leasing revenues" in the statement of operations on a basis approximating straight line over the lease period. The drilling services element is recognized as "Service revenues" in the period in which the services are rendered at fair value rates. Revenues related to the drilling element of mobilization and direct incremental expenses of drilling services are deferred and recognized over the estimated duration of the drilling period. 55 Well contracts: These are contracts pursuant to which we agree to drill a certain number of wells. Revenue from dayrate based compensation for drilling operations is recognized in the period during which the services are rendered at the rates established in the contracts. All mobilization revenues, direct incremental expenses of mobilization and contributions from customers for capital improvements are initially deferred and recognized as revenues over the estimated duration of the drilling period. Revenue from drilling contracts Our drilling revenues are driven primarily by the number of drilling units in our fleet, the contractual dayrates and the utilization of the drilling units. This, in turn, is affected by a number of factors, including the amount of time that our drilling units spend on planned off-hire class work, unplanned off-hire maintenance and repair, off-hire upgrade and modification work, reduced dayrates due to reduced efficiency or non-productive time, the age, condition and specifications of our drilling units, levels of supply and demand in the rig market, the price of oil and other factors affecting the market dayrates for drilling units. Historically, industry participants have increased supply of drilling units in periods of high utilization and dayrates. This has resulted in an oversupply and caused a decline in utilization dayrates. Therefore, dayrates have historically been very cyclical. Rig operating expenses Rig operating expenses include crew wages and related costs, catering, the cost of insurance, expenses relating to repairs and maintenance, the costs of spares and consumable stores, shore based costs and other miscellaneous expenses. Our rig operating expenses, which generally represent fixed costs, have historically increased as a result of the business climate in the offshore drilling sector. Specifically, wages and vendor supplied spares, parts and services have experienced a significant price increase over the previous two to three years. Other factors beyond our control, some of which may affect the offshore drilling industry in general, including developments relating to market prices for insurance, may also cause these expenses to increase. In addition, these rig operating expenses are higher when operating in harsh environments, though an increase in expenses is typically offset by the higher dayrates we receive when operating in these conditions. Depreciation We depreciate our drilling units on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Specifically, we depreciate bare-decks over 30 years and other asset parts over five to 15 years. We expense the costs associated with a five-year periodic class work. Management fees to related party From October 19, 2007 to December 21, 2010, we were party to, with respect to the Ocean Rig Corcovado and the Ocean Rig Olympia, separate management agreements with Cardiff pursuant to which Cardiff provided additional supervisory services in connection with these drillships including, among other things: (i) assisting in securing the required equity for the construction; (ii) negotiating, reviewing and proposing finance terms; (iii) assisting in marketing towards potential contractors; (iv) assisting in arranging, reviewing and supervising all aspects of building, equipment, financing, accounting, record keeping, compliance with laws and regulations; (v) assisting in procuring consultancy services from specialists; and (vi) assisting in finding prospective joint-venture partners and negotiating any such agreements. Pursuant to the management agreements, we paid Cardiff a management fee of $40,000 per month per drillship plus (i) a chartering commission of 1.25% on revenue earned; (ii) a commission of 1.0% on the shipyard payments or purchase price paid for drillships; (iii) a commission of 1.0% on loan financing; and (iv) a commission of 2.0% on insurance premiums. In accordance with the Addenda No. 1 to the above management agreements, dated as of December 1, 2010, these management agreements were terminated effective December 21, 2010; however, all obligations to pay for services rendered by Cardiff prior to termination remain in effect. As of December 31, 2010, these obligations totaled $5.8 million. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, total charges from Cardiff under the management agreement amounted to $5.8 million, $4.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively, which were capitalized as drillship under construction cost, being a cost directly attributable to the construction of the two drillships, the Ocean Rig Corcovado and the Ocean Rig Olympia. 56 See "—Management of our drilling units" and "Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related party transactions—Management agreements with Cardiff – Management fees to related party." General and administrative expenses Our general and administrative expenses mainly include the costs of our offices, including salary and related costs for members of senior management and our shore-side employees. Interest and finance costs In 2008, we completed a refinancing of Ocean Rig ASA, which was later reorganized into Drill Rigs Holdings Inc., to replace our secured bank debt and two bond issuances with secured bank debt only. Please see "—Our credit facilities—$1.04 billion credit facility." As of December 31, 2009 and after the completion of the acquisitions of the contracts for four newbuilding drillships in March and May 2009, we had total indebtedness of $1.2 billion. As of December 31, 2010, we had total indebtedness of $1.26 billion. As of December 31, 2011, we had total indebtedness of $2.78 billion. We capitalize our interest on the debt we have incurred in connection with our drillships under construction. Critical accounting policies Advances for drillships under construction: This represents amounts expended by the Company in accordance with the terms of the construction contracts for drillships as well as with a related party in connection with on-site supervision. In addition, interest costs incurred during the construction (until the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use) are capitalized. The carrying value of rigs and drillships under construction, or newbuildings, represents the accumulated costs at the balance sheet date. Cost components include payments for yard installments and variation orders, commissions to related party, construction supervision, equipment, or OFEs, spare parts, capitalized interest, certain non-reimbursable costs related to first time mobilization and commissioning costs. No charge for depreciation is made until commissioning of the newbuilding has been completed and it is ready for its intended use. Capitalized interest: Interest expense is capitalized during the construction period of rigs and drillships based on accumulated expenditures for the applicable project at the Company's current rate of borrowing. The amount of interest expense capitalized in an accounting period is determined by applying an interest rate, or the capitalization rate, to the average amount of accumulated expenditures for the asset during the period. The capitalization rates used in an accounting period are based on the rates applicable to borrowings outstanding during the period. The Company does not capitalize amounts in excess of actual interest expense incurred in the period. If the Company's financing plans associate a specific new borrowing with a qualifying asset, the Company uses the rate on that borrowing as the capitalization rate to be applied to that portion of the average accumulated expenditures for the asset that does not exceed the amount of that borrowing. If average accumulated expenditures for the asset exceed the amounts of specific new borrowings associated with the asset, the capitalization rate applied to such excess is a weighted average of the rates applicable to other borrowings of the Company. 57 Drilling unit machinery and equipment, net: Drilling units are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Such costs include the cost of adding or replacing parts of drilling unit machinery and equipment when that cost is incurred, if the recognition criteria are met. The recognition criteria require that the cost incurred extends the useful life of a drilling unit. The carrying amounts of those parts that are replaced are written off and the cost of the new parts is capitalized. Depreciation is calculated on a straight- line basis over the useful life of the assets as follows: bare-deck, 30 years and other asset parts, 5 to 15 years. The residual values of the drilling rigs and drillships are estimated at $35 million and $50 million, respectively. Drilling unit machinery and equipment, information technology and office equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives, for drilling unit machinery and equipment over 5 to 15 years and for information technology and office equipment over 5 years. Intangible assets: Our finite-lived acquired intangible assets are recorded at historical cost less accumu­lated amortization. Amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangibles as follows: Intangible assets/liabilities Years Tradenames 10 Software 10 Fair value of above market acquired drilling contracts over remaining contract term Trade names and software constitute the item "Intangible assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortization of these items are included in the line "Depreciation and amortization" in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Impairment of long-lived assets: The Company reviews for impairment long-lived assets and intangible long-lived assets held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. In this respect, the Company reviews its assets for impairment on a rig by rig and drillship by drillship and asset by asset basis. When the estimate of undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to be generated by the use of the asset is less than its carrying amount, the Company evaluates the asset for impairment loss. The impairment loss is determined by the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the fair value of the asset. The Company evaluates the carrying amounts of its drilling rigs and drillships by obtaining independent appraisals to determine if events have occurred that would require modification to their carrying values or useful lives. In evaluating useful lives and carrying values of long-lived assets, the Company reviews certain indicators of potential impairment, such as undiscounted projected operating cash flows, drilling rig/drillship sales and purchases, business plans and overall market conditions. In developing estimates of future undiscounted cash flows, the Company makes assumptions and estimates about the drilling rigs' and drillships' future performance, with the significant assumptions being related to charter rates, fleet utilization, operating expenses, capital expenditures, residual value and the estimated remaining useful life of each rig/drillship. The assumptions used to develop estimates of future undiscounted cash flows are based on historical trends as well as future expectations. To the extent impairment indicators are present, the Company determines undiscounted projected net operating cash flows for each rig/drillship and compares them to the rig or drillship's carrying value. The projected net operating cash flows are determined by considering the revenues from existing drilling contracts. The salvage value used in the impairment test is estimated to be $35 million and $50 million for drilling rigs and drillships, respectively, in accordance with the Company's depreciation policy. If the Company's estimate of undiscounted future cash flows for any drilling rig or drillship is lower than the carrying value, the carrying value is written down, by recording a charge to operations, to the vessel's fair market value if the fair market value is lower than the vessel's carrying value. The Company's analysis for the year ended December 31, 2011, which also involved sensitivity tests on the drilling rates and fleet utilization (being the most sensitive inputs to variances), allowing for variances ranging from 97.5% to 92.5%, indicated no impairment on any of its drilling rigs or drillships. Although the Company believes that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable and appropriate, such assumptions are highly subjective. There can be no assurance as to how long drilling rates and drilling rig and drillship values will remain at their currently high levels. As a result of the impairment review, the Company determined that the carrying amounts of its assets held for use were recoverable, and therefore, concluded that no impairment loss was necessary for 2009, 2010 and 2011. 58 Deferred financing costs: Deferred financing costs include fees, commissions and legal expenses associated with our long- term debt and are capitalized and recorded net with the underlying debt. These costs are amortized over the life of the related debt using the effective interest method and are included in interest expense. Unamortized fees relating to loans repaid or refinanced as debt extinguishments are expensed as interest and finance costs in the period the repayment or extinguishment is made. Revenue and related expenses: Revenues: Our services and deliverables are generally sold based upon contracts with our customers that include fixed or determinable prices. We recognize revenue when delivery occurs, as directed by our customer, or the customer assumes control of physical use of the asset and collectability is reasonably assured. We evaluate if there are multiple deliverables within our contracts and whether the agreement conveys the right to use the drill rigs for a stated period of time and meet the criteria for lease accounting, in addition to providing a drilling services element, which are generally compensated for by dayrates. In connection with drilling contracts, we may also receive revenues for preparation and mobilization of equipment and personnel or for capital improvements to the drilling rigs or drillships and dayrate or fixed price mobilization and demobilization fees. Revenues are recorded net of agents' commissions. There are two types of drilling contracts: well contracts and term contracts. Well contracts: Well contracts are contracts under which the assignment is to drill a certain number of wells. Revenue from dayrate-based compensation for drilling operations is recog­nized in the period during which the services are rendered at the rates established in the contracts. All mobilization revenues, direct incremental expenses of mobilization and contributions from customers for capital improvements are initially deferred and recognized as revenues over the estimated duration of the drilling period. To the extent that expenses exceed revenue to be recognized, they are expensed as incurred. Contingent demobilization revenues are recognized as the amounts become known over the demobilization period. Non-contingent demobilization revenues are recognized over the estimated duration of the drilling period. All costs of demobilization are expensed as incurred. All revenues for well contracts are recognized as "Service revenues" in the statement of operations. Term contracts: Term Contracts are contracts under which the assignment is to operate the drilling unit for a specified period of time. For these types of contracts we determine whether the arrangement is a multiple element arrangement containing both a lease element and drilling services element. For revenues derived from contracts that contain a lease, the lease elements are recognized as "Leasing revenues" in the statement of operations on a basis approximating straight line over the lease period. The drilling services element is recognized as "Service revenues" in the period in which the services are rendered at fair value. Revenues related to the drilling element of mobilization and direct incremental expenses of drilling services are deferred and recognized over the estimated duration of the drilling periods. To the extent that expenses exceed revenue to be recognized, they are expensed as incurred. Contingent demobilization revenues are recognized as the amounts become known over the demobilization period. Non-contingent demobilization revenues are recognized over the estimated duration of the drilling period. All costs of demobilization are expensed as incurred. Contributions from customers for capital improvements are initially deferred and recognized as revenues over the estimated duration of the drilling contract. 59 Income taxes: Income taxes have been provided for based upon the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income is earned. There is no expected relationship between the provision for/or benefit from income taxes and income or loss before income taxes because the countries in which we operate have taxation regimes that vary not only with respect to the nominal rate, but also in terms of the availability of deductions, credits and other benefits. Variations also arise because income earned and taxed in any particular country or countries may fluctuate from year to year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the anticipated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities using the applicable jurisdictional tax rates in effect at the year end. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We accrue interest and penalties related to its liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Inflation Inflation has not had a material effect on our expenses given current economic conditions. In the event that significant global inflationary pressures appear, these pressures could increase our operating, administrative and financing costs. Results of operations Included in this document are our audited consolidated historical financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Year ended December 31, 2011 compared to year ended December 31, 2010 (U.S. Dollars in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2010 Year Ended December 31, 2011 Change Percentage Change REVENUES: Total revenues 405,712 699,649 293,937 72.4 % EXPENSES: Drilling rigs operating expenses 119,369 281,833 162,464 136.1 % Depreciation and amortization 75,092 162,532 87,440 116.4 % Loss on disposal of assets 1,458 754 (704 ) (48.3 %) General and administrative expenses 19,443 37,639 18,196 93.6 % Total operating expenses 215,362 482,758 267,396 124.2 % Operating income 190,350 216,891 26,541 13.9 % Interest and finance costs (8,418 ) (68,982 ) (60,564 ) 719.5 % Interest income 12,464 9,810 (2,654 ) (21.3 %) Gain/(loss) on interest rate swaps (40,303 ) (33,455 ) 6,848 (17.0 %) Other, net 1,104 (1,538 ) (2,642 ) (239.3 %) Total finance expenses, net (35,153 ) (94,165 ) (59,012 ) 167.9 % Income/(loss) before taxes 155,197 122,726 (32,471 ) (20.9 %) Income taxes (20,436 ) (27,428 ) (6,992 ) 34.2 % Net income attributable to Ocean Rig UDW Inc. $ 134,761 $ 95,298 $ (39,463 ) (29.3 %) 60 Revenues Revenues from drilling contracts increased by $293.9 million, or 72.4%, to $699.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $405.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase is primarily attributable to the operation of our six drilling units (two drill rigs and four drillships) in 2011, compared to the operation of two drill rigs in 2010. The Ocean Rig Olympia, Ocean Rig Corcovado and Ocean Rig Poseidon were delivered and commenced drilling activities during the year ended December 31, 2011. The day rates for the contracts on which our drilling units were employed during the year ranged between $415,000 and $665,473 per day. Operating expenses Drilling rigs operating expenses increased by $162.5 million, or 136.1%, to $281.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $119.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in operating expenses of $162.5 million is mainly due to $132.3 million in increased operating expenses from the commencement of drilling operations of the Ocean Rig Corcovado, the Ocean Rig Olympia, the Ocean Rig Poseidon and the Ocean Rig Mykonos during 2011, $15.3 million related to the 10-year class survey of the Leiv Eiriksson and $15.0 million in increased operating expenses relating to the Eirik Raude due to a more extensive maintenance program performed during 2011. Depreciation and amortization expense Depreciation and amortization expense for the drilling rigs increased by $87.4 million, or 116.4%, to $162.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $75.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in depreciation and amortization was attributable to the depreciation related to our four operating drillships delivered during 2011. Loss on sale of assets Loss on disposal of assets amounting to $0.8 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to the disposal of rig equipment. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses increased by $18.2 million, or 93.6%, to $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase of $20.9 million is mainly due to increased costs relating to the management of six drilling units during the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to two drilling units during the year ended December 31, 2010, as well as professional fees related to the Company's exchange offer completed in September 2011, which is partly offset by $2.7 million relating to foreign exchange gain. 61 Interest and finance costs Interest and finance costs increased by $60.6 million, or 719.5%, to $69.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase is mainly due to higher average debt, costs associated with debt issuance and increased interest rates during 2011. Interest income Interest income decreased by $2.7 million, or 21.3%, to $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease is due to lower interest rates on our deposits during 2011, although the average cash balances increased significantly during the same period. Loss on interest rate swaps Loss on interest rate swaps decreased by $6.8 million, or 17.0%, to $33.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to a loss of $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The loss for the year ended December 31, 2011 is mainly due to mark to market losses of outstanding swap positions as interest rates trended downwards. Other, net Other, net decreased by $2.6 million, or 239.3%, to a loss of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to a gain of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease is due to net losses on currency forward contracts. Income taxes Income taxes increased by $7.0 million, or 34.2%, to $27.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. As our drilling units operate around the world, they may become subject to taxation in many different jurisdictions. The basis for such taxation depends on the relevant regulation in the countries in which we operate. Consequently, there is no expected relationship between the income tax expense or benefit for the period and the income or loss before taxes. Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to year ended December 31, 2009 (U.S. Dollars in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2009 Year Ended December 31, 2010 Change Percentage Change REVENUES: Total revenues 388,122 405,712 17,590 4.5 % EXPENSES: Drilling rigs operating expenses 133,256 119,369 (13,887 ) (10.4 %) Depreciation and amortization 75,348 75,092 (256 ) (0.3 %) Loss on disposal of assets - 1,458 1,458 - General and administrative expenses 17,955 19,443 1,488 8.3 % Total operating expenses 226,559 215,362 (11,197 ) (4.9 %) Operating income / (loss) 161,563 190,350 28,787 17.8 % Interest and finance costs (46,120 ) (8,418 ) 37,702 (81.7 %) Interest income 6,259 12,464 6,205 99.1 % Gain/(loss) on interest rate swaps 4,826 (40,303 ) (45,129 ) (935.1 %) Other, net 2,023 1,104 (919 ) (45.4 %) Total finance expenses, net (33,012 ) (35,153 ) (2,141 ) 6.5 % Income/(loss) before taxes 128,551 155,197 26,646 20.7 % Income taxes (12,797 ) (20,436 ) (7,639 ) 59.7 % Net income attributable to Ocean Rig UDW Inc. $ 115,754 $ 134,761 $ 19,007 16.4 % 62 Revenues Revenues from drilling contracts increased by $17.6 million, or 4.5%, to $405.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to $388.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase is primarily attributable to higher maximum dayrate achieved by both the Eirik Raude and the Leiv Eiriksson during the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. The maximum day rates for the contracts on which our drilling units were employed during the period ranged between $583,000 and $647,000 per day. Operating expenses Drilling rigs operating expenses decreased by $13.9 million, or 10.4%, to $119.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $133.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to lower crew costs and catering costs for 2010, as a result of operations in Turkey in 2010, where costs are lower than they were in Norway, where we operated in 2009. Depreciation and amortization expense Depreciation and amortization expense of $75.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 was materially unchanged from $75.3 million for 2009. 63 Loss on sale of assets We recorded a loss on sale of assets of $1.5 million as a result of the disposal of various drilling rig equipment for the year ended December 31, 2010. There was no such gain or loss for the year ended December 31, 2009. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses increased by $1.5 million, or 8.3%, to $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to higher consulting fees. Interest and finance costs Interest and finance costs decreased by $37.7 million, or 81.7%, to $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $46.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease is due to a higher level of capitalization of interest expense and lower average debt levels. Interest income Interest income increased by $6.2 million, or 99.1%, to $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase is mainly due to higher interest rates on bank deposits and higher average bank deposits included in restricted cash. Loss on interest rate swaps Loss on interest rate swaps increased by $45.1 million, to $40.3 million, for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to a gain of $4.8 million in 2009 on interest rate swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting. The loss for the year ended December 31, 2010 was due to mark-to-market losses from a decreasing interest rate level for the applicable interest swap durations. Other, net Other, net decreased by $0.9 million, or 45.4%, to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease is due to lower gains on currency forward contracts. Income taxes Income taxes increased by $7.6 million, or 59.7%, to $20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. As our drilling units operate around the world, they may become subject to taxation in many different jurisdictions. The basis for such taxation depends on the relevant regulation in the countries in which we operate. Consequently, there is no expected relationship between the income tax expense or benefit for the period and the income or loss before taxes. B. Liquidity and capital resources As of December 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents of $250.9 million and $57.1 million of current and $125.0 million of non-current restricted cash mainly related to restricted bank deposits pledged as cash collateral under various secured credit agreements and minimum cash and cash equivalents, or minimum liquidity, required under various secured credit facilities. As of December 31, 2011, we had total indebtedness of $2.8 billion under various senior secured credit facilities and our 9.5% senior unsecured notes, excluding unamortized financing fees. Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2011 increased by $155.2 million, or 162.1%, to $250.9 million, compared to $95.7 million as of December 31, 2010, while our restricted cash balances as of December 31, 2011 decreased by $380.7 million, or 67.6%, to $182.1 million, compared to $562.8 million as of December 31, 2010. The increase in our cash and cash equivalents was mainly due to the receipt of $1.9 billion in new secured vessel financing, $500 million in gross proceeds from our 9.5% senior notes offering, $270.7 million in surplus cash from operational activities and the decrease in restricted cash, which was partly offset by payments of yard installments and capital upgrades amounting to $1.9 billion and loan repayments of $926.7 million. The decrease in restricted cash balances was primarily due to the repayment of our $300.0 million short-term credit facility and corresponding release of restricted cash and the partial release of restricted cash under our two Deutsche Bank credit facilities following drawdowns that were partly offset by additional restricted cash deposits required under our $800.0 million credit facility and our two Deutsche Bank credit facilities. 64 Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2011 increased by $1.5 billion, or 116.2%, to $2.8 billion, compared to $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2010 due to $1.9 billion of additional secured senior bank financing and the issuance of $500 million of 9.5% senior unsecured notes offering in April 2011, which was partly offset by payments and repayments of long and short term debt. As of December 31, 2011, our total purchase commitments consisted of the remaining construction expenses of $1.3 billion, relating to the construction of our three seventh generation hulls, which are scheduled to be delivered in July 2013, September 2013 and November 2013, respectively. The estimated total project cost per drillship for our seventh generation hulls under construction, excluding financing costs, ranges between $668.0 million and $678.0 million, consisting of $608.0 million of construction costs, upgrade costs to the existing drillship specifications of between $10.0 million and $20.0 million and construction-related expenses of $50.0 million. As of December 31, 2011, we made pre-delivery payments of $726.7 million in the aggregate for these three newbuilding drillships. We have not yet arranged financing for the remaining $1.3 billion of construction and construction-related payments for the newbuilding drillships, which are due upon the delivery of the drillships, scheduled in the second half of 2013. We plan to finance these capital expenditures with new debt or equity financing. We may exercise our options under our contract with Samsung to purchase up to three additional newbuilding drillships any time on or prior to April 2, 2012. To the extent we exercise any of these options, with an estimated total project cost, excluding financing costs, of approximately $2.0 billion in the aggregate, assuming these optional drillships are built with the same specifications as our seventh generation hulls under construction, we will incur additional payment obligations for which we have not arranged financing. Working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities (including the current portion of long-term debt). Our working capital surplus amounted to $83.9 million as of December 31, 2011, compared to $4.1 million as of December 31, 2010. The working capital surplus as of December 31, 2011 is primarily due to cash balance exceeding debt falling due within a year. If we do not maintain our working capital surplus, or if we return to a working capital deficit and such a working capital deficit continues to grow, lenders may be unwilling to provide future financing or will provide future financing at significantly increased interest rates, which will negatively affect our earnings, liquidity and capital position, and our ability to make timely payments on our newbuilding purchase contracts and to meet our debt repayment obligations. Our principal use of funds has been capital expenditures to establish and grow our fleet, maintain the quality of our drilling units, comply with international standards, environmental laws and regulations, fund working capital requirements and make principal repayments on outstanding loan facilities. Since our formation, our principal source of funds has been equity provided by our shareholders, operating cash flows, our equity and notes offerings and long-term bank borrowings. From January 1, 2009 to December 3, 2010, we received $1.3 billion in cash from our parent company, DryShips, in the form of capital contributions to meet obligations for capital expenditures on our drillships under construction and debt repayments during the period. In 2011, we did not receive cash capital contributions from DryShips. In March and April 2011, we borrowed an aggregate amount of $175.5 million from DryShips through shareholder loans, which we repaid in full in April 2011. Based on our current liquidity position, we do not expect to require funding from DryShips over the next 12 months. As we are no longer a wholly owned subsidiary of DryShips, even if it is able to do so, DryShips may be unwilling to provide continued funding or credit support for our capital expenditure requirements or only provide such funding in return for market rate repayment and interest rates or issuances of equity securities, which could be significantly dilutive to other shareholders. 65 As of December 31, 2011, we had no available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and aggregate debt outstanding of $2.8 billion. As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all covenants related to our various credit facilities. Please refer to the discussion on Long-term Debt as detailed in Note 8 of our audited condensed consolidated financial statements. Due to the decline in vessel values in the drybulk shipping sector, DryShips was in breach of certain of its financial covenants as of December 31, 2008 and, as a result, obtained waiver agreements from its lenders waiving the violations of such covenants. Certain of these waiver agreements expire during 2012, at which time the original covenants under the loan agreements come back into effect. In addition, as of December 31, 2011, DryShips was not in compliance with the loan-to-value ratios contained in certain of its loan agreements under which a total of $185.8 million was outstanding as of that date, out of DryShips’s group consolidated debt of approximately $4.4 billion as of December 31, 2011, and has obtained a waiver of the breach relating to approximately $97.3 million of this outstanding indebtedness until March 31, 2012. As a result of the aforementioned non-compliance, DryShips may be required to prepay indebtedness or provide additional collateral to its lenders in the form of cash or other property in the total amount of $83.0 million in order to comply with these ratios, including $64.4 million that will be payable on March 31, 2012 in the event that DryShips is not in compliance with the applicable loan-to-value ratio for which it has obtained a waiver until March 31, 2012. There can be no assurance that DryShips will regain compliance with the original covenants when the waivers expire or be able to obtain extensions upon the expiration of such waivers. Due to the cross-default provisions in our loan agreements that are triggered in the event of a default by us under one of our other loan agreements or, in certain cases, a default by DryShips under one of its loan agreements, our lenders could accelerate our indebtedness if DryShips fails to (i) obtain a waiver for any covenant breach or remedy any such breach within the required time period; or (ii) successfully extend the existing waiver agreements or comply with the applicable covenants in the original loan agreements, as applicable. See "—Compliance with financial covenants under secured credit facilities" below. Our internally generated cash flow is directly related to our business and the market sectors in which we operate. Should the drilling market deteriorate, or should we experience poor results in our operations, cash flow from operations may be reduced. As of March 6, 2012, assuming the drilling or financing markets do not deteriorate, we believe that our current cash balances and operating cash flow, together with any debt or equity issuances in the future, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next 12 months, including minimum cash requirements under our loan agreements, of which $219.2 million is due in 2012. Our access to debt and equity markets may be reduced or closed due to a variety of events, including a credit crisis, credit rating agency downgrades of our debt, industry conditions, general economic conditions, market conditions and market perceptions of us and our industry. Compliance with financial covenants under secured credit facilities Our secured credit facilities impose operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions generally limit our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things (i) pay dividends; (ii) incur additional indebtedness; (iii) create liens on their assets; (iv) change the management and/or ownership of the drilling units; and (v) change the general nature of their business. For example, we are prohibited from paying dividends under our $800 million secured term loan agreement without the lender's consent. In addition, our existing secured credit facilities require us and certain of our subsidiaries to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial covenants, including to ensure that the market value of the mortgaged drilling unit under the applicable credit facility, determined in accordance with the terms of that facility, does not fall below a certain percentage of the outstanding amount of the loan, which we refer to as a value maintenance clause (which becomes applicable upon the completion of construction and following the delivery of the applicable drillship to us). In general, these financial covenants relate to the maintenance of (i) minimum amount of free cash; (ii) leverage ratio not to exceed specified levels; (iii) minimum interest coverage ratio; (iv) minimum current ratio (the ratio of current assets to current liabilities); and (v) minimum equity ratio (the ratio of value adjusted equity to value adjusted total assets). In addition, DryShips, as a guarantor under our Deutsche Bank credit facilities and our $800.0 million senior secured term loan agreement, is required to maintain certain financial covenants, as guarantor under the facilities. In general, these financial covenants require DryShips to maintain (i) minimum liquidity; (ii) a minimum market adjusted equity ratio; (iii) a minimum interest coverage ratio; (iv) a minimum market adjusted net worth; and (v) a minimum debt service coverage ratio. 66 Furthermore, all of our loan agreements also contain a cross-default provision that may be triggered by either a default under one of our other loan agreements or a default by DryShips under one of its loan agreements. A cross-default provision means that a default on one loan would result in a default on all of our other loans. A default by DryShips under one of its loan agreements would trigger a cross-default under our Deutsche Bank credit facilities and would provide our lenders with the right to accelerate the outstanding debt under these facilities. Further, if DryShips defaults under one of its loan agreements, and the related debt is accelerated, this would trigger a cross-default under our $1.04 billion credit facility and our $800.0 million secured term loan agreement and would provide our lenders with the right to accelerate the outstanding debt under these facilities. In general, a violation of financial covenants constitutes a breach under our credit facilities and our lenders may declare an event of default, which would, unless waived by our lenders, provide our lenders with the right to require us to post additional collateral, enhance our equity and liquidity, increase our interest payments, pay down our indebtedness to a level where we are in compliance with our loan covenants, sell assets, reclassify our indebtedness as current liabilities and accelerate our indebtedness, which would impair our ability to continue to conduct our business. As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all covenants related to our various credit facilities. Due to the decline in vessel values in the drybulk shipping sector, DryShips was in breach of certain of its financial covenants as of December 31, 2008 and, as a result, obtained waiver agreements from its lenders waiving the violations of such covenants. Certain of these waiver agreements expire during 2012, at which time the original covenants under the loan agreements come back into effect. In addition, as of December 31, 2011, DryShips was not in compliance with the loan-to-value ratios contained in certain of its loan agreements under which a total of $185.8 million was outstanding as of that date, out of DryShips’s group consolidated debt of approximately $4.4 billion as of December 31, 2011, and has obtained a waiver of the breach relating to approximately $97.3 million of this outstanding indebtedness until March 31, 2012. As a result of the aforementioned non-compliance, DryShips may be required to prepay indebtedness or provide additional collateral to its lenders in the form of cash or other property in the total amount of $83.0 million in order to comply with these ratios, including $64.4 million that will be payable on March 31, 2012 in the event that DryShips is not in compliance with the applicable loan-to-value ratio for which we have obtained a waiver until March 31, 2012. There can be no assurance that DryShips will regain compliance with the original covenants when the waivers expire or be able to obtain extensions upon the expiration of such waivers. Furthermore, if DryShips does not remedy covenant breaches, this may trigger cross-default provisions in our loan agreements. We do not guarantee, or otherwise become directly liable for, DryShips’s indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated pursuant to the cross-default provisions, it will be very difficult in the current financing environment for us to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing and we could lose our drilling rigs if our lenders foreclose their liens. We expect that cash on hand and cash generated from operations would be sufficient to repay our loans that have cross-default provisions, which aggregated approximately $2.3 billion, excluding our 9.5% senior unsecured notes, as of December 31, 2011. However, in the event we do not have sufficient cash on hand and cash generated from operations to repay our loans that have cross-default provisions if that debt were to be accelerated by our lenders, we would have to seek to access the capital markets to fund the mandatory payments, although such financing may not be available on attractive terms or at all. Our credit facilities Existing credit facilities $1.04 billion senior secured credit facility On September 17, 2008, our wholly-owned subsidiaries Ocean Rig ASA and Ocean Rig Norway AS entered into a revolving credit and term loan facility with a syndicate of lenders that was amended and restated on November 19, 2009, to, among other things, add Drill Rigs Holdings Inc. as a borrower. This credit facility is in the aggregate amount of approximately $1.04 billion. The $1.04 billion credit facility consists of a guarantee facility, which provides us with a letter of credit of up to $20.0 million, which has been drawn, three revolving credit facilities in the amounts of $350.0 million, $250.0 million and $20.0 million, respectively, and a term loan in the amount of up to $400.0 million. On September 30 and October 10, 2008, Ocean Rig ASA drew down $750.0 million and $250.0 million, respectively, under this facility for the repayment of approximately $776.0 million under a previous credit facility and for general corporate purposes. Amounts outstanding under the $1.04 billion credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin and the loan is repayable in 20 quarterly installments plus a balloon payment of $400.0 million payable together with the last installment, on September 17, 2013. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the outstanding balance under this loan agreement was $522.5 million and $675.8 million, respectively. 67 The $1.04 billion credit facility is secured by, among other things, (i) first and second priority mortgages over the Leiv Eiriksson and the Eirik Raude; (ii) first and second priority assignment of all insurances and earnings of the Leiv Eiriksson and the Eirik Raude; (iii) pledges of shares of certain of our subsidiaries and (iv) first and second mortgages over the machinery and plant of certain of our subsidiaries. Under the $1.04 billion credit facility, Drill Rigs Holdings Inc. and its subsidiaries are subject to certain covenants requiring, among other things, the maintenance of (i) a minimum amount of free cash; (ii) a leverage ratio not to exceed specified levels; (iii) a minimum interest coverage ratio; (iv) a minimum current ratio (the ratio of current assets to current liabilities); and (v) a minimum equity ratio (the ratio of value adjusted equity to value adjusted total assets). In addition, capital expenditures must not exceed $50.0 million in any fiscal year and capital expenditures in excess of $30.0 million require the prior consent of the lender. Further, the aggregate market value of the Eirik Raude and the Leiv Eiriksson be at least equal to 135% of the principal amount of the borrowings outstanding under the term loan facility and of the $350.0 million and $20.0 million revolving credit facilities. Furthermore, pursuant to the terms of the $1.04 billion credit facility, if any person or persons acting in concert (other than DryShips or other companies controlled by Mr. George Economou, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of DryShips) obtains either direct or indirect control of one-third or more of the shares in Drill Rigs Holdings Inc., notice must be provided to the Agent, who may, upon the instruction of any lender, cancel all commitments and declare outstanding loans and accrued interest due and payable. The $1.04 billion credit facility also contains restrictions on the ability of Drill Rigs Holdings Inc. to pay dividends, make distributions to its shareholders, and reduce share capital without the prior written consent of the lenders. This loan agreement contains other customary restrictive covenants and events of default, including non-payment of principal or interest, breach of covenants or material representations, bankruptcy and imposes insurance requirements and restrictions on the employment of the vessels. This credit facility contains a cross-default provision that applies to us and DryShips. This means that if we or DryShips default, by way of non-payment of principal and interest or by way of acceleration or cancellation of debt, we will be in default of this loan. Our wholly-owned subsidiary Drill Rigs Holdings Inc. has entered into three interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rate on the principal amounts outstanding under this loan agreement. See "—Swap agreements" below for a description of these interest rate swap agreements. The outstanding balance of this facility, as of March 6, 2012, was $522.5 million. Two $562.5 million senior secured credit facilities, amended to $495.0 million each (the Deutsche Bank credit facilities) On July 18, 2008, Drillship Kithira Owners Inc. and Drillship Skopelos Owners Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the owners of our newbuilding drillships, the Ocean Rig Poseidon and the Ocean Rig Mykonos, respectively, each entered into separate loan agreements with a syndicate of lenders, including Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, in the amount of $562.5 million to partially finance the construction cost of the Ocean Rig Poseidon and the Ocean Rig Mykonos, including payment of financing fees, incidental drillship costs, commitment fees, loan interest, and a portion of the second yard installments. We refer to these credit facilities as the Deutsche Bank credit facilities. Both of the loans bear interest at a rate that is in part fixed and in part based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin and are repayable in 18 semi-annual installments of $31.25 million through September 2020 and November 2020, respectively. These agreements and the waivers and consents contained therein were terminated pursuant to the terms of the Supplemental Agreement No. 3, dated January 29, 2010, to each of these credit facilities because we, including DryShips, were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in this loan agreement. 68 On June 5, 2009, we entered into agreements with the facility agent and certain other lenders with respect to each of these credit facilities providing for a waiver of certain financial covenants through January 31, 2010. These agreements and the waivers and consents contained therein were terminated pursuant to the terms of the Supplemental Agreement No. 3, dated January 29, 2010, to each of these credit facilities because we and DryShips were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in this loan agreement. This credit facility contains a cross-default provision that applies to us and DryShips. This means that if we or DryShips default under any of our other loan obligations, we will be in default of this loan. On April 27, 2011, we entered into an agreement with the lenders under our two Deutsche Bank credit facilities to amend these facilities. As a result of this restructuring, (i) the maximum amount permitted to be drawn was reduced from $562.5 million to $495.0 million under each facility; (ii) in addition to the guarantee already provided by DryShips, we provided an unlimited recourse guarantee that includes certain financial covenants; and (iii) we are permitted to draw under the facility with respect to the Ocean Rig Poseidon based upon the employment of the drillship under its drilling contract with Petrobras Tanzania, and on April 27, 2010, the cash collateral deposited for this vessel was released. On August 10, 2011, we amended the terms of the credit facility for the construction of the Ocean Rig Mykonos to allow for full drawdowns to finance the remaining installment payments for this drillship based on the contract with Petrobras Brazil for the Ocean Rig Mykonos and on August 10, 2011, the cash collateral deposited for the drillship was released. The amendment also requires that the Ocean Rig Mykonos be re-employed under a contract acceptable to the lenders meeting certain minimum terms and dayrates at least six months, in lieu of 12 months, prior to the expiration of the contract with Petrobras Brazil. All other material terms of the credit facility were unchanged. Each Deutsche Bank loan agreement is secured by, among other things, a first priority mortgage on the relevant vessel and a reserve account pledge. Each loan agreement contains a loan to value ratio relating to the post-delivery market value of the relevant vessel. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the outstanding balance under the Deutsche Bank credit facilities was $990.0 million and $194.5 million, respectively. These loan agreements are guaranteed by DryShips. The guarantee covers the initial equity contribution and each other equity contribution, the equity collateral, amounts to be paid into the debt service reserve account and each payment of the loan balance. The guarantee by DryShips contains certain financial covenants measured on the DryShips financial accounts requiring the maintenance of (i) a minimum market adjusted equity ratio; (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio; (iii) a minimum market value adjusted net worth of DryShips and its subsidiaries; and (iv) a minimum amount of free cash and cash equivalents. In addition, as noted above, we provided an unlimited recourse guarantee under the terms of the restructuring of these loan agreements whereby we are required to comply with certain financial covenants requiring that we maintain (i) a minimum equity ratio; (ii) a minimum amount of working capital; (iii) a maximum leverage ratio; (iv) a minimum interest coverage ratio; and (v) a minimum amount of free cash. The loan agreements contain customary restrictive covenants and events of default, including non-payment of principal or interest, minimum insurance requirements, breach of covenants or material misrepresentations, bankruptcy, and change of control and impose restrictions on the payments of dividends and employment of the vessels. 69 In addition, due to the cross-default provisions in these credit facilities, a default by DryShips under one of its loan agreements would trigger a cross-default under our Deutsche Bank credit facilities and would provide our lenders with the right to accelerate the outstanding debt under these facilities. Further, if DryShips defaults under one of its loan agreements, and the related debt is accelerated, this would trigger a cross-default under our $1.04 billion credit facility and our $800.0 million secured term loan agreement and would provide our lenders with the right to accelerate the outstanding debt under these facilities. We have entered into four interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rate payable on the principal amounts outstanding under the Deutsche Bank credit facilities. See "—Swap agreements" below for a description of the interest rate swap agreements. The outstanding balance of this facility, as of March 6, 2012, was $962.5 million. $800.0 million senior secured term loan agreement On April 15, 2011, our wholly owned subsidiary Drillships Holdings Inc., or Drillships Holdings, entered into a $800 million senior secured term loan agreement with a syndicate of lenders to fund a portion of the construction of the Ocean Rig Corcovado and the Ocean Rig Olympia. The $800 million senior secured term loan agreement consists of four term loans, which were all fully drawn in April 2011. A portion of the loans was used to refinance the $325 million short term loan facility, as discussed below. Amounts outstanding under the $800 million senior secured term loan agreement bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin and the loan is repayable in 20 quarterly installments plus a balloon payment of $488.3 million payable together with the last installment payment. The $800 million senior secured term loan agreement is secured by, among other things, the first priority rights to (i) the mortgages over the Ocean Rig Corcovado and the Ocean Rig Olympia; (ii) the assignment of earnings; (iii) the assignment of earnings accounts; (iv) the minimum cash accounts; (v) the insurances; and (vi) the all of the shares of Drillships Holdings Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Drillship Hydra Shareholders Inc., Drillship Hydra Owners Inc., Ocean Rig Corcovado Greenland Operations Inc., Ocean Rig Black Sea Coop, Ocean Rig Black Sea Operations B.V., Drillship Paros Shareholders Inc., Drillship Paros Owners Inc., Ocean Rig Olympia Ghana Operations Ltd and Drillships Holdings Operations Inc. As of December 31, 2011, the outstanding balance under this loan was $766.7 million. Under the $800 million senior secured term loan agreement, we and certain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors, are subject to certain covenants requiring among other things, the maintenance of (i) a minimum amount of free cash; (ii) a leverage ratio not to exceed specified levels; (iii) a minimum interest coverage ratio; (iv) a minimum current ratio; and (v) a minimum equity ratio. In addition, DryShips, as guarantor, must maintain (i) minimum liquidity; (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio; (iii) a minimum market adjusted equity ratio; and (iv) a minimum market value adjusted net worth. Further, the aggregate market value of the Ocean Rig Corcovado and the Ocean Rig Olympia must be greater than 140% of the total borrowings outstanding under the senior secured term loan. Also, the $800 million senior secured term loan agreement restricts our and Drillships Holdings' ability to pay dividends, make any distribution to its shareholders or buy-back common shares, except for dividends paid by Drillships Holdings to us from the first distribution and relating to the refinancing of capital expenditures for the Ocean Rig Corcovado and the Ocean Rig Olympia. Furthermore, pursuant to the terms of the $800 million senior secured term loan agreement, if, after an initial public offering, any person or group (other than George Economou and DryShips) acquire beneficial ownership of more than 50% of our equity, or, if George Economou and DryShips fails (i) prior to an initial public offering, to hold 65% of the aggregate ordinary voting power and economic interest in us; or (ii) after an initial public offering, to hold 15% aggregate ordinary voting power and economic interest in us, then all outstanding amounts under the $800 million senior secured term loan agreement are required to be prepaid within 60 days. 70 The $800 million senior secured term loan agreement contains other customary restrictive covenants and events of default, including non-payment of principal or interest, breach of covenants or material representations, bankruptcy and imposes insurance requirements and restrictions on the employment of the vessels. The $800 million senior secured term loan agreement contains a cross-default provision that applies to us and DryShips, as guarantor. This means that if we or DryShips default, by way of non-payment of principal or interest or by way of acceleration or cancellation of debt, we will be in default of this loan. We have entered into two interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rate payable on the principal amounts outstanding under the $800.0 million senior secured term loan agreement. See "—Swap agreements" below for a description of the interest rate swap agreements. The outstanding balance under this loan as of March 6, 2012 was $750.0 million. 9.5% senior unsecured notes due 2016 On April 27, 2011, we completed the issuance of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 9.5% senior unsecured notes due 2016 in an offering made to both non-U.S. persons in Norway in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act and to qualified institutional buyers in the United States in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, which we refer to as the notes offering. We received net proceeds from the notes offering of approximately $487.5 million, which were used to finance a portion of the remaining payments under our newbuiliding program and for general corporate purposes. DryShips, our parent company, purchased $75.0 million of our 9.5% senior unsecured notes due 2016 from a third party on May 18, 2011. Under the terms of the bond agreement, also referred to herein as the indenture, dated April 14, 2011, we will pay interest on the notes at a rate of 9.5% per annum. We will make interest payments on the bonds semi-annually in arrears on October 27 and April 27 of each year, beginning October 27, 2011 until the bonds' final maturity on April 27, 2016. Interest will accrue from the issue date of the notes. The notes will not be guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries. The notes will be our unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our future subordinated indebtedness and equally in right of payment to all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. We may redeem some or all of the notes as follows: (i) at any time and from time to time from April 27, 2014 to April 26, 2015, at a redemption price equal to 104.5% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption; or (ii) at any time and from time to time from April 27, 2015 at a redemption price equal to 102.5% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Upon a change of control, which occurs if 50% or more of our shares are acquired by any person or group other than DryShips or its affiliates, the noteholders will have an option to require us to purchase all outstanding notes at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. Subject to a number of limitations and exceptions, the bond agreement governing the notes contains covenants limiting, among other things, our ability to: (i) create liens; or (ii) merge, or consolidate or transfer, sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets. Furthermore, the bond agreement contains financial covenants requiring us, among other things, to ensure that we maintain: (i) a consolidated equity ratio of minimum 35%; (ii) free cash of minimum $50 million; (iii) current ratio of minimum 1-to-1; and (iv) an interest coverage ratio of 2.5x calculated on a 12 month rolling basis. 71 In connection with the issue, we agreed to apply to list the notes on a securities exchange or other regulated market by December 1, 2011. The notes were approved for trading on the Oslo ABM, which is maintained by the Oslo Bors ASA, on October 10, 2011. We have obtained a credit rating on our Company and notes in compliance with the loan agreement. If we had failed to obtain the required credit ratings, the interest rate on the notes would have increased by 0.25% annually. Cash flows Year ended December 31, 2011 compared to year ended December 31, 2010 Our cash and cash equivalents increased to $250.9 million as of December 31, 2011, compared to $95.7 million as of December 31, 2010, primarily due to cash provided by new financing and operating activities partly offset by cash used in investing activities. Working capital is equal to current assets minus current liabilities, including the current portion of long-term debt. Our working capital surplus was $83.9 million as of December 31, 2011, compared to a $4.1 million working capital surplus as of December 31, 2010. Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $270.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. In determining net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2011, net income was adjusted for the effects of certain non-cash items, including $162.5 million of depreciation and amortization, $23.0 million of amortization and the write-off of deferred financing costs. Moreover for the year ended December 31, 2011, net income was also adjusted for the effects of non-cash items, such as the gain in the change in fair value of derivatives of $15.1 million, amortization of discontinued cash flow hedges of $9.8 million, amortization of below market value acquired drilling contracts of $1.2 million and $4.3 million interest income on restricted cash. Net cash provided by operating activities was $221.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Net cash used in investing activities Net cash used in investing activities was $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. We made shipyard payments and project capital expenditures of approximately $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $711.9 million for advances for drillships under construction and other capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in restricted cash was $385.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2011, reflecting primarily repayment of the $300.0 million short-term credit facility that was classified as restricted cash as of December 31, 2010, compared to an increase of $335.9 million in the corresponding period of 2010. Net cash provided by financing activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, consisting of $2.4 billion in net proceeds from new long-term debt, which was largely offset by repayments of credit facilities amounting to an aggregate of $926.7 million. This compares to net cash provided by financing activities of $1.08 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, consisting mainly of stockholders contribution to fund investments of $540.3 million, net proceeds from the private offering of $488.3 million, proceeds from bank debt of $308.2 million and the repayment of bank debt of $247.7 million. 72 Year ended December 31, 2010 compared to year ended December 31, 2009 Our cash and cash equivalents decreased to $95.7 million as of December 31, 2010, compared to $234.2 million as of December 31, 2009, primarily due to cash used in investing activities which was partly offset by cash provided by operating activities and financing activities. Working capital is equal to current assets minus current liabilities, including the current portion of long-term debt. Our working capital surplus was $4.1 million as of December 31, 2010, compared to a $123.7 million working capital deficit as of December 31, 2009. The movement from a deficit to a surplus is due to the reclassification of long-term debt from current liabilities to non-current liabilities due to DryShips' compliance with its covenants, which removed the technical cross-default under our loan agreements. Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $221.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $211.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase is mainly due to increased operational profitability during 2010. Net cash used in investing activities Net cash used in investing activities was $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. Net cash used in investing activities was $146.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. We made shipyard payments of approximately $999.6 million for advances for drillships for the year ended December 31, 2010. This compares to $130.8 million for advances for drillships for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in restricted cash was $335.9 million during 2010 and was mainly driven by a $300.0 million short-term credit facility, which was fully cash collateralized and was repaid in January 2011, compared to $185.6 million in the corresponding period of 2009. The increase in the cash used in investing activities for year ended December 31, 2010 was mainly due to yard installments. Net cash provided by financing activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.08 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, consisting mainly of stockholders contribution to fund investments of $540.3 million, net proceeds from the private offering of $488.3 million, proceeds from bank debt of $308.2 million and the repayment of bank debt of $247.7 million. Net cash used in by financing activities was $103.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, consisting of stockholders' contribution of $753.4 million, proceeds from credit facilities of $150.0 million and debt repayments of $1.0 billion. Swap agreements As of December 31, 2011, we had seven interest rate swap and cap and floor agreements outstanding, with a notional amount of $1.0 billion, maturing from September 2013 through November 2017. These agreements were entered into in order to economically hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations with respect to our borrowings. As of January 1, 2011, we discontinued hedge accounting and, as such, changes in their fair values are included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of the above agreements was a liability of $92.8 million. This fair value equates to the amount that would be paid by us if the agreements were cancelled at the reporting date, taking into account current interest rates and our creditworthiness. In addition, during February 2012, we entered into two additional interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $700.0 million in the aggregate, maturing in April 2016, to hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations applicable to indebtedness under our $800.0 million senior secured term loan agreement by fixing our three-month LIBOR rates at approximately 0.9% up to April 2016. 73 As of December 31, 2011, security deposits (margin calls) of $33.1 million were paid and were recorded as "Other non current assets" in our consolidated balance sheet. These deposits are required by the counterparty due to the market loss in the swap agreements. As of December 31, 2009 and 2010, we had outstanding 11 interest rate swap and cap and floor agreements, with a notional amount of $1.3 billion and $908.0 million, respectively, maturing from September 2011 through November 2017. These agreements are entered into in order to economically hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations with respect to its borrowings. As of December 31, 2009 and 2010, eight of these agreements did not qualify for hedge accounting and, as such, changes in their fair values are included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2009 and 2010, three agreements qualified for and were designated for hedge accounting and, as such, changes in their fair values are included in other comprehensive loss. The fair value of these agreements equates to the amount that would be paid by us if the agreements were cancelled at the reporting date, taking into account current interest rates and our creditworthiness. As of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2010, security deposits (margin calls) of $40.7 million and $78.6 million, respectively, were paid and were recorded as "Other non current assets" in our consolidated balance sheet. These deposits are required by the counterparty due to the market loss in the swap agreements. See "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." Currency forward sale exchange contracts As of December 31, 2011, we had no outstanding currency forward sale exchange contracts. The change in fair value of these contracts at December 31, 2011 amounted to a loss of $1.5 million and is included as Other, net in our consolidated statement of operations. See Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2010, we had currency forward sale exchange contracts for the future sales of U.S. Dollars at fixed rates of $28.0 million outstanding with a fair market value of $1.5 million recorded in "Financial instruments" in our consolidated balance sheet. For the relevant period, we did not designate currency forward sale exchange contracts as hedges under U.S. GAAP, and realized gains are included as General and administrative expenses and unrealized gains are included as Other, net in our consolidated statement of operations. See Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2009, we had currency forward sale exchange contracts for the future sales of U.S. Dollars at fixed rates of $20.0 million outstanding with a fair market value of $0.4 million recorded in "Financial instruments" in our consolidated balance sheet. For the relevant period, we did not designate currency forward sale exchange contracts as hedges under US GAAP, and realized gains are included as General and administrative expenses and unrealized gains and losses are included as Other, net in our consolidated statement of operations. See Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements. See "Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." C. Research and development, patents and licenses, etc. Not applicable. D. Trend Information The slowdown in the world economy following the credit crisis in the latter part of 2008 had significant adverse impact on the activity levels for most of the offshore drilling industry in 2009. This trend extended into 2010 and 2011 for some of the rig types and market segments, in spite of the rebound in oil prices, as oil companies retained a cautious attitude towards the longer term sustainability of the price recovery. 74 The market for ultra-deepwater semi-submersible rigs and drillships was less affected by the credit crisis and slow down in the world economy in 2008 than the markets for other types of rigs, such as jack-up and tender rigs, due to the limited availability of such rigs in the near term and the continued long-term strategic focus by super majors and national oil companies on exploration and production activities in deeper waters. Although there were fewer fixtures in 2009 compared to 2008, daily rates remained close to $500,000 for units in such waters something that is strong by historical standards. In 2010, we saw daily rates decrease to some $430,000 as the activity level in deeper waters developed more slowly than anticipated. The Macondo incident in late April 2010 and the subsequent moratorium on offshore drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico further stalled such activity. The moratorium not only delayed a large number of deepwater projects in the region but also prompted oil companies to assert rights of termination in certain cases forcing relocation of deepwater drilling rigs to other regions. Although the moratorium was lifted in October 2010, delays in the approval process of drilling permits, increased regulatory requirements and perceived increase in legal risk of operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have hampered the activity for deepwater drilling in the United States. However, the Macondo incident has increased oil companies focus on new, modern and technically superior equipment and thus reducing their interest in using older moored and upgraded deepwater vessels with weight and capacity restrictions. This has resulted in the market absorbing new dynamically positioned deepwater rigs, originally ordered without a drilling contract in place at the time of the order, as construction is completed at yards. There has been an increase in new countries, as well as regions, of interest for new deepwater exploration activities. These include countries in West Africa, East Africa, and Southeast Asia. New frontier markets are also emerging such as Greenland and Australia. At the same time and in response to the favorable outlook for oil prices and deepwater drilling, established players have taken advantage of the significant reduction in newbuild prices compared to the highs in 2008 and, since October 2010, orders have been placed for 76 new dynamic deepwater units, mainly on speculation. The deliveries of these units are scheduled to be delivered by 2020 and, as such, are not expected a have any near term effect of significance on the balance of the market. Strong growth in development drilling activities in Brazil and West Africa is expected to drive demand in the upcoming years. In the short term, more drilling units moving into these regions and a return of deepwater drilling activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico could have a positive impact on demand and daily rates. There is also likely to be a catch up effect in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico related to the deepwater drilling activity that was postponed due to the moratorium and halt in issuance of drilling permits. The number of market inquiries for ultra-deepwater rigs has improved significantly over the last six months and at present, daily rates for new deepwater drilling units range from $500,000 to $600,000, depending upon country, region and whether the rig is considered new out of the yard or has been in operation , the latter commanding a premium. E. Off-balance sheet arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 75 F. Tabular disclosure of contractual obligations The following table sets forth our contractual obligations and their maturity dates as of December 31, 2011: Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years (U.S. Dollars in thousands) Drillships under construction (1) 1,096,826 - 1,096,826 - - Retirement Plan Benefits (2) 2,063 64 216 326 1,457 Operating leases (3) 3,376 1,241 2,135 - - Loan payments (4) 2,779,167 219,167 805,834 1,286,666 467,500 Interest payments (5) 659,444 133,902 270,782 184,866 69,894 Total 4,540,876 354,374 2,175,793 1,471,858 538,851 (1) The figure includes contracted purchase obligations only. (2) We have three defined benefit plans for our employees managed and funded through Norwegian life insurance companies at December 31, 2011. The pension plans covered 53 employees by December 31, 2011. Pension liabilities and pension costs are calculated based on the actuarial cost method as determined by an independent third party actuary. (3) We entered into two new three-year office lease agreements with an unrelated third party, which commenced on September 1, 2011 and October 1, 2011, respectively. The lease agreements include options for additional two and three year terms, which must be exercised at least six months prior to the end of the terms of the contracts, which expire in September 2014 and October 2014, respectively. We also entered into a three-year office lease with a third party in Nicosia, Cyprus which commenced on September 1, 2010. The lease agreements relating to office space are considered to be operational lease contracts. (4) Includes $500 million 9.5% senior unsecured notes. (5) Based on assumed interest rates ranging from 4.46% to 9.5%. Recent accounting pronouncements: In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2011-04, "Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs", ("ASU 2011-04"). ASU 2011-04 amends Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 820, "Fair Value Measurements", ("ASC 820"), providing a consistent definition and measurement of fair value, as well as similar disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2011-04 changes certain fair value measurement principles, clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement and expands the ASC 820 disclosure requirements, particularly for Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2011-04 will be effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2012. The adoption of ASU 2011-04 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements, but may require certain additional disclosures. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, "Comprehensive Income, Presentation of Comprehensive Income ("Topic 220") which revises the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements. The new guidance removes the presentation options in ASC 220, "Comprehensive income", and requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either (i) a continuous statement of comprehensive income or (ii) two separate but consecutive statements. Under the two-statement approach, an entity is required to present components of net income and total net income in the statement of net income. The statement of other comprehensive income should immediately follow the statement of net income and include the components of other comprehensive income and a total for other comprehensive income, along with a total for comprehensive income. The amendments in this ASU do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. The amendments in this ASU should be applied retrospectively and they are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted, because compliance with the amendments is already permitted. The amendments do not require any transition disclosures. The amendments in this ASU have been adopted by us in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and, as a result, the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010 were revised to include a separate statement of comprehensive income and to exclude the components of other comprehensive income from the statement of stockholders' equity. 76 In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, "Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about offsetting Assets and Liabilities". The objective of this update is to provide enhanced disclosures that will enable financial statements' users to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity's financial position. This includes the effect or potential effect of rights of setoff associated with an entity's recognized assets and recognized liabilities within the scope of this ASU. The amendments require enhanced disclosures by requiring improved information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either (1) offset in accordance with either Section 210-20-45 or Section 815-10-45 or (2) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are offset in accordance with either Section 210-20-45 or Section 815-10-45. The amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. An entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. The provisions of ASU 2011-11 are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, "Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standard Update No 2011-05". The amendments in this ASU supersede certain pending paragraphs in ASU 2011-05, to effectively defer the requirement that companies present reclassification adjustments for each component of accumulated other comprehensive income in both net income and other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements. Companies are still required to present reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements or disclose those amounts in the notes to the financial statements.

In making this determination, our board of directors broadly considers all facts and circumstances it deems relevant from the standpoint of the director and from that of persons or organizations with which the director has an affiliation. We have established an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee, in each case comprised of independent directors.

Share Ownership With respect to the total amount of common shares owned by all of our officers and directors, individually and as a group, see "Item 7. Major Stockholders and Related Party Transactions—A. Major Shareholders." 2012 Equity Incentive Plan Our board of directors intends to adopt the Ocean Rig UDW Inc. 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, or the plan, effective in or around March 2012, the material terms of which are set forth below. Under the plan, officers, directors and employees of, and consultants and service providers to, the Company, our subsidiaries and our affiliates will be eligible to participate. The plan provides for the award of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, phantom stock units, dividend equivalents, unrestricted stock, and other stock or cash-based awards. 83 Administration The plan will be administered by our compensation committee, or such other committee of our board of directors as may be designated by our board of directors. The plan administrator will have the authority to, among other things, designate participants under the plan, determine the type or types of awards to be granted to a participant, determine the number of shares of common stock to be covered by awards, determine the terms and conditions applicable to awards and interpret and administer the plan. Number of Shares of Common Stock Subject to adjustment in the event of any distribution, recapitalization, split, merger, consolidation and the like, the number of shares of our common stock with respect to which awards may be granted under the plan is 2,000,000. Shares subject to an award that remain unissued upon the termination or cancellation of the award, restricted shares awarded under the plan that are forfeited, shares in respect of an award that are settled for cash without delivery of common stock, and shares that are tendered or withheld to satisfy the grant or exercise price or tax withholding obligation pursuant to an award under the plan, will again be available for grant under the plan. Common stock delivered under the plan will consist of authorized but unissued shares or shares acquired by us in the open market, from us or from any other person or entity. Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights The plan will permit the grant of options covering common stock and the grant of stock appreciation rights. A stock appreciation right is an award that, upon exercise, entitles the participant to receive the excess of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the exercise date over the base price established for the stock appreciation right. Such excess may be paid in common stock, cash, or a combination thereof, as determined by the plan administrator in its discretion. The plan administrator will be able to make grants of stock options and stock appreciation rights under the plan containing such terms as the plan administrator may determine. Stock options and stock appreciation rights may have an exercise price or base price that is no less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. In general, stock options and stock appreciation rights granted will become exercisable over a period determined by the plan administrator, but in no event will they exercisable later than ten years from the date of grant. Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and Phantom Stock Units Restricted stock is subject to forfeiture prior to the vesting of the award. A restricted stock unit is notional stock that entitles the grantee to receive a share of common stock following the vesting of the restricted stock unit or, in the discretion of the plan administrator, cash equivalent to the value of our common stock. The plan administrator may determine to make grants under the plan of restricted stock and restricted stock units containing such terms as the plan administrator may determine. The plan administrator will determine the period over which restricted stock and restricted stock units granted to plan participants will vest. The plan administrator may base its determination upon the achievement of specified performance goals. Phantom stock units, which represent a notional share of our common stock, may also be granted by the plan administrator under the plan, subject to vesting and forfeiture and other terms and conditions as determined by the plan administrator. Dividend Equivalent Rights The plan administrator may grant dividend equivalent rights under the plan, subject to such terms and conditions as determined by the plan administrator in accordance with the terms of the plan. 84 Unrestricted Stock The plan administrator may grant shares of our common stock free of restrictions under the plan in respect of past services or other valid consideration. Other Stock-Based Awards The plan administrator may, subject to the provisions of the plan, grant other equity-based or equity-related awards in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as the plan administrator may determine. Change in Control Unless otherwise provided in the instrument evidencing the award, in the event of a change in control of Ocean Rig UDW Inc., as defined in the plan, all outstanding awards will become fully and immediately vested and exercisable. Term, Termination and Amendment of Plan and Awards Our board of directors may terminate, suspend or discontinue the plan at any time with respect to any award that has not yet been granted. Unless the plan is terminated earlier, no award may be granted under the plan following the tenth anniversary of the date of the plan's adoption by our board of directors. Our board of directors also has the right to alter or amend the plan or any part of the plan from time to time, subject to shareholder approval in certain circumstances as provided in the plan. The plan administrator may also modify outstanding awards granted under the plan. However, other than adjustments to outstanding awards upon the occurrence of certain unusual or nonrecurring events, generally no change in any outstanding grant may be made that would materially impair the rights or materially increase the obligations of the participant without the consent of the participant. Awards The compensation committee of our board of directors has approved the award of 109,950 restricted common shares to management and employees of the Company and its operating subsidiaries, which such restricted common shares are expected to be issued following the adoption of the plan by our board of directors.
