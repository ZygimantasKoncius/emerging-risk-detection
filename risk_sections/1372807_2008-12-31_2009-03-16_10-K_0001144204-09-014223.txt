Item 1A. Risk Factors Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. The risks set forth below are not the only risks we face. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition and results of our operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the net asset value and the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business We have a limited operating history. We were organized in August 2006 to continue the middle market investment business and asset management business of Katonah Debt Advisors, which was organized in 2005 by Kohlberg & Co. Katonah Debt Advisors commenced its asset management operations with the hiring of E.A. Kratzman, its President (who also serves as our Vice President and a member of our Investment Committee), in June 2005 and began its middle market lending operations in February 2006 with the hiring of Dayl W. Pearson, who serves as our President and CEO and as one of our directors, and R. Jon Corless, who serves as our CIO. In December 2006, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock and our common stock was listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. We have a limited operating history. As a result, we have limited operating results which demonstrate our ability to manage our business. We are subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business enterprise, including the risk that we will not achieve our investment objective and that the value of your investment in us could decline substantially. We are dependent upon senior management for our future success, and if we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel or if we lose any member of our senior management team, our ability to achieve our investment objective could be significantly harmed. We depend on the members of our senior management as well as other key personnel for the identification, final selection, structuring, closing and monitoring of our investments. These employees have critical industry experience and relationships that we rely on to implement our business plan. Our future success depends on the continued service of our senior management team and our Board of Directors. The departure of any of the members of our senior management or a significant number of our senior personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objective. As a result, we may not be able to operate our business as we expect, and our ability to compete could be harmed, which could cause our operating results to suffer. We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities. A large number of entities compete with us to make the types of investments that we plan to make in prospective portfolio companies. We compete with other BDCs, as well as a large number of investment funds, investment banks and other sources of financing, including traditional financial services companies, such as commercial banks and finance companies. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. This may enable some of our competitors to make commercial loans with interest rates that are comparable to or lower than the rates we typically offer. We may lose prospective portfolio investments if we do not match our competitors’ pricing, terms and structure. If we do match our competitors’ pricing, terms or structure, we may experience decreased net interest income and increased risk of credit losses. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments, establish more relationships and build their market shares. Furthermore, many of our potential competitors have greater experience operating under, or are not subject to, the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC. As a result of this competition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and take advantage of attractive investment opportunities or that we will be able to fully invest our available capital. If we are not able to compete effectively, our business and financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. Although Kohlberg & Co. has agreed to notify us of equity investment opportunities that are presented to Kohlberg & Co. but do not fit the investment profile of Kohlberg & Co. or its affiliates, no such referral to date has resulted in an investment by us or Katonah Debt Advisors. If we are unable to source investments effectively, we may be unable to achieve our investment objective. Our ability to achieve our investment objective depends on our senior management team’s ability to identify, evaluate, finance and invest in suitable companies that meet our investment criteria. Accomplishing this result on a cost-effective basis is largely a function of our marketing capabilities, our management of the investment process, our ability to provide efficient services and our access to financing sources on acceptable terms. In addition to monitoring the performance of our existing investments, members of our management team and our investment professionals may also be called upon to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. These demands on their time may distract them or slow the rate of investment. To grow, we need to continue to hire, train, supervise and manage new employees and to implement computer and other systems capable of effectively accommodating our growth. However, we cannot assure you that any such employees will contribute to the success of our business or that we will implement such systems effectively. Failure to manage our future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 32 There is a risk that we may not make distributions. We intend to continue to make distributions on a quarterly basis to our stockholders. We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at historical or any specific levels or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a BDC, depending on the types of debt and equity securities we have outstanding, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions. See “Distributions” and “LEVERAGE.” Also, restrictions and provisions in our Facility may limit our ability to make distributions. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we could fail to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC and we would be subject to corporate level U.S. federal income tax. Furthermore, in accordance with current IRS guidance, we may make distributions under special circumstances that would allow us to meet our annual RIC distribution requirement for 2009 (and perhaps subsequent years) by distributing shares of our stock in lieu of a significant portion of the cash (or other property other than our stock) that we would otherwise be required to distribute to satisfy such distribution requirement. See “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations.” We cannot ensure that we will make distributions at historical or any other specified levels or at all. We may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize income before or without receiving cash equal to such income. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and the Code, we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as contracted payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance and due at the end of the loan term. In addition to the cash yields received on our loans, in some instances, certain loans may also include any of the following: end of term payments, exit fees, balloon payment fees or prepayment fees. The increases in loan balances as a result of contracted PIK arrangements are included in income for the period in which such PIK interest was received, which is often in advance of receiving cash payment, and are separately identified on our statements of cash flows. We also may be required to include in income certain other amounts that we will not receive in cash. Any warrants that we receive in connection with our debt investments generally are valued as part of the negotiation process with the particular portfolio company. As a result, a portion of the aggregate purchase price for the debt investments and warrants is allocated to the warrants that we receive. This generally results in “original issue discount” for tax purposes, which we must recognize as ordinary income, increasing the amounts we are required to distribute to qualify as a RIC eligible for pass-through tax treatment. Because such original issue discount income might exceed the amount of cash received in a given year with respect to such investment, we might need to obtain cash from other sources to satisfy such distribution requirements. Other features of the debt instruments that we hold may also cause such instruments to generate original issue discount, resulting in a dividend distribution requirement in excess of current cash received. Since in certain cases we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least 90% of our net ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any. If we are unable to meet these distribution requirements, we will not qualify for tax treatment as a RIC or, even if such distribution requirement is satisfied, we may be subject to tax on the amount that is undistributed. Accordingly, we may have to sell some of our assets, raise additional debt or equity securities or reduce new investment originations to meet these distribution requirements and avoid tax. See “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations.” We may incur losses as a result of “first loss” agreements into which we or Katonah Debt Advisors may enter in connection with warehousing credit arrangements which we put in place prior to raising a CLO Fund and pursuant to which we agree to reimburse credit providers for a portion of losses (if any) on warehouse investments. We and Katonah Debt Advisors may, in the future, enter into “first loss” agreements in connection with warehouse credit lines to be established by Katonah Debt Advisors to fund the initial accumulation of loan investments for future CLO Funds that Katonah Debt Advisors will manage. Such agreements (referred to as “first loss agreements” or “first loss obligations”) frequently relate to (i) losses as a result of individual loan investments being ineligible for purchase by the CLO Fund (typically due to a payment default on such loan) when such fund formation is completed or, (ii) if the CLO Fund has not been completed before the expiration of the warehouse credit line, the loss (if any, and net of any accumulated interest income) on the resale of such loans funded by the warehouse credit line. As a result, we may incur losses if loans and debt obligations that had been purchased in the warehouse facility become ineligible for inclusion in the CLO Fund or if a planned CLO Fund does not close. For example, as a result of an engagement letter with Bear Stearns & Co. Inc., we have agreed to make certain payments to JP Morgan, Inc. in connection with a settlement of claims. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – COMMITMENTS.” 33 Any unrealized losses we experience on our loan portfolio may be an indication of future realized losses, which could reduce our income available for distribution. As a BDC, we are required to carry our investments at market value or, if no market value is ascertainable, at the fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors pursuant to procedures approved by our Board of Directors. Decreases in the market values or fair values of our investments will be recorded as unrealized losses. Any unrealized losses in our loan portfolio could be an indication of a portfolio company’s inability to meet its repayment obligations to us with respect to the affected loans. This could result in realized losses in the future and ultimately in reductions of our income available for distribution in future periods. We may experience fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results and credit spreads. We could experience fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including our ability to make investments in companies that meet our investment criteria, the interest rate payable on the debt securities we acquire, the default rate on such securities, the level of our expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets and general economic conditions. As a result of these factors, results for any period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods. We are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates and spreads. Changes in interest rates may have a substantial negative impact on our investments, the value of our securities and our rate of return on invested capital. A reduction in the interest spreads on new investments could also have an adverse impact on our net interest income. An increase in interest rates could decrease the value of any investments we hold which earn fixed interest rates, including mezzanine securities and high-yield bonds, and also could increase our interest expense, thereby decreasing our net income. An increase in interest rates due to an increase in credit spreads, regardless of general interest rate fluctuations, could also negatively impact the value of any investments we hold in our portfolio. Also, an increase in interest rates available to investors could make investment in our common stock less attractive if we are not able to increase our dividend rate, which could reduce the value of our common stock. The debt we incur could increase the risk of investing in our Company. As of December 31, 2008, we had $262 million of outstanding indebtedness, which accrues interest based on prevailing commercial paper rates plus 0.85% (or, if the commercial paper market is at any time unavailable, prevailing LIBOR rates plus an applicable spread) and matures on September 29, 2010. Lenders have fixed dollar claims on our assets that are superior to the claims of our stockholders, and we may grant a security interest in our assets in connection with our borrowings. In the case of a liquidation event, those lenders would receive proceeds before our stockholders. In addition, borrowings, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and, therefore, increase the risks associated with investing in our securities. Leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique. If the value of our assets increases, then leverage would cause the net asset value attributable to our common stock to increase more than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged. Conversely, if the value of our assets decreases, leverage would cause the net asset value attributable to our common stock to decline more than it otherwise would have had we not used leverage. Similarly, any increase in our revenue in excess of interest expense on our borrowed funds would cause our net income to increase more than it would without leverage. Any decrease in our revenue would cause our net income to decline more than it would have had we not borrowed funds and could negatively affect our ability to make distributions on our common stock. Our ability to service any debt that we incur will depend largely on our financial performance and will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures. The current economic environment and the availability of credit, which is severely limited, affected our ability to extend the Facility and we may not be able to enter into another facility as a result of such conditions should they continue. As a BDC, we are generally required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total borrowings and other senior securities, which include all of our borrowings and other debt securities and any preferred stock we may issue in the future, of at least 200%. If this ratio declines below 200%, we may not be able to incur additional debt and may need to sell a portion of our investments to repay some debt when it is disadvantageous to do so, and we may not be able to make distributions. As of December 31, 2008, we had $262 million of outstanding borrowings and our asset coverage ratio was 196%, primarily as a result of unrealized fair value losses on our investments. Until the minimum asset coverage level is met, we will be unable to incur additional debt or issue securities senior to our common stock. As a result, we will be severely limited in our ability to raise capital to make new investments until our asset coverage ratio exceeds 200%. However, because we have no public debt or preferred stock outstanding, failure to maintain asset coverage of at least 200% will not limit our ability, under the 1940 Act, to pay dividends from our net investment income. 34 As of March 12, 2009, our Facility balance was approximately $245 million and our asset coverage ratio was approximately 209%, above the minimum asset coverage level generally required for a BDC by the 1940 Act. Under our Facility, we must maintain a leverage ratio covenant of at least one to one based on the ratio of the Facility outstanding balance to our most recently reported GAAP stockholders’ equity balance (determined quarterly in conjunction with the Company’s financial reporting filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission) as of the Facility outstanding balance determination date. At year-end, our leverage ratio covenant was met using the December 31, 2008 Facility balance and the latest filed quarterly stockholders’ equity balance which, at that time, was as of September 30, 2008. We remain in compliance with the leverage covenant ratio based on the March 12, 2009 Facility balance and the GAAP stockholders’ equity balance as of September 30, 2008. Because we have outstanding indebtedness, we are exposed to additional risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage. We borrow funds or may issue senior securities, pursuant to our existing Facility or other agreements, to make additional investments. With certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to borrow amounts or issue senior securities such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 200% after such borrowing or issuance. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our management’s and our Board of Directors’ assessment of market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. There is no assurance that a leveraging strategy will be successful. Leverage involves risks and special considerations of stockholders, including: • a likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of our common stock than a comparable portfolio without leverage; • exposure to increased risk of loss if we incur debt or issue senior securities to finance investments because a decrease in the value of our investments would have a greater negative impact on our returns and therefore the value of our common stock than if we did not use leverage; • that the covenants contained in the documents governing the Facility or other debt instruments could restrict our operating flexibility. Such covenants may impose asset coverage or investment portfolio composition requirements that are more stringent than those imposed by the 1940 Act and could require us to liquidate investments at an inopportune time; and • that we, and indirectly our stockholders, will bear the cost of leverage, including issuance and servicing costs ( i.e. , interest). Any requirement that we sell assets at a loss to redeem or pay interest or dividends on any leverage, or for other reasons, would reduce our net asset value and also make it difficult for the net asset value to recover. Our Board of Directors, in their judgment, nevertheless may determine to use leverage if they expect that the benefits to our stockholders of maintaining the leveraged position will outweigh the risks. The agreements governing our Facility contain various covenants that limit our discretion in operating our business and also include certain financial covenants. We have entered into a credit facility that is backed by a revolving pool of loans. Under the Facility, we are subject to limitations as to how borrowed funds may be used, including restrictions on geographic and industry concentrations, loan size, payment frequency and status, average life, collateral interests and investment ratings, as well as regulatory restrictions on leverage which may affect the amount of funding that may be obtained. There are also certain requirements relating to portfolio performance, including required minimum portfolio yield and limitations on delinquencies and charge-offs, a violation of which could result in the early amortization of the Facility, limit further advances and, in some cases, result in an event of default. An event of default under the Facility would result, among other things, in the termination of the availability of further funds under the Facility and an accelerated maturity date for all amounts outstanding under the Facility, which would likely disrupt our business and, potentially, the portfolio companies whose loans we financed through the Facility. This could reduce our revenues and, by delaying any cash payment allowed to us under the Facility until the lender has been paid in full, reduce our liquidity and cash flow and impair our ability to grow our business and maintain our qualification as a RIC. If we default under certain provisions of the Facility, the remedies available to the lender may limit our ability to declare dividends. 35 During September 2008, we were notified by the lenders that the liquidity banks providing the underlying funding for the Facility did not intend to renew their liquidity facility to the lenders unless we agreed to certain revised terms for the Facility. As a result, the lenders proposed new terms to us in order to extend additional fundings under the Facility. We viewed such proposed terms as unfavorable and have opted to forego the revolving credit feature of the Facility and to amortize existing borrowings under the Facility. In accordance with the terms of the Facility, all principal and interest collected from the assets securing the Facility are used to amortize the Facility through a termination date of September 29, 2010 (the “amortization period”). During the amortization period, the interest rate will continue to be based on prevailing commercial paper rates plus 0.85% or, if the commercial paper market is at any time unavailable, prevailing LIBOR rates plus an applicable spread. We believe we have sufficient cash and liquid assets to fund normal operations and dividend distributions. However, because we are required to use interest income earned on the assets securing the Facility to amortize the Facility during the amortization period, we may need to sell other assets not pledged to secure the Facility, potentially at a loss, in order to generate sufficient cash to make the required dividend distributions necessary to maintain our RIC status. In addition, at the end of the amortization period, we may be required to sell or transfer the remaining assets securing the Facility, potentially at a loss, to repay any remaining outstanding borrowings or we may enter into a new agreement with the lenders providing for continued amortization of the Facility borrowings or into alternative financing arrangements with another lender. Under our Facility, we must maintain a leverage ratio covenant of at least one to one based on the ratio of the Facility outstanding balance to our most recently reported GAAP stockholders’ equity balance (determined quarterly in conjunction with the Company’s financial reporting filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission) as of the Facility outstanding balance determination date. At year-end, our leverage ratio covenant was met using the December 31, 2008 Facility balance and the latest filed quarterly stockholders’ equity balance which, at that time, was as of September 30, 2008. We remain in compliance with the leverage covenant ratio based on the March 12, 2009 Facility balance and the GAAP stockholders’ equity balance as of September 30, 2008. Because we intend to distribute substantially all of our income and net realized capital gains to our stockholders, we will need additional capital to finance our growth. In order to qualify as a RIC, to avoid payment of excise taxes and to minimize or avoid payment of income taxes, we intend to distribute to our stockholders substantially all of our net ordinary income and realized net capital gains except for certain net long-term capital gains (which we may retain, pay applicable income taxes with respect thereto, and elect to treat as deemed distributions to our stockholders). As a BDC, we are generally required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total senior securities, which includes all of our borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future, of at least 200%. This requirement limits the amount that we may borrow. Because we will continue to need capital to grow our loan and investment portfolio, this limitation may prevent us from incurring debt and require us to issue additional equity at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. While we expect to be able to borrow and to issue additional debt and equity securities, we cannot assure you that debt and equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, and debt financings may be restricted by the terms of any of our outstanding borrowings. In addition, as a BDC, we are generally not permitted to issue equity securities priced below net asset value without stockholder approval. If additional funds are not available to us, we could be forced to curtail or cease new lending and investment activities, and our net asset value could decline. On March 13, 2007, June 8, 2007, September 24, 2007, December 14, 2007, March 14, 2008, June 13, 2008, September 19, 2008 and December 19, 2008 we declared dividends in the amount of $0.29 per share, $0.35 per share, $0.37 per share, $0.39 per share, $0.41 per share, $0.41 per share, $0.35 per share and $0.27 per share, respectively. These dividends represented our estimated distributable income for the quarters ended March 31, 2007, June 30, 2007, September 30, 2007, December 31, 2007, March 31, 2008, June 30, 2008, September 30, 2008, and December 31, 2008, respectively, plus a portion of our undistributed 2006 distributable income. Our Board of Directors may change our investment objective, operating policies and strategies without prior notice or stockholder approval. Our Board of Directors has the authority to modify or waive certain of our operating policies and strategies without prior notice (except as required by the 1940 Act) and without stockholder approval. However, absent stockholder approval, we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC. We cannot predict the effect any changes to our current operating policies and strategies would have on our business, operating results and value of our stock. Nevertheless, the effects may adversely affect our business and impact our ability to make distributions. 36 Risks Related to Our Investments Our investments may be risky, and you could lose all or part of your investment. We invest primarily in senior secured term loans, mezzanine debt and selected equity investments issued by middle market companies. Secured Loans. When we extend secured term loans, we generally take a security interest (either as a first lien position or as a second lien position) in the available assets of these portfolio companies, including the equity interests of their subsidiaries, which we expect to assist in mitigating the risk that we will not be repaid. However, there is a risk that the collateral securing our loans may decrease in value over time, may be difficult to sell in a timely manner, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based upon the success of the business and market conditions, including as a result of the inability of the portfolio company to raise additional capital, and, in some circumstances, our lien could be subordinated to claims of other creditors. In addition, deterioration in a portfolio company’s financial condition and prospects, including its inability to raise additional capital, may be accompanied by deterioration in the value of the collateral for the loan. Consequently, the fact that a loan is secured does not guarantee that we will receive principal and interest payments according to the loan’s terms, or at all, or that we will be able to collect on the loan should we be forced to exercise our remedies. Mezzanine Debt. Our mezzanine debt investments generally are subordinated to senior loans and generally are unsecured. This may result in an above average amount of risk and volatility or loss of principal. These investments may entail additional risks that could adversely affect our investment returns. To the extent interest payments associated with such debt are deferred, such debt is subject to greater fluctuations in value based on changes in interest rates and such debt could subject us to phantom income. Since we generally do not receive any cash prior to maturity of the debt, the investment is of greater risk. Equity Investments. We have made and expect to make selected equity investments. In addition, when we invest in senior secured loans or mezzanine debt, we may acquire warrants. Our goal is ultimately to dispose of such equity interests and realize gains upon our disposition of such interests. However, the equity interests we receive may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests, and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience. Risks Associated with Middle Market Companies. Investments in middle market companies also involve a number of significant risks, including: • limited financial resources and inability to meet their obligations, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of our realizing the value of any guarantees we may have obtained in connection with our investment; • shorter operating histories, narrower product lines and smaller market shares than larger businesses, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors’ actions and market conditions, as well as general economic downturns; • dependence on management talents and efforts of a small group of persons; therefore, the death, disability, resignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on our portfolio company and, in turn, on us; • less predictable operating results, being parties to litigation from time to time, engaging in rapidly changing businesses with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence, and requiring substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position; • difficulty accessing the capital markets to meet future capital needs; and • generally less publicly available information about their businesses, operations and financial condition. 37 Our portfolio investments for which there is no readily available market, including our investment in Katonah Debt Advisors, are recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. As a result, there is uncertainty as to the value of these investments. Our investments consist primarily of securities issued by privately-held companies, the fair value of which is not readily determinable. In addition, we are not permitted to maintain a general reserve for anticipated loan losses. Instead, we are required by the 1940 Act to specifically value each investment and record an unrealized gain or loss for any asset that we believe has increased or decreased in value. We value these securities at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors pursuant to procedures approved by our Board of Directors. These valuations are initially prepared by our management and reviewed by our Valuation Committee which utilizes its best judgment in arriving at the fair value of these securities. However, the Board of Directors retains ultimate authority as to the appropriate valuation of each investment. Where appropriate, our Board of Directors utilizes the services of an independent valuation firm to aid it in determining fair value, particularly in the case of our investments in CLO Funds and in Katonah Debt Advisors, which are valued quarterly, and investments in mezzanine and equity securities, which are valued regularly. The independent valuation firm provides third-party valuation consulting services, which consist of certain limited procedures that we identify and request the independent valuation firm to perform. The types of factors that may be considered in valuing our investments include the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments and its earnings, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly-traded companies, discounted cash flow and other relevant factors. The value of our investment in Katonah Debt Advisors is determined based on a percentage of the assets under management and a multiple of its operating income, both of which are based, in part, on an analysis of the valuation of comparable asset management companies. Because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private investments and private companies, are inherently uncertain and may be based on estimates, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would be assessed if a ready market for these securities existed or from the valuations that would be placed on our assets by other market participants. Our net asset value could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair value of our investments were materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon the disposal of such securities, particularly if we are forced to sell securities in a distressed market to fund operations. We are a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act, and therefore we may invest a significant portion of our assets in a relatively small number of issuers, which subjects us to a risk of significant loss if any of these issuers defaults on its obligations under any of its debt instruments or as a result of a downturn in the particular industry. We are classified as a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act, and therefore we may invest a significant portion of our assets in a relatively small number of issuers in a limited number of industries. As of December 31, 2008, our largest investment, our 100% equity interest in Katonah Debt Advisors, equaled approximately 11% of the fair value of our investments. Beyond the asset diversification requirements associated with our qualification as a RIC (as described further in “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations”), we do not have fixed guidelines for diversification, and while we are not targeting any specific industries, relatively few industries may become significantly represented among our investments. In accordance with our current policy, we will not “concentrate” our investments, that is, invest 25% or more of our assets in any particular industry (determined at the time of investment). However, to the extent that we assume large positions in the securities of a small number of issuers, our net asset value may fluctuate to a greater extent than that of a diversified investment company as a result of changes in the financial condition or the market’s assessment of the issuer or a downturn in any particular industry. We may also be more susceptible to any single economic or regulatory occurrence than a diversified investment company. Economic recessions or downturns could negatively impact our portfolio companies and harm our operating results. Many of our portfolio companies may be susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions and may be unable to repay our loans during these periods. Therefore, our non-performing assets are likely to increase and the value of our portfolio is likely to decrease during these periods. Adverse economic conditions may also decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans and the value of our equity investments. Economic slowdowns or recessions could lead to financial losses in our portfolio and a decrease in revenues, net income and assets. Unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. These events could prevent us from increasing investments and harm our operating results. For instance, the freezing up of the credit markets and lack of investments in general reduce our ability to make additional investments. Defaults by our portfolio companies could harm our operating results. A portfolio company’s failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by us or other debt holders could lead to defaults and, potentially, acceleration of the time when the loans are due and foreclosure on its secured assets. Such events could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements and jeopardize a portfolio company’s ability to meet its obligations under the debt that we hold and the value of any equity securities we own. We may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting portfolio company. 38 When we are a debt or minority equity investor in a portfolio company, which generally is the case, we may not be in a position to control the entity, and its management may make decisions that could decrease the value of our investment. Most of our investments are either debt or minority equity investments in our portfolio companies. Therefore, we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company may make business decisions with which we disagree, and the stockholders and management of such company may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not serve our interests. As a result, a portfolio company may make decisions that could decrease the value of our portfolio holdings. In addition, we generally are not in a position to control any portfolio company by investing in its debt securities. Prepayments of our debt investments by our portfolio companies could negatively impact our operating results. We are subject to the risk that the investments we make in our portfolio companies may be repaid prior to maturity. When this occurs, we generally reinvest these proceeds in temporary investments, pending their future investment in new portfolio companies. These temporary investments typically have substantially lower yields than the debt being prepaid and we could experience significant delays in reinvesting these amounts. Any future investment in a new portfolio company may also be at lower yields than the debt that was repaid. Consequently, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if one or more of our portfolio companies elects to prepay amounts owed to us. Additionally, prepayments could negatively impact our return on equity, which could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock. Our portfolio companies may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies. We invest primarily in debt securities issued by our portfolio companies. In some cases portfolio companies are permitted to have other debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the debt securities in which we invest. By their terms, such debt instruments may provide that the holders thereof are entitled to receive payment of interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments in respect of the debt securities in which we invest. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution in respect of our investment. After repaying such senior creditors, such portfolio company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. In the case of debt ranking equally with debt securities in which we invest, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company. There may be circumstances where our debt investments could be subordinated to claims of other creditors or we could be subject to lender liability claims. Even though we may have structured certain of our investments as senior loans, if one of our portfolio companies were to go bankrupt, depending on the facts and circumstances, including the size of our investment and the extent to which we actually provided managerial assistance to that portfolio company, a bankruptcy court might recharacterize our debt investment and subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors. In addition, lenders can be subject to lender liability claims for actions taken by them where they become too involved in the borrower’s business or exercise control over the borrower. It is possible that we could become subject to a lender’s liability claim, including as a result of actions taken if we actually render significant managerial assistance. Our investments in equity securities involve a substantial degree of risk. We may purchase common stock and other equity securities, including warrants. Although equity securities have historically generated higher average total returns than fixed-income securities over the long term, equity securities have also experienced significantly more volatility in those returns. The equity securities we acquire may fail to appreciate and may decline in value or become worthless, and our ability to recover our investment depends on our portfolio company’s success. Investments in equity securities involve a number of significant risks, including the risk of further dilution as a result of additional issuances, inability to access additional capital and failure to pay current distributions. Investments in preferred securities involve special risks, such as the risk of deferred distributions, credit risk, illiquidity and limited voting rights. The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business. We invest in securities issued by private companies. These securities may be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise be less liquid than publicly-traded securities. The illiquidity of these investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we had previously recorded these investments. As a result, we do not expect to achieve liquidity in our investments in the near-term. Our investments are usually subject to contractual or legal restrictions on resale or are otherwise illiquid because there is usually no established trading market for such investments. The illiquidity of most of our investments may make it difficult for us to dispose of them at a favorable price, and, as a result, we may suffer losses. 39 We may not receive all or a portion of the income we expect to continue to receive from Katonah Debt Advisors. We expect to receive distributions of recurring fee income, after the payment of its expenses, from the asset management activities of Katonah Debt Advisors. However, the existing asset management agreements pursuant to which Katonah Debt Advisors receives such fee income from the CLO Funds for which it serves as manager may be terminated for “cause” by the holders of a majority of the most senior class of securities issued by such CLO Funds and the holders of a majority of the subordinated securities issued by such CLO Funds. “Cause” is defined in the asset management agreements to include a material breach by Katonah Debt Advisors of the indenture governing the applicable CLO Fund, breaches by Katonah Debt Advisors of certain specified provisions of the indenture, material breaches of representations or warranties made by Katonah Debt Advisors, bankruptcy or insolvency of Katonah Debt Advisors, fraud or criminal activity on the part of Katonah Debt Advisors or an event of default under the indenture governing the CLO Funds. We expect that future asset management agreements will contain comparable provisions. Further, a significant portion of the asset management fees payable to Katonah Debt Advisors under the asset management agreements are subordinated to the prior payments of interest on the senior securities issued by the CLO Funds. If the asset management agreements are terminated or the CLO Funds do not generate enough income to pay the subordinated management fees, we will not receive the fee income that we expect to continue to receive from Katonah Debt Advisors, which will reduce income available to make distributions to our stockholders. We may not receive any return on our investment in the CLO Funds in which we have invested and we may be unable to raise additional CLO Funds. As of December 31, 2008, we had $57 million invested in the subordinated securities or preferred shares issued by CLO Funds managed by Katonah Debt Advisors and certain other third party asset managers. We expect to continue to acquire subordinated securities in the future in CLO Funds managed by Katonah Debt Advisors and/or third party managers. These subordinated securities are the most junior class of securities issued by the CLO Funds and are subordinated in priority of payment to each other class of securities issued by these CLO Funds. Therefore, they only receive cash distributions if the CLO Funds have made all cash interest payments to all other debt securities issued by the CLO Fund. The subordinated securities are also unsecured and rank behind all of the secured creditors, known or unknown, of the CLO Fund, including the holders of the senior securities issued by the CLO Fund. Consequently, to the extent that the value of a CLO Fund’s loan investments has been reduced as a result of conditions in the credit markets, or as a result of default loans or individual fund assets, the value of the subordinated securities at their redemption could be reduced. Additionally, we may not be able to continue to complete new CLO Funds due to prevailing CLO market conditions or other factors. Risks Related to Our Operation as a BDC Our management team has limited experience managing a BDC. The 1940 Act imposes numerous constraints on the operations of BDCs. For example, BDCs are required to invest at least 70% of their total assets in specified types of securities, primarily in private companies or thinly traded U.S. public companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. See “Regulation.” Our management team’s limited experience in managing a portfolio of assets under such constraints may hinder our ability to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and, as a result, achieve our investment objective. Furthermore, any failure to comply with the requirements imposed on BDCs by the 1940 Act could cause the SEC to bring an enforcement action against us and/or expose us to claims of private litigants. If we do not remain a BDC, we might be regulated as a closed-end investment management company under the 1940 Act, which would further decrease our operating flexibility and may prevent us from operating our business as described in this Annual Report. See “Election to be Regulated as a Business Development Company and a Regulated Investment Company.” Furthermore, our management team’s limited experience in managing a BDC that qualifies as a RIC, which is subject to operating limitations under the Code, may hinder our ability to invest in certain assets that might otherwise be part of our investment strategy, thus reducing the return on your investment. For a description of the requirements to maintain RIC pass-through tax treatment, please see “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations.” 40 Our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted. We are prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with certain of our affiliates without the prior approval of our independent directors and, in some cases, the SEC. Any person that owns, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of our outstanding voting securities is our affiliate for purposes of the 1940 Act, and we generally are prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to such affiliate, absent the prior approval of our independent directors. The 1940 Act also prohibits certain “joint” transactions with certain of our affiliates, which could include investments in the same portfolio company (whether at the same or different times), without prior approval of our independent directors and, in some cases, the SEC. If a person acquires more than 25% of our voting securities, we are prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to such person or certain of that person’s affiliates, or entering into prohibited joint transactions with such persons, absent the prior approval of the SEC. Similar restrictions limit our ability to transact business with our officers or directors or their affiliates. As a result of these restrictions, we may be prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to any portfolio company of a private equity fund managed by Kohlberg & Co. without the prior approval of the SEC. In addition, we may co-invest on a concurrent basis with Kohlberg & Co. or any of our affiliates, subject to compliance with existing regulatory guidance, applicable regulations and our allocation procedures. Certain types of negotiated co-investments may be made only if we receive an order from the SEC permitting us to do so. There can be no assurance that any such order will be obtained. Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital. Our business requires a substantial amount of additional capital. We may acquire additional capital from the issuance of senior securities or other indebtedness, the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or from securitization transactions. However, we may not be able to raise additional capital in the future on favorable terms or at all. We may issue debt securities or preferred securities, which we refer to collectively as “senior securities,” and we may borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, up to the maximum amount permitted by the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act permits us to issue senior securities or incur indebtedness only in amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after such issuance or incurrence. Depending on the type of debt or preferred stock we have outstanding, our ability to pay dividends or issue additional senior securities may be restricted if our asset coverage ratio were not at least 200%. If the value of our assets declines, we may be unable to satisfy this test. If that happens, we may be required to liquidate a portion of our investments and repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous. • Senior Securities. As a result of issuing senior securities, we would also be exposed to typical risks associated with leverage, including an increased risk of loss. If we issue preferred securities they would rank “senior” to common stock in our capital structure. Preferred stockholders would have separate voting rights and may have rights, preferences or privileges more favorable than those of our common stock. Furthermore, the issuance of preferred securities could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stockholders or otherwise be in your best interest. • Additional Common Stock. Our Board of Directors may decide to issue common stock to finance our operations rather than issuing debt or other senior securities. As a BDC, we are generally not able to issue our common stock at a price below net asset value without first obtaining required approvals from our stockholders and our independent directors; we received the required stockholder approval at a special meeting on July 21, 2008 (this approval is valid for one year from the date of such approval). In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price, that in the determination of our Board of Directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any commission or discount). We may also make rights offerings to our stockholders at prices per share less than the net asset value per share, subject to the 1940 Act. If we raise additional funds by issuing more common stock or senior securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our common stock, the percentage ownership of our stockholders at that time would decrease, and you may experience dilution. • Securitization. In addition to issuing securities to raise capital as described above, we securitize a portion of our loans to generate cash for funding new investments through our Facility. To securitize loans, we have created a wholly-owned subsidiary and contributed a pool of loans to the subsidiary. An inability to successfully securitize our loan portfolio could limit our ability to grow our business and fully execute our business strategy and adversely affect our earnings, if any. Moreover, the successful securitization of our loan portfolio might expose us to losses, as the residual loans in which we do not sell interests tend to be those that are riskier and more apt to generate losses. 41 Changes in the laws or regulations governing our business, or changes in the interpretations thereof, and any failure by us to comply with these laws or regulations, could negatively affect the profitability of our operations. Changes in the laws or regulations or the interpretations of the laws and regulations that govern BDCs, RICs or non-depository commercial lenders, could significantly affect our operations and our cost of doing business. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations and are subject to judicial and administrative decisions that affect our operations, including our loan originations, maximum interest rates, fees and other charges, disclosures to portfolio companies, the terms of secured transactions, collection and foreclosure procedures and other trade practices. If these laws, regulations or decisions change, or if we expand our business into jurisdictions that have adopted more stringent requirements than those in which we currently conduct business, we may have to incur significant expenses in order to comply or we might have to restrict our operations. In addition, if we do not comply with applicable laws, regulations and decisions, we may lose licenses needed for the conduct of our business and be subject to civil fines and criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations or financial condition. If we do not invest a sufficient portion of our assets in “qualifying assets,” we could fail to qualify as a BDC or be precluded from investing according to our current business strategy. As a BDC, we may not acquire any assets other than “qualifying assets” for purposes of the 1940 Act unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such acquisition, at least 70% of our total assets are “qualifying assets.” See “Regulation.” We believe that most of the senior loans and mezzanine investments that we acquire constitute “qualifying assets.” However, investments in the equity securities of CLO Funds generally do not qualify as “qualifying assets,” and we may invest in other assets that are not “qualifying assets.” If we do not invest a sufficient portion of our assets in “qualifying assets,” we may be precluded from investing in what we believe are attractive investments or could lose our status as a BDC, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These restrictions could also prevent us from making investments in the equity securities of CLO Funds, which could limit Katonah Debt Advisors’ ability to organize new CLO Funds. Similarly, these rules could prevent us from making follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies (which could result in the dilution of our position) or could require us to dispose of investments at inappropriate times in order to come into compliance with the 1940 Act. If we need to dispose of such investments quickly, it would be difficult to dispose of such investments on favorable terms. For example, we may have difficulty in finding a buyer and, even if we do find a buyer, we may have to sell the investments at a substantial loss. If we are unable to qualify as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, we will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax, which will adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Provided we qualify as a RIC, we will generally not be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on income distributed to our stockholders as dividends. We will not continue to qualify for pass-through tax treatment as a RIC, and thus will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes, if we are unable to comply with the source-of-income, asset diversification and distribution requirements contained in the Code, or if we fail to maintain our election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Failure to meet the requirements for tax treatment as a RIC would subject us to taxes, which would reduce the return on your investment. As such, our failure to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC would have a material adverse effect on us, the net asset value of our common stock and the total return obtainable from your investment in our common stock. We may, from time to time, organize and conduct the business of our wholly-owned portfolio company, Katonah Debt Advisors, through additional direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries which may, in some cases, be taxable as corporations.
