Item 1A. Risk Factors Investors should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Risks Related to Our Business We may be unable to attract and retain members, which could have a negative effect on our business. The performance of our clubs is dependent on our ability to attract and retain members and we may not be successful in these efforts. Many of our members can cancel their club membership at any time under certain circumstances. In addition, there are numerous factors that have in the past and could in the future lead to a decline in membership levels at established clubs or that could prevent us from increasing our membership at newer clubs, including a decline in our ability to deliver quality service at a competitive cost, the presence of direct and indirect competition in the areas in which the clubs are located, the publics interest in sports and fitness clubs and general economic conditions. The current volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets have reached unprecedented levels and have significantly adversely impacted global economic conditions, resulting in additional significant recessionary pressures and further declines in consumer confidence and economic growth. These conditions have and could further lead to reduced consumer spending in the foreseeable future. In the current depressed economic environment, consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on the demand for the Companys services and products and such decline in demand may continue as the current recessionary period continues and disposable income declines. Other factors that could influence demand include increases in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. The current 15 Table of Contents downturn and uncertain outlook in the global economy may materially adversely affect our business and our revenues and profits. As a result of these factors, membership levels might not be adequate to maintain our operations at current levels or permit the expansion of our operations. In addition, to the extent our corporate clients are adversely affected by negative economic conditions, they may decide, as part of expense reduction strategies, to curtail or cancel club membership benefits provided to their respective employees. Any reductions in corporate memberships may lead to membership cancellations as we can not assure that employees of corporate customers will choose to continue their memberships without employer subsidies. A decline in membership levels may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our geographic concentration heightens our exposure to adverse regional developments. As of December 31, 2008, we operated 112 fitness clubs in the New York metropolitan market, 25 fitness clubs in the Boston market, 19 fitness clubs in the Washington, D.C. market, seven fitness clubs in the Philadelphia market and three fitness clubs in Switzerland. Our geographic concentration in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions and, in particular, the New York area, heightens our exposure to adverse developments related to competition, as well as economic and demographic changes in these regions. Our geographic concentration might result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations in the future. The level of competition in the fitness club industry could negatively impact our revenue growth rates and profits. The fitness club industry is competitive and continues to become more competitive. In each of the markets in which we operate, we compete with other fitness clubs, physical fitness and recreational facilities established by local governments, hospitals and businesses for their employees, amenity and condominium clubs, the YMCA and similar organizations and, to a certain extent, with racquet and tennis and other athletic clubs, country clubs, weight reducing salons and the home-use fitness equipment industry. We also compete with other entertainment and retail businesses for the discretionary income in our target demographics. We might not be able to compete effectively in the future in the markets in which we operate. Competitors include companies that are larger and have greater resources than us and they may enter these markets to our detriment. These competitive conditions may limit our ability to increase dues without a material loss in membership, attract new members and attract and retain qualified personnel. Additionally, consolidation in the fitness club industry could result in increased competition among participants, particularly large multi-facility operators that are able to compete for attractive acquisition candidates or newly constructed club locations, thereby increasing costs associated with expansion through both acquisitions and lease negotiation and real estate availability for newly constructed club locations. Competitors offering lower pricing and a lower level of service compete against our facilities. Furthermore, smaller and less expensive weight loss facilities present a competitive alternative for consumers. We also face competition from competitors offering comparable or higher pricing with higher levels of service. The trend to larger outer-suburban, multi-recreational family fitness centers, in areas where suitable real estate is more likely to be available, also compete against our suburban, fitness-only models. In addition, large competitors could enter the urban markets in which we operate to attempt to open a chain of clubs in these markets through one, or a series of, acquisitions. If we are unable to identify and acquire suitable sites for new clubs, our revenue growth rate and profits may be negatively impacted. To successfully expand our business over the long term, we must identify and acquire sites that meet the site selection criteria we have established. In addition to finding sites with the right geographical, demographic and other measures we employ in our selection process, we also need to evaluate the penetration of our competitors in the market. We face competition from other health and fitness center operators for sites that meet our criteria and as a result, we may lose those sites, our competitors could copy our format or we could be forced to pay higher prices for those sites. If we are unable to identify and acquire sites for new clubs on attractive terms, our revenue growth rate and profits may be negatively impacted. Additionally, if our analysis of the suitability of a site is incorrect, we may not be able to recover our capital investment in developing and building the new club. 16 Table of Contents We may experience prolonged periods of losses in our recently opened clubs. We have opened a total of 24 new club locations that we have constructed in the 24-month period ended December 31, 2008. Upon opening a club, we typically experience an initial period of club operating losses. Enrollment from pre-sold memberships typically generates insufficient revenue for the club to initially generate positive cash flow. As a result, a new club typically generates an operating loss in its first full year of operations and substantially lower margins in its second full year of operations than a club opened for more than 24 months (mature club). These operating losses and lower margins will negatively impact our future results of operations. This negative impact will be increased by the initial expensing of pre-opening costs, which include legal and other costs associated with lease negotiations and permitting and zoning requirements, as well as depreciation and amortization expenses, which will further negatively impact net income. We may, at our discretion, accelerate or expand our plans to open new clubs, which may temporarily adversely affect results from operations. We could be subject to claims related to health or safety risks at our clubs. Use of our clubs poses some potential health or safety risks to members or guests through physical exertion and use of our services and facilities, including exercise equipment. Claims might be asserted against us for injury suffered by, or death of members or guests while exercising at a club. We might not be able to successfully defend such claims. As a result, we might not be able to maintain our general liability insurance on acceptable terms in the future or maintain a level of insurance that would provide adequate coverage against potential claims. Depending upon the outcome, these matters may have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Security and privacy breaches may expose us to liability and cause us to lose customers. Federal and state law requires us to safeguard our customers financial information, including credit card information. Although we have established security procedures to protect against identity theft and the theft of our customers financial information, our security and testing measures may not prevent security breaches and breaches of our customers privacy may occur, which could harm our business. For example, a significant number of our users provide us with credit card and other confidential information and authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for our products and services. Typically, we rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to enhance transmission security of confidential information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, inadequate facility security or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect customer data. Any compromise of our security could harm our reputation or financial condition and, therefore, our business. In addition, a party who is able to circumvent our security measures or exploit inadequacies in our security measures, could, among other effects, misappropriate proprietary information, cause interruptions in our operations or expose customers to computer viruses or other disruptions. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. To the extent the measures we have taken prove to be insufficient or inadequate, we may become subject to litigation or administrative sanctions, which could result in significant fines, penalties or damages and harm to our reputation. Loss of key personnel and/or failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel could make it more difficult for us to develop our business and enhance our financial performance. We are dependent on the continued services of our senior management team, particularly Alexander A. Alimanestianu, our Chief Executive Officer. We believe the loss of Mr. Alimanestianu could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial performance. Currently, we do not have any long-term employment agreements with any of our executive officers and we may not be able to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel to meet our business needs. Terrorism and the uncertainty of armed conflicts may have a material adverse effect on clubs and our operating results. Terrorist attacks, such as the attacks that occurred in New York and Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001 and other acts of violence or war may affect the markets in which we operate, our operating results or the market on which our common stock trades. Our geographic concentration in the major cities in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions and, in particular, the New York and Washington, D.C. areas, heightens our exposure to any such future 17 Table of Contents terrorist attacks, which may adversely affect our clubs and result in a decrease in our revenues. The potential near-term and long-term effect these attacks may have for our members, the markets for our services and the market for our common stock are uncertain; however, their occurrence can be expected to further negatively affect the United States economy generally and specifically the regional markets in which we operate. The consequences of any terrorist attacks or any armed conflicts are unpredictable; and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business. Disruptions and failures involving our information systems could cause customer dissatisfaction and adversely affect our billing and other administrative functions. The continuing and uninterrupted performance of our information systems is critical to our success. Our members may become dissatisfied by any systems disruption or failure that interrupts our ability to provide our services to them, including programs and adequate staffing. Disruptions or failures that affect our billing and other administrative functions could have an adverse affect on our operating results. We use a fully-integrated information system to sell memberships, bill our members, track and analyze sales and membership statistics, the frequency and timing of member workouts, cross-club utilization, member life, value-added services and demographic profiles by member. This system also assists us in evaluating staffing needs and program offerings. Correcting any disruptions or failures that affected our proprietary system could be difficult, time-consuming and expensive because we would need to use contracted consultants familiar with our system. In 2008, we commenced the development of GIMS, which we expect to roll out to our clubs in the first half of 2010. We estimate that the total cost of creating and implementing GIMS to be approximately between $12.0 million and $15.0 million. Any failure of this new system to be operational in the expected time frame or to function as expected could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We have implemented numerous infrastructure changes to accommodate our growth, provide network redundancy, better manage telecommunications and data costs, increase efficiencies in operations and improve management of all components of our technical architecture. In 2005, we brought our disaster recovery site online. The disaster recovery facility utilizes replication tools to provide failover capabilities for supporting our club operations and company communications. Fire, floods, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins, acts of terrorism and similar events could damage either our primary or back-up systems. In addition, computer viruses, electronic break-ins or other similar disruptive problems could also adversely affect our online sites. Any system disruption or failure, security breach or other damage that interrupts or delays our operations could cause us to lose members and adversely affect our business and results of operations. The opening of new clubs by us in existing locations may negatively impact our comparable club revenue increases and our operating margins. We currently operate clubs throughout the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. We opened nine clubs in 2008 and three clubs since December 31, 2008. In addition, we currently have four clubs for which we have signed lease commitments in existing markets. With respect to existing markets, it has been our experience that opening new clubs may attract some memberships away from other clubs already operated by us in those markets and diminish their revenues. In addition, as a result of new club openings in existing markets and because older clubs will represent an increasing proportion of our club base over time, our mature club revenue increases may be lower in future periods than in the past. Another result of opening new clubs is that our club operating margins may be lower than they have been historically while the clubs build a membership base. We expect both the addition of pre-opening expenses and the lower revenue volumes characteristic of newly-opened clubs to affect our club operating margins at these new clubs. Our continued growth could place strains on our management, employees, information systems and internal controls, which may adversely impact our business. Over the past five years, we have experienced significant growth in our business activities and operations, including an increase in the number of our clubs. Future expansion will place increased demands on our administrative, operational, financial and other resources. Any failure to manage growth effectively could seriously harm our business. To be successful, we will need to continue to improve management information systems and our operating, administrative, financial and accounting systems and controls. We will also need to train new employees 18 Table of Contents and maintain close coordination among our executive, accounting, finance, marketing, sales and operations functions. These processes are time-consuming and expensive, increase management responsibilities and divert management attention. Our cash and cash equivalents are concentrated in one bank. Our cash and cash equivalents are held, primarily, in a single commercial bank. These deposits are not collateralized. In the event the bank becomes insolvent, we would be unable to recover most of our cash and cash equivalents deposited at the bank. Cash and cash equivalents held in a single commercial bank as of December 31, 2008 were $6.9 million. Because of the capital-intensive nature of our business, we may have to incur additional indebtedness or issue new equity securities and, if we are not able to obtain additional capital, our ability to operate or expand our business may be impaired and our results of operations could be adversely affected. Our business requires significant levels of capital to finance the development of additional sites for new clubs and the construction of our clubs. If cash from available sources is insufficient or unavailable due to restrictive credit markets, or if cash is used for unanticipated needs, we may require additional capital sooner than anticipated. In the event that we are required or choose to raise additional funds, we may be unable to do so on favorable terms or at all. Furthermore, the cost of debt financing could significantly increase, making it cost-prohibitive to borrow, which could force us to issue new equity securities. If we issue new equity securities, existing shareholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to execute on current growth plans, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. Any inability to raise additional capital when required could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. We may incur rising costs related to construction of new clubs and maintaining our existing clubs. If we are not able to pass these cost increases through to our members, our returns may be adversely affected. Our clubs require significant upfront investment. If our investment is higher than we had planned, we may need to outperform our operational plan to achieve our targeted return. Over the longer term, we believe that we can offset cost increases by increasing our membership dues and other fees and improving profitability through cost efficiencies; however, higher costs in certain regions where we are opening new clubs during any period of time may be difficult to offset in the short-term. Risks Related to Our Leverage and Our Indebtedness We may be negatively affected by the economic crisis in the United States and key international markets. We must maintain liquidity to fund our working capital, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance investment opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue new business opportunities. If our current resources do not satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may have to seek additional financing. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our $260.0 million senior secured credit facility (the 2007 Senior Credit Facility). The capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption during the past year. As a result, one or more of our current lenders could experience financial difficulty, and as a result fail to provide the required lending amounts under our 2007 Credit Agreement. If this should occur, we may need to seek additional financing from other sources. The availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, the availability of credit and our credit ratings, as well as the possibility that lenders could develop a negative perception of the prospects of our company or the fitness industry in general. We may not be able to successfully obtain any necessary additional financing on favorable terms, or financing altogether. Economic conditions, both domestic and foreign, may affect our financial performance. Prevailing economic conditions, including unemployment levels, inflation, availability of credit, energy costs and other macro-economic factors, as well as uncertainty about future economic conditions, adversely affect consumer spending and, consequently, our business and results of operations. 19 Table of Contents Our leverage may impair our financial condition and we may incur significant additional debt. We currently have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2008, our total consolidated debt was $338.0 million. Our substantial debt could have important consequences, including:  making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness;  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions of clubs and other general corporate requirements;  requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of interest on our debt, which is variable on our 2007 Senior Credit Facility and our Revolving Loan Facility, and reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions of new clubs and general corporate requirements; and  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate. These limitations and consequences may place us at a competitive disadvantage to other less-leveraged competitors. The indenture governing our 11% Senior Discount Notes due in 2014 (Senior Discount Notes) will permit us and our subsidiaries to incur substantial additional debt, subject to compliance with provisions of the Indenture. In addition, as of December 31, 2008, we had $42.8 million of unutilized borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries current debt levels, the related risks that we and they currently face could intensify. We may not have access to the cash flow and other assets of our subsidiaries that may be needed to make payments on our outstanding Indebtedness. Our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries and our ability to make payments on our outstanding Senior Discount Notes is dependent on the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. However, none of our subsidiaries are obligated to make funds available to us for payment on our outstanding Senior Discount Notes. In addition, the terms of the Credit Agreement dated as of February 27, 2007 (the 2007 Credit Agreement) governing the 2007 Senior Credit Facility, significantly restrict TSI, LLC and its subsidiaries from paying dividends and otherwise transferring assets to us. Furthermore, our subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of the 2007 Credit Agreement and other indebtedness (including under the Senior Discount Notes indenture) to incur additional indebtedness that may severely restrict or prohibit the making of distributions, the payment of dividends or the making of loans by such subsidiaries to us. We cannot assure that the agreements governing the current and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries will permit our subsidiaries to provide TSI, LLC with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund scheduled interest and principal payments on the 2007 Credit Agreement when due. Covenant restrictions under our indebtedness may limit our ability to operate our business and, in such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to settle our indebtedness. The indenture governing our Senior Discount Notes, 2007 Credit Agreement and certain of our other agreements regarding our indebtedness contain, among other things, covenants that may restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. The indenture governing our Senior Discount Notes, the 2007 Credit Agreement and certain of our other agreements regarding our indebtedness restrict, among other things, may impact our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:  borrow money;  pay dividends or make distributions;  purchase or redeem stock;  make investments and extend credit;  engage in transactions with affiliates; 20 Table of Contents  engage in sale-leaseback transactions;  consummate certain asset sales;  effect a consolidation or merger or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and  create liens on our assets. In addition, the 2007 Credit Agreement requires the Company, on a consolidated basis, to maintain a specified financial ratio and satisfy certain financial condition tests that may require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives. The 2007 Credit Agreement requires the Company, on a consolidated basis, to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio not greater than 4.25:1.00 of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the 2007 Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with such ratio test, with a ratio of 2.35:1.00. In the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $17.6 million primary related to our Boston Sports Clubs region. As of December 31, 2008, we had $32.6 million of goodwill remaining on our consolidated balance sheet. If we were to experience material additional goodwill impairment charges it would increase our total leverage ratio and depending upon the amount of goodwill impairment charges recorded, such an impairment could result in a failure to maintain the required minimum total leverage ratio of 4.25 to 1.00 and would result in a breach of our covenant under the 2007 Credit Agreement. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  2007 Senior Credit Facility for further discussion of our covenants under our 2007 Senior Credit Facility. Events beyond our control, including changes in general economic and business conditions, may affect our ability to meet certain financial ratios and financial condition tests. We may be unable to meet those tests and the lenders may decide not to waive any failure to meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under the indenture governing our Senior Discount Notes and the 2007 Credit Agreement. If an event of default under the 2007 Credit Agreement occurs, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. In the event of default under the indenture governing our Senior Discount Notes, the note holders could elect to declare due all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest. If any such event should occur, we might not have sufficient assets to pay our indebtedness. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None
