Item 1A. Risk Factors - ContinuedIn order to comply with U.S. laws with respect to the ownership of interests in oil and natural gas leases on federal lands, we have adopted certain requirements regarding those investors who may own our units. As used herein, an Eligible Holder means a person or entity qualified to hold an interest in oil and natural gas leases on federal lands. As of the date hereof, Eligible Holder means: (1) a citizen of the U.S.; (2) a corporation organized under the laws of the U.S. or of any state thereof; or (3) an association of U.S. citizens, such as a partnership or limited liability company, organized under the laws of the U.S. or of any state thereof, but only if such association does not have any direct or indirect foreign ownership, other than foreign ownership of stock in a parent corporation organized under the laws of the U.S. or of any state thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, onshore mineral leases or any direct or indirect interest therein may be acquired and held by aliens only through stock ownership, holding or control in a corporation organized under the laws of the U.S. or of any state thereof and only for so long as the alien is not from a country that the U.S. federal government regards as denying similar privileges to citizens or corporations of the U.S. Unitholders who are not persons or entities who meet the requirements to be an Eligible Holder will not be entitled to receive distributions in kind on their units in a liquidation and they run the risk of having their units redeemed by us at the then-current market price.Item 1B.
