Item 1A, Risk Factors. 25 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The only assets of and sources of income to the trust are the net profits interests, which generally entitle the trust to receive a share of the net profits from oil and gas production from the underlying properties. Consequently, the trust is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in oil and gas prices. The trust is a passive entity and, other than the trusts ability to periodically borrow money as necessary to pay expenses, liabilities and obligations of the trust that cannot be paid out of cash held by the trust, the trust is prohibited from engaging in borrowing transactions. The amount of any such borrowings is unlikely to be material to the trust. In addition, the trustee is prohibited by the trust indenture from engaging in any business activity or causing the trust to enter into any investments other than investing cash on hand in specific short-term cash investments. Therefore, the trust cannot hold any derivative financial instruments. As a result of the limited nature of its borrowing and investing activities, the trust is not subject to any material interest rate market risk. Additionally, any gains or losses from any hedging activities conducted by XTO Energy are specifically excluded from the calculation of net proceeds due the trust under the forms of the conveyances. The trust does not engage in transactions in foreign currencies which could expose the trust to any foreign currency related market risk. Item 8.

Trust Organization and Provisions Hugoton Royalty Trust was created on December 1, 1998 by XTO Energy Inc. (formerly known as Cross Timbers Oil Company). Effective on that date, XTO Energy conveyed 80% net profits interests in certain predominantly gas-producing working interest properties in Kansas, Oklahoma and Wyoming to the trust under separate conveyances for each of the three states. In exchange for the conveyances of the net profits interests to the trust, XTO Energy received 40 million units of beneficial interest in the trust. The trusts initial public offering was in April 1999. The majority of the underlying working interest properties are currently owned and operated by XTO Energy (Note 8). Bank of America, N.A. is the trustee for the trust. In 2007 the Bank of America private wealth management group officially became known as U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management. The legal entity that serves as the trustee of the trust did not change, and references in this Annual Report to U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management shall describe the legal entity Bank of America, N.A. The trust indenture provides, among other provisions, that: - the trust cannot engage in any business activity or acquire any assets other than the net profits interests and specific short-term cash investments; - the trust may dispose of all or part of the net profits interests if approved by 80% of the unitholders, or upon trust termination. Otherwise, the trust may sell up to 1% of the value of the net profits interests in any calendar year, pursuant to notice from XTO Energy of its desire to sell the related underlying properties. Any sale must be for cash with the proceeds promptly distributed to the unitholders; - the trustee may establish a cash reserve for payment of any liability that is contingent or not currently payable; - the trustee may borrow funds to pay trust liabilities if repaid in full prior to further distributions to unitholders; - the trustee will make monthly cash distributions to unitholders (Note 3); and - the trust will terminate upon the first occurrence of: - disposition of all net profits interests pursuant to terms of the trust indenture, - gross proceeds from the underlying properties falling below $1 million per year for two successive years, or - a vote of 80% of the unitholders to terminate the trust in accordance with provisions of the trust indenture. 2. Basis of Accounting The financial statements of the trust are prepared on the following basis and are not intended to present financial position and results of operations in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles: - Net profits income is recorded in the month received by the trustee (Note 3). - Trust expenses are recorded based on liabilities paid and cash reserves established by the trustee for liabilities and contingencies. - Distributions to unitholders are recorded when declared by the trustee (Note 3). The most significant differences between the trusts financial statements and those prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles are: - Net profits income is recognized in the month received rather than accrued in the month of production. - Expenses are recognized when paid rather than when incurred. - Cash reserves may be established by the trustee for contingencies that would not be recorded under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This comprehensive basis of accounting corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E, Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts. 30 Table of Contents Most accounting pronouncements apply to entities whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, directing such entities to accrue or defer revenues and expenses in a period other than when such revenues were received or expenses were paid. Because the trusts financial statements are prepared on the modified cash basis, as described above, most accounting pronouncements are not applicable to the trusts financial statements. The initial carrying value of the net profits interests of $247,066,951 was XTO Energys historical net book value of the interests on December 1, 1998, the date of the transfer to the trust. Amortization of the net profits interests is calculated on a unit-of-production basis and charged directly to trust corpus. Accumulated amortization was $131,698,955 as of December 31, 2011 and $122,073,185 as of December 31, 2010. 3. Distributions to Unitholders The trustee determines the amount to be distributed to unitholders each month by totaling net profits income, interest income and other cash receipts, and subtracting liabilities paid and adjustments in cash reserves established by the trustee. The resulting amount is distributed to unitholders of record within ten business days after the monthly record date, which is the last business day of the month. Net profits income received by the trustee consists of net proceeds received in the prior month by XTO Energy from the underlying properties, multiplied by 80%. Net proceeds are the gross proceeds received from the sale of production, less costs. Costs generally include applicable taxes, transportation, legal and marketing charges, production expense, development and drilling costs, and overhead (Note 8). XTO Energy, as owner of the underlying properties, computes net profits income separately for each of the three conveyances (one for each of the states of Kansas, Oklahoma and Wyoming). If costs exceed revenues for any conveyance, such excess costs must be recovered, with accrued interest, from future net proceeds of that conveyance and cannot reduce net profits income from the other conveyances (Note 4). 4. Excess Costs Costs exceeded revenues by $513,475 ($410,780 net to the trust) on properties underlying the Kansas net profits interests in October and November 2009. Lower gas prices caused costs to exceed revenues on properties underlying the Kansas net profits interests. However, these excess costs did not reduce net proceeds from the remaining conveyances. XTO Energy advised the trustee that increased gas prices led to the partial recovery of excess costs of $410,957 ($328,766 net to the trust), plus accrued interest of $1,958 ($1,566 net to the trust) in December 2009 and the full recovery of excess costs of $102,518 ($82,014 net to the trust), plus accrued interest of $282 ($226 net to the trust) in January 2010. There were no excess costs as of December 31, 2011. 31 Table of Contents 5. Development Costs The following summarizes actual development costs, budgeted development costs deducted in the calculation of net profits income, and the cumulative actual costs compared to the amount deducted: Year Ended December 31 2011 2010 2009 Cumulative actual costs (over) under the amount deducted - beginning of period $ (809,696 ) $ 909,477 $ (7,314,084 ) Actual costs (5,593,384 ) (8,969,173 ) (12,776,439 ) Budgeted costs deducted 8,800,000 7,250,000 21,000,000 Cumulative actual costs under (over) the amount deducted - end of period $ 2,396,920 $ (809,696 ) $ 909,477 The monthly development cost deduction was $4.0 million from the January 2009 distribution through the March 2009 distribution. As a result of decreased development activity and revisions to the 2009 development budget, the development cost deduction was decreased to $2.0 million beginning with the April 2009 distribution, to $1.0 million beginning with the June 2009 distribution and to $500,000 beginning with the September 2009 distribution and was maintained at that level through the July 2010 distribution. As a result of increased development activity, the development cost deduction was increased to $600,000 beginning with the August 2010 distribution and to $850,000 beginning with the October 2010 distribution and was maintained at that level through the August 2011 distribution. Due to lower than anticipated actual costs as a result of reduced activity, the development cost deduction was decreased to $500,000 beginning with the September 2011 distribution and was maintained at that level for the remainder of 2011. For further information on 2012 budgeted development costs, see Properties, under Item 2. The monthly deduction is based on the current level of development expenditures, budgeted future development costs and the cumulative actual costs under (over) previous deductions. XTO Energy has advised the trustee that this monthly deduction will continue to be evaluated and revised as necessary. 6. Federal Income Taxes For federal income tax purposes, the trust constitutes a fixed investment trust which is taxed as a grantor trust. A grantor trust is not subject to tax at the trust level. The unitholders are considered to own the trusts income and principal as though no trust were in existence. The income of the trust is deemed to have been received or accrued by each unitholder at the time such income is received or accrued by the trust and not when distributed by the trust. Because the trust is a grantor trust for federal tax purposes, each unitholder is taxed directly on his proportionate share of income, deductions and credits of the trust consistent with each such unitholders taxable year and method of accounting and without regard to the taxable year or method of accounting employed by the trust. The income of the trust consists primarily of a specified share of the net profits from the sale of oil and natural gas produced from the underlying properties. During 2011, the trust earned interest income on funds held for distribution and for the cash reserve maintained for the payment of contingent and future obligations of the trust. The net profits interests constitute economic interests in oil and gas properties for federal tax purposes. Each unitholder is entitled to amortize the cost of the units through cost depletion over the life of the net profits interests or, if greater, through percentage depletion equal to 15 percent of gross income. Unlike cost depletion, percentage depletion is not limited to a unitholders depletable tax basis in the units. Rather, a unitholder is entitled to a percentage depletion deduction as long as the applicable underlying properties generate gross income. Unitholders may compute both percentage depletion and cost depletion from each property, and claim the larger amount as a deduction on their income tax returns. If a taxpayer disposes of any Section 1254 property (certain oil, gas, geothermal or other mineral property), and if the adjusted basis of such property includes adjustments for deductions for depletion under Section 611 of the Internal Revenue Code, the taxpayer generally must recapture the amount deducted for depletion as ordinary income (to the extent of gain realized on the disposition of the property). This depletion recapture rule applies to any disposition of property that was placed in service by the taxpayer after December 31, 1986. Detailed rules set forth in Sections 1.1254-1 through 1.1254-6 of the U.S. Treasury Regulations govern dispositions of property after March 13, 1995. The Internal Revenue Service likely will take the position that a unitholder must recapture depletion upon the disposition of a unit. Interest and net profits income attributable to ownership of units and any gain on the sale thereof are considered portfolio income, and not income from a passive activity, to the extent a unitholder acquires and holds units as an investment and not in the ordinary course of a trade or business. Therefore, interest and net profits income attributable to ownership of units generally may not be offset by losses from any passive activities. 32 Table of Contents Some trust units are held by middlemen, as such term is broadly defined in U.S. Treasury Regulations (and includes custodians, nominees, certain joint owners, and brokers holding an interest for a customer in street name, collectively referred to herein as middlemen). Therefore, the trustee considers the trust to be a non-mortgage widely held fixed investment trust (WHFIT) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management, EIN: 56-0906609, Post Office Box 830650, Dallas, Texas. 75283-0650, telephone number 1-877-228-5083, email address trustee@hugotontrust.com, is the representative of the trust that will provide tax information in accordance with applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations governing the information reporting requirements of the trust as a WHFIT. Tax information is also posted by the trustee at www.hugotontrust.com. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the middlemen holding trust units on behalf of unitholders, and not the trustee of the trust, are solely responsible for complying with the information reporting requirements under the U.S. Treasury Regulations with respect to such trust units, including the issuance of IRS Forms 1099 and certain written tax statements. Unitholders whose trust units are held by middlemen should consult with such middlemen regarding the information that will be reported to them by the middlemen with respect to the trust units. Unitholders should consult their tax advisors regarding trust tax compliance matters. 7. State Income Taxes All revenues from the trust are from sources within either Kansas, Oklahoma or Wyoming. Because it distributes all of its net income to unitholders, the trust has not been taxed at the trust level in Kansas or Oklahoma. While the trust has not owed tax, the Trustee is required to file a return with Oklahoma and Kansas reflecting the income and deductions of the Trust attributable to properties located in each state, along with a schedule that includes information regarding distributions to unitholders. Oklahoma and Kansas tax the income of nonresidents from real property located within those states, and the trust has been advised by counsel that those states will each tax nonresidents on income from the net profits interests located in those states. Wyoming does not have a state income tax. Kansas and Oklahoma also impose a corporate income tax that may apply to unitholders organized as corporations (subject to certain exceptions for S corporations and limited liability companies, depending on their treatment for federal tax purposes). Each unitholder should consult his or her own tax advisor regarding state income tax requirements, if any, applicable to such persons ownership of trust units. 8. XTO Energy Inc. XTO Energy operates approximately 95% of the underlying properties. In computing net proceeds, XTO Energy deducts an overhead charge for reimbursement of administrative expenses on the underlying properties it operates. As of December 31, 2011, the overhead charge was approximately $907,000 ($725,600 net to the trust) per month and is subject to annual adjustment based on an oil and gas industry index as defined in the trust agreement. XTO Energy sells a significant portion of natural gas production from the underlying properties to certain of XTO Energys wholly owned subsidiaries under contracts in existence when the trust was created, generally at amounts approximating monthly published market prices. Most of the production from the Hugoton area is sold under a contract to Timberland Gathering & Processing Company, Inc. (TGPC) based on the index price. Much of the gas production in Major County, Oklahoma is sold to Ringwood Gathering Company (RGC), which retains approximately $0.31 per Mcf as a compression and gathering fee. TGPC and RGC sell gas to Cross Timbers Energy Services, Inc. (CTES), which markets gas to third parties. XTO Energy sells directly to CTES most gas production not sold directly to TGPC or RGC. Total gas sales from the underlying properties to XTO Energys wholly owned subsidiaries were $35.6 million for 2011, or 35% of total gas sales, $48.5 million for 2010, or 43% of total gas sales and, $42.2 million for 2009, or 47% of total gas sales. On June 25, 2010, XTO Energy became a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corporation. 33 Table of Contents 9. Contingencies Litigation An amended petition for a class action lawsuit, Beer, et al. v. XTO Energy Inc., was filed in January 2006 in the District Court of Texas County, Oklahoma by certain royalty owners of natural gas wells in Oklahoma and Kansas. The plaintiffs allege that XTO Energy has not properly accounted to the plaintiffs for the royalties to which they are entitled and seek an accounting regarding the natural gas and other products produced from their wells and the prices paid for the natural gas and other products produced, and for payment of the monies allegedly owed since June 2002, with a certain limited number of plaintiffs claiming monies owed for additional time. XTO Energy removed the case to federal district court in Oklahoma City. In April 2010, new counsel and representative parties, Fankhouser and Goddard, filed a motion to intervene and prosecute the Beer class, now styled Fankhouser v. XTO Energy Inc. This motion was granted on July 13, 2010. The new plaintiffs and counsel filed an amended complaint asserting new causes of action for breach of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment. On December 16, 2010, the court certified the class. Cross motions for summary judgment have been filed by the parties, and the case is set for trial in April 2012. XTO Energy has informed the trustee that XTO Energy believes that it has strong defenses to this lawsuit and intends to vigorously defend its position. In September 2008, a class action lawsuit was filed against XTO Energy styled Wallace B. Roderick Revocable Living Trust, et al. v. XTO Energy Inc. in the District Court of Kearny County, Kansas. XTO Energy removed the case to federal court in Wichita, Kansas. The plaintiffs allege that XTO Energy has improperly taken post-production costs from royalties paid to the plaintiffs from wells located in Kansas, Oklahoma and Colorado. The plaintiffs have filed a motion to certify the class, including only Kansas and Oklahoma wells not part of the Fankhouser matter. After filing the motion to certify, but prior to the class certification hearing, the plaintiff filed a motion to sever the Oklahoma portion of the case so it could be transferred and consolidated with a newly filed class action in Oklahoma styled Chieftain Royalty Company v. XTO Energy Inc. This motion was granted. The Roderick case now comprises only Kansas wells not previously included in the Fankhouser matter. XTO Energy has informed the trustee that it believes that XTO Energy has strong defenses to this lawsuit and intends to vigorously defend its position. In December 2010, a class action lawsuit was filed against XTO Energy styled Chieftain Royalty Company v. XTO Energy Inc. in Coal County District Court, Oklahoma. XTO Energy removed the case to federal court in the Eastern District of Oklahoma. The plaintiffs allege that XTO Energy wrongfully deducted fees from royalty payments on Oklahoma wells, failed to make diligent efforts to secure the best terms available for the sale of gas and its constituents, and demand an accounting to determine whether they have been fully and fairly paid gas royalty interests. The case expressly excludes those claims and wells being prosecuted in the Fankhouser case. The severed Roderick case claims related to the Oklahoma portion of the case were consolidated into Chieftain. XTO Energy has informed the trustee that it believes that XTO Energy has strong defenses to this lawsuit and intends to vigorously defend its position. If XTO Energy ultimately makes any settlement payments or receives a judgment against it in any of the cases named above, the trust will bear its 80% share of such settlement or judgment related to production from the underlying properties. Additionally, if the judgment or settlement increases the amount of future payments to royalty owners, the trust would bear its proportionate share of the increased payments through reduced net proceeds. XTO Energy has informed the trustee that, although the amount of any reduction in net proceeds is not presently determinable, in its managements opinion, the amount is not currently expected to be material to the trusts financial position or liquidity though it could be material to the trusts annual distributable income. Additionally, it could result in costs exceeding revenues on the properties underlying the Oklahoma and Kansas net profit interests for one or more monthly distributions, depending on the size of the judgment or settlement, if any, and the net proceeds being paid at that time. Certain of the underlying properties are involved in various other lawsuits and certain governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. XTO Energy has advised the trustee that it does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these claims will have a material effect on trust annual distributable income, financial position or liquidity. Other Several states have enacted legislation requiring state income tax withholding from nonresident recipients of oil and gas proceeds. After consultation with its tax counsel, the trustee believes that it is not required to withhold on payments made to the unitholders. However, regulations are subject to change by the various states, which could change this conclusion. Should amounts be withheld on payments made to the trust or the unitholders, distributions to the unitholders would be reduced by the required amount, subject to the filing of a claim for refund by the trust or unitholders for such amount. 34 Table of Contents 10. Supplemental Oil and Gas Reserve Information (Unaudited) Oil and Natural Gas Reserves Proved oil and gas reserves have been estimated by independent petroleum engineers. Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulation before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. Proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well. Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available. The reserves actually recovered and the timing of production of these reserves may be substantially different from the original estimate. Revisions result primarily from new information obtained from development drilling and production history and from changes in economic factors. Standardized Measure The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes in such cash flows are prepared using assumptions required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Such assumptions include the use of 12-month average prices for oil and gas, based on the first-day-of-the-month price for each month in the period for 2011, 2010 and 2009, and year end costs for estimated future development and production expenditures to produce the proved reserves. Prior to 2009, standardized measure was calculated using year end oil and gas prices and costs. Future net cash flows are discounted at an annual rate of 10%. No provision is included for federal income taxes since future net cash flows are not subject to taxation at the trust level. The standardized measure does not represent managements estimate of our future cash flows or the value of proved oil and gas reserves. Probable and possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. Furthermore, prices used to determine the standardized measure are influenced by supply and demand as affected by recent economic conditions as well as other factors and may not be the most representative in estimating future revenues or reserve data. Estimated costs to plug and abandon wells on the underlying working interest properties at the end of their productive lives have not been deducted from cash flows since this is not a legal obligation of the trust. These costs are the legal obligation of XTO Energy as the owner of the underlying working interests and will only be deducted from net proceeds payable to the trust if net proceeds from the related conveyance exceed such costs when paid, subject to excess cost carryforward provisions (Notes 3 and 4). The average realized gas prices used to determine the standardized measure were $4.67 per Mcf in 2011, $4.45 per Mcf in 2010, and $3.28 per Mcf in 2009 and a year end realized gas price of $4.47 per Mcf in 2008. Oil prices used to determine the standardized measure were based on average realized oil prices of $92.92 per Bbl in 2011, $75.91 per Bbl in 2010, and $57.17 per Bbl in 2009 and a year end realized oil price of $42.13 per Bbl in 2008. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we used average oil and gas prices, based on the first-day-of-the-month price for each month in the period. For periods prior to 2009, we used year end oil and gas prices. 35 Table of Contents Proved Reserves Underlying Properties Net Profits Interests Gas Oil Gas Oil (in thousands) (Mcf) (Bbls) (Mcf) (Bbls) Balance, December 31, 2008 366,305 3,309 178,483 1,682 Extensions, additions and discoveries 5,447 354 2,369 154 Revisions of prior estimates (21,865 ) (398 ) (55,473 ) (621 ) Production - sales volumes (26,642 ) (260 ) (8,326 ) (91 ) Balance, December 31, 2009 323,245 3,005 117,053 1,124 Extensions, additions and discoveries 11  5  Revisions of prior estimates 15,813 123 33,833 353 Production - sales volumes (24,075 ) (267 ) (12,455 ) (141 ) Balance, December 31, 2010 314,994 2,861 138,436 1,336 Extensions, additions and discoveries 175 12 70 5 Revisions of prior estimates (3,567 ) 115 (1,583 ) 76 Production - sales volumes (21,693 ) (249 ) (10,661 ) (130 ) Balance, December 31, 2011 289,909 2,739 126,262 1,287 Extensions, additions and discoveries in 2009, 2010 and 2011 are primarily related to delineation of additional proved undeveloped reserves in the Anadarko Basin. Revisions of prior estimates of the proved gas reserves for the underlying properties in each year are primarily because of changes in the gas and oil prices. Negative revisions of 2011 gas reserves related primarily to increased future costs. Higher upward and downward revisions for the net profits interests as compared with the underlying properties in each year were caused by changes in oil and gas prices and estimated future production and development costs which resulted in an increase or decrease in gas reserves allocated to the trust.

We also have audited the Trusts internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Trustee is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Trustees Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Trusts internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the trustee, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. As described in Note 2, these financial statements were prepared on the modified cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. A trusts internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A trusts internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the trust; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the trust are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the trustee; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the trusts assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities and trust corpus of the Trust at December 31, 2011, and the distributable income and changes in trust corpus for the year then ended, on the basis of accounting described in Note 2. Also in our opinion, the Trust maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by COSO. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Dallas, Texas February 29, 2012 39 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Bank of America, N.A., as Trustee for the Hugoton Royalty Trust: We have audited the accompanying statement of assets, liabilities, and trust corpus of the Hugoton Royalty Trust as of December 31, 2010 and related statements of distributable income and changes in trust corpus for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2010.

The trustee conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the trusts internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
