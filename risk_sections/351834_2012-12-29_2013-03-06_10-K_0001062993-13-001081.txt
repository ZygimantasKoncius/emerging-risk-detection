Risk Factors, included elsewhere in this report. SUNOPTA INC. 3 December 29, 2012 10-K PART I Item 1. Business INTRODUCTION SunOpta, a corporation organized under the laws of Canada in 1973, is a leading global company operating businesses focused on a healthy products portfolio that promotes sustainable well-being. With expertise in field to table integration, we specialize in the sourcing, processing and packaging of natural, organic and specialty food products. As a general principle, we do not own or operate our own farms, retail stores, or extensively market our own consumer brands. Our core natural and organic food operations focus on value-added grains, fiber and fruit-based product offerings, supported by a global sourcing and supply infrastructure. Our assets, operations and employees are principally located in North America and Europe. We have two non-core holdings: a 66.1% ownership position in Opta Minerals Inc. and its subsidiaries (Opta Minerals), a producer, distributor and recycler of industrial materials; and an 18.7% ownership position in Mascoma Corporation (Mascoma), an innovative biofuels company. Business Objectives, Goals and Strategies Our vision is to be the recognized global leader in natural and organic food products that drive sustainable well-being. The objective of our business strategy is to maximize stakeholder value through: Strategically supplying healthy food to retailers, food service and food manufacturers. Leveraging our global, integrated field to table supply chain capabilities. Fostering passionate talented employees. To reach our objective, we have established the following financial goals: 8% operating income as a percentage of revenues in three years. 10% EBITDA as a percentage of revenues in three years. 15% return on net assets in three years. In order to deliver on these goals we have developed the following core strategies: Become a pure play natural and organic foods company. This includes evaluating our existing product portfolio, integrating strategically-aligned acquisitions, and divesting non-core assets to focus on key market categories and geographies. Aggressively grow our value-added packaged foods and ingredients portfolios. This includes enhancing innovation through shared research and development capabilities, and the addition of new sourcing and processing capabilities to achieve higher gross margins from the introduction of new products, packaging and processes to the market. Leverage the integrated platform we have built. This includes optimizing our supply chain capabilities, available production capacity, and consolidated back office functions to achieve synergies and cost improvements. These strategies form the framework within which key initiatives and near-term action plans are developed, helping to create focus and a high degree of accountability for our businesses and employees. SUNOPTA INC. 4 December 29, 2012 10-K Segment Information We divide our operations into the following industry segments: SunOpta Foods, which accounted for approximately 88% of our fiscal 2012 consolidated revenues; and Opta Minerals, which represented approximately 12% of our fiscal 2012 consolidated revenues. SunOpta Foods operates in the natural, organic and specialty foods product sectors and utilizes a number of integrated business models to bring cost-effective and quality products to market. We believe these markets will continue to grow as consumers focus on health and wellness. In February 2012, we undertook a process to streamline the operations and organizational structure of SunOpta Foods in order to drive efficiencies and better align product innovation and commercial activities. During the first quarter of 2012, the operating segments within SunOpta Foods were re-aligned according to the type of customers and markets served, rather than by product groupings. As a result, the former Fruit Group was eliminated and a new Consumer Products Group was created to focus on non-grains based consumer packaged goods. The Consumer Products Group is comprised of the Frozen Foods and Healthy Snacks operations which were part of the former Fruit Group, and the Food Solutions operations which were formerly part of the International Foods Group. The Fruit Ingredient operation of the former Fruit Group was merged with the existing Ingredients Group. Following this realignment and the divestiture of Purity Life Natural Health Products (Purity) (as described below under Business Development), the International Foods Group comprises solely our international sourcing and supply operations (Tradin Organic). The Grains and Foods Group remained unchanged. SunOpta Foods is currently comprised of the following four operating segments: Grains and Foods Group; Ingredients Group; Consumer Products Group; and International Foods Group. We intend, however, to continue to realign our operations with a focus on three key go-to-market segments: raw materials; value-added ingredients; and consumer-packaged products. Over time we expect our operating segments will be realigned accordingly. Opta Minerals is a vertically integrated provider of custom process optimization solutions and supplier of industrial minerals and silica-free abrasives for use primarily in the steel, foundry, loose abrasive cleaning and municipal water filtration industries. Financial information for each segment describing revenues from external customers, a measure of profit or loss, and total assets for the last three fiscal years, as well as financial information about geographic areas for the last three fiscal years, is set forth in note 21 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Business Development Our strategy is to focus on our core natural and organic value-added foods business. In this regard, we have completed a number of selective acquisitions in early fiscal 2013 and over the preceding three fiscal years, as follows: On December 31, 2012, we acquired a grains handling and processing facility operated as the Organic Land Corporation OOD (OLC) and located in Silistra, Bulgaria. The purchase price was €3,200, plus an earn-out based on pre-determined earnings targets over a three-year period. We have been sourcing non-genetically modified (non-GMO) sunflower kernel from OLC since late 2011. The facility is located near a protected and chemical free agricultural area, which produces organic products including sunflower, flax seed, corn, barley, and soybeans. This acquisition diversifies our non-GMO and organic sunflower processing operations and should allow us to expand our capabilities into other organic products grown in the region. The Bulgarian processing operation is included in the International Foods Group. SUNOPTA INC. 5 December 29, 2012 10-K In August 2011, we completed the acquisition of the assets and business of Lortons Fresh Squeezed Juices, Inc. (Lortons) for cash consideration of $2,500, plus an earn-out based on pre-determined earnings targets over a three-year period. Lortons is an integrated producer of a variety of citrus based products in both industrial and packaged formats. This acquisition expanded our integrated operations into the extracting, processing and packaging of citrus-based ingredients through consumer packaged products, and provided increased capacity for future growth and expansion. Lortons operations are included in the Consumer Products Group. In December 2010, we completed the acquisition of the assets and business of Edner of Nevada, Inc. (Edner) for cash consideration of $4,000, plus an earn-out based on pre-determined revenue targets over a five-year period. Edner produces a wide variety of nutritious portable foods such as nutrition bars and grains-based snack bars serving the fast growing wholesome and convenient healthy snacks category from its 104,000 square foot facility, located in Carson City, Nevada. Edners operations are included in the Consumer Products Group. In November 2010, we completed the acquisition of Dahlgren & Company Inc. (Dahlgren) for cash consideration of $46,303, plus an earn-out based on pre-determined earnings targets over a two-year period. Dahlgren is an integrated processor and global supplier of confection sunflower seed products including in-shell and kernel products, roasted sunflower and soy nuts, bird food, hybrid seed and other products. Dahlgren serves customers in the U.S. and Canada, as well as Europe, Asia, Australia and South America. Dahlgrens operations are included in the Grains and Foods Group. In addition, we have invested in a number of internal growth projects to diversify our sources of supply, as well as to add capacity, improve profitability, and expand our value-added processing capabilities at a number of our facilities, as follows: The International Foods Group is constructing a cocoa processing facility in Middenmeer, the Netherlands, which will specialize in the processing of organic and fair trade certified cocoa beans into derivatives, such as organic cocoa powder, butter, and liquor. All cocoa beans processed at this facility are expected to be sourced internally through Tradin Organic. The facility will provide needed capacity to accommodate our organic and specialty cocoa business that is currently processed by third parties. We expect the facility will be operational in the third quarter of 2013. Once fully commissioned, it will employ approximately 30 personnel and have an annual processing capacity of approximately 9,000 metric tons of raw cocoa. In November 2012, the Grains and Food Group completed an expansion of our aseptic non-dairy beverage processing and packaging capabilities at its Modesto, California plant, which increased our overall aseptic non-dairy beverage and broth capacity by approximately 10% to between 250 and 300 million quarts, depending on product mix. The expansion was necessary to meet growing demand for natural and organic beverages such as soy, rice, almond and sunflower. In 2010, the Grains and Foods Group also completed an upgrade and retrofit of the Alexandria, Minnesota processing and packaging facility. In September 2012, the Consumer Products Group completed the commissioning of two flexible re-sealable pouch filling lines at a new facility located in Allentown, Pennsylvania. As the first two lines are expected to reach capacity through committed long-term contracts, we have initiated expansion plans to install an additional two pouch filling lines at the Allentown facility, which we expect to be operational in the third quarter of 2013. We entered the flexible, re-sealable pouch business in late 2011 with the installation of two pouch filling lines at a third-party production facility in California. The flexible re-sealable pouch is applicable to a wide range of product categories including natural and organic fruit and vegetable snacks, apple sauces, tomato products, baby food, yogurts, toppings and beverages. Once the new east coast lines are operational, we expect to have a total filling capacity of approximately 150 million pouches. In December 2011, the Ingredients Group completed the installation of a new aseptic processing line with a processing capacity of approximately 30 million pounds at Pacific Fruit Processors, our value-added fruit ingredients operation. Applications for the new equipment include fruit bases for yogurts, smoothies, fruit toppings and food service products, in both organic and conventional formats. SUNOPTA INC. 6 December 29, 2012 10-K We have also completed the following strategic divestitures of non-core assets in order to focus on our natural and organic foods business: In June 2012, we completed the sale of Purity, our Canadian natural health products distribution business, for cash consideration of Cdn $14,000 at closing, plus an earn-out if Purity achieves certain earnings targets during the one- year period following the closing date. The divestiture of Purity completed our exit from all non-core distribution businesses. Purity was formerly part of the International Foods Group. In June 2011, we completed the sale of land and buildings in Irapuato, Mexico to parties related to Fruvemex Mexicali, S.A. de C.V. (Fruvemex). In addition, in April 2011, we sold our frozen fruit processing assets in Rosarito and Irapuato, Mexico to Fruvemex. As part of this transaction we entered into a strategic raw material supply agreement with Fruvemex. These assets were included in the former Fruit Group. Aggregate consideration related to these transactions amounted to $5,650. In May 2011, the former Fruit Group also completed the sale of frozen fruit processing equipment located in Salinas, California for cash consideration of $1,773. In August 2010, we completed the sale of SunOpta BioProcess Inc. (SunOpta BioProcess) to Mascoma Canada Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Mascoma, in exchange for a combination of preferred shares, common shares and warrants of Mascoma valued at $50,925, with a net value of $33,345 after settling the preferred share liability with former SunOpta BioProcess shareholders. The combination of the two companies brought together SunOpta BioProcess fiber preparation and pretreatment technology with Mascomas consolidated bioprocessing technology, to create a company with comprehensive capabilities for converting non-food cellulose (wood chips, energy crops and organic solid waste) into ethanol and high value co-products. SunOpta BioProcess represented the former SunOpta BioProcess operating segment, which was eliminated with this sale. In June 2010, we completed the sale of our Canadian Food Distribution assets to UNFI Canada, Inc., a wholly- owned subsidiary of United Natural Foods, Inc., (UNFI) for cash consideration of Cdn $68,000. The divestiture of the Canadian Food Distribution assets was an important step in our strategy to focus on our core food manufacturing platform. The Canadian Food Distribution assets formed part of the former Distribution Group operating segment, which was eliminated with this sale. For more information regarding acquisitions and divestitures, see Notes 2 and 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Developments Amended Credit Agreements On September 25, 2012, The Organic Corporation (TOC) and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit facilities agreement with two lenders, which provides for a €45,000 revolving credit facility covering working capital needs and a €3,000 pre-settlement facility covering currency hedging requirements. A portion of the revolving credit facility was used to repay an existing €35,000 line of credit facility of TOC. The revolving credit facility and pre-settlement facility are due on demand with no set maturity date, and the credit limit can be extended or adjusted based on the needs of the business and upon approval of the lenders. These facilities support the global sourcing, supply and processing capabilities of the International Foods Group. On July 27, 2012, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders to support our core North American food operations. The amended agreement provides secured revolving credit facilities of Cdn $10,000 and $165,000, as well as an additional $50,000 in availability upon the exercise of an uncommitted accordion feature. These facilities mature on July 27, 2016, with the outstanding principal amount repayable in full on the maturity date. These facilities replaced our previous line of credit facilities of Cdn $10,000 and $115,000, and refinanced non-revolving term facilities totaling approximately $21,000, which were due to mature on October 30, 2012. On July 24, 2012, Opta Minerals amended and restated its credit agreement to include a Cdn $15,000 revolving term credit facility and a Cdn $52,500 non-revolving term credit facility. The revolving term credit facility matures on August 14, 2013, with the outstanding principal amount repayable in full on the maturity date, and the non-revolving term credit facility matures on May 18, 2017, with the remaining outstanding principal amount repayable in full on the maturity date. These facilities are specific to the operations of Opta Minerals, are standalone and separate from facilities used to finance our core food operations, and carry no cross default or other provisions. SUNOPTA INC. 7 December 29, 2012 10-K Corporate Social Responsibility Report In January 2013, we released our second annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report, which provides a progress update on previously established sustainability goals covering social, environmental and economic objectives, and details key priorities for the future. The report covers all of our operations, excluding Opta Minerals, and is available on our website. The Corporate Social Responsibility Report and the other information included on our website is not included in, or incorporated by reference into, this Form 10-K. Senior Management Appointments Effective August 1, 2012, Hendrik (Rik) Jacobs was appointed to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer, with operational responsibility for SunOpta Foods. Mr. Jacobs brings over 20 years of international sales, marketing, innovation, strategic development and general management experience to this role. Former Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Tony Tavares left the Company effective July 27, 2012. SUNOPTA FOODS Introduction SunOpta Foods has been built through business acquisitions and significant internal growth. It operates in the natural, organic and specialty foods sectors and utilizes a number of integrated business models to bring cost effective and quality products to market. Below is a summary listing of acquisitions and significant facilities that we have acquired since the inception of SunOpta Foods. This summary does not include any acquisitions that were subsequently divested. Date of Acquisition Business Operations Acquired August 3, 1999 Sunrich Inc.

(Grains and Foods Group) December 14, 2010 Assets of Edner of Nevada, Inc. (Consumer Products Group) August 5, 2011 Assets of Lortons Fresh Squeezed Juices, Inc. (Consumer Products Group) December 31, 2012 Organic Land Corporation OOD (International Foods Group) SunOpta Foods long-term strategy is to leverage the platform that has been developed via implementation of continuous improvement principles, new product development and a focus on value-added components of the business, and to continue to pursue selective acquisitions that align with the value-added components of our integrated business models. We believe that the natural, organic and specialty foods markets offer solid long-term growth opportunities as consumers focus on health and wellness and see diet as a key part of a healthy lifestyle. We also believe these markets remain fragmented with numerous players in North America and internationally. SUNOPTA INC. 8 December 29, 2012 10-K Specific strategies of SunOpta Foods in the last several years have included the following: Diversify the range of organic and non-GMO grains, fiber and fruit-based products that we market, including via the acquisition of businesses that are integrated from sourcing through ingredients and packaged products. Develop value-added natural and organic fiber and food ingredient solutions to meet the demands of food manufacturers wanting to improve the healthfulness of their products or expand into the natural and organic markets. Invest in value-added processing capabilities which add further value to sourced raw materials. Expand our ability to source and supply natural and organic food products worldwide. Invest in healthy convenience and nutritious portable foods via both internal growth opportunities and acquisitions, driven by our belief that this segment will continue to be a strong area of growth for natural and organic food products. Expand the number of customer private label natural and organic programs including soy and alternative beverages, frozen fruit, fruit beverages, re-sealable pouch and healthy convenience food categories. Develop and expand our operations outside of North America via acquisitions or by entering into partnerships and strategic alliances with food producers internationally. Grains and Foods Group Operations and Product offeringsGrains and Foods Group The Grains and Foods Group specializes in marketing organic, identity preserved (IP), and non-GMO grains, ingredients, packaged goods and processing services with a core focus on soybean, sunflower and corn products. The Grains and Foods Group works to ensure that it provides its customers with high quality organic, non-GMO and IP specialty grains and seeds by serving as a growers supplier of seed; purchaser of the growers specialty crops; and processor and packager of a wide range of grains-based ingredients and consumer-packaged products. We believe this field to table approach allows the Grains and Foods Group to meet the specific needs of domestic and foreign food manufacturers and processors, by providing products in the varieties and quantities needed in a timely and cost effective manner. The Grains and Foods Groups products include: 1. A wide variety of IP, non-GMO and organic seeds and whole grains including soy, corn and sunflower for food applications offering premium varieties with superior food quality. The Grains and Foods Groups integrated model results in control at every stage of production, from seed selection and growing through storage, processing and transportation. 2. Organic, non-GMO and IP grain-based ingredients, including: Raw material sourcing and processing of soy based ingredients in liquid, spray-dried and roasted formats. Grain-based ingredients which utilize non-GMO and organic soy, corn, sunflower and rice; specialty organic functional ingredients, including maltodextrins, tack blends, fiber products; flavor enhancing products, including snack coatings, cheese powders and flavor systems; an innovative line of organic dairy ingredients; and organic soy and sunflower oils. SUNOPTA INC. 9 December 29, 2012 10-K 3. A variety of packaged food products for retail and foodservice use, including: A wide variety of private label packaged products for retailers and consumer foods companies, including aseptic and refrigerated soy, rice, almond, sunflower and other alternate beverages; aseptic broths and teas; frozen edamame and vegetable blends; and roasted grains-based snacks. Branded food products under the Sunrich Naturals brand, including: Alternative beverages  a variety of soy, rice, almond and sunflower based beverages for retail and foodservice. Frozen vegetables  a variety of frozen edamame and vegetable blends for health food stores, foodservice operators and retail outlets. Roasted grains-based snacks  specializing in providing healthy, non-GMO and organic snacks to schools, retailers and healthcare facilities throughout North America. Products include in-shell sunflower and sunflower kernels, and roasted corn and soy snacks. 4. A full range of bulk grain-based animal feed and pet food products. The premium feed products originate from select organic and non-GMO soy, corn, sunflower and other grains. The Grains and Foods Group also engages in processing and contract manufacturing services and offers a comprehensive range of services including basic grain cleaning, ingredient processing, custom roasting, and retail-ready packaging. With processing facilities throughout the U.S., plus a number of storage and office facilities, it can handle a range of order sizes, including barge lots, rail cars, bags, pallets, and retail packages. The Grains and Foods Group services include: Grain conditioning services for soy, corn and sunflower. The Grains and Foods Groups advanced equipment and technology for scalping and foreign matter removal is engineered to meet U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Grain Standards for premium food grade seed and grain conditioning. Grain milling for corn, oat and grain processing, with various granulations and batch sizing. Ingredient processing expertise and equipment needed for extraction, separation and concentration of a wide variety of grains-based and dairy ingredients. Liquid packaging through its aseptic packaging facilities, specializing in Tetra Pak equipment in a variety of pack sizes and extended shelf life options. The Grains and Foods Group also partners with third-party fillers to provide extended shelf life refrigerated packaging formats to its customers. Grains roasting and packaging through extensive facilities offering a wide range of consumer and bulk packaging. CompetitionGrains and Foods Group The Grains and Foods Group competes with large grain suppliers for customers and competes with other companies active on the international commercial grain procurement market for supply. The Grains and Foods Groups non-GMO and organic specialty grains compete in the smaller niche U.S. commercial non-GMO and organic grains market. Key to competing in these markets is access to transportation, supply and relationships with producers. The Grains and Foods Groups aseptic and roasted packaged products facilities compete with a number of other regional manufacturers, and its ingredient offerings compete with a range of suppliers from small local companies through large multi-nationals. Distribution, Marketing, and SalesGrains and Foods Group The Grains and Foods Group has well established sales and marketing capabilities. As a leading provider of non-GMO and organic soy, corn, sunflower and grain-based food ingredients, it offers a comprehensive range of ingredients and services to the food industry. Distribution channels can vary greatly by product category, but the Grains and Foods Group enjoys a diverse to market strategy in each product category. Its organic, non-GMO and IP ingredients are sold to food manufacturers worldwide. For specialty whole grain raw materials, approximately 50% of the customer base is international. SUNOPTA INC. 10 December 29, 2012 10-K Food ingredients are sold principally to customers in North America that range from major multi-nationals to smaller specialty food marketers, but are expanding geographically as the Grains and Foods Group opens new international markets. The consumer goods distribution channels include private label and store brands, food service and also SunOpta-controlled brands. This wide array of sales and distribution avenues is intended to allow the Grains and Foods Group to maximize sales and margin while mitigating the risk of concentrating business in a single segment of the market. SuppliersGrains and Foods Group The Grains and Foods Group has an extensive established IP, organic soy and corn grower network with approximately 2,500 producers, with many relationships existing for over 25 years, and relationships with approximately 1,000 sunflower farmers in the Midwest and southern U.S. The Grains and Foods Group also has a network of growers in South America, Africa and Asia. Because weather conditions and other factors can limit the availability of certain grains in North America, the Grains and Foods Group continues to focus on expanding production and sourcing capabilities to other parts of the world in hand with the International Foods Group to ensure supply in years when local production is below normal levels. By diversifying supply, it also has the ability to divert available product based on market demand and customer requirements in order to maximize return. Ingredients Group Operations and Product OfferingsIngredients Group The Ingredients Group is focused primarily on fiber products and specialty fruit ingredients. It works closely with its customers to identify product formulation, cost and productivity opportunities aimed at transforming raw materials into value-added food ingredient solutions. The Ingredients Groups products include: 1. Fibers and brans, including Canadian Harvest® Oat Fiber, SunOpta® Soy Fiber, SunOpta® Rice Fiber, SunOpta® Cellulose Fiber and SunOpta® Pea Fiber brands of insoluble organic and conventional fiber products, Barley Balance soluble fiber, MultiFiber blends, value-added starch-based texturizers, and a number of custom processed ingredients. The Ingredients Groups family of insoluble fiber products are derived from oat, soy, pea and rice hulls. In addition, the Ingredients Group provides two gluten-free cellulose fibers, which are highly concentrated sources of insoluble dietary fiber. These products are used commercially to increase the fiber content of cereals, breads, cookies and crackers; to increase yield and enhance texture in ground and processed meat products; and to add strength and reduce breakage in baked products. The Ingredients Group also provides highly functional fiber blends for specific applications under the MultiFiber brand name and offers Canadian Harvest® Stabilized Brans derived from oat, wheat and corn, as well as wheat germ. The stabilized brans are heat-treated to extend shelf life and ground to meet customer needs for appropriate particle size. 2. SunOpta® Specialty Starch products, including OptaGrade® and OptaMist®. OptaGrade is a natural, starch-based texturizing agent that is used commercially in a variety of dairy products including natural, imitation, and processed cheeses, sour cream, cream cheese, cottage cheese and yogurt. OptaMist is also a starch-based texturizing agent that improves the taste, texture and appearance of dairy products, yogurt, cheese products, and salad dressings. 3. Value-added fruit-based ingredients in aseptic and conventional formats, which are custom formulated to provide unique flavor and texture profiles for a wide range of specialized applications. Applications include fruit for yogurts, ice creams, cheeses, smoothies, shakes, frozen desserts, bakery fillings, health bars, various beverages, dressings, marinades, dips and sauces. 4. Custom ingredients and contract manufacturing services. The Ingredients Group produces a number of unique functional food ingredients, and offer services to customers on a contract basis utilizing proprietary technologies. We believe the Ingredients Group is well positioned to capitalize on the rapid growth of the health conscious natural and organic food markets, with its wide range of fiber, brans, starch and fruit-based products. The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends choosing foods that provide dietary fiber and increasing the intake of whole fruit, as consumption of both fiber and fruit is below recommended levels in the U.S. The Ingredients Groups portfolio of insoluble fibers, stabilized brans and fiber blends are used in numerous products such as fiber-enriched breads and other baked goods, breakfast cereals and snack bars. These products can be used to increase total dietary fiber content of foods, including dairy and meat products, while minimizing negative effects on taste, texture and appearance. Stabilized oat brans can be used as a source of soluble fiber, which is beneficial to cardiovascular health. Through the use of natural and organic ingredients, including strawberries, blueberries, peaches, and other fruits, the Ingredients Groups fruit-based applications are formulated to improve the nutritional content of its customers products. In addition to helping food manufacturers improve the healthfulness of their food products, the Ingredients Groups ingredient offerings can be used to improve the overall quality of food products, reduce formulation costs, and meet specific processing requirements. We believe that all of our ingredient products are Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) under current U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations (see Regulation  SunOpta Foods, below). SUNOPTA INC. 11 December 29, 2012 10-K CompetitionIngredients Group Food ingredients are considered unique niche items usually developed or processed for specific customers or industry segments. The Ingredients Group competes with other product developers and specialty processors for the specialty ingredient business. Competitors include major companies with food ingredient divisions, other food ingredient and sourcing companies, other insoluble and soluble fiber processors, and consumer food companies that also engage in the development and sale of food ingredients. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources, as well as production and marketing capabilities that are greater than our own. Distribution, Marketing, and SalesIngredients Group The Ingredients Group utilizes a technically-oriented customer account team. It works closely with customers to identify product formulation, cost and productivity opportunities, and develops solutions for customers based on proprietary, value-added, highly functional food ingredients that use the Ingredients Groups technical knowledge and manufacturing base. The Ingredients Group takes a multidisciplinary approach to achieve this level of customer understanding and service. Members of the Ingredients Groups direct sales force are teamed up with the appropriate technical personnel to work as consultants in defining and developing a range of potential solutions to its customers formulation and product development needs. Our food ingredients are used by approximately 300 customers worldwide, including some of the largest U.S. consumer-packaged food companies. The Ingredients Groups product offerings are sold through distributors around the world, including the International Foods Group. Based on our internal estimates, the Ingredients Group is the worlds largest supplier of oat fiber to the food industry, one of the largest producers of soy fiber in the U.S., and the largest producer of organic soy fiber in the U.S. SuppliersIngredients Group The availability of the Ingredients Groups raw materials is subject to world market conditions; however, there are a number of alternative sources of supply for most raw materials. Oat and soy hulls are primarily sourced from major food companies or their brokers and we believe there is adequate supply to meet current production requirements. Supply shortfalls would have an effect on availability and price and would be reflected in finished product pricing. Certain other raw materials are supplied by processing customers and are not sourced directly from suppliers within SunOpta Foods. Fruit ingredient raw materials are sourced from processors and traders of frozen fruits, including the International Foods Group and our own fruit processing operations, major sweetener producers, and a number of regional and national flavor companies. Availability of supplies is subject to world market conditions, including quantity and quality of supply. Consumer Products Group Operations and Product OfferingsConsumer Products Group The Consumer Products Group provides natural and organic consumer packaged food products to major global food manufacturers, distributors and supermarket chains with a variety of branded and private label products. The Consumer Products Groups products include: 1. Conventional and organic beverage processing and re-sealable pouch filling solutions in a variety of product categories, including shelf stable and refrigerated juices, frozen fruits and vegetables, specialty beverages, vitamin waters, electrolyte waters, energy drinks, soups, baby food, and healthy fruit and vegetable based snacks in flexible pouches. SUNOPTA INC. 12 December 29, 2012 10-K 2. Nutritious healthy snacks including natural and organic fruit-based snacks in bar, twist, rope and bite size shapes, with the ability to add a variety of ingredients including fiber, plus a range of baked and extruded nutrition bars using a wide variety of ingredients including grains, proteins and other ingredients. 3. Individually Quick Frozen natural and organic frozen fruits and vegetables, including strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, peppers and many other items. CompetitionConsumer Products Group The Consumer Products Group faces competition when securing fruit, vegetable and grain raw materials; however, due to the location of its processing facilities, it is able to source these raw materials from a number of growing regions and suppliers. In particular, it sources frozen fruits and vegetables from a number of domestic and worldwide growers, processors and traders, including the International Foods Group. The Consumer Products Groups beverage and pouch products compete in the private label retail market with the offerings of major food manufacturing companies. Its healthy snack products have a large number of competitors, which include independent fruit snack manufacturers, fruit snack divisions of larger food manufacturers, and nutrition bar manufacturers. Its frozen fruit and vegetable products compete with processors primarily in California and Mexico, and frozen fruit imports from Mexico, South America, Europe and Asia. In many cases, Mexican, South American, European and Asian competitors are able to achieve greater cost efficiencies due to lower relative costs of living and costs of supply in these regions. Distribution, Marketing and SalesConsumer Products Group The Consumer Products Group supplies frozen fruit and vegetable products to the private label retail market, including large retailers and club stores, food manufacturers, food service distributors, quick service and casual dining restaurants located principally in North America. In addition, it supplies healthy fruit snacks and nutrition bars to branded food companies and the private label retail market. We estimate that the Consumer Products Group is the largest supplier of natural and organic private label fruit snacks in the U.S. SuppliersConsumer Products Group The Consumer Products Groups raw materials are subject to the availability of fruit, vegetable and grain supply, which is based on conditions that are beyond our control. Frozen fruits, berries, and vegetables are sourced directly from a large number of suppliers throughout the U.S., Mexico and globally, or indirectly through the International Foods Group. Raw material suppliers for healthy snacks products include growers and traders of apples and apple concentrates, flavor companies, processors and traders of fruit and grain products, including the International Foods Group. International Foods Group Operations and Product OfferingsInternational Foods Group The International Foods Group includes European and North American based operations that source and supply raw material ingredients and trade organic commodities. Its principal operations are located in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and Santa Cruz, California and comprise the global sourcing and supply operations of Tradin Organic, including a business in Dalian, China that supplies food grade organic soybeans, feed, organic sunflower kernels and other grains and distributes certain organic food products, as well as sourcing and processing operations in Ethiopia for organic and specialty coffees and organic and conventional sesame seeds. In addition, the International Foods Group is expanding its integrated processing capabilities with the construction of its value-added organic and specialty cocoa facility in the Netherlands. The International Foods Group sources raw material ingredients from approximately 60 countries around the world, and, in our estimation, is one of the largest suppliers of a wide range of organic commodities to the food industry in the European, North American and Asian markets. It sources organic fruit and vegetable based ingredients, sweeteners, cocoa, coffee, grains, nuts, seeds and pulses and other organic food products from virtually every continent to ensure quality of supply, minimize crop risk and provide contra-seasonal solutions to our customers. In many cases, the International Foods Group will enter into exclusive arrangements with growers and/or processors of key strategic commodities to control the reliability of its supply chain. SUNOPTA INC. 13 December 29, 2012 10-K CompetitionInternational Foods Group The organic food industry is very competitive due primarily to the limited worldwide supply of organic raw materials. The International Foods Groups competitors in the supply of industrial organic ingredients include domestic and worldwide brokers, traders and food processors. Distribution, Marketing and SalesInternational Foods Group Sales and marketing is conducted through technically oriented sales teams strategically located close to specific geographic sourcing and/or sales regions. The International Foods Group maintains one of the largest global sourcing and supply networks in the world, working closely to develop and manage global organic supply and link these supplies with diverse customer needs, and it also provides procurement support for other SunOpta operations. SuppliersInternational Foods Group The International Foods Groups raw material suppliers include growers, processors and traders of non-GMO and organic fruit and vegetable based ingredients, sweeteners and other food products. Raw materials are sourced from growing regions worldwide. Organic food suppliers are required to meet stringent organic certification requirements equivalent to the USDA National Organic Program, European Union (EU) standards, or others. RegulationSunOpta Foods SunOpta Foods is subject to a wide range of governmental regulations and policies in various countries and regions where we operate, including the U.S., Canada, the Netherlands, throughout the rest of the EU, China and Ethiopia. These laws, regulations and policies are implemented, as applicable in each jurisdiction, on the national, federal, state, provincial and local levels. For example, SunOpta Foods is affected by laws and regulations related to: seed, fertilizer and pesticides; the purchasing, harvesting, transportation and warehousing of grain and other products; the processing, packaging and sale of food, including wholesale operations; and product labelling and marketing, food safety and food defense. SunOpta Foods is also affected by government-sponsored price supports, acreage set aside programs and a number of environmental regulations. U.S. Regulations SunOpta Foods is required to comply with the regulations and policies promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and corresponding state agencies, as well as the USDA, the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyard Administration, the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission. USDA National Organic Program and Similar Regulations SunOpta Foods is involved in the sourcing, manufacturing, supplying, processing, marketing, selling and distribution of organic seed and food products and, as such, is subject to certain organic quality assurance standards. In 1990, Congress passed the Organic Foods Production Act mandating that the USDA develop national standards for organically produced agricultural products to assure consumers that those products marketed as organic meet consistent, uniform standards. The Organic Foods Production Act established the National Organic Program, a marketing program housed within the Agricultural Marketing Service of the USDA. In December 2000, after considering recommendations from the National Organic Standards Board, as well as private, state, and foreign organic certification programs, USDA adopted regulations with respect to a national organic production, handling, labeling and certification program contained within 7 CFR 205. The regulations became fully effective in October 2002. These regulations, among other things, set forth the minimum standards producers must meet, and have reviewed by an accredited USDA-certifying agent, in order to label their products 100% organic, organic, or made with organic ingredients and display the USDA organic seal. The regulations impose strict standards on the production of organic food products and limit the use of non-organic or synthetic materials in the production of organic foods. Generally, organic food products are produced using: agricultural management practices intended to promote and enhance ecosystem health; no genetically engineered seeds or crops, sewage sludge, long-lasting pesticides, herbicides or fungicides; and food processing practices intended to protect the integrity of the organic product and disallow irradiation, genetically modified organisms or synthetic preservatives. SUNOPTA INC. 14 December 29, 2012 10-K After becoming certified, organic operations must retain records concerning the production, harvesting, and handling of agricultural products that are to be sold as organic for a period of five years. Any organic operation found to be in violation of the USDA organic regulations is subject to enforcement actions, which can include financial penalties or suspension or revocation of their organic certificate. Additionally, our organic products may be subject to various state regulations. Many states have adopted their own organic programs making the state agency responsible for enforcing USDA regulations for organic operations. However, state organic programs may also add more restrictive requirements due to specific environmental conditions or the necessity of production and handling practices in the state. Applicable regulatory agencies in the U.S. include the USDA, which monitors and ensures the integrity of both the organic process and agricultural grain business, and the FDA and Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversee the safety, security and efficacy of the food supply in the U.S. We currently manufacture and distribute a number of organic products that are subject to the standards set forth in the Organic Foods Production Act and the regulations adopted thereunder by the National Organic Standards Board. We believe that we are in material compliance with the organic regulations applicable to our business. Food-Related Regulations As a manufacturer and distributor of food products, SunOpta Foods is also subject to a number of federal, state and local food-related regulations, including, but not limited to, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (the FDCA) and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. This comprehensive regulatory framework governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging and safety of food in the U.S. The FDA: regulates manufacturing practices for foods through its current good manufacturing practices regulations; specifies the standards of identity for certain foods, including many of the products we sell; and prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on food product labels. Some of the key food safety and food labeling regulations in the U.S. include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. Food Safety Regulations In 2011, the Food Safety Modernization Act (the FSMA) became effective, significantly expanding the authority of the FDA and imposing new regulation of food production, sales and imports. The goal of FSMA is to shift the focus of the current food safety scheme away from one that is reactive to one that is preventative. Although there remains uncertainty concerning how FSMA will be implemented in light of budgetary concerns, the FDA has taken initial steps to assert its new authority. For instance, the FDA has begun using its authority to administratively detain food products that it has reason to believe are adulterated or misbranded for up to 30 days. In addition, the agency has issued interim final rules on criteria for administrative detention and on prior notice of imported food. Most recently in January 2013, the FDA released for public comment proposed rules on Preventive Controls for Human Food and Standards for Produce Safety. The FDA expects to issue its proposed rule on importer foreign supplier verification in the near term. Future proposed rules will address preventive controls for animal food, and accreditation of third-party auditors. The proposed rules on preventive controls relating to human food for human consumption would apply to SunOpta Foods as we manufacture, process, pack and hold food for human consumption. The rule proposes a requirement that firms have written plans in place to identify potential hazards, put in place steps to address them, verify that the steps are working, and outline how to correct any problems that arise. The rule also proposes a requirement that each covered facility prepare and implement a written food safety plan, which would include the following: hazard analysis; risk based preventive controls; monitoring procedures; corrective actions; verification; and recordkeeping. In addition, we are subject to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (the Bioterrorism Act) and regulations issued thereunder. The Bioterrorism Act authorizes the FDA to take the regulatory action necessary to protect the nations food supply against the threat of intentional or accidental contamination. The major components of the Bioterrorism Act include registration of food facilities with the FDA; prior notice of virtually all imported food shipments under FDA authority; recordkeeping requirements for food facilities; FDA authority to administratively detain food; FDA authority to institute debarment of food importers for various violations related to food importation; and creation of a clear way to re-import previously refused foods if certain criteria are met. SUNOPTA INC. 15 December 29, 2012 10-K Lastly, we are subject to numerous other federal, state and local regulations involving such matters as the licensing and registration of manufacturing facilities, enforcement by government health agencies of standards for our products, inspection of our facilities and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of food products. 2. Food Labeling Regulations SunOpta Foods is subject to certain requirements relating to food labeling under the FDCA and corresponding FDA regulations as well as the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act enacted in 1967 and corresponding FTC regulations. Although the FTC, FDA, and USDA share jurisdiction over claims made by manufacturers of food products, the FDA retains primary jurisdiction over the labeling of food products whereas the FTC regulates advertising. The FDA and FTC require that all food products be labeled to disclose the net contents, the identity of commodity, nutrition information, and the name and place of business of the products manufacturer, packer, or distributor in order to prevent consumer deception. Both agencies also require that any claim on the product be truthful and not misleading. Other state and local statutes and regulations may impose additional food labeling requirements. For instance, the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (commonly referred to as Proposition 65) requires, with a few exceptions, that a specific warning appear on any consumer product sold in California that contains a substance, above certain levels, listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. This law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products. FDA GRAS Regulations Food ingredients can be classified into four groups including: food additives; color additives; prior sanctioned substances, and GRAS substances. In particular, a food additive is a substance, the intended use of which results or may reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, either in their becoming a component of food or otherwise affecting the characteristics of food. Food additives require premarket approval under the 1958 Food Additive Amendments to the FDCA as administered by FDA. However, in enacting those amendments, Congress recognized that many substances intentionally used in a manner whereby they are added to food would not require a formal premarket review by FDA to assure their safety, either because their safety had been established by a long history of use in food or by virtue of the nature of the substances, their customary or projected conditions of use, and the information generally available to scientists about the substances. Congress thus excluded from the definition of food additive substances that are generally recognized, among qualified experts, as having been adequately shown through scientific procedures to be safe under the conditions of their intended use, or GRAS. Companies may establish GRAS status through self-affirmation whereby the producer determines on its own that the ingredient is GRAS, normally with the assistance of a panel of qualified experts. The producer may also voluntarily submit a GRAS Notification to the FDA that includes the products description, conditions of use, and the basis for GRAS determination, among other information. The FDA response to a GRAS notice, typically issued within 180 days, is not an approval and the product may be marketed while the FDA is reviewing the information. A food ingredient is eligible for GRAS classification based on the views of experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of the product. The experts views are either based on scientific procedures or through experience based on common use of the material prior to 1958. If based on scientific procedures they must use the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence as would be required for the FDA to issue a premarket approval of the sale of a food additive. If a food ingredient is not entitled to GRAS status, premarket approval must be sought through the filing of a Food Additive Petition. Many of SunOpta Foods products are being marketed pursuant to GRAS self-affirmation. We believe that a majority of products for which we have retained commercial rights are GRAS. However, such status cannot be determined until actual formulations and uses are finalized. Thereafter, we decide whether self-affirmation procedures and a GRAS notification will be appropriate. For those components that do not qualify for GRAS, we may be required to file a Food Additive Petition. In the event that a petition is required, we may elect to sell or license its rights to manufacture, market, and distribute the component to another party. SUNOPTA INC. 16 December 29, 2012 10-K Environmental Regulations SunOpta Foods is also subject to various U.S. federal, state and local environmental regulations. Some of the key environmental regulations in the U.S. include, but are not limited to, the following. Air quality regulations  air quality is regulated by the EPA and certain city/state air pollution control groups. Emission reports are filed annually. Waste treatment/disposal regulations  solid waste is either disposed of by a third-party or, in some cases, we have a permit to haul and apply the sludge to land. Agreements exist with local city sewer districts to treat waste at specified levels of Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and other constituents. This can require weekly/monthly reporting as well as annual inspection. Sewer regulations  we have agreements with the local city sewer districts to treat waste at specified limits of BOD and TSS. This requires weekly/monthly reporting as well as annual inspection. Hazardous chemicals regulations  Various reports are filed with local city/state emergency response agencies to identify potential hazardous chemicals being used in our facilities, including reports filed with the Department of Public Safety Emergency Response Commission in Minnesota and the Kentucky Emergency Response Commission. Storm water  all facilities are inspected annually and must comply with an approved storm water plan to protect water supplies. Employee Safety Regulations We are subject to certain safety regulations, including OSHA regulations. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. We believe that we are in material compliance with all employee safety regulations applicable to our business. Canadian and Other Non-U.S. Regulations Outside of the U.S., regulations concerning the sale or characterization of food ingredients vary substantially from country to country, and we take appropriate steps to comply with such regulations. In Canada, the sale of food is regulated under various federal and provincial laws, principally the federal Food and Drugs Act (FADA), Canada Agricultural Products Act (CAPA), and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA), along with their supporting regulations. Some of the key Canadian regulatory instruments include but are not limited to the following: Food and Drug Regulations (under the FADA)  food and drugs are subject to specific regulatory requirements, including composition (such as food additives, fortification, and food standards), packaging, labelling, advertising and marketing, and licensing requirements. Organic Products Regulations, 2009 (OPR) (under the CAPA)  as of June 30, 2009, the OPR require mandatory certification to the revised national organic standard for agricultural products that are to be represented as organic in international and inter-provincial trade, or that bear the federal organic agricultural product legend (or federal logo). Except for certain exceptions and conditions, a U.S.-Canada Organic Equivalence Arrangement is currently in place whereby agricultural products produced and processed in conformity with the U.S. Organic Foods Production Act and the Canadian OPR are deemed to have been produced and processed in accordance with the OPR and may be sold, labelled or represented in Canada as organic. Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)  the CCPSA provides oversight and regulation of consumer products with respect to manufacturers, importers, and retailers. It includes, without limitation, the ability to require product recalls, mandatory incident reporting, document retention requirements, increased fines and penalties, and packaging and labeling requirements. While the CCPSA does not apply to food, it does apply to its packaging with respect to safety. It is possible that there will be amendments introduced to the FADA, to capture the essence of the regulatory oversight found in the CCPSA. We have no way of anticipating if and when that may occur. SUNOPTA INC. 17 December 29, 2012 10-K We are subject to Dutch and European Commission (EC) regulations and policies. Our European subsidiary, TOC, is involved in the sourcing, supplying, marketing, selling and distribution of organic food products and, as such, is subject to standards for production, labeling and inspection of organic products contained in EC Regulation 2092/91 (and its subsequent amendments). TOC is certified by Skal, the inspection body for the production of organic products in the Netherlands. Products certified as organic by an EU-recognized inspection body, such as Skal, can be marketed within the entire EU. In addition, under the terms of an equivalency arrangement between the U.S. and the EU, organic operations certified to the USDA organic or EU organic standards may be labeled and sold as organic in both the U.S. and EU. TOC is also affected by general food legislation both at EU and Dutch level relating to product safety and hygiene, among others. TOC is Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point certified in the Netherlands and manages a fully computerized system that guarantees the traceability of each product. In addition, TOC also considers and abides by EU and local legislation with regard to packaging and packaging waste. TOC is also subject to the regulations and policies of the countries outside of the EU in which it operates, including China and Ethiopia. Research and DevelopmentSunOpta Foods Research and development and new product and process innovation are key priorities of SunOpta Foods and initiatives are focused on continuous improvement of our existing product portfolios and production processes, as well as the development of innovative new products. Innovation is a key pillar for us and a necessity in the natural and organic foods categories. SunOpta Foods extensive applications and research and development expertise is organized around four key product categories: Grains and grain-based ingredients through finished packaged products; Value-added ingredients focused on fiber and fruit based applications; Fruit-based consumer packaged products; and Value-added nutritious healthy snacks and portable foods. Our product development teams include highly trained and experienced food scientists and technologists that are dedicated to both the development of unique new product offerings plus addressing product development opportunities for our customers including new and custom formulations, innovations in packaging formats, and new production processes and applications. Applications and technical support provided by each of our operating groups to our customers include all aspects of product development from concept to commercial launch, as well as ongoing manufacturing and processing support. Representatives from our operating groups also meet regularly to coordinate efforts to develop products which leverage the talents and product capabilities from across our organization. SunOpta Foods continues to develop new products to maximize the capabilities of our aseptic packaging facilities in Modesto, California and Alexandria, Minnesota, including the development of non-dairy based beverages that address the growing consumer demand for beverages that address allergy concerns and provide a unique nutritional portfolio. The expanding interest to incorporate grain-based foods in consumers diets also creates numerous opportunities to develop ingredients that can be incorporated into food developers menu items. In addition, SunOpta Foods continues to expand its product portfolio via the addition of new fiber and ingredient offerings that can be used to improve the nutritional content and functionality of a variety of foods. Demand for food fibers has continued to grow and we believe that this is a long-term trend due to an increased focus on healthy foods. Many of our ingredient solutions can be used in products that aid in satiety to respond to the growing epidemic of obesity in North America and elsewhere. Many of our ingredients can also be used in products which qualify for a whole grain claim by augmenting the insoluble and soluble fiber content of foods. SunOpta Foods also continues to develop new fruit-based beverages, healthy fruit snacks, nutrition bars and fruit based resealable pouch products, as well as innovative fruit ingredient systems for the dairy, food service and beverage industries. We are also looking at using fiber and other ingredients in these fruit products to improve their ability to address satiety and lower glycemic indices. SUNOPTA INC. 18 December 29, 2012 10-K Intellectual PropertySunOpta Foods The nature of a number of SunOpta Foods products and processes requires that we create and maintain patents, trade secrets and trademarks. Our policy is to protect our technology, brands and trade names by, among other things, filing patent applications for technology relating to the development of our business in the U.S. and in selected foreign jurisdictions, registering trademarks in the U.S., Canada and selected foreign jurisdictions where we sell products, and maintenance of confidentiality agreements with outside parties and employees. SunOpta Foods success will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our products, trade names and technology under U.S. and international patent laws and other intellectual property laws. We believe that we own or have sufficient rights to use all of the proprietary technology, information and trademarks necessary to manufacture and market our products; however, there is always a risk that patent applications relating to our products or technologies will not result in patents being issued, or, if issued, will be later challenged by a third party, or that current or additional patents will not afford protection against competitors with similar technology. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how and confidentiality agreements to protect certain technologies and processes. Even with these steps taken, our outside partners and contract manufacturers could gain access to our proprietary technology and confidential information. All employees are required to adhere to internal policies which are intended to further protect our technologies, processes and trade secrets. PropertiesSunOpta Foods As at December 29, 2012, SunOpta Foods operated 27 processing facilities in 11 U.S. states, as well as China and Ethiopia. SunOpta Foods also owns and leases a number of office and distribution locations in the U.S., Canada, the Netherlands, Ethiopia and China, and leases and utilizes public warehouses to satisfy its storage needs.
