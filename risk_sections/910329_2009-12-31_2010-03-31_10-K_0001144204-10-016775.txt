ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following risk factors should be considered when reading this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the events described below occurs, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. Much of our growth and future profitability depends on the effectiveness of our advertising spent in the Direct to consumer channel. Our marketing expenditures may not result in increased revenue or generate sufficient awareness of the program or the brand to the consumer. We may not be able to manage our advertising spend in a cost effective manner thereby increasing the cost to acquire a new customer to an elevated level that will decrease profits. We may be subject to health related claims from our customers A customer that suffers health problems may allege that the Medifast program contributed to the ailment. The Company is not currently the subject of any such claims; however, we would defend ourselves vigorously against such accusations. Regardless of the ultimate outcome, defending against such claims would be costly and could adversely affect our results of operations. A competitor or new entrant into the market may develop a product and program similar to ours Many of our competitors are significantly larger than us and have more financial resources to develop new products and programs. Our business could be affected if one of our competitors or a new entrant to the market develops similar products and programs through similar marketing channels. This could result in lower sales as well as pricing competition which could adversely affect the Company’s results from operations. New fad diets or pharmaceutical solutions could put us at a competitive disadvantage The weight loss industry is subject to fad diets. The Atkins craze hit the U.S. several years ago and had an impact on many weight loss companies. Another fad diet could sweep the nation or consumer preferences could change. Our failure to adapt or respond quickly enough to these changes could have an adverse affect on our results of operations. In addition, pharmaceutical companies are constantly trying to develop safe, effective, drugs that lead to weight loss. If successful, many dieters could perceive this to be easier than the Medifast program and this would put us at a competitive disadvantage. 14 Our ability to compete could be negatively affected in the event we fail to protect our brand names, trademarks or other intellectual property Because our business relies heavily on direct to consumer models, brand awareness is an important factor in our sales strategy. Failure to protect our brand or maintain an image of good standing with the public could result in a negative effect on our operations. Additionally, failure to protect our intellectual property could result in the arrival of a similar competitor which could reduce our competitive edge or decrease our market share. The business may grow too quickly for the current infrastructure to handle If our advertising is extremely successful and our Take Shape for Life relationship marketing division sees a large uptick in recruitment we may be unable to handle the growth from an operational perspective. Increasing demands on our infrastructure could cause long hold times in the call center as well as delays on our website. In addition, there could be delays in order processing, packaging and shipping. We could run out of a majority of our inventory if growth exceeded our production capacity. If these difficulties are encountered in a period of hyper-growth then our operating results could suffer. Any deficiencies or shortcomings in our information technology could prevent an efficient execution of routine business procedures We rely heavily on our IT infrastructure to support major business components. Any disruption to the integrity of this support structure including but not limited to; software, telecommunications, Electronic Resource Platform, or the Information Technology architecture as a whole could severely limit our ability to provide customers and vendors with adequate service and operating responses. In addition, our financial reporting is directly correlated with our company-wide software Microsoft Navision 4.0. Any compromise in the veracity of this system could severely alter the accuracy of our tracking, volumes, and general reporting including financial statements. A disruption in the supply of raw materials or the inability of third party manufacturing for certain products could affect operating results We rely heavily on our vendors to provide quality raw materials for us to utilize in our on-site manufacturing processes. Any disruption in the availability of these materials could potentially interrupt our ability to provide certain products to customers in a timely manner. Also certain products are currently manufactured through a third party. The availability of these products is prone to fluctuations dependent on the manufacturer’s ability to secure and produce a quality product that satisfies our satisfaction standards. Our stock price may experience volatility due to fluctuations in our operating results Our stock price is subject to fluctuations in response to our operating results, a competitor’s operating results, or our ability to meet stock analysts forecasts and our yearly revenue and EPS guidance. In addition, general trends in the weight-loss industry as a whole can have an affect on our stock price. These factors may have an adverse affect on the market price of our stock and cause it to fluctuate significantly. Since we cannot exert the same level of influence or control over our independent health coaches as we could were they our own employees, our health coaches could fail to comply with our policies and procedures, which could result in claims against us that could harm our financial condition and operating results. Our health coaches are independent contractors and, accordingly, we are not in a position to directly provide the same direction, motivation and oversight as we would if health coaches were our own employees. As a result, there can be no assurance that our health coaches will participate in our marketing strategies or plans, accept our introduction of new products, or comply with our health coach policies and procedures. We can provide no assurances that the number of independent health coaches will increase or remain constant or that their productivity will increase. We experienced a 76% increase in active independent health coaches during 2009. The number of active independent health coaches may not increase and could decline in the future. Independent health coaches may terminate their services at any time, and, like most direct selling companies, we experience turnover among new independent health coaches from year to year. We cannot accurately predict any fluctuation in the number and productivity of independent health coaches because we primarily rely upon existing independent health coaches to sponsor and train new independent health coaches and to motivate new and existing independent health coaches. Our operating results could be adversely affected if we and our existing independent health coaches do not generate sufficient interest in our business to successfully retain existing independent health coaches and attract new independent health coaches. Extensive federal, state and local laws regulate our business, products and direct selling program. While we have implemented health coach policies and procedures designed to govern their conduct and to protect the trademarks and brand of the Company it can be difficult to enforce these policies and procedures because of the large number of health coaches and their independent status. Violations by our independent health coaches of applicable law or of our policies and procedures in dealing with customers could reflect negatively on our products and operations and harm our business reputation. In addition, it is possible that a court could hold us civilly or criminally accountable based on vicarious liability because of the actions of our independent health coaches. 15 We may be subject to claims that our employees are unqualified to provide weight loss counseling Our Medifast Weight Control center division provides medical assessments and counseling to our customers. We may be subject to claims that our employees lack the proper training and qualifications to provide proper advice regarding weight loss. We could be subject to claims if an employee in one of our clinics gives inappropriate weight loss advice that results in health problems. Such claims could result in damage to our reputation and could have an affect on our operating results. Adverse publicity associated with our products, ingredients, or sales channels, or those of similar companies, could harm our financial condition, operating results, and stock price. Adverse publicity, whether or not accurate, relating to the Company, our products or our operations, our sales channels and independent health coaches could adversely impact the Company’s financial condition, operating results, and stock price. In addition, it could lead to lawsuits or other legal challenges and could negatively impact our reputation, the market demand for our products, or our general business. Negative publicity in the weight loss industry could adversely affect our business If the press were to come out with negative media about low-calorie diets, meal replacements, or soy protein this could harm our business. Even if not directed at Medifast, this perception could be instilled in our target market and cause harm to our operating results. The loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate and result in a negative financial condition Certain members of our Company oversee integral components of our Company. Although we do not anticipate the departure of any key employees including but not limited to the executive management team, we cannot guarantee their tenure indefinitely in the future. Our results of operations may decline as a result of a downturn in general economic conditions or consumer confidence Our results of operations are highly dependent on product sales and program fees. A downturn in general economic conditions or consumer confidence and spending in any of our major markets could result in people curtailing their discretionary spending, which, in turn, could lead to a decrease in product sales in our Medifast Direct and Take Shape for Life divisions and a decrease in product and program fees at our Medifast Weight Control Centers and Internet product subscriptions. Any such reduction would adversely affect our results of operations. Our Business is subject to regulatory and legislative restrictions A number of laws and regulations govern our production, operation, and advertising. The FTC and certain states regulate advertising, disclosures to consumers, privacy, consumer pricing or billing arrangements, and other consumer matters. Our direct selling distribution channel is subject to risk of interpretation of certain laws pertaining to the prevention of “pyramid” or “chain sale” schemes. Although we believe we are in full compliance, should the governing body alter or enforce the law in an unanticipated way, there may be a negative result on the company’s operations. The Company’s financial reporting is subject to various laws and regulations as well, specifically, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the SEC. These requirements demand the Company disclose certain information and maintain specific controls to ensure fair and legal accounting practices as outlined therein. The Company has taken substantial measures to ensure compliance through routine internal and external audits. Failure to correct any flaws in internal controls may constitute a public notification of weakness and could have an adverse effect on our stock price. Additionally, the Company is required to maintain a position of good standing in regards to taxation on both a Federal and State level. Failure to comply with federal and state regulations could result in additional taxes, fines, or interest due that could financially strain the company. Future laws and regulations could be unforeseen and potentially have a material negative impact on the Company. Failure to comply with any regulations of current or future authoritative entities could have a detrimental effect on the Company’s financial standing or operating results We are subject to risks associated with our reliance upon information technology systems. Our success is dependent on the accuracy, reliability, and proper use of information processing systems and management information technology. Our information technology systems are designed and selected in order to facilitate order entry and customer billing, maintain health coach and Preferred Customer records, accurately track purchases and incentive payments, manage accounting, finance, and manufacturing operations, generate reports, and provide customer service and technical support. Although off-site data back-up is maintained, it is possible that an interruption in these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. As a manufacturer, we may be subject to product liability claims. As a manufacturer and a distributor of products for human consumption and topical application, we could become exposed to product liability claims and litigation. Additionally, the manufacture and sale of these products involves the risk of injury to consumers due to tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination. To date, we have not been a party to any product liability litigation We are aware of no instance in which any of our products are or have been defective in any way that could give rise to material losses or expenditures related to product liability claims. Although we maintain product liability insurance, which we believe to be adequate for our needs, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to such claims in the future or that our insurance coverage will be adequate. 16 Our manufacturing activity is subject to certain risks. We manufacture approximately 65% of the products sold to our customers. As a result, we are dependent upon the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facility in Owings Mills, Maryland. Those operations are subject to power failures, the breakdown, failure, or substandard performance of equipment, the improper installation or operation of equipment, natural or other disasters, and the need to comply with the requirements or directives of government agencies, including the FDA. There can be no assurance that the occurrence of these or any other operational problems at our facility would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture, use and disposal of chemicals, solid and hazardous waste, and other toxic and hazardous materials. Our manufacturing operations presently do not result in the generation of material amounts of hazardous or toxic substances. Nevertheless, complying with new or more stringent laws or regulations, or more vigorous enforcement of current or future policies of regulatory agencies, could require substantial expenditures by us that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Environmental laws and regulations require us to maintain and comply with a number of permits, authorizations, and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in our processes. Violations of those requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions and could require us to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured. The combined costs of curing incidents of non-compliance, resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities, or of satisfying new legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
