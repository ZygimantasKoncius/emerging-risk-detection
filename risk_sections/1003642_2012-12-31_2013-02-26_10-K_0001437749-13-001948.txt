Item 1A. Risk Factors An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. In deciding whether to invest in our common stock, you should consider carefully the following risk factors, as well as the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The materialization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in this “Risk Factors” section. See “Forward-Looking Statements” on page 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Risks Related to Our Business Unstable economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business, financial position and results of operations. The global economy has undergone a period of significant volatility which has led to diminished credit availability, declines in consumer confidence and increases in unemployment rates. There remains caution about the stability of the U.S. economy due to the global financial crisis, and we cannot assure that further deterioration in the financial markets will not occur. These economic conditions have resulted in, and could lead to further, reduced consumer spending related to healthcare in general and pharmaceutical products in particular. In addition, we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, including our partners under our alliance and collaboration agreements, suppliers of raw chemical materials, drug wholesalers and other customers that may be affected by an unstable economic environment. Any economic instability may affect these parties’ ability to fulfill their respective contractual obligations to us, cause them to limit or place burdensome conditions upon future transactions with us or drive us and our competitors to decrease prices, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position. Furthermore, the capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility. Disruptions in the credit markets make it harder and more expensive to obtain funding. In the event current resources do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional financing. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions and the general availability of credit. Future debt financing may not be available to us when required or may not be available on acceptable terms, and as a result we may be unable to grow our business, take advantage of business opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures. 21 Our revenues and operating income could fluctuate significantly. Our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter to quarter as well as in comparison to the corresponding quarter of the preceding year. Variations may result from, among other factors: · the timing of FDA approvals we receive; · the timing of process validation for particular drug products; · the timing of product launches, and market acceptance of such products launched; · changes in the amount we spend to research, develop, acquire, license or promote new products; · the outcome of our clinical trial programs; · serious or unexpected health or safety concerns with our products, the brand products we have genericized, or our product candidates; · the introduction of new products by others that render our products obsolete or noncompetitive; · the ability to maintain selling prices and gross margins on our products; · the outcome of our patent infringement litigation and other litigation matters and expenditures as a result of such litigation; · the ability to comply with complex governmental regulations which deal with many aspects of our business; · changes in coverage and reimbursement policies of health plans and other health insurers, including changes to Medicare, Medicaid and similar state programs; · increases in the cost of raw materials used to manufacture our products; · manufacturing and supply interruptions, including product rejections or recalls due to failure to comply with manufacturing specifications; · the ability of our brand license partner(s) to secure regulatory approval, gain market share, sales volume, and sales milestone levels; · timing of revenue recognition related to our alliance and collaboration agreements; · the ability to protect our intellectual property and avoid infringing the intellectual property of others; and · the addition or loss of customers. As an illustration, we earned significant revenues and gross profit from sales of our tamsulosin, a generic to Flomax®, and fenofibrate products during the year ended December 31, 2010 and from sales of our authorized generic Adderall XR® and fenofibrate products during the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012. We commenced sales of our tamsulosin product on March 2, 2010 and had contractual market exclusivity for this generic product for the succeeding eight week period, during which we were able to achieve high market-share penetration. Our tamsulosin product sales, however, did not remain at this level, as additional competing generic versions of the product entered the market in late April 2010, at the conclusion of our contractual exclusivity period, and have resulted in both price erosion and reduction of our market share. With respect to our authorized generic of Adderall XR® products, we are dependent on another unrelated third-party pharmaceutical company to supply us with such products we market and sell through our Global Division. Any delay or interruption in the supply of our authorized generic of Adderall XR® products from the unrelated third-party pharmaceutical company could curtail or delay our product shipments and adversely affect our revenues, as well as jeopardize our relationships with our customers. In June 2012, an unrelated pharmaceutical company received FDA approval for a competitor product to our authorized generic Adderall XR® products and began marketing this product. With respect to our fenofibrate products, in October 2012, a competitor product to our fenofibrate capsule was approved for sale by the FDA. As a result of these competing products, we have experienced significant diminution of our sales revenue and gross profit from our generic Adderall XR® products. Any further diminution of sales revenue and/or gross profit from such products due to existing or additional competition, product supply or any other reasons in future periods may materially and adversely affect our results of operations in such periods. Due to the fluctuations in revenue and operating results discussed above, our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period. We cannot predict with any certainty the timing or level of sales of our products in the future. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance and any full-year financial forecast should not be relied upon as a guarantee of future performance for that year or for any given quarter within that year. If our quarterly sales or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the value of our securities could decline substantially. 22 We have received a warning letter from the FDA. If we are unable to promptly correct the issues raised in the warning letter, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In late May 2011, we received a warning letter from the FDA related to an on-site FDA inspection of our Hayward, California manufacturing facility conducted between December 13, 2010 and January 21, 2011. In the warning letter, the FDA cited deviations from current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, record keeping and quality standards. In summary, the FDA observations set forth in the warning letter related to sampling and testing of in-process materials and drug products, production record review, and our process for investigating the failure of certain manufacturing batches (or portions of batches) to meet specifications. From late June 2011 through the end of 2011, we filed our response and subsequent updates with the FDA and continued to cooperate with the FDA to resolve the FDA observations. During the quarter ended March 31, 2012, the FDA completed a re-inspection of our Hayward manufacturing facility in connection with the warning letter and in addition, a general GMP inspection. As a result of the general GMP inspection of our Hayward operations, the FDA issued a Form 483, with observations primarily relating to our Quality Control Laboratory. We have been notified by the FDA that a satisfactory re-inspection of our Hayward manufacturing facility is required to close out the warning letter. The FDA observations do not place restrictions on our ability to manufacture and ship our products. We have taken a number of steps to thoroughly review our quality control and manufacturing systems and standards and are working with several third-party experts to assist us with our review. This work is ongoing and we are committed to improving our quality control and manufacturing practices. We cannot be assured, however, that the FDA will be satisfied with our corrective actions and as such, we cannot be assured of when the warning letter will be closed out. Unless and until the warning letter is closed out, it is possible we may be subject to additional regulatory action by the FDA as a result of the current or future FDA observations, including, among others, monetary sanctions or penalties, product recalls or seizure, injunctions, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, and suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals. Additionally, the FDA has withheld and may continue to withhold approval of pending drug applications currently or previously listing our Hayward, California facility as a manufacturing location of finished dosage forms until these FDA observations are resolved. For instance, in January 2013, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter regarding our NDA for our late stage branded pharmaceutical product candidate, RYTARY™, which we are developing internally, for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson’s disease. In the Complete Response Letter, the FDA indicated that it required a satisfactory re-inspection of our Hayward manufacturing facility as a result of the warning letter issued to us in May 2011 before the NDA may be approved by the FDA due to the facility’s involvement in the development of RYTARY™ and supportive manufacturing and distribution activities. During the assessment of the NDA, we had withdrawn the Hayward site as an alternative site of commercial production in the launch of RYTARY™. We are currently working with the FDA on the appropriate next steps for the RYTARY™ NDA and, as noted above, on closing out the warning letter, however we cannot be assured of when that will occur. Further, other federal agencies and our customers may take the warning letter into account when considering the award of contracts. Any such actions could significantly disrupt our business and harm our reputation, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, business, results of operations and financial condition. 23 Our continued growth is dependent on our ability to continue to successfully develop and commercialize new products in a timely manner. Our financial results depend upon our ability to introduce and commercialize additional generic and branded products in a timely manner. In the generic pharmaceutical products market, revenue from newly launched generic products that we are the first to market is typically relatively high during the period immediately following launch and can be expected generally to decline over time. Revenue from generic drugs in general can also be expected to decline over time. Revenue from branded pharmaceutical products can be expected to decline as the result of entry of new competitors, particularly of companies producing generic versions of the branded products. Our continued growth is therefore dependent upon our ability to continue to successfully introduce and commercialize new generic and branded products. As of February 8, 2013, we had 50 applications pending at the FDA for generic versions of brand-name pharmaceuticals. In our branded products division, we have one late stage branded pharmaceutical product candidate which we are developing internally, RYTARY™ for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson’s disease for which our NDA was accepted for filing by the NDA in February 2012 and which we are currently working with the FDA on the appropriate next steps in in response to a Complete Response Letter we received from the FDA in January 2013. We also have a number of other product candidates that are in varying stages of development. The development and commercialization process for our products, particularly of our branded products, is time-consuming, costly and involves a high degree of business risk. The FDA and the regulatory authorities may not approve our products submitted to them or our other products under development. Additionally, we may not successfully complete our development efforts. Even if the FDA approves our products, we may not be able to market them successfully or profitably or, with respect to our generics products, we may not be able to market them at all if we do not prevail in the patent infringement litigation in which we are involved. Our future results of operations will depend significantly upon our ability to timely develop, receive FDA approval for, and market new pharmaceutical products or otherwise acquire new products. A substantial portion of our total revenues is derived from sales to a limited number of customers. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales to a limited number of customers. In 2012, our five major customers, Cardinal Health, McKesson Corporation, Amerisource-Bergen, Walgreens and Medco accounted for 25%, 22%, 15%, 9% and 3%, respectively, or an aggregate of 74%, of our gross revenue. A reduction in, or loss of business with, any one of these customers, or any failure of a customer to pay us on a timely basis, would adversely affect our business. A substantial portion of our total revenues is derived from sales of a limited number of products. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of a limited number of products. In 2012, our top five products in our Global Division accounted for 16%, 12%, 9%, 9% and 7%, or an aggregate of 53%, of Global product sales, net. In our Impax Division, revenue from sales of Zomig® products pursuant to our Distribution, License, Development and Supply Agreement with AstraZeneca accounted for 100% of our Impax product sales, net. The sale of our products can be significantly influenced by market conditions, as well as regulatory actions. We may experience decreases in the sale of our products in the future as a result of actions taken by our competitors, such as price reductions, or as a result of regulatory actions related to our products or to competing products, which could have a material impact on our results of operations. Actions which could be taken by our competitors, which may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, may include, without limitation, pricing changes and entering or exiting the market for specific products. 24 Sales of our products may be adversely affected by the continuing consolidation of our customer base. A significant proportion of our sales is made to relatively few retail drug chains, wholesalers, and managed care purchasing organizations. These customers are continuing to undergo significant consolidation. Such consolidation has provided and may continue to provide them with additional purchasing leverage, and consequently may increase the pricing pressures that we face. Additionally, the emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies, and the prevalence and influence of managed care organizations and similar institutions, enable those groups to extract price discounts on our products. Our net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may also be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of retail chains, major distributors and other trade buyers, whether resulting from pricing, wholesaler buying decisions or other factors. In addition, since such a significant portion of our revenues is derived from relatively few customers, any financial difficulties experienced by a single customer, or any delay in receiving payments from a single customer, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 25 We face intense competition from both brand-name and generic manufacturers. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors have longer operating histories and substantially greater financial, research and development, marketing, and other resources than we have. In addition, pharmaceutical manufacturers’ customer base consists of an increasingly limited number of large pharmaceutical wholesalers, chain drug stores that warehouse products, mass merchandisers, mail order pharmacies. Our competitors may be able to develop products and delivery technologies competitive with or more effective or less expensive than our own for many reasons, including that they may have: · proprietary processes or delivery systems; · greater resources in the area of research and development and marketing; · larger or more efficient production capabilities; · more expertise in a particular therapeutic area; · more expertise in preclinical testing and human clinical trials; · more experience in obtaining required regulatory approvals, including FDA approval; · more products; or · more experience in developing new drugs and financial resources, particularly with regard to brand manufacturers. With respect to generic pharmaceutical products, the FDA approval process often results in the FDA granting final approval to a number of ANDAs for a given product at the time a patent claim for a corresponding brand product or other market exclusivity expires. This often forces us to face immediate competition when we introduce a generic product into the market. As competition from other manufacturers intensifies, selling prices and gross profit margins often decline, which has been our experience with our existing products. Moreover, with respect to products for which we file a Paragraph IV certification, if we are not the first ANDA filer challenging a listed patent for a product, we are at a significant disadvantage to the competitor that first filed an ANDA for that product containing such a challenge, which is awarded 180 days of market exclusivity for the product. With respect to our 29 disclosed products pending FDA approval for which we have filed Paragraph IV certifications as of February 8, 2013, we believe: (i) unrelated third parties are the first to file with respect to products with which 22 of our products can be expected to compete; (ii) we are the first to file for 4 products; and (iii) we share first to file status with other filers for 3 products. Accordingly, the level of market share, revenue and gross profit attributable to a particular generic product that we develop is generally related to the number of competitors in that product’s market and the timing of that product’s regulatory approval and launch, in relation to competing approvals and launches. Although we cannot assure, we strive to develop and introduce new products in a timely and cost effective manner to be competitive in our industry (see “Item 1 Business — Regulation”). Additionally, ANDA approvals often continue to be granted for a given product subsequent to the initial launch of the generic product. These circumstances generally result in significantly lower prices and reduced margins for generic products compared to brand products. New generic market entrants generally cause continued price and margin erosion over the generic product life cycle. In addition to the competition we face from other generic manufacturers, we face competition from brand-name manufacturers related to our generic products. Branded pharmaceutical companies often sell their branded products as “authorized generics” (an industry term that describes instances when a brand-name manufacturer licenses a generic manufacturer to market the brand product under the licensee’s name and registration at typical generic discounts). Further, branded pharmaceutical companies may seek to delay FDA approval of our ANDAs or reduce generic competition by, for example obtaining new patents on drugs whose original patent protection is about to expire, filing patent infringement suits that automatically delay FDA approval of generics, filing “citizen petitions” contesting FDA approvals of generics on alleged health and safety grounds, developing “next generation” versions of products that reduce demand for generic versions we are developing, changing product claims and labeling, and marketing as OTC branded products. Our principal competitors in the generic pharmaceutical products market are Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Actavis, Inc., Mylan Inc., Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd., Lannett Company, Inc., Sandoz, Inc., and Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc. In the brand-name pharmaceutical market, we market Zomig® products pursuant to the Distribution, License, Development and Supply Agreement with AstraZeneca. We are not currently marketing any internally developed products, however, with respect to both products that we are developing internally and any additional products we may in-license from third parties, we expect that we will face increased competition from large pharmaceutical companies, other drug delivery companies, and other specialty pharmaceutical companies that have focused on CNS disorders. 26 We have experienced operating losses and negative cash flow from operations in the past, and our future profitability is uncertain. Although 2007 was our first profitable year, and we continued to record net income on an annual basis through and including 2012, we do not know whether our business will continue to be profitable or generate positive cash flow, and our ability to remain profitable or obtain positive cash flow is uncertain. To remain operational and profitable, we must, among other things: · obtain FDA approval of our products; · successfully launch and market new products; · prevail in patent infringement litigation in which we are involved; · continue to generate or obtain sufficient capital on acceptable terms to fund our operations; and · comply with the many complex governmental regulations that deal with virtually every aspect of our business activities. Any delays or unanticipated expenses in connection with the operation of our Taiwan facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of business operations and financial condition. We completed construction of a new manufacturing facility in Taiwan, installed equipment, and received FDA approval during 2009. We initiated commercial manufacturing operations in 2010, and produced approximately 115 million and 240 million tablets and capsules in 2011 and 2012 respectively, for sale in the United States. We plan to continue to increase the aggregate total tablet and capsule production, as well as the number of different products manufactured, at our facility in Taiwan during 2013, and have invested approximately $110 million in the facility through December 31, 2012. We initiated construction of an expansion to our manufacturing facility in Taiwan during 2009 and will expand the Taiwan manufacturing facility in stages. The first phase of the expansion of the Taiwan manufacturing facility was completed in 2009 and the second phase of the expansion was substantially completed in 2012. We currently expect to complete the second phase expansion and begin manufacturing trial batches of products during 2013. After the completion of the second phase of the expansion, we expect the Taiwan facility to have an annual production capacity of approximately 2 billion doses. A major portion of the second phase of the expansion is dedicated to the production of our late stage branded pharmaceutical product candidate, RYTARY™ for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson’s disease, for which the NDA was accepted for filing by the FDA in February 2012 and which we are currently working with the FDA on the appropriate next steps in response to a Complete Response Letter we received from the FDA in January 2013. We are also in the process of transferring a portion of our Hayward, California production to the lower cost production site in Taiwan. While we have thus far not suffered any material delays, significant increases in estimated expenses or other material setbacks associated with the construction and operation of the manufacturing facility in Taiwan, we cannot assure that costs of production will be within our projections. During any potential delays in scale-up of commercial operations, changing market conditions could render projections relating to our investment in the new facility inaccurate or unreliable. While the facility was approved by the FDA in 2009 and in 2012, we cannot assure that the facility will continue to receive FDA approval in future inspections. In addition, we cannot assure that the planned expansion of the facility will become operational as anticipated or will ultimately result in profitable operations. If the completion of the second phase of our planned expansion of the Taiwan facility is significantly delayed, we will, based upon current projections, reach full production capacity at our Taiwan manufacturing facility and may have inadequate capacity to meet our production requirements for RYTARY™. If our manufacturing capacity were to be exceeded by our production requirements, we could lose customers and market share to competing products, and otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 27 Our business is subject to the economic, political, legal and other risks of maintaining facilities and conducting clinical trials in foreign countries. In 2010, we commenced shipment of commercial product from our new manufacturing facility in Taiwan, and we plan to increase our commercial manufacturing operations in Taiwan in the future. In addition, certain clinical trials for our product candidates are conducted at multiple sites in Europe. These foreign operations are subject to risks inherent in maintaining operations and doing business abroad, such as economic and political destabilization, international conflicts, restrictive actions by foreign governments, expropriation or nationalization of property, changes in laws and regulations, changes in regulatory requirements, the difficulty of effectively managing diverse global operations, adverse foreign tax or tariff laws, more limited intellectual property protection in certain foreign jurisdictions, and the threat posed by potential international disease pandemics in countries that do not have the resources necessary to deal with such outbreaks. Further, as our global operations require compliance with a complex set of foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, and export requirements, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and local laws which also prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers, there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently breached. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. These foreign economic, political, legal and other risks could impact our operations and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are routinely subject to patent litigation that can delay or prevent our commercialization of generic products, force us to incur substantial expense to defend, and expose us to substantial liability. Brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers routinely bring patent infringement litigation against ANDA applicants seeking FDA approval to manufacture and market generic forms of their branded products. Likewise, patent holders may bring patent infringement suits against companies that are currently marketing and selling their approved generic products. Patent infringement litigation involves many complex technical and legal issues and its outcome is often difficult to predict, and the risk involved in doing so can be substantial, because the remedies available to the owner of a patent in the event of an unfavorable outcome include damages measured by the profits lost by the patent owner rather than the profits earned by the infringer. Such litigation usually involves significant expense and can delay or prevent introduction or sale of our products. As of February 8, 2013, we were involved in patent infringement suits involving the following 11 generic products: (i) Doxycycline Monohydrate Delayed-Release Capsules, 40 mg, generic to Oracea®, (ii) Ezetimibe/Simvastatin Tablets, 10/80 mg, generic to Vytorin®, (iii) Guanfacine Hydrochloride Tablets, 1 mg, 2 mg, 3mg and 4 mg, generic to Intuniv®, (iv) Dexlansoprazole Delayed Release Capsules, 30 mg and 60 mg, generic to Dexilant®, (v) Oxycodone Hydrochloride, Controlled Release tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg and 80 mg, generic to Oxycontin®, (vi) Dextromethorphan/Quinidine Capsules, 20 mg/10 mg, generic to Nuedexta®, (vii) Dutasteride/Tamsulosin Capsules, 0.5 mg/0.4 mg, generic to Jalyn®, (viii) Fentanyl Citrate Buccal Tablets, 100 mcg, 200 mcg, 400 mcg, 600 mcg, and 800 mcg, generic to Fentora®, (ix) Oxycodone Hydrochloride Tablets, 5 mg and 7.5 mg, generic to Oxecta®, (x) Oxymorphone Hydrochloride, Extended Release tablets, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg and 40 mg, generic to Opana ER® and (xi) Oxycodone Hydrochloride, extended-release tablets 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg and 80 mg generic to OxyContin® (related to NDA 020553). For the year ended December 31, 2012, we incurred costs of approximately $8.7 million in connection with our participation in these matters, which are in varying stages of litigation, as well as for other matters that were resolved in 2012. If any of these patent litigation matters are resolved unfavorably, we or any alliance or collaboration partners may be enjoined from manufacturing or selling the product that is the subject of such litigation without a license from the other party. In addition, if we decide to market and sell generic products prior to the resolution of patent infringement suits, we could be held liable for lost profits if we are found to have infringed a valid patent, or liable for treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a valid patent. As a result, any patent litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, although it is not possible to quantify the liability we could incur if any of these suits are decided against us. 28 Our agreements with brand pharmaceutical companies, which are important to our business, are facing increased government scrutiny in the U.S. We are involved in numerous patent litigations in which we challenge the validity or enforceability of innovator companies’ listed patents and/or their applicability to our generic pharmaceutical products and therefore settling patent litigations has been and is likely to continue to be an important part of our business. Parties to such settlement agreements in the U.S., including us, are required by law to file them with the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice for review. The FTC has publicly stated that, in its view, some of the brand - generic settlement agreements violate the antitrust laws and has brought actions against some brand and generic companies that have entered into such agreements. In May 2012, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) from the FTC concerning its investigation into the drug SOLODYN® and its generic equivalents. According to the FTC, the investigation is to determine whether we, along with Medicis Pharmaceutical Corporation (now a wholly owned subsidiary of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.) and six other companies, have engaged or are engaged in unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce by entering into agreements regarding SOLODYN® or its generic equivalents and/or engaging in other conduct regarding the sale or marketing of SOLODYN® or its generic equivalents. To our knowledge, no proceedings have been initiated against us by the FTC at this time, however no assurance can be given as to the timing or outcome of the FTC’s investigation. Further, we may receive formal or informal requests from the FTC for information about certain other settlement agreements, and there is a risk that the FTC may commence an action against us alleging violation of the antitrust laws. Our ability to develop or license, or otherwise acquire, and introduce new products on a timely basis in relation to our competitors’ product introductions involves inherent risks and uncertainties. Product development is inherently risky, especially for new drugs for which safety and efficacy have not been established and the market is not yet proven. Likewise, product licensing involves inherent risks including uncertainties due to matters that may affect the achievement of milestones, as well as the possibility of contractual disagreements with regard to terms such as license scope or termination rights. The development and commercialization process, particularly with regard to new drugs, also requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. The process of obtaining FDA approval to manufacture and market new pharmaceutical products is rigorous, time consuming, costly and largely unpredictable. We, or a partner, may not be successful in obtaining FDA approval or in commercializing any of the products that we are developing or licensing. Our approved products may not achieve expected levels of market acceptance. Even if we are able to obtain regulatory approvals for our new products, the success of those products is dependent upon market acceptance. Levels of market acceptance for our new products could be affected by several factors, including: · the availability of alternative products from our competitors; · the prices of our products relative to those of our competitors; · the timing of our market entry; · the ability to market our products effectively at the retail level; · the perception of patients and the healthcare community, including third-party payers, regarding the safety, efficacy and benefits of our drug products compared to those of competing products; and · the acceptance of our products by government and private formularies. Some of these factors are not within our control, and our products may not achieve expected levels of market acceptance. Additionally, continuing and increasingly sophisticated studies of the proper utilization, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products are being conducted by the industry, government agencies and others which can call into question the utilization, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of product marketing or other risk management programs such as the need for a patient registry. 29 Our business is highly dependent on market perceptions of us and the safety and quality of our products. Our business or products could be subject to negative publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Market perceptions of our business are very important to us, especially market perceptions of the safety and quality of our products. If any of our products or similar products that other companies distribute are subject to market withdrawal or recall or are proven to be, or are claimed to be, harmful to consumers, then this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Also, because our business is dependent on market perceptions, negative publicity associated with product quality, illness or other adverse effects resulting from, or perceived to be resulting from, our products could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial position. We expend a significant amount of resources on research and development efforts that may not lead to successful product introductions or the recovery of our research and development expenditures. We conduct research and development primarily to enable us to manufacture and market pharmaceuticals in accordance with FDA regulations. We spent approximately $81.3 million, $82.7 million and $86.2 million on research and development activities during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We are required to obtain FDA approval before marketing our drug products. The FDA approval process is costly and time consuming. Typically, research expenses related to the development of innovative compounds and the filing of NDAs are significantly greater than those expenses associated with ANDAs. As we continue to develop new products, our research expenses will likely increase. Because of the inherent risk associated with research and development efforts in our industry, particularly with respect to new drugs, our research and development expenditures may not result in the successful introduction of FDA approved pharmaceuticals. Our bioequivalence studies, other clinical studies and/or other data may not result in FDA approval to market our new drug products. While we believe that the FDA’s ANDA procedures will apply to our bioequivalent versions of controlled-release drugs, these drugs may not be suitable for, or approved as part of, these abbreviated applications. In addition, even if our drug products are suitable for FDA approval by filing an ANDA, the abbreviated applications are costly and time consuming to complete. After we submit an NDA or ANDA, the FDA may require that we conduct additional studies, and as a result, we may be unable to reasonably determine the total research and development costs to develop a particular product. Also, for products pending approval, we may obtain raw materials or produce batches of inventory to be used in anticipation of the product’s launch. In the event that FDA approval is denied or delayed, we could be exposed to the risk of this inventory becoming obsolete. Finally, we cannot be certain that any investment made in developing products or product-delivery technologies will be recovered, even if we are successful in commercialization. To the extent that we expend significant resources on research and development efforts and are not able, ultimately, to introduce successful new products or new delivery technologies as a result of those efforts, we will be unable to recover those expenditures. The time necessary to develop generic drugs may adversely affect whether, and the extent to which, we receive a return on our capital. We generally begin our development activities for a new generic drug product several years in advance of the patent expiration date of the brand-name drug equivalent. The development process, including drug formulation, testing, and FDA review and approval, often takes three or more years. This process requires that we expend considerable capital to pursue activities that do not yield an immediate or near-term return. Also, because of the significant time necessary to develop a product, the actual market for a product at the time it is available for sale may be significantly less than the originally projected market for the product. If this were to occur, our potential return on our investment in developing the product, if approved for marketing by the FDA, would be adversely affected and we may never receive a return on our investment in the product. It is also possible for the manufacturer of the brand-name product for which we are developing a generic drug to obtain approvals from the FDA to switch the brand-name drug from the prescription market to the OTC market. If this were to occur, we would be prohibited from marketing our product other than as an OTC drug, in which case revenues could be substantially less than we anticipated. 30 Research and development efforts invested in our branded pharmaceutical products may not achieve expected results. We invest increasingly significant resources to develop our branded products, both through our own efforts and through collaborations, in-licensing and acquisition of products from or with third parties. The development of proprietary branded drugs involves processes and expertise different from those used in the development of generic products, which increases the risks of failure that we face. For example, the time from discovery to commercial launch of a branded product can be 15 years or even longer, and involves multiple stages: not only intensive preclinical and clinical testing, but also highly complex, lengthy and expensive approval processes which can vary from country to country. The longer it takes to develop a product, the longer time it may take for us to recover our development costs and generate profits, if at all. During each development stage, we may encounter obstacles that delay the process or approval and increase expenses, leading to significant risks that we will not achieve our goals and may be forced to abandon a potential product in which we have invested substantial amounts of time and money. These obstacles may include: preclinical failures; difficulty enrolling patients in clinical trials; delays in completing formulation and other work needed to support an application for approval; adverse reactions or other safety concerns arising during clinical testing; insufficient clinical trial data to support the safety or efficacy of the product candidate; and failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, the required regulatory approvals for the product candidate or the facilities in which it is manufactured. For instance, in January 2013, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter regarding our NDA for our late stage branded pharmaceutical product candidate that we are developing internally, RYTARY™, for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson’s disease. In the Complete Response Letter, the FDA indicated that it required a satisfactory re-inspection of our Hayward manufacturing facility as a result of the warning letter issued to us in May 2011 before the NDA may be approved by the FDA due to the facility’s involvement in the development of RYTARY ™ and supportive manufacturing and distribution activities. During the assessment of the NDA, we had withdrawn the Hayward site as an alternative site of commercial production in the launch of RYTARY™. We are currently working with the FDA on the appropriate next steps for the RYTARY™ NDA and, as noted above, on closing out the warning letter, however we cannot be assured of when that will occur. We also discontinued our branded pharmaceutical development program for IPX159, an oral controlled-release formulation for the potential treatment of moderate to severe RLS, in mid-February 2013 after we determined that although the results from the Phase IIb clinical study of IPX159 in patients showed a modest improvement in addressing RLS symptoms, the results from the study did not achieve the statistical criteria for its primary efficacy endpoints compared to placebo. As a result of the obstacles noted above, our investment in research and development of branded products can involve significant costs with no assurances of future revenues or profits. Approvals for our new generic drug products may be delayed or become more difficult to obtain if the FDA institutes changes to its approval requirements. The FDA may institute changes to its ANDA approval requirements, which may make it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain approval for our new generic products. For instance, in July 2012, the Generic Drug Fee User Amendments of 2012 (“GDUFA”) was enacted into law. The GDUFA legislation implemented fees for new ANDAs, Drug Master Files, product and establishment fees and a one-time fee for back-logged ANDAs pending approval as of October 1, 2012. In return, the program is intended to provide faster and more predictable ANDA reviews by the FDA and increased inspections of drug facilities. Under GDUFA, generic product companies face significant penalties for failure to pay the new user fees, including rendering an ANDA not “substantially complete” until the fee is paid. It is currently uncertain the effect the new fees will have on our ANDA process and business, however, any failure by us or our suppliers to pay the fees or to comply with the other provisions of GDFUA may impact or delay our ability to file ANDAs, obtain approvals for new generic products, generate revenues and thus may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Some abbreviated application procedures for products, including those related to our ANDA filings, are or may also become the subject of petitions filed by brand-name drug manufacturers seeking changes from the FDA in the approval requirements for particular drugs, which can delay or make development of generic drugs more difficult. We cannot predict whether the FDA will make any changes to its abbreviated application requirements as a result of these petitions, or the effect that any changes may have on us. Any changes in FDA requirements as a result of these petitions or otherwise may similarly make it more difficult for us to file ANDAs or obtain approval of our ANDAs and generate revenues and thus have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 31 Our inexperience in conducting clinical trials and submitting NDAs could result in delays or failure in development and commercialization of our own branded products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition. With respect to our branded products and other products that we develop that are not generic equivalents of existing brand-name drugs and thus do not qualify for the FDA’s abbreviated application procedures, we must demonstrate through clinical trials that these products are safe and effective for use. We have only limited experience in conducting and supervising clinical trials. The process of completing clinical trials and preparing an NDA may take several years and requires substantial resources. Our studies and filings may not result in FDA approval to market our new drug products and, if the FDA grants approval, we cannot predict the timing of any approval. There are substantial filing fees for NDAs that are not refundable if FDA approval is not obtained. We cannot assure that our expenses related to NDAs and clinical trials will lead to the development of brand-name drugs that will generate revenues in the near future. Delays or failure in the development and commercialization of our own branded products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The risks and uncertainties inherent in conducting clinical trials could delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our own branded products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, and growth prospects. There are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with clinical trials. The results of clinical trials may not be indicative of results that would be obtained from large scale testing. Clinical trials are often conducted with patients having advanced stages of disease and, as a result, during the course of treatment these patients can die or suffer adverse medical effects for reasons that may not be related to the pharmaceutical agents being tested, but which nevertheless affect the clinical trial results. In addition, side effects experienced by the patients may cause delay of approval or limited profile of an approved product. Moreover, our clinical trials may not demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain FDA approval. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process and, in addition, the results from early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in later and larger clinical trials, and product candidates in later clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety or efficacy despite having progressed successfully through earlier clinical testing. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including us, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even in advanced clinical trials after showing positive results in earlier clinical trials. For example, we had previously sought to develop an earlier product formulation containing carbidopa/levodopa for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. Following completion of the clinical trials and submission of the NDA, the NDA was not approved due to the FDA’s concerns over product nomenclature and the potential for medication errors. In the future, the completion of clinical trials for our product candidates may be delayed or halted for many reasons, including: · delays in patient enrollment, and variability in the number and types of patients available for clinical trials; · regulators or institutional review boards may not allow us to commence or continue a clinical trial; · our inability, or the inability of our partners, to manufacture or obtain from third parties materials sufficient to complete our clinical trials; · delays or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective clinical trial sites; · risks associated with trial design, which may result in a failure of the trial to show statistically significant results even if the product candidate is effective; · difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment commences, resulting in incomplete data; · poor effectiveness of product candidates during clinical trials; · safety issues, including adverse events associated with product candidates; · the failure of patients to complete clinical trials due to adverse side effects, dissatisfaction with the product candidate, or other reasons; · governmental or regulatory delays or changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines; and · varying interpretation of data by the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, our product candidates could be subject to competition for clinical study sites and patients from other therapies under development which may delay the enrollment in or initiation of our clinical trials. 32 The FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may require us to conduct unanticipated additional clinical trials, which could result in additional expense and delays in bringing our product candidates to market. Any failure or delay in completing clinical trials for our product candidates would prevent or delay the commercialization of our product candidates. We cannot assure that our expenses related to clinical trials will lead to the development of brand-name drugs that will generate revenues in the near future. Delays or failure in the development and commercialization of our own branded products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, and our growth prospects. We rely on our license partner for regulatory filing and commercialization of IPX066 outside of the United States and Taiwan. Glaxo Group Limited, under the terms of our license, development and commercialization agreement, is responsible for certain regulatory activities outside the United States and Taiwan that are essential for the commercialization of IPX066 (brand name RYTARY™ in the United States) outside of the United States and Taiwan. If Glaxo Group Limited is not successful in its performance of, or fails to perform, their regulatory obligations with respect to IPX066, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for IPX066 in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States and Taiwan, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials and testing for our product candidates, and if they do not properly and successfully perform their legal and regulatory obligations, as well as their contractual obligations to us, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates. We design the clinical trials for our product candidates, but rely on contract research organizations and other third parties to assist us in managing, monitoring and otherwise carrying out these trials, including with respect to site selection, contract negotiation, analytical testing and data management. We do not control these third parties and, as a result, they may not treat our clinical studies as their highest priority, or in the manner in which we would prefer, which could result in delays. Although we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and related activities, we are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with our general investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices and good laboratory practices, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. The FDA enforces good clinical practices and good laboratory practices through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we, our contract research organizations or our study sites fail to comply with applicable good clinical practices and good laboratory practices, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, the FDA will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with good clinical practices and good laboratory practices. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product manufactured under the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations. Our failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers if any are involved in the process, to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. If third parties do not successfully carry out their duties under their agreements with us, if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or if they otherwise fail to comply with clinical trial protocols or meet expected deadlines, our clinical trials may not meet regulatory requirements. If our clinical trials do not meet regulatory requirements or if these third parties need to be replaced, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated. If any of these events occur, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects. 33 The illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of our products or of stolen products could have a negative impact on our reputation and a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Third parties could illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet the rigorous manufacturing and testing standards that our products undergo. Counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective, and can be life-threatening. Counterfeit medicines may contain harmful substances, the wrong dose of the active pharmaceutical ingredient or no active pharmaceutical ingredients at all. However, to distributors and users, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version. Reports of adverse reactions to counterfeit drugs or increased levels of counterfeiting could materially affect patient confidence in the authentic product. It is possible that adverse events caused by unsafe counterfeit products will mistakenly be attributed to the authentic product. In addition, thefts of inventory at warehouses, plants or while in-transit, which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business. Public loss of confidence in the integrity of pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting or theft could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. We are dependent on a small number of suppliers for our raw materials that we use to manufacture our products and interruptions in our supply chain could materially and adversely affect our business. We typically purchase the ingredients, other materials and supplies that we use in the manufacturing of our products, as well as certain finished products, from a small number of foreign and domestic suppliers. The FDA requires identification of raw material suppliers in applications for approval of drug products. If raw materials were unavailable from a specified supplier or the supplier was not in compliance with FDA or other applicable requirements, the FDA approval of a new supplier could delay the manufacture of the drug involved. As a result, there is no guarantee we will always have timely and sufficient access to a required raw material or other product. In addition, some materials used in our products are currently available from only one supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Generally, we would need as much as 18 months to find and qualify a new sole-source supplier. If we receive less than one year’s termination notice from a sole-source supplier that it intends to cease supplying raw materials, it could result in disruption of our ability to produce the drug involved. Further, a significant portion of our raw materials may be available only from foreign sources. Foreign sources can be subject to the special risks of doing business abroad, including: · greater possibility for disruption due to transportation or communication problems; · the relative instability of some foreign governments and economies; · interim price volatility based on labor unrest, materials or equipment shortages, export duties, restrictions on the transfer of funds, or fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and · uncertainty regarding recourse to a dependable legal system for the enforcement of contracts and other rights. Those of our raw materials that are available from a limited number of suppliers are Bendroflumethiazide, Chloroquine, Colestipol, Demeclocycline, Digoxin, Flavoxate, Methyltestosterone, Nadolol, Orphenadrine, Terbutaline and Klucel, all of which are active pharmaceutical ingredients except Klucel, which is an excipient used in several product formulations. The manufacturers of two of these products, Formosa Laboratories, Ltd. and a division of Ashland, Inc., are sole-source suppliers. While none of the active ingredients is individually significant to our business, the excipient, while not covered by a supply agreement, is utilized in a number of significant products, it is manufactured for a number of industrial applications and supplies have been readily available. Only one of the active ingredients is covered by a long-term supply agreement and, while we have experienced occasional interruptions in supplies, none has had a material effect on our operations. Many third-party suppliers are subject to governmental regulation and, accordingly, we are dependent on the regulatory compliance of these third parties. We also depend on the strength, enforceability and terms of our various contracts with these third-party suppliers. We also rely on complex shipping arrangements throughout the various facilities of our supply chain spectrum. Customs clearance and shipping by land, air or sea routes rely on and may be affected by factors that are not in our full control or are hard to predict. Any inability to obtain raw materials on a timely basis, or any significant price increases which cannot be passed on to customers, could have a material adverse effect on us. 34 Certain of our products use controlled substances, the availability of which may be limited by the DEA and other regulatory agencies. We utilize controlled substances in certain of our current products and products in development and therefore must meet the requirements of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and the related regulations administered by the DEA in the U.S. as well as similar laws in other countries where we operate. These laws relate to the manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use of controlled substances. The DEA and other regulatory agencies limit the availability of the active ingredients used in certain of our current products and products in development and, as a result, our procurement quota of these active ingredients may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. We must annually apply to the DEA and other regulatory agencies for procurement quota in order to obtain these substances. Any delay or refusal by the DEA or such regulatory agencies in establishing our procurement quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches, or could cause trade inventory disruptions for those products that have already been launched, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may be subject to disruptions or failures in our information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on our business. We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and network infrastructures to operate our business. We also hold data in various data center facilities upon which our business depends. A disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, system implementations or upgrades, computer viruses, third-party security breaches, employee error, theft or misuse, malfeasance, power disruptions, natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security, loss of intellectual property and critical data and the release and misappropriation of sensitive competitive information. Any of these events could result in the loss of key information, impair our production and supply chain processes, harm our competitive position, cause us to incur significant costs to remedy any damages and ultimately materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. While we have implemented a number of protective measures, including firewalls, antivirus, patches, data encryption, log monitors, routine back-ups with offsite retention of storage media, system audits, data partitioning, routine password modifications and disaster recovery procedures, such measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent or fully address the adverse effect of such events. We may be adversely affected by alliance, collaboration, supply, or license and distribution agreements we enter into with other companies. We have entered into several alliance, collaboration, supply or license and distribution agreements with respect to certain of our products and services and may enter into similar agreements in the future. These arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates, or to grant licenses on terms that ultimately may prove to be unfavorable to us. Relationships with alliance partners may also include risks due to regulatory requirements, incomplete marketplace information, inventories, and commercial strategies of our partners, and our agreements may be the subject of contractual disputes. If we or our partners are not successful in commercializing the products covered by the agreements, such commercial failure could adversely affect our business. Pursuant to a license and distribution agreement with an unrelated third party pharmaceutical company, we are dependent on such company to supply us with product that we market and sell, and we may enter into similar agreements in the future. Any delay or interruption in the supply of product under such agreements could curtail or delay our product shipment and adversely affect our revenues, as well as jeopardize our relationships with our customers. 35 We depend on qualified scientific and technical employees and are increasingly dependent on our direct sales force, and our limited resources may make it more difficult to attract and retain these personnel. Because of the specialized scientific nature of our business, we are highly dependent upon our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified scientific and technical personnel. We are not aware of any pending, significant losses of scientific or technical personnel. Loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, key scientific and technical personnel, however, would be significantly detrimental to our product-development programs. As a result of our small size and limited financial and other resources, it may be difficult for us to attract and retain qualified officers and qualified scientific and technical personnel. In addition, marketing of the Zomig® products pursuant to our Distribution, License, Development and Supply Agreement with AstraZeneca and future marketing of any internally developed branded products approved by the FDA requires and will continue to require much greater use of a direct sales force compared to marketing of our Global products. Our ability to realize significant revenues from marketing and sales activities depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified sales personnel. Competition for qualified sales personnel is intense. Any failure to attract or retain qualified sales personnel or to enter into third party arrangements on favorable terms for a contract sales force could negatively impact our sales revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers and certain other key employees. Under the employment agreements, the employee may terminate his or her employment upon 60 days prior written notice to us. All of our other key personnel are employed on an at-will basis with no formal employment agreements. We purchase a life insurance policy as an employee benefit for Dr. Hsu, but do not maintain “Key Man” life insurance on any executives. 36 We are subject to significant costs and uncertainties related to compliance with the extensive regulations that govern the manufacturing, labeling, distribution, and promotion of pharmaceutical products as well as environmental, safety and health regulations. The manufacturing, distribution, processing, formulation, packaging, labeling and advertising of our products are subject to extensive regulation by federal agencies, including the FDA, DEA, FTC, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Environmental Protection Agency, among others. We are also subject to state and local laws, regulations and agencies in California, Pennsylvania and elsewhere, as well as the laws and regulations of Taiwan. Compliance with these regulations requires substantial expenditures of time, money and effort in such areas as production and quality control to ensure full technical compliance. Failure to comply with FDA and other governmental regulations can result in fines, disgorgement, unanticipated compliance expenditures, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, suspension of the FDA’s review of NDAs or ANDAs, enforcement actions, injunctions and civil or criminal prosecution. For instance, in 2012, we conducted a voluntary market withdrawal of our bupropion XL 300 mg product, which we manufactured and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. marketed, after the FDA determined that the product was not therapeutically equivalent to the referenced listed drug, Wellbutrin XL® 300 mg. As discussed above, we received a warning letter in late May 2011 from the FDA related to an on-site FDA inspection of our Hayward, California manufacturing facility conducted between December 13, 2010 and January 21, 2011 and a Form 483 from the FDA during the quarter ended March 21, 2012 after the FDA completed a re-inspection of our Hayward manufacturing facility in connection with the warning letter and a general GMP inspection. We have taken a number of steps to thoroughly review our quality control and manufacturing systems and standards and are working with several third-party experts to assist us with our review. This work is ongoing and we are committed to improving our quality control and manufacturing practices. We cannot be assured, however, that the FDA will be satisfied with our corrective actions and as such, we cannot be assured of when the warning letter will be closed out. Unless and until the warning letter is closed out, it is possible we may be subject to additional regulatory action by the FDA as a result of the current or future FDA observations, including, among others, monetary sanctions or penalties, product recalls or seizure, injunctions, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, and suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals. Additionally, the FDA has withheld and may continue to withhold approval of pending drug applications listing our Hayward, California facility as a manufacturing location of finished dosage forms until these FDA observations are resolved. Other federal agencies and our customers may take the warning letter into account when considering the award of contracts. Any such actions could significantly disrupt our business and harm our reputation, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, business, results of operations and financial condition. With respect, to environmental, safety and health laws and regulations, we cannot accurately predict the outcome or timing of future expenditures that we may be required to make in order to comply with such laws as they apply to our operations and facilities. We are also subject to potential liability for the remediation of contamination associated with both present and past hazardous waste generation, handling, and disposal activities. We are subject periodically to environmental compliance reviews by environmental, safety, and health regulatory agencies. Environmental laws are subject to change and we may become subject to stricter environmental standards in the future and face larger capital expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws. 37 We may experience reductions in the levels of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products by governmental authorities, HMOs or other third-party payers. Any such reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Various governmental authorities and private health insurers and other organizations, such as HMOs, provide reimbursement to consumers for the cost of certain pharmaceutical products. Demand for our products depends in part on the extent to which such reimbursement is available. In addition, third-party payers are attempting to control costs by limiting the level of reimbursement for medical products, including pharmaceuticals, and increasingly challenge the pricing of these products which may adversely affect the pricing of our products. Moreover, health care reform has been, and is expected to continue to be, an area of national and state focus, which could result in the adoption of measures that could adversely affect the pricing of pharmaceuticals or the amount of reimbursement available from third-party payers for our products. Reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid rebate program and other government programs are complex, and failure to comply could result in sanctions and penalties or we could be required to reimburse the government for underpayments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Medicaid and other government reporting and payment obligations are highly complex and somewhat ambiguous. State attorneys general and the U.S. Department of Justice have brought suits or instituted investigations against a number of other pharmaceutical companies for failure to comply with Medicaid and other government reporting obligations. Our methodologies for making these calculations are complex and the judgments involved require us to make subjective decisions, such that these calculations are subject to the risk of errors. Government agencies may impose civil or criminal sanctions, including fines, penalties and possible exclusion from federal health care programs, including Medicaid and Medicare. Any such penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Legislative or regulatory programs that may influence prices of prescription drugs could have a material adverse effect on our business. Current or future federal or state laws and regulations may influence the prices of drugs and, therefore, could adversely affect the prices that we receive for our products. Programs in existence in certain states seek to set prices of all drugs sold within those states through the regulation and administration of the sale of prescription drugs. Expansion of these programs, in particular, state Medicaid programs, or changes required in the way in which Medicaid rebates are calculated under such programs, could adversely affect the price we receive for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Decreases in health care reimbursements could limit our ability to sell our products or decrease our revenues. 38 Our failure to comply with the legal and regulatory requirements governing the healthcare industry may result in substantial fines, sanctions and restrictions on our business activities. Our practices and activities related to the sales and marketing of our products, as well as the pricing of our products, are subject to extensive regulation under U.S. federal and state healthcare statutes and regulations intended to combat fraud and abuse to federal and state healthcare payment programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, Tri-Care, CHAMPUS, and Department of Defense programs. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and similar state laws and implementing regulations. For example, the payment of any incentive to a healthcare provider to induce the recommendation of our product or the purchase of our products reimbursable under a federal or state program would be considered a prohibited promotional practice under these laws. Similarly, the inaccurate reporting of prices leading to inflated reimbursement rates would also be considered a violation of these laws. These laws and regulations are enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, state Medicaid Fraud Units and other state enforcement agencies. Violations of these laws and regulations are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including substantial fines and penal sanctions, such as imprisonment. It is common for enforcement agencies to initiate investigations into sales and marketing practices, as well as pricing practices, regardless of merit. These types of investigations and any related litigation can result in: (i) large expenditures of cash for legal fees, payment for penalties, and compliance activities; (ii) limitations on operations, (iii) diversion of management resources, (iv) injury to our reputation and (v) decreased demand for our products. While we believe that our practices and activities related to sales and marketing, and the pricing of our products, are in compliance with these fraud and abuse laws, the criteria for compliance are often complex and subject to change and interpretation. An investigation by an enforcement agency could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 39 We have entered into, and anticipate entering into, contracts with various U.S. government agencies. Unfavorable provisions in government contracts, some of which may be customary, may harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Government contracts customarily contain provisions that give the government substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including provisions that allow the government to: · suspend or debar the contractor from doing business with the government or a specific government agency; · terminate existing contracts, in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason; · reduce the scope and value of contracts; · change certain terms and conditions in contracts; · claim rights to products, including intellectual property, developed under the contract; · take actions that result in a longer development timeline than expected; · direct the course of a development program in a manner not chosen by the government contractor; · audit and object to the contractor’s contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs; and · control and potentially prohibit the export of the contractor’s products. Generally, government contracts contain provisions permitting unilateral termination or modification, in whole or in part, at the government’s convenience. Under general principles of government contracting law, if the government terminates a contract for convenience, the terminated company may recover only its incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the government terminates a contract for default, the defaulting company is entitled to recover costs incurred and associated profits on accepted items only and may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items from another source. Some government contracts grant the government the right to use, for or on behalf of the U.S. government, any technologies developed by the contractor under the government contract. If we were to develop technology under a contract with such a provision, we might not be able to prohibit third parties, including our competitors, from using that technology in providing products and services to the government. As a government contractor, we may also become subject to periodic audits and reviews. As part of any such audit or review, the government may review the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies, including those relating to our purchasing, property, compensation and/or management information systems. In addition, if an audit or review uncovers any improper or illegal activity, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of our contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the government. We could also suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us. 40 Legislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system in the United States may harm our future business. Healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade. On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act” (P.L. 111-148) and on March 30, 2010, the President signed the "Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act" (P.L. 111-152), collectively commonly referred to as the “Healthcare Reform Law” which, among other things, requires most individuals to have health insurance, effective January 1, 2014, establishes new regulations on health plans (with the earliest changes for certain benefits beginning with plan years commencing after September 23, 2010), creates insurance exchanges (effective January 2014) and imposes new requirements and changes in reimbursement or funding for healthcare providers, device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies (with the earliest changes effective on March 23, 2010) and other changes staged in thereafter. The Healthcare Reform Law imposes additional requirements and obligations upon our company, which, to a certain extent, will depend upon the mix of products we sell. These changes include, among other things: · revisions to the Medicaid rebate program by: (a) increasing the rebate percentage for branded drugs dispensed after December 31, 2009 to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price ("AMP"), with limited exceptions, (b) increasing the rebate for outpatient generic, multiple source drugs dispensed after December 31, 2009 to 13% of AMP; (c) changing the definition of AMP; and (d) extending the Medicaid rebate program effective January 1, 2011 to Medicaid managed care plans, with limited exception; · the imposition of annual fees upon manufacturers or importers of branded prescription drugs, which fees will be in amounts determined by the Secretary of Treasury based upon market share and other data; · providing a 50% discount on brand-name prescriptions filled in the Medicare Part D coverage gap beginning in 2011; · imposing increased penalties for the violation of fraud and abuse laws and funding for anti-fraud activities; and · creating a new pathway for approval of biosimilar biological products and granting an exclusivity period of 12 years for branded drug manufacturers of biological products before biosimilar products can be approved for marketing in the U.S.; and · expands the definition of “covered entities” that purchase certain outpatient drugs in the 340B Drug Pricing Program of Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act. While the aforementioned Healthcare Reform Law may increase the number of patients who have insurance coverage for our products, such insurance mandate does not commence until January 2014, and the Healthcare Reform Law also restructures payments to Medicare managed care plans and reduces reimbursements to many institutional customers. Accordingly, the timing on the insurance mandate, the change in the Medicaid rebate levels, the additional fees imposed upon our company if it markets branded drugs, other compliance obligations, and the reduced reimbursement levels to institutional customers may result in a loss of revenue and could adversely affect our business. In addition, the Healthcare Reform Law contemplates the promulgation of significant future regulatory action which may also further affect our business. We depend on our intellectual property, and our future success is dependent on our ability to protect our intellectual property and not infringe on the rights of others. We believe intellectual property protection is important to our business and that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing on the rights of others. We cannot assure you that: · any of our future processes or products will be patentable; · our processes or products will not infringe upon the patents of third parties; or · we will have the resources to defend against charges of patent infringement by third parties or to protect our own rights against infringement by third parties. We rely on trade secrets and proprietary knowledge related to our products and technology which we generally seek to protect by confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with employees, consultants, licensees and pharmaceutical companies. If these agreements are breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and our trade secrets may otherwise become known by our competitors. 41 We are subject to potential product liability claims that can result in substantial litigation costs and liability. The design, development and manufacture of pharmaceutical products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity. Product liability insurance coverage is expensive, difficult to obtain, and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. Although we currently carry $50.0 million of such insurance, we believe that no reasonable amount of insurance can fully protect against all such risks because of the potential liability inherent in the business of producing pharmaceutical products for human consumption. We face risks relating to our goodwill and intangibles. At December 31, 2012, our goodwill, which was originally generated as a result of the December 1999 merger of Global Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Impax Pharmaceuticals, Inc., was approximately $27.6 million, or approximately 3% of our total assets, and the carrying value of our intangible assets, composed primarily of the Zomig® and Tolmar product rights acquired by us pursuant to the AZ Agreement and the Tolmar Agreement, respectively, was approximately $48.0 million, or approximately 6% of our total assets. We may never realize the value of our goodwill and intangibles. We will continue to evaluate, on a regular basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred to indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets may no longer be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary. Although as of December 31, 2012, the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets was not impaired based on our assessment performed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”), any such future determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of the carrying value of our goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Changes in tax regulations and varying application and interpretations of these regulations could result in an increase in our existing and future tax liabilities. We have potential tax exposures resulting from the varying application of statutes, regulations and interpretations, including exposures with respect to manufacturing, research and development, marketing, sales and distribution functions. Although our arrangements are based on accepted tax standards, tax authorities in various jurisdictions including the United States may disagree with and subsequently challenge the amount of profits taxed, which may increase our tax liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of our operations and financial condition. If we are unable to manage our growth, our business will suffer. We have experienced rapid growth in the past several years and anticipate continued rapid expansion in the future. The number of our ANDAs pending approval at the FDA has increased from 24 at December 31, 2008 to 50 at February 8, 2013. This growth has required us to expand, upgrade, and improve our administrative, operational, and management systems, internal controls and resources. We anticipate additional growth in connection with the expansion of our manufacturing operations, development of our brand-name products, and our marketing and sales efforts for the products we develop. Although we cannot assure you that we will, in fact, grow as we expect, if we fail to manage growth effectively or to develop a successful marketing approach, our business and financial results will be materially harmed. We may also seek to expand our business through complementary or strategic acquisitions of other businesses, products or assets, or through joint ventures, strategic agreements or other arrangements. Any such acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations may involve significant integration challenges, operational complexities and time consumption and require substantial resources and effort. It may also disrupt our ongoing businesses, which may adversely affect our relationships with customers, employees, regulators and others with whom we have business or other dealings. Further, if we are unable to realize synergies or other benefits expected to result from any acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations, or to generate additional revenue to offset any unanticipated inability to realize these expected synergies or benefits, our growth and ability to compete may be impaired, which would require us to focus additional resources on the integration of operations rather than other profitable areas of our business, and may otherwise cause a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 42 We may make acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary technologies, businesses or products, which may be on terms that are not commercially advantageous, may require additional debt or equity financing, and may involve numerous risks, including the risks that we may be unable to integrate the acquired business successfully and that we may assume liabilities that adversely affect us. We regularly review the potential acquisition of technologies, products, product rights and complementary businesses. We may choose to enter into such transactions at any time. Nonetheless, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates. To the extent that we do identify candidates that we believe to be suitable, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to make such acquisitions or investments on commercially advantageous terms or at all. If we make any acquisitions or investments, we may finance such acquisitions or investments through our cash reserves, debt financing, or by issuing additional equity securities, which could dilute the holdings of our then-existing stockholders. If we require financing, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain required financing when needed on acceptable terms or at all. Any such acquisitions or investments could also result in an increase in goodwill, intangible assets and amortization expenses that could ultimately negatively impact our profitability. If the fair value of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined at some future date to be less than its recorded value, a charge to earnings may be required. Such a charge could be in an amount that is material to our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in assimilating the personnel, operations and products of the acquired companies, the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns, risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company. There may be overlap between our products or customers and those of an acquired entity that may create conflicts in relationships or other commitments detrimental to the integrated businesses. As a result of acquiring businesses, we may incur significant transaction costs, including substantial fees for investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and financial printing. Any acquisition could result in our assumption of unknown and/or unexpected, perhaps material liabilities. Additionally, in any acquisition agreement, the negotiated representations, warranties and agreements of the selling parties may not entirely protect us, and liabilities resulting from any breaches could exceed negotiated indemnity limitations. 43 The terms of our revolving credit facility impose financial and operating restrictions on us. We have a revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $50 million. Our revolving credit facility contains a number of negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities. These covenants limit or restrict, among other things, our ability to: · incur additional indebtedness and grant liens on assets; · make certain investments and restricted payments (including the ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock); · undertake certain acquisitions or sell certain assets; and · enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. These limitations and restrictions may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests. Further, the revolving credit facility subjects us to various financial covenants which require us to maintain certain levels of debt ratios and limit our capital expenditures. Our ability to borrow under the revolving bank facility is subject to compliance with the negative and financial covenants. If we breach any of the covenants in our revolving credit facility, we may be in default under our revolving credit facility. If we default, our borrowings under the revolving credit facility could be declared due and payable, including accrued interest and other fees. There are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Any future changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions used or necessary revisions to prior estimates, judgments or assumptions could lead to a restatement of our results. The consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance with GAAP. This involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets (including intangible assets), liabilities, revenues, expenses and income. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future and any necessary revisions to prior estimates, judgments or assumptions could lead to a restatement. Any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets (including goodwill and other intangible assets), liabilities, revenues, expenses and income. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, timely file our periodic reports, maintain our reporting status or prevent fraud. Our management or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. The existence of internal control material weaknesses may result in current and potential stockholders and alliance and collaboration agreements’ partners losing confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business, the market price of our common stock, and our ability to retain our current, or obtain new, alliance and collaboration agreements’ partners. In addition, the existence of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may affect our ability to timely file periodic reports under the Exchange Act. Although we remedied any past accounting issues and do not believe similar accounting problems are likely to recur, an internal control material weakness may develop in the future and affect our ability to timely file our periodic reports. The inability to timely file periodic reports under the Exchange Act could result in the SEC revoking the registration of our common stock, which would prohibit us from listing or having our stock quoted on any public market. This would have an adverse effect on our business and stock price by limiting the publicly available information regarding us and greatly reducing the ability of our stockholders to sell or trade our common stock. 44 Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may adversely affect our business. Terrorist attacks at or nearby our facilities in Hayward, California, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or our manufacturing facility in Taiwan may negatively affect our operations. While we do not believe that we are more susceptible to such attacks than other companies, such attacks could directly affect our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers and could make the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive and ultimately affect our sales. We carry insurance coverage on our facilities of types and in amounts that we believe are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties. We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market in general and the scope and cost of coverage for acts of terrorism in particular, but we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. Currently, we carry terrorism insurance as part of our property and casualty and business interruption coverage. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged facilities, as well as the anticipated future net sales from those facilities. Because of the location of our manufacturing and research and development facilities, our operations could be interrupted by an earthquake or be susceptible to climate changes. Our corporate headquarters in California, manufacturing operations in California and Taiwan, and research and development activities related to process technologies are located near major earthquake fault lines. Although we have other facilities, we produce a substantial portion of our products at our California facility. A disruption at these California facilities due to an earthquake, other natural disaster, or due to climate changes, even on a short-term basis, could impair our ability to produce and ship products to the market on a timely basis. In addition, we could experience a destruction of facilities which would be costly to rebuild, or loss of life, all of which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. We presently carry $10.0 million of earthquake coverage which covers all of our facilities on a worldwide basis. We carry an additional $40.0 million of earthquake coverage specifically for our California facilities. We believe the aggregate amount of earthquake coverage we currently carry is appropriate in light of the risks; however, the amount of our earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses from earthquakes. We may discontinue some or all of this insurance coverage in the future if the cost of premiums exceeds the value of the coverage discounted for the risk of loss. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged facilities, as well as the anticipated future net sales from those facilities. 45 Item 1B.
