Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Please note additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business and operations. Risks Associated with Real Estate, Real Estate Capital, and Credit Markets Volatility in capital and credit markets could adversely impact us. The capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption, which has caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably and made it more difficult to borrow money. If current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, we may not be able to obtain new debt financing or refinance our existing debt on favorable terms or at all, which would adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to make distributions to shareholders. This market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased lack of consumer confidence and widespread reduction of business activity generally, which have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact us, including our ability to acquire and dispose of assets and continue our development pipeline. We could be negatively impacted by the condition of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily rental real estate. We and other multifamily companies depend heavily on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to finance growth by purchasing apartment loans. In September 2008, the U.S. government assumed control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and placed both companies into a government conservatorship under the recently created Federal Housing Finance Agency. The U.S. government has not determined which of Fannie Maes and Freddie Macs businesses to retain and which to dissolve. A decision by the government to reduce Fannie Maes or Freddie Macs acquisitions of apartment loans could adversely affect interest rates, capital availability, and the development of multifamily communities. Governmental actions could also make it easier for individuals to finance loans for single-family homes, which would make renting a less attractive option and adversely affect our occupancy or rental rates. 3 Table of Contents Unfavorable changes in economic conditions could adversely impact occupancy or rental rates. Weakened economic conditions, including decreased job growth and job losses, have affected and continue to significantly affect apartment home occupancy and rental rates. Significant decreases in occupancy or rental rates in the markets in which we operate, in turn, may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and operating results. The risks which may affect conditions in these markets include the following:  changes in the national, regional, and local economic climates;  local conditions, such as an oversupply of apartments or other housing available for rent, or a reduction in demand for apartments in the area;  a continued economic downturn which simultaneously effects one or more of our geographical markets; and  increased operating costs, if these costs cannot be passed through to residents. We may experience a decrease in rental revenues, an increase in operating expenses, or a combination of both, which may adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and to pay distributions to shareholders. We face risks associated with land holdings. We hold land for future development and may in the future acquire additional land holdings. The risks inherent in owning or purchasing and developing land increase as demand for apartments, or rental rates, decrease. Real estate markets are highly uncertain and, as a result, the value of undeveloped land has fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate as a result of changing market conditions. In addition, carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or reduced margins in a poorly performing project. As a result, we hold certain land and may in the future acquire additional land in our development pipeline at a cost we may not be able to recover fully or on which we cannot build and develop into a profitable multifamily community. Also, real estate markets are highly uncertain and, as a result, the value of undeveloped land has fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate as a result of changing market conditions. Under current market conditions, we have recorded impairment charges on certain of our land held for development and may have future impairments of our land. These impairment charges are based on estimates of fair value. Given the current environment, the amount of market information available to estimate fair value is less than usual; if additional market information becomes available in future periods we may take additional impairment charges in the future. Difficulties of selling real estate could limit our flexibility. We intend to evaluate the potential disposition of assets that may no longer help us meet our objectives. When we decide to sell an asset, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers in a timely manner as real estate investments generally cannot be disposed of quickly, especially when market conditions are poor. These difficulties have been exacerbated in the current credit environment because buyers have experienced difficulty in obtaining the necessary financing. These factors may limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions and may also limit our ability to utilize sales proceeds as a source of liquidity, which would adversely affect our ability to make distributions to shareholders or repay debt. In addition, in order to maintain our status as a REIT, the Code imposes restrictions on our ability to sell properties held fewer than two years, which may cause us to incur losses thereby reducing our cash flows and adversely impacting our ability to make distributions to shareholders or repay debt. 4 Table of Contents Compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHAA), and other federal, state, and local laws generally require public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants. These laws may require us to modify our existing properties. These laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features which increase our construction costs. Legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons. We may incur unanticipated expenses which may be material to our financial condition or results of operations to comply with ADA, FHAA, and other federal, state, and local laws, or in connection with lawsuits brought by private litigants. Competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rental income. There are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our properties in attracting residents. Our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums and single family homes which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located. This competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property, as well as on the rents charged. Risks Associated with Our Operations Development and construction risks could impact our profitability. Although we expect decreasing levels of development activity in 2009, as compared to prior years, in the long term we intend to continue to develop and construct multifamily apartment communities for our property portfolio. Our development and construction activities may be exposed to a number of risks which may increase our construction costs including the following:  inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other required permits and authorizations, or problems with subcontractors could result in increased costs;  incurring construction costs exceeding our original estimates due to increased materials, labor, or other costs, or due to errors and omissions which occur in the design or construction process;  experiencing fluctuations in occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property which may not be adequate to make the property profitable;  inability to obtain financing with favorable terms for the development of a community;  inability to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, resulting in increased costs;  incurring costs related to the abandonment of development opportunities which we have pursued and deemed unfeasible; and  inability to successfully implement our development and construction strategy could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to shareholders. We also serve as the general contractor on a limited number of development and construction projects related to properties owned by unrelated third parties pursuant to guaranteed maximum price contracts. The terms of these contracts require us to estimate the time and costs to complete a project, and we assume the risk the time and costs associated with our performance may be greater than was anticipated. As a result, our profitability on guaranteed maximum price contracts is dependent on our ability to accurately predict these factors. The time and costs may be affected by a variety of factors, including those listed above, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, the terms of these contracts generally require a warranty period, which may have a duration of up to ten years, during which we may be required to repair, replace, or rebuild a project in the event of a material defect. 5 Table of Contents Our acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected. Subject to the requirements of the Funds, we may acquire additional operating properties on a select basis. Our acquisition activities are subject to a number of risks, including the following:  we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired properties into our existing operations;  our estimates of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping the acquired property may prove inaccurate;  the expected occupancy and rental rates may differ from the actual results; and  we may not be able to obtain adequate financing. With respect to acquisitions of operating companies, we may not be able to identify suitable candidates on terms acceptable to us, or may not achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of integration challenges, such as personnel and technology. Competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties. We expect other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, private investors, and other apartment REITs, will compete with us to acquire new properties. This competition could increase prices for the type of properties we would likely pursue and adversely affect our ability to acquire these properties or the profitability of such properties upon acquisition. Losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage. We carry comprehensive property and liability insurance on our properties, which we believe is of the type and amount customarily obtained on similar real property assets. We intend to obtain similar coverage for properties we acquire or develop in the future. However, some losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as losses from floods, hurricanes, or earthquakes, may be subject to coverage limitations. We exercise our discretion in determining amounts, coverage limits, and deductible provisions of insurance, to maintain appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms. If we suffer a substantial loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations, and other factors also may reduce the feasibility of using insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed. Investments through joint ventures and partnerships involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole investor. We have invested and may continue to invest as a partner in joint ventures or partnerships. These investments involve risks, including the possibility our partner may have business goals which are inconsistent with ours, be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our requests, or become insolvent and require us to assume and fulfill the joint ventures or partnerships financial obligations. We and our partner may each have the right to initiate a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partners interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have entered into such a transaction. Each joint venture or partnership agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement. We face risks associated with investments in and management of discretionary funds. We have formed the Funds which, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, we manage as the general partner and advisor and to which we have committed 20% of the total equity interest, up to $75 million in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2008, the Funds had total capital commitments of $375 million. There are risks associated with the investment in and management of the Funds, including the following:  investors in the Funds may fail to make their capital contributions when due and, as a result, the Funds may be unable to execute their investment objectives;  the general partner of the Funds, our wholly-owned subsidiary, has unlimited liability for the third-party debts, obligations, and liabilities of the Funds pursuant to general partnership law; 6 Table of Contents  investors in the Funds (other than us), by majority vote, may remove our subsidiary as the general partner of the Funds with or without cause and the Funds advisory boards, by a majority vote of their members, may remove our subsidiary as the general partner of the Funds at any time for cause;  while we have broad discretion to manage the Funds and make investment decisions on behalf of the Funds, the investors or the advisory committees must approve certain matters, and as a result we may be unable to cause the Funds to make certain investments or implement certain decisions we consider beneficial;  we are permitted to acquire land and develop communities but are generally prohibited from acquiring fully developed multifamily properties outside of the Funds until the earlier of (i) December 31, 2011 or (ii) such time as 90% of the Funds committed capital is invested, subject to certain exceptions;  our ability to redeem all or a portion of our investments in the Funds is subject to significant restrictions; and  we may be liable if the Funds fail to comply with various tax or other regulatory matters. We depend on our key personnel. Our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel. There is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry, and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us. Changes in laws and litigation risks could affect our business. As a large publicly-traded owner of multifamily properties, we may become involved in legal proceedings, including consumer, employment, tort, or commercial litigation, which if decided adversely to or settled by us, could result in liability which is material to our financial condition or results of operations. Tax matters, including failure to qualify as a REIT, could have adverse consequences. We may not continue to qualify in the future as a REIT. The Internal Revenue Service may challenge our qualification as a REIT for prior years and new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions may change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT or the federal tax consequences of such qualification. For any taxable year we fail to qualify as a REIT and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions:  we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, including any applicable alternative minimum tax;  we would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify, thereby reducing our net earnings available for operations, including any distributions to shareholders, as we would be required to pay significant income taxes for the year or years involved; and  our ability to expand our business and raise capital would be impaired, which may adversely affect the value of our common shares. We may face other tax liabilities in the future which may impact our cash flow. These potential tax liabilities may be calculated on our income or property at either the corporate or individual property levels. Any additional tax expense incurred would decrease the cash available for distribution to our shareholders. 7 Table of Contents Risks Associated with Our Indebtedness and Financing Insufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders. Substantially all of our income is derived from rental and other income from our multifamily communities. As a result, our performance depends in large part on our ability to collect rent from residents which could be negatively affected by a number of factors, including the following:  delay in resident lease commencements;  decline in occupancy;  failure of residents to make rental payments when due;  the attractiveness of our properties to residents and potential residents;  our ability to adequately manage and maintain our properties;  competition from other available apartments and housing alternatives; and  changes in market rents. Cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest with respect to debt financing. In order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT we are required to distribute annual dividends equal to a minimum of 90% of our REIT taxable income, computed without regards to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains. This requirement limits the cash flow available to meet required principal payments on our debt. We have significant debt, which could have important adverse consequences. As of December 31, 2008, we had outstanding debt of approximately $2.8 billion. This indebtedness could have important consequences, including:  if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness, and if we are unable to meet our mortgage obligations, we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the mortgage;  our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions is increased; and  our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in business and industry is limited. The mortgages on our properties subject to secured debt, our unsecured credit facility, and the indentures under which our unsecured debt was issued contain customary restrictions, requirements, and other limitations, as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios. Maintaining compliance with these provisions could limit our financial flexibility. A default in these provisions, if uncured, could require us to repay the indebtedness, which could severely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs. We may be unable to renew, repay, or refinance our outstanding debt. We are subject to the risk that indebtedness on our properties, or unsecured indebtedness, will not be able to be renewed, repaid, or refinanced when due or the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all, we might be forced to dispose of one or more of the properties on disadvantageous terms, which might result in losses to us. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt. Furthermore, if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property, appoint a receiver and exercise rights under an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies, all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value. Foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds, thereby hindering our ability to meet the REIT distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. 8 Table of Contents Variable rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. We have mortgage debt with varying interest rates dependent upon various market indexes. In addition, we have a revolving credit facility bearing interest at a variable rate on all amounts drawn on the facility. We may incur additional variable rate debt in the future. Increases in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase our interest expense, unless we make arrangements which hedge the risk of rising interest rates, which would adversely affect net income and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to shareholders. We may incur losses on interest rate hedging arrangements. Periodically, we have entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated with changes in interest rates, and we may continue to do so in the future. Although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates, they may also reduce the benefits to us if interest rates decline. If a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness which is hedged, we may be exposed to losses to the extent which the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other. Additionally, nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject us to increased credit risks. Issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our financial condition. Our capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including the occupancy rates of our apartment properties, dividend payment rates to our shareholders, development and capital expenditures, costs of operations, and potential acquisitions. If our capital requirements vary materially from our plans, we may require additional financing earlier than anticipated. Accordingly, we could become more leveraged, resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in our debt service requirements, both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future. Failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. Moodys and Standard & Poors, the major debt rating agencies, routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings of Baa1 and BBB+, respectively, on our senior unsecured debt. These ratings are based on a number of factors, which include their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. In light of the difficulties in the real estate industry and the volatile financial markets, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. Risks Associated with Our Shares Share ownership limits and our ability to issue additional equity securities may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders. For us to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must have 100 or more shareholders during the year and not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals. As defined for federal income tax purposes, the term individuals includes a number of specified entities. To minimize the possibility of us failing to qualify as a REIT under this test, our declaration of trust includes restrictions on transfers of our shares and ownership limits. The ownership limits, as well as our ability to issue other classes of equity securities, may delay, defer, or prevent a change in control. These provisions may also deter tender offers for our common shares which may be attractive to you, or limit your opportunity to receive a premium for your shares which might otherwise exist if a third party were attempting to effect a change in control transaction. 9 Table of Contents Our share price will fluctuate. Stock markets in general and our common shares have experienced significant price volatility over the past year. The market price and volume of our common shares may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to the risk factors discussed in this report and the following:  operating results which vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;  investor interest in our property portfolio;  the reputation and performance of REITs;  the attractiveness of REITs as compared to other investment vehicles;  the results of our financial condition and operations;  the perception of our growth and earnings potential;  dividend payment rates;  increases in market rates, which may lead purchasers of our common shares to demand a higher yield; and  changes in financial markets and national economic and general market conditions. We may reduce dividends on our equity securities or elect to pay a portion of the dividend in common shares. On November 24, 2008, we announced our Board of Trust Managers had declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.70 per common share, totaling $2.80 per share for the year ended December 31, 2008. In order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT we are required to distribute annual dividends equal to a minimum of 90% of our REIT taxable income, computed without regards to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains. However, in the event of, among other factors, continued material future deterioration in business conditions, or continuing tightening in the credit markets, our Board of Trust Managers may decide to reduce our dividend while ensuring compliance with the requirements of the Code related to REIT qualification. In December 2008, the Internal Revenue Service announced it would treat a cash option share dividend as satisfying a public REITs distribution requirements for 2008 and 2009 so long as certain requirements are met. We may elect to pay dividends during this period in part in our common shares which would cause dilution to our earnings per share given the additional shares outstanding. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties The Properties Our properties typically consist of mid-rise buildings or two and three story buildings in a landscaped setting and provide residents with a variety of amenities. Most of the properties have one or more swimming pools and a clubhouse and many have whirlpool spas, tennis courts, and controlled-access gates. Many of the apartment homes offer additional features such as fireplaces, vaulted ceilings, microwave ovens, covered parking, icemakers, washers and dryers, and ceiling fans. 10 Table of Contents Operating Properties The 181 operating properties, including properties held through joint ventures, which we owned interests in and operated at December 31, 2008, averaged 915 square feet of living area per apartment home. For the year ended December 31, 2008, no single operating property accounted for greater than 2.2% of our total revenues. Our operating properties, including properties held through joint ventures, had a weighted average occupancy rate of 93.9% and 93.7% for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Resident lease terms generally range from six to fifteen months. One hundred and fifty-six of our operating properties have over 200 apartment homes, with the largest having 904 apartment homes. Our operating properties have an average age of 9.6 years (calculated on the basis of investment dollars). Our operating properties were constructed and placed in service as follows: Year Placed in Service Number of Operating Properties 2001-2008 46 1996-2000 57 1991-1995 19 1986-1990 39 1980-1985 15 Prior to 1980 5 11 Table of Contents Property Table The following table sets forth information with respect to our operating properties at December 31, 2008.
