Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Company We have a limited operating history and our historical financial results do not accurately indicate our future performance. Validus Re was formed in October 2005 and was fully operational by December 2005. Talbot was formed in 2002. We, therefore, have a limited operating and financial history. Validus Re began underwriting with risks attaching no earlier than January 1, 2006. It has been reported that among the last 20 years, 2006 has produced the third-lowest level of insured losses, after 1997 and 1988. As of December 31, 2007, Validus Re has not experienced any catastrophe events such as those experienced by the industry in 2004 and 2005. Talbot experienced losses in 2004 and 2005 but was formed following the events of September 11, 2001 thus had no exposure to losses prior to 2002. As a result, we cannot provide assurances as to how our business model or risk controls would respond to such events. There is limited historical financial and operating information available to help evaluate our past performance or make a decision about an investment in our common shares. As a recently formed company, we face substantial business and financial risks and may suffer significant losses. As a result of these risks, it is possible that we may not be successful in the continued implementation of our business strategy or completing the development of the infrastructure necessary to run our business. In addition, particularly as a recently formed company, our business strategy may change and may be affected by acquisitions, joint venture or other business, investment and/or growth opportunities that may, in the future, become available to us or that we may pursue. In the future, we may pursue investments in or acquisitions of companies complementary to our business. There can be no assurance that any such investments or acquisitions will occur, or if such investments or acquisitions do occur, that they will be on terms favorable to us. 21 Table of Contents Claims on policies written under our short-tail insurance lines that arise from unpredictable and severe catastrophic events could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Substantially all of our gross premiums written to date are in short-tail lines, which means we could become liable for a significant amount of losses in a brief period. Short-tail policies expose us to claims arising out of unpredictable natural and other catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, windstorms, tsunamis, severe winter weather, earthquakes, floods, fires, explosions, acts of terrorism and other natural and man-made disasters. Many observers believe that the Atlantic basin is in the active phase of a multi-decade cycle in which conditions in the ocean and atmosphere, including warmer-than-average sea-surface temperatures and low wind shear, enhance hurricane activity. This increase in the number and intensity of tropical storms and hurricanes can span multiple decades (approximately 20 to 30 years). These conditions may translate to a greater potential for hurricanes to make landfall in the U.S. at higher intensities over the next five years. The frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. The extent of losses from catastrophes is a function of both the number and severity of the insured events and the total amount of insured exposure in the areas affected. Increases in the value and concentrations of insured property, the effects of inflation and changes in cyclical weather patterns may increase the severity of claims from catastrophic events in the future. Claims from catastrophic events could reduce our earnings and cause substantial volatility in our results of operations for any fiscal quarter or year, which could adversely affect our financial condition, possibly to the extent of eliminating our shareholders equity. Our ability to write new reinsurance policies could also be affected as a result of corresponding reductions in our capital. Underwriting is inherently a matter of judgment, involving important assumptions about matters that are unpredictable and beyond our control, and for which historical experience and probability analysis may not provide sufficient guidance. One or more catastrophic or other events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations and which would become due in a short period of time, which could materially adversely effect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Emerging claim and coverage issues could adversely affect our business. As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes. For example, a reinsurance contract might limit the amount that can be recovered as a result of flooding. However, if the flood damage was caused by an event that also caused extensive wind damage, the quantification of the two types of damage is often a matter of judgment. Similarly, one geographic zone could be affected by more than one catastrophic event. In this case, the amount recoverable from a reinsurer may in part be determined by the judgmental allocation of damage between the storms. Given the magnitude of the amounts at stake involved with a catastrophic event, these types of issues occasionally necessitate judicial resolution. In addition, our actual losses may vary materially from our current estimate of the loss based on a number of factors, including receipt of additional information from insureds or brokers, the attribution of losses to coverages that had not previously been considered as exposed and inflation in repair costs due to additional demand for labor and materials. As a result, the full extent of liability under an insurance or reinsurance contract may not be known for many years after such contract is issued and a loss occurs. Our exposure to this uncertainty is greater in our longer tail lines (marine and energy liabilities and financial institutions). We depend on ratings from third party rating agencies. Our financial strength rating could be revised downward, which could affect our standing among brokers and customers, cause our premiums and earnings to decrease and limit our ability to pay dividends on the common shares. Third-party rating agencies assess and rate the financial strength of reinsurers based upon criteria established by the rating agencies, which criteria are subject to change. The financial strength ratings assigned by rating agencies to insurance and reinsurance companies represent independent opinions of financial strength and ability to meet policyholder obligations and are not directed toward the protection of investors. Ratings have become an 22 Table of Contents increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies. Insurers and intermediaries use these ratings as one measure by which to assess the financial strength and quality of insurers and reinsurers. These ratings are often a key factor in the decision by an insured or intermediary of whether to place business with a particular insurance or reinsurance provider. These ratings are not an evaluation directed toward the protection of investors or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our common shares. Validus Re was assigned a rating of A− (Excellent) by A.M. Best Company in December 2005, which was affirmed by A.M. Best on August 29, 2007. This rating action followed the Companys closing of the acquisition of Talbot Holdings (Talbot), as well as the Companys completion of its capital raising initiatives, which were necessary to support the risk-adjusted capital position of the Company. Talbots subsidiary, Talbot Underwriting Ltd., which manages Syndicate 1183 at Lloyds, uses the Lloyds rating. On March 7, 2007, A.M. Best Company assigned an issuer credit rating of bbb- to Validus Holdings, Ltd. Lloyds is rated A (Excellent) by A.M. Best and A+ (Strong) by Standard & Poors (S&P). If our financial strength rating is reduced from current levels, our competitive position in the reinsurance industry would suffer, and it would be more difficult for us to market our products. A downgrade could result in a significant reduction in the number of reinsurance contracts we write and in a substantial loss of business as our customers, and brokers that place such business, move to other competitors with higher financial strength ratings. The substantial majority of reinsurance contracts issued through reinsurance brokers contains provisions permitting the ceding company to cancel such contracts in the event of a downgrade of the reinsurer by A.M. Best below A− (Excellent). Consequently, substantially all of our business could be affected by a downgrade of our A.M. Best rating. It is increasingly common for our reinsurance contracts to contain terms that would allow the ceding companies to cancel the contract for the remaining portion of our period of obligation if our financial strength rating is downgraded below A− (Excellent) by A.M. Best. We cannot predict in advance the extent to which this cancellation right would be exercised, if at all, or what effect any such cancellations would have on our financial condition or future operations, but such effect could be material. The indenture governing our Junior Subordinated Deferrable Debentures would restrict us from declaring or paying dividends on our common shares if we are downgraded by A.M. Best to a financial strength rating of B (Fair) or below or if A.M. Best withdraws its financial strength rating on any of our material insurance subsidiaries. A downgrade of the Companys A.M. Best financial strength rating below B++ (Fair) would also constitute an event of default under our credit facilities. Either of these events could, among other things, reduce the Companys financial flexibility. If Validus Res risk management and loss limitation methods fail to adequately manage exposure to losses from catastrophic events, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Validus Re manages exposure to catastrophic losses by analyzing the probability and severity of the occurrence of catastrophic events and the impact of such events on our overall reinsurance and investment portfolio. Validus Re uses various tools to analyze and manage the reinsurance exposures assumed from ceding companies and risks from a catastrophic event that could have an adverse effect on their investment portfolio. VCAPS, a proprietary risk modeling software, enables Validus Re to assess the adequacy of risk pricing and to monitor the overall exposure to risk in correlated geographic zones. VCAPS is new and relatively untested and Validus Re cannot assure the models and assumptions used by the software will accurately predict losses. Further, Validus Re cannot assure that it is free of defects in the modeling logic or in the software code. In addition, Validus Re has not sought copyright or other legal protection for VCAPS. In addition, much of the information that Validus Re enters into the risk modeling software is based on third-party data that they cannot assure to be reliable, as well as estimates and assumptions that are dependent on many variables, such as assumptions about building material and labor demand surge, storm surge, the expenses of settling claims, which are known as loss adjustment expenses, insurance-to-value and storm intensity. Accordingly, if the estimates and assumptions that are entered into the proprietary risk model are incorrect, or if the proprietary risk model proves to be an inaccurate forecasting tool, the losses Validus Re might incur from an actual catastrophe 23 Table of Contents could be materially higher than their expectation of losses generated from modeled catastrophe scenarios, and their financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Validus Re also seeks to limit loss exposure through loss limitation provisions in their policies, such as limitations on the amount of losses that can be claimed under a policy, limitations or exclusions from coverage and provisions relating to choice of forum, which are intended to assure that their policies are legally interpreted as intended. Validus Re cannot assure that these contractual provisions will be enforceable in the manner expected or that disputes relating to coverage will be resolved in their favor. If the loss limitation provisions in the policies are not enforceable or disputes arise concerning the application of such provisions, the losses they might incur from a catastrophic event could be materially higher than expectation, and their financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. The insurance and reinsurance business is historically cyclical, and we expect to experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates and policy terms and conditions, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The insurance and reinsurance industry has historically been cyclical. Insurers and reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to competition, frequency of occurrence or severity of catastrophic events, levels of underwriting capacity, underwriting results of primary insurers, general economic conditions and other factors. The supply of insurance and reinsurance is related to prevailing prices, the level of insured losses and the level of industry surplus which, in turn, may fluctuate, including in response to changes in rates of return on investments being earned in the reinsurance industry. The insurance and reinsurance pricing cycle has historically been a market phenomenon, driven by supply and demand rather than by the actual cost of coverage. The upward phase of a cycle is often triggered when a major event forces insurers and reinsurers to make large claim payments, thereby drawing down capital. This, combined with increased demand for insurance against the risk associated with the event, pushes prices upwards. Over time, insurers and reinsurers capital is replenished with the higher revenues. At the same time, new entrants flock to the industry seeking a part of the profitable business. This combination prompts a slide in prices  the downward cycle  until a major insured event restarts the upward phase. As a result, the insurance and reinsurance business has been characterized by periods of intense competition on price and policy terms due to excessive underwriting capacity, which is the percentage of surplus or the dollar amount of exposure that a reinsurer is willing to place at risk, as well as periods when shortages of capacity result in favorable premium rates and policy terms and conditions. Premium levels may be adversely affected by a number of factors which fluctuate and may contribute to price declines generally in the reinsurance industry. For example, as premium levels for many products have increased subsequent to the significant natural catastrophes of 2004 and 2005, the supply of reinsurance has increased and is likely to increase further, either as a result of capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of additional capital by existing reinsurers. In addition, some of the prior upward cycles were initiated following each of Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and the events of September 11, 2001. Continued increases in the supply of insurance and reinsurance may have consequences for the reinsurance industry generally and for us including fewer contracts written, lower premium rates, increased expenses for customer acquisition and retention, and less favorable policy terms and conditions. For instance, the Company has noted an increase in the amount of available underwriting capacity in most lines in which it is involved throughout 2007 and continuing through the January renewal period of 2008. As a consequence, the Company has experienced greater competition on most insurance and reinsurance lines. This has adversely affected the rates we receive for our reinsurance and our overall gross premiums written to date. Furthermore, the State of Florida has instituted a law that, in part, increases the amount of reinsurance available to primary insurers from the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund. The cyclical trends in the industry and the industrys profitability can also be affected significantly by volatile and unpredictable developments, such as natural disasters (such as catastrophic hurricanes, windstorms, tornados, earthquakes and floods), courts granting large awards for certain damages, fluctuations in interest rates, changes in the investment environment that affect market prices of investments and inflationary pressures that may tend to 24 Table of Contents affect the size of losses experienced by insureds and primary insurance companies. We expect to experience the effects of cyclicality, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If we underestimate our reserve for losses and loss expenses, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our success depends on our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses and properties that we reinsure. If unpredictable catastrophic events occur, or if we fail to adequately manage our exposure to losses or fail to adequately estimate our reserve requirements, our actual losses and loss expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from our reserve estimates. We estimate the risks associated with our outstanding obligations, including the risk embedded within our unearned premiums. To do this, we establish reserves for losses and loss expenses (or loss reserves ), which are liabilities that we record to reflect the estimated costs of claim payment and the related expenses that we will ultimately be required to pay in respect of premiums written and include case reserves and incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves. However, under U.S. GAAP, we are not permitted to establish reserves for losses with respect to our property catastrophe reinsurance until an event which gives rise to a claim occurs. As a result, only reserves applicable to losses incurred up to the reporting date may be set aside on our financial statements, with no allowance for the provision of loss reserves to account for possible other future losses with respect to our catastrophe-exposed reinsurance. Case reserves are reserves established with respect to specific individual reported claims. IBNR reserves are reserves for estimated losses that we have incurred but that have not yet been reported to us. Property catastrophe reinsurance covers insurance companies exposures to an accumulation of property and related losses from separate policies, typically relating to natural disasters or other catastrophic events. Our reserve estimates do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, they are estimates of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost. These estimates are based upon actuarial and statistical projections and on our assessment of currently available data, predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends and other variable factors such as inflation. Establishing an appropriate level of our loss reserve estimates is an inherently uncertain process. It is likely that the ultimate liability will be greater or less than these estimates and that, at times, this variance will be material. Our reserve estimates are regularly refined as experience develops and claims are reported and settled. Establishing an appropriate level for our reserve estimates is an inherently uncertain process. In addition, as we operate solely through intermediaries, reserving for our business can involve added uncertainty arising from our dependence on information from ceding companies which, in addition to the risk of receiving inaccurate information involves an inherent time lag between reporting information from the primary insurer to us. Additionally, ceding companies employ differing reserving practices which adds further uncertainty to the establishment of our reserves. Moreover, these uncertainties are greater for reinsurers like us than for reinsurers with a longer operating history, because we do not yet have an established loss history. The lack of historical information for the Company has necessitated the use of industry loss emergence patterns in deriving IBNR. Loss emergence patterns are development patterns used to project current reported or paid loss amounts to their ultimate settlement value or amount. Further, expected losses and loss ratios are typically developed using vendor and proprietary computer models and these expected loss ratios are a material component in the calculation deriving IBNR. Actual loss ratios will deviate from expected loss ratios and ultimate loss ratios will be greater or less than expected loss ratios. Because of these uncertainties, it is possible that our estimates for reserves at any given time could prove inadequate. To the extent we determine that actual losses and loss adjustment expenses from events which have occurred exceed our expectations and the loss reserves reflected in our financial statements, we will be required to reflect these changes in the current period. This could cause a sudden and material increase in our liabilities and a reduction in our profitability, including operating losses and reduction of capital, which could materially restrict our ability to write new business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and potentially our A.M. Best rating. 25 Table of Contents We rely on key personnel and the loss of their services may adversely affect us. The Bermuda location of our head office may be an impediment to attracting and retaining experienced personnel. Various aspects of our business depend on the services and skills of key personnel of the Company. We believe there are only a limited number of available qualified executives in the business lines in which we compete. We rely substantially upon the services of Edward J. Noonan, Chairman of our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; George P. Reeth, President and the Deputy Chairman of our Board of Directors; C.N. Rupert Atkin, Chief Executive Officer of the Talbot Group; Michael J. Belfatti, Executive Vice President and Chief Actuary; Gilles A. M. Bonvarlet, Chief Operating Officer of the Talbot Group; Michael E.A. Carpenter, Chairman of the Talbot Group; Joseph E. (Jeff) Consolino, Chief Financial Officer; C. Jerome Dill, General Counsel; Stuart W. Mercer, Chief Risk Officer; and Conan M. Ward, Chief Underwriting Officer, among other key employees. Although we are not aware of any planned departures, the loss of any of their services or the services of other members of our management team or any difficulty in attracting and retaining other talented personnel could impede the further implementation of our business strategy, reduce our revenues and decrease our operational effectiveness. Although we have an employment agreement with each of the above named executives, there is a possibility that these employment agreements may not be enforceable in the event any of these employees leave. The employment agreements for each of the above-named executives provide that the terms of the agreement will continue for a defined period after either party giving notice of termination, and will terminate immediately upon the Company giving notice of termination for cause. We do not currently maintain key man life insurance policies with respect to them or any of our other employees. The operating location of our head office and Validus Re subsidiary may be an impediment to attracting and retaining experienced personnel. Under Bermuda law, non-Bermudians (other than spouses of Bermudians) may not engage in any gainful occupation in Bermuda without an appropriate governmental work permit. Our success may depend in part on the continued services of key employees in Bermuda. A work permit may be granted or renewed upon demonstrating that, after proper public advertisement, no Bermudian (or spouse of a Bermudian or a holder of a permanent residents certificate or holder of a working residents certificate) is available who meets the minimum standards reasonably required by the employer. The Bermuda governments policy places a six-year term limit on individuals with work permits, subject to certain exemptions for key employees. A work permit is issued with an expiry date (up to five years) and no assurances can be given that any work permit will be issued or, if issued, renewed upon the expiration of the relevant term. If work permits are not obtained, or are not renewed, for our principal employees, we would lose their services, which could materially affect our business. Work permits are currently required for 26 of our Bermuda employees, all of whom have obtained three- or five-year work permits except Mr. Belfatti whose five year work permit has been applied for but not yet approved due his recent start date with the Company. Certain of our directors and officers may have conflicts of interest with us. Entities affiliated with some of our directors have sponsored or invested in, and may in the future sponsor or invest in, other entities engaged in or intending to engage in insurance and reinsurance underwriting, some of which compete with us. They have also entered into, or may in the future enter into, agreements with companies that compete with us. We have a policy in place applicable to each of our directors and officers which provides for the resolution of potential conflicts of interest. However, we may not be in a position to influence any partys decision to engage in activities that would give rise to a conflict of interest, and they may take actions that are not in our shareholders best interests. We may require additional capital or credit in the future, which may not be available or only available on unfavorable terms. We monitor our capital adequacy on a regular basis. The capital requirements of our business depend on many factors, including our premiums written, loss reserves, investment portfolio composition and risk exposures, as well as satisfying regulatory and rating agency capital requirements. Our ability to underwrite is largely dependent upon the quality of our claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies. To the 26 Table of Contents extent that our existing capital is insufficient to fund our future operating requirements and/or cover claim losses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or limit our growth. Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that are unfavorable to us. In the case of equity financings, dilution to our shareholders could result, and, in any case, such securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our outstanding securities. If we are not able to obtain adequate capital, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, as an alien reinsurer (not licensed in the United States), we are required to post collateral security with respect to any reinsurance liabilities that we assume from ceding insurers domiciled in the United States in order for U.S. ceding companies to obtain full statutory and regulatory credit for our reinsurance. Other jurisdictions and non-U.S. ceding insurers may have similar collateral requirements. Under applicable statutory provisions, these security arrangements may be in the form of letters of credit, reinsurance trusts maintained by trustees or funds-withheld arrangements where assets are held by the ceding company. We intend to satisfy such statutory requirements by providing to primary insurers letters of credit issued under our credit facilities. To the extent that we are required to post additional security in the future, we may require additional letter of credit capacity and we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain such additional capacity or arrange for other types of security on commercially acceptable terms or on terms as favorable as under our current letter of credit facilities. Our inability to provide collateral satisfying the statutory and regulatory guidelines applicable to primary insurers would have a material effect on our ability to provide reinsurance to third parties and negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. Security arrangements may subject our assets to security interests and/or require that a portion of our assets be pledged to, or otherwise held by, third parties. Although the investment income derived from our assets while held in trust typically accrues to our benefit, the investment of these assets is governed by the investment regulations of the state of domicile of the ceding insurer. Competition for business in our industry is intense, and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may not be able to retain market share and our business may be materially adversely affected. The insurance and reinsurance industries are highly competitive. We face intense competition, based upon (among other things) global capacity, product breadth, reputation and experience with respect to particular lines of business, relationships with reinsurance intermediaries, quality of service, capital and perceived financial strength (including independent rating agencies ratings), innovation and price. We compete with major global insurance and reinsurance companies and underwriting syndicates, many of which have extensive experience in reinsurance and may have greater financial, marketing and employee resources available to them than us. Other financial institutions, such as banks and hedge funds, now offer products and services similar to our products and services through alternative capital markets products that are structured to provide protections similar to those provided by reinsurers. These products, such as catastrophe-linked bonds, compete with our products. In the future, underwriting capacity will continue to enter the market from these identified competitors and perhaps other sources. After the events of September 11, 2001, and then again following the three major hurricanes of 2005 (Katrina, Rita and Wilma), new capital flowed into Bermuda, and much of these new proceeds went to a variety of Bermuda-based start-up companies. The full extent and effect of this additional capital on the reinsurance market will not be known for some time and market conditions could become less favorable. Increased competition could result in fewer submissions and lower rates, which could have an adverse effect on our growth and profitability. If we are unable to compete effectively against these competitors, we may not be able to retain market share. In addition, insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously, and industrial and commercial companies have been increasingly relying upon their own subsidiary insurance companies, known as captive insurance companies, self-insurance pools, risk retention groups, mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks, rather than risk transferring insurance. This has put downward pressure on insurance premiums. 27 Table of Contents Loss of business from one or more major brokers could adversely affect us. We market our insurance and reinsurance on a worldwide basis primarily through brokers, and we depend on a small number of brokers for a large portion of our revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2007 (1), our business was primarily sourced from the following brokers: Marsh Inc./Guy Carpenter & Co. 26.9%, Willis Group Holdings Ltd. 15.7%, Aon Corporation 15.1% and Benfield Group Ltd. 9.3%. These four brokers provided a total of 67.0% of our gross premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2007. Talbot was acquired on July 2, 2007. Talbots gross premium written for the full year ended December 31, 2007 has been included in the above analysis for informational purposes only and is not included within the consolidated results. Loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could adversely affect our business. We assume a degree of credit risk associated with substantially all of our brokers. In accordance with industry practice, we frequently pay amounts owed on claims under our policies to brokers and the brokers, in turn, pay these amounts over to the ceding insurers and reinsurers that have reinsured a portion of their liabilities with us. In some jurisdictions, if a broker fails to make such a payment, we might remain liable to the ceding insurer or reinsurer for the deficiency notwithstanding the brokers obligation to make such payment. Conversely, in certain jurisdictions, when the ceding insurer or reinsurer pays premiums for these policies to reinsurance brokers for payment to us, these premiums are considered to have been paid and the ceding insurer or reinsurer will no longer be liable to us for these premiums, whether or not we have actually received them. Consequently, we assume a degree of credit risk associated with substantially all of our brokers. Our success depends on our ability to establish and maintain effective operating procedures and internal controls. Failure to detect control issues and any instances of fraud could adversely affect us. Our success is dependent upon our ability to establish and maintain operating procedures and internal controls (including the timely and successful implementation of information technology systems and programs) to effectively support our business and our regulatory and reporting requirements. We may not be successful in such efforts. Even if and when implemented, as a result of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide full assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company will be detected. We may be unable to purchase reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance in the future, and if we successfully purchase retrocessional reinsurance, we may be unable to collect, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We purchase reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance in order that we may offer insureds and cedants greater capacity, and to mitigate the effect of large and multiple losses upon our financial condition. Reinsurance is a transaction whereby an insurer or reinsurer cedes to a reinsurer all or part of the reinsurance it has assumed. A reinsurers or retrocessional reinsurers insolvency or inability or refusal to make timely payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with us could have an adverse effect on us because we remain liable to our client. From time to time, market conditions have limited, and in some cases have prevented, insurers and reinsurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance that they consider adequate for their business needs. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain our desired amounts of reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance or negotiate terms that we deem appropriate or acceptable or obtain reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance from entities with satisfactory creditworthiness. Our investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or losses which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Any increase in interest rates or volatility in the fixed income markets could result in significant unrealized losses in the fair value of our investment portfolio which, commencing in 2007, would reduce our net income. Our operating results depend in part on the performance of our investment portfolio, which currently consists of fixed maturity securities, as well as the ability of our investment managers to effectively implement our investment strategy. Our Board of Directors, including our Finance Committee, oversees our investment strategy, and in consultation with BlackRock Financial Management, Inc. and Goldman Sachs Asset Management, our 28 Table of Contents portfolio advisors, has established investment guidelines. The investment guidelines dictate the portfolios overall objective, benchmark portfolio, eligible securities, duration, limitations on the use of derivatives and inclusion of foreign securities, diversification requirements and average portfolio rating. The Board periodically reviews these guidelines in light of our investment goals and consequently they may change at any time. The investment income derived from our invested assets was $112.3 million or 27.9% of our net income for the year ended December 31, 2007. While we follow a conservative investment strategy designed to emphasize the preservation of invested assets and to provide sufficient liquidity for the prompt payment of claims, we will nevertheless be subject to market-wide risks including illiquidity and pricing uncertainty and fluctuations, as well as to risks inherent in particular securities. Our investment performance may vary substantially over time, and we cannot assure that we will achieve our investment objectives. Unlike more established reinsurance companies with longer operating histories, Validus Re has a limited performance record to which investors can refer. See Business  Investments. Investment results will also be affected by general economic conditions, market volatility, interest rate fluctuations, liquidity and credit risks beyond our control. In addition, our need for liquidity may result in investment returns below our expectations. Also, with respect to certain of our investments, we are subject to prepayment or reinvestment risk. In particular, our fixed income portfolio is subject to reinvestment risk, and as at December 31, 2007, 44.5% of the fixed income portfolio is comprised of mortgage backed and asset backed securities which are subject to prepayment risk. Although we attempt to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, a significant increase in interest rates could result in significant losses, realized or unrealized, in the fair value of our investment portfolio and, consequently, could have an adverse affect on our results of operations. As of January 1, 2007, the Companys investments were accounted for as trading and, as such, all unrealized gains and losses are included in Net Income on the Statement of Operations. Including unrealized gains and losses in Net Income may have the effect of increasing the volatility of our earnings. The movement in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our operating results because we enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts where the premiums receivable and losses payable are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and we maintain a portion of our investments and liabilities in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar is our reporting currency. We enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts where the premiums receivable and losses payable are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, we maintain a portion of our investments and liabilities in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Premiums received in non-U.S. currencies are generally converted into U.S. dollars at the time of receipt. When we incur a liability in a non-U.S. currency, we carry such liability on our books in the original currency. These liabilities are converted from the non-U.S. currency to U.S. dollars at the time of payment. We will therefore realize foreign currency exchange gains or losses as we ultimately receive premiums and settle claims required to be paid in foreign currencies. At December 31, 2007, 8.7% of our investments and 30.9% of our reserves for losses and loss expenses were in foreign currencies. To the extent that we do not seek to hedge our foreign currency risk, the impact of a movement in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our operating results. The preparation of our financial statements will require us to make many estimates and judgments, which are even more difficult than those made in a mature company, and which, if inaccurate, could cause volatility in our results. The Companys consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes the item that requires the most subjective and complex estimates is the reserve for losses and loss expenses. Due to Validus Res short operating history, loss experience is limited and reliable evidence of changes in trends of numbers of claims incurred, average settlement amounts, numbers of claims outstanding and average losses per claim will necessarily take many years to develop. Following a major catastrophic event, the possibility of future litigation or legislative change that may affect interpretation of policy terms further increases 29 Table of Contents the degree of uncertainty in the reserving process. The uncertainties inherent in the reserving process, together with the potential for unforeseen developments, including changes in laws and the prevailing interpretation of policy terms, may result in losses and loss expenses materially different than the reserves initially established. Changes to prior year reserves will affect current underwriting results by increasing net income if the prior year reserves prove to be redundant or by decreasing net income if the prior year reserves prove to be insufficient. The Company expects volatility in results in periods in which significant loss events occur because U.S. GAAP does not permit insurers or reinsurers to reserve for loss events until they have occurred and are expected to give rise to a claim. As a result, the Company is not allowed to record contingency reserves to account for expected future losses. The Company anticipates that claims arising from future events will require the establishment of substantial reserves from time to time. An inability to implement, for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2008, the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in a timely and satisfactory manner could cause the price of our common shares to fall. We are presently evaluating our existing internal controls with respect to the standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. We cannot be certain at this time that we will be able to successfully and satisfactorily complete the procedures, certification and attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 by the time that we are required to file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2008, which is the first time that our management and our external auditors will be required to deliver reports on our internal controls and procedures in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Uncertainty as to our ability to comply with such requirements or any material weaknesses uncovered as a result of such procedures could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common shares. In addition, we may incur increased costs associated with such procedures or a diversion of internal resources necessary to prepare for or comply with such requirements. Risks Related to Acquisitions and New Ventures There can be no assurance that we will fully realize the expected benefits of the Talbot acquisition in the anticipated time. In order to realize the benefits of the Talbot acquisition, our and Talbots management will be required to devote considerable effort to projects such as upgrading and integrating financial, actuarial, underwriting and other systems and preparing financial reports on a timely basis, whether for a public company or otherwise, and no assurances can be given as to the impact these efforts may have upon our operations. In addition, no assurances can be given as to how much business Talbot will be permitted by Lloyds to write in 2009 and subsequent years nor as to the viability or cost of the capital structure we may use as a substitute for the external capital and reinsurance used by Talbot in 2007 and prior underwriting years. The Company has recorded intangible assets related to the acquisition of Talbot based on assumptions of anticipated benefits. These intangible assets may become impaired if anticipated benefits are not achieved, resulting in a corresponding impact on our income. Any future acquisitions or new ventures may expose us to operational risks. We may in the future make strategic acquisitions, either of other companies or selected blocks of business, or grow our business organically. Any future acquisitions or new ventures may expose us to operational challenges and risks, including:  integrating financial and operational reporting systems;  establishing satisfactory budgetary and other financial controls;  funding increased capital needs and overhead expenses;  obtaining management personnel required for expanded operations;  funding cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated sales and revenues are not realized or are delayed, whether by general economic or market conditions or unforeseen internal difficulties; 30 Table of Contents  the value of assets related to acquisitions or new ventures may be lower than expected or may diminish due to credit defaults or changes in interest rates and liabilities assumed may be greater than expected;  the assets and liabilities related to acquisitions or new ventures may be subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation; and  financial exposures in the event that the sellers of the entities we acquire are unable or unwilling to meet their indemnification, reinsurance and other obligations to us. Our failure to manage successfully these operational challenges and risks may impact our results of operations. Risks Relating to Lloyds and Other U.K. Regulatory Matters The regulation of Lloyds members by Lloyds and of Lloyds by the U.K. Financial Services Authority (FSA) and under European Directives and other local laws may result in intervention that could have a significant negative impact on Talbot. Talbot operates in a regulated industry. Its underwriting activities are regulated by the FSA and franchised by Lloyds. The FSA has substantial powers of intervention in relation to the Lloyds managing agents (such as Talbot Underwriting Ltd.) which it regulates, including the power to remove their authorization to manage Lloyds syndicates. In addition, the Lloyds Franchise Board requires annual approval of Syndicate 1183s business plan, including a maximum underwriting capacity, and may require changes to any business plan presented to it or additional capital to be provided to support underwriting (known as Funds at Lloyds or FAL). An adverse determination in any of these cases could lead to a change in business strategy which may have an adverse effect on Talbots financial condition and operating results. European Directives affect the regulation governing the carrying on of insurance business in the United Kingdom. A new Directive covering the prudential supervision of insurance companies is being developed to replace the existing insurance Directives. The proposed Solvency II insurance Directive is presently under consultation and is unlikely to come into force before 2009. Likewise, a new reinsurance Directive was adopted on 17 October 2005, which is likely to be fully implemented in the U.K. by the end of 2010. There can be no assurance that future legislation will not have an adverse effect on Talbot. Additionally, Lloyds worldwide insurance and reinsurance business is subject to local regulation. Changes in such regulation may have an adverse effect on Lloyds generally and on Talbot. Should Lloyds Council decide additional levies are required to support the New Central Fund, this could adversely affect Talbot. The New Central Fund, which is funded by annual contributions and loans from Lloyds members, acts as a policyholders protection fund to make payments where any Lloyds member has failed to pay, or is unable to pay, valid claims. The Lloyds Council may resolve to make payments from the New Central Fund for the advancement and protection of policyholders, which could lead to additional or special contributions being payable by Lloyds members, including Talbot. This, in turn, could adversely affect Talbot. Lloyds 1992 and prior liabilities. Notwithstanding the firebreak introduced when Lloyds implemented the Reconstruction and Renewal Plan in 1996, Lloyds members, including Talbot subsidiaries, remain indirectly exposed in a number of ways to 1992 and prior business reinsured by Equitas, including through the application of overseas deposits and the New Central Fund. Lloyds currently has a number of contingent liabilities in respect of risks under certain policies allocated to 1992 or prior Years of Account. If the statutory transfer of business from Equitas to National Indemnity Company (NICO) is not implemented, and the limit of the NICO retrocession cover proves to be insufficient and as a consequence Equitas is unable to pay the 1992 and prior liabilities in full, Lloyds will be liable to meet any shortfall arising in respect of those policies. The New Central Fund, which can, subject to Lloyds regulations, issue calls on current underwriting members of Lloyds (which will include Talbot subsidiaries), may be applied for these 31 Table of Contents purposes. Lloyds also has contingent liabilities under indemnities in respect of claims against certain persons and from residual litigation with Lloyds members who have not accepted the settlement offer. The failure of Lloyds to satisfy the FSAs annual solvency test could result in limitations on Talbots ability to underwrite or its ability to commence legal proceedings against Lloyds. The FSA requires Lloyds to satisfy an annual solvency test. The solvency requirement in essence measures whether Lloyds has sufficient assets in the aggregate to meet all outstanding liabilities of its members, both current and in run-off. If Lloyds fails to satisfy the test in any year, the FSA may require Lloyds to cease trading and/or its members to cease or reduce underwriting. In the event of Lloyds failing to meet any solvency requirement, either the Society of Lloyds or the FSA may apply to the court for a Lloyds Market Reorganisation Order (LMRO). On the making of an order a reorganisation controller is appointed, and for its duration, a moratorium is imposed preventing any proceedings or legal process from being commenced or continued against any party that is the subject of such an order, which, if made, would apply to the market as a whole, including members, former members, managing agents, members agents, Lloyds brokers, approved run-off companies and managing general agents unless individual parties are specifically excluded. A downgrade in Lloyds ratings would have an adverse effect on Syndicate 1183s standing among brokers and customers and cause its premiums and earnings to decrease. The ability of Lloyds syndicates to trade in certain classes of business at current levels is dependent on the maintenance of a satisfactory credit rating issued by an accredited rating agency. The financial security of the Lloyds market is regularly assessed by three independent rating agencies, A.M. Best, Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings. Syndicate 1183 benefits from Lloyds current ratings and would be adversely affected if the current ratings were downgraded from their present levels. An increase in the charges paid by Talbot to participate in the Lloyds market could adversely affect Talbots financial and operating results. Lloyds imposes a number of charges on businesses operating in the Lloyds market, including, for example, annual subscriptions and central fund contributions for members and policy signing charges. The bases and amounts of charges may be varied by Lloyds and could adversely affect Talbot. An increase in the level or type of deposits required by U.S. Situs Trust Deeds to be maintained by Lloyds could result in Syndicate 1183 being required to make a cash call which could adversely affect Talbots financial performance. The U.S. Situs Trust Deeds require syndicates transacting certain types of business in the United States to maintain minimum deposits as protection for U.S. policyholders. These deposits represent the syndicates estimates of unpaid claims liabilities (less premiums receivable) relating to this business, adjusted for provisions for potential bad debt on premiums earned but not received and for any anticipated profit on unearned premiums. No credit is generally allowed for potential reinsurance recoveries. The New York Insurance Department and the U.S. National Association of Insurance Commissioners currently require funding of 30% of gross liabilities in relation to insurance business classified as Surplus Lines. The Credit for Reinsurance trust fund is usually required to be funded at 100% of gross liabilities. The funds contained within the deposits are not ordinarily available to meet trading expenses. U.S. regulators may increase the level of funding required or change the requirements as to the nature of funding. Accordingly, in the event of a major claim arising in the United States, for example from a major catastrophe, syndicates participating in such U.S. business may be required to make cash calls on their members to meet claims payments and deposit funding obligations. This could adversely affect Talbot. Risks Related to Taxation We may be subject to U.S. tax. We are organized under the laws of Bermuda and presently intend to structure our activities to minimize the risk that we would be considered engaged in a U.S. trade or business. No definitive standards, however, are provided 32 Table of Contents by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), U.S. Treasury regulations or court decisions regarding activities that constitute the conduct of a U.S. trade or business. Because that determination is essentially factual, we cannot assure that the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) will not contend that we are engaged in a U.S. trade or business. If we were found to be so engaged, we would be subject to U.S. corporate income and branch profits tax on our earnings that are effectively connected to such U.S. trade or business. If Validus Re is entitled to the benefits of the income tax treaty between the U.S. and Bermuda (the Bermuda Treaty), it would not be subject to U.S. income tax on any income protected by the Bermuda Treaty unless that income is attributable to a permanent establishment in the U.S. The treaty clearly applies to premium income, but may be construed as not protecting other income such as investment income. If Validus Re were found to be engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. and were entitled to the benefits of the treaty in general, but the treaty were found not to protect investment income, a portion of Validus Res investment income could be subject to U.S. tax. U.S. persons who hold common shares may be subject to U.S. income taxation at ordinary income rates on our undistributed earnings and profits. Controlled Foreign Corporation Status: The Company should not be a controlled foreign corporation (CFC) because its organizational documents provide that if the common shares owned, directly, indirectly or by attribution, by any person would otherwise represent more than 9.09% of the aggregate voting power of all the Companys common shares, the voting rights attached to those common shares will be reduced so that such person may not exercise and is not attributed more than 9.09% of the total voting power of the common shares. We cannot assure, however, that the provisions of the Organizational Documents will operate as intended and that the Company will not be considered a CFC. If the Company were considered a CFC, any shareholder that is a U.S. person that owns directly, indirectly or by attribution, 10% or more of the voting power of the Company may be subject to current U.S. income taxation at ordinary income tax rates on all or a portion of the Companys undistributed earnings and profits attributable to Validus Res insurance and reinsurance income, including underwriting and investment income. Any gain realized on sale of common shares by such 10% shareholder may also be taxed as a dividend to the extent of the Companys earnings and profits attributed to such shares during the period that the shareholder held the shares and while the Company was a CFC (with certain adjustments). Related Person Insurance Income: If the related person insurance income (RPII) of any of the Companys non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries were to equal or exceed 20% of that subsidiarys gross insurance income in any taxable year, and U.S. persons were treated as owning 25% or more of the subsidiarys stock, by vote or value, a U.S. person who directly or indirectly owns any common shares on the last day of such taxable year on which the 25% threshold is met would be required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes that persons ratable share of that subsidiarys RPII for the taxable year. The amount includible in income is determined as if the RPII were distributed proportionately to U.S. holders on that date, regardless of whether that income is distributed. The amount of RPII includible in income is limited by such shareholders share of the subsidiarys current-year earnings and profits, and possibly reduced by the shareholders share of prior year deficits in earnings and profits. The amount of RPII earned by a subsidiary will depend on several factors, including the identity of persons directly or indirectly insured or reinsured by that subsidiary. Although we do not believe that the 20% threshold will be met for our non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries, some of the factors that might affect that determination in any period may be beyond our control. Consequently, we cannot assure that we will not exceed the RPII threshold in any taxable year. If a U.S. person disposes of shares in a non-U.S. insurance corporation that had RPII (even if the 20% threshold was not met) and the 25% threshold is met at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of disposition, and the U.S. person owned any shares at such time, any gain from the disposition will generally be treated as a dividend to the extent of the holders share of the corporations undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that the holder owned the shares (possibly whether or not those earnings and profits are attributable to RPII). In addition, the shareholder will be required to comply with specified reporting requirements, regardless of the amount of shares owned. We believe that those rules should not apply to a disposition of common shares because the Company is not itself directly engaged in the insurance business. We cannot assure, however, that the IRS will not successfully assert that those rules apply to a disposition of common shares. 33 Table of Contents U.S. persons who hold common shares will be subject to adverse tax consequences if the Company is considered a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Company is considered a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder who owns common shares will be subject to adverse tax consequences, including a greater tax liability than might otherwise apply and an interest charge on certain taxes that are deferred as a result of the Companys non-U.S. status. We currently do not expect that the Company will be a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes in the current taxable year or the foreseeable future because, through Validus Re, Talbot 2002 Underwriting Capital Ltd. and Talbot Underwriting Ltd., it intends to be predominantly engaged in the active conduct of a global insurance business. We cannot assure you, however, that the Company will not be deemed to be a PFIC by the IRS. No regulations currently exist regarding the application of the PFIC provisions to an insurance company. New regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying such provisions may be forthcoming. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such guidance would have on an investor that is subject to U.S. federal income taxation. Changes in U.S. tax laws may be retroactive and could subject a U.S. holder of common shares to other adverse tax consequences. The tax treatment of non-U.S. companies and their U.S. and non-U.S. insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries has been the subject of Congressional discussion and legislative proposals in the U.S. We cannot assure that future legislative action will not increase the amount of U.S. tax payable by us. For example, Congress has recently conducted hearings related to the tax treatment of offshore insurance and is reported to be considering legislation that would adversely affect reinsurance between affiliates and offshore insurance and reinsurance more generally. One such proposal would increase the excise tax rate on reinsurance premiums paid to affiliated foreign reinsurers from 1% to 4%; another proposal would limit deductions for premiums ceded to affiliated non-U.S. companies above certain levels. Other proposals relating to cross-border transactions, intangible products, or non-U.S. jurisdictions generally have been introduced in a number of Congressional committees. Enactment of some versions of such legislation as well as other changes in U.S. tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof to address these issues could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations, including those regarding whether a company is engaged in a U.S. trade or business or is a PFIC, or whether U.S. holders would be required to include subpart F income or RPII in their gross income, are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. No regulations regarding the application of the PFIC rules to insurance companies are currently in effect, and the regulations regarding RPII are still in proposed form. New regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying such rules may be forthcoming. We cannot be certain if, when, or in what form, such regulations or pronouncements may be provided, and whether such guidance will have a retroactive effect. Proposed U.S. Tax Legislation Could Adversely Affect U.S. Shareholders. Under current U.S. law, non-corporate U.S. holders of the Companys common shares generally are taxed on dividends at a capital gains tax rate rather than ordinary income tax rates. Currently, there is proposed legislation before both Houses of Congress that would exclude shareholders of certain foreign corporations from this advantageous income tax treatment. If this legislation became law, non-corporate U.S. shareholders would no longer qualify for the capital gains tax rate on the Companys dividends. We may become subject to taxes in Bermuda after March 28, 2016, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Under current Bermuda law, we are not subject to tax on income or capital gains. We have received from the Minister of Finance under The Exempted Undertaking Tax Protection Act 1966, as amended, an assurance that, in the event that Bermuda enacts legislation imposing tax computed on profits, income, any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance, then the imposition of any such tax shall not be applicable to us or to any of our operations or shares, debentures or other obligations, until March 28, 2016. We could be subject to taxes in Bermuda after that date. This assurance is subject to the proviso that it is not to be 34 Table of Contents construed to prevent the application of any tax or duty to such persons as are ordinarily resident in Bermuda or to prevent the application of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of the Land Tax Act 1967 or otherwise payable in relation to any property leased to us. We and Validus Re each pay annual Bermuda government fees; Validus Re pays annual insurance license fees. In addition, all entities employing individuals in Bermuda are required to pay a payroll tax and there are other sundry taxes payable, directly or indirectly, to the Bermuda government. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and other multinational organizations are considering measures that might increase our taxes and reduce our net income. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which is commonly referred to as the OECD, has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non-member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition. These measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world. In the OECDs report dated 18 April 2002 and updated as of June 2004, Bermuda was not listed as an uncooperative tax haven jurisdiction because it had previously committed to eliminate harmful tax practices and to embrace international tax standards for transparency, exchange of information and the elimination of any aspects of the regimes for financial and other services that attract business with no substantial domestic activity. We are not able to predict what changes will arise from the commitment or whether such changes will subject us to additional taxes. Our non-U.S. companies may be subject to U.K. tax. We intend to operate in such a manner so that none of our companies other than Talbot Underwriting Ltd., which manages Syndicate 1183 at Lloyds, Talbot 2002 Underwriting Capital Ltd. and Underwriting Risk Services Ltd. (Talbot U.K. Group) should be resident in the U.K. for tax purposes or have a permanent establishment in the U.K. Accordingly, we expect that none of our companies other than the Talbot U.K. Group should be subject to U.K. taxation. However, since applicable law and regulations do not conclusively define the activities that constitute conducting business in the U.K. through a permanent establishment, the U.K. Inland Revenue might contend successfully that one or more of our other companies, is conducting business in the U.K. through a permanent establishment in the U.K. Risks Related to Laws and Regulations Applicable to Us If we become subject to insurance statutes and regulations in addition to the statutes and regulations that currently apply to us, there could be a significant and negative impact on our business. We currently conduct our business in a manner such that we expect the Company will not be subject to insurance and/or reinsurance licensing requirements or regulations in any jurisdiction other than Bermuda and, with respect to Talbot, the U.K. and jurisdictions to which Lloyds is subject. See Business  Regulation  United States and Bermuda. Although we do not currently intend to engage in activities which would require us to comply with insurance and reinsurance licensing requirements of other jurisdictions, should we choose to engage in activities that would require us to become licensed in such jurisdictions, we cannot assure that we will be able to do so or to do so in a timely manner. Furthermore, the laws and regulations applicable to direct insurers could indirectly affect us, such as collateral requirements in various U.S. states to enable such insurers to receive credit for reinsurance ceded to us. The insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework of Bermuda and the insurance of U.S. risk by companies based in Bermuda that are not licensed or authorized in the U.S. have recently become subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions, including the United States. In the past, there have been Congressional and other initiatives in the United States regarding increased supervision and regulation of the insurance industry, including proposals to supervise and regulate offshore reinsurers. Government regulators are generally concerned with the protection of policyholders rather than other constituencies, such as our shareholders. We are not able to predict the future impact on our operations of changes in the laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject. 35 Table of Contents Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Shares Because we are a holding company and substantially all of our operations are conducted by our main operating subsidiaries, Validus Re and Talbot, our ability to meet any ongoing cash requirements and to pay dividends will depend on our ability to obtain cash dividends or other cash payments or obtain loans from Validus Re and Talbot. We conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries. Our ability to meet our ongoing cash requirements, including any debt service payments or other expenses, and pay dividends on our common shares in the future, will depend on our ability to obtain cash dividends or other cash payments or obtain loans from these subsidiaries and will also depend on the financial condition of these subsidiaries. The inability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements could have a material adverse effect on us and the value of our common shares. Each of these subsidiaries is a separate and distinct legal entity that has no obligation to pay any dividends or to lend or advance us funds and may be restricted from doing so by contract, including other financing arrangements, charter provisions or applicable legal and regulatory requirements or rating agency constraints. The payment of dividends by these subsidiaries to us is limited under Bermuda law and regulations. The Insurance Act provides that neither of these subsidiaries may declare or pay in any financial year dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus (as shown on its statutory balance sheet in relation to the previous financial year) unless it files an affidavit with the BMA at least seven days prior to the payment signed by at least two directors and such subsidiarys principal representative, stating that in their opinion such subsidiaries will continue to satisfy the required margins following declaration of those dividends, though there is no additional requirement for BMA approval. In addition, before reducing its total statutory capital by 15% or more (as set out in its previous years statutory financial statements) each of these subsidiaries must make application to the BMA for permission to do so, such application to consist of an affidavit signed by at least two directors and such subsidiarys principal representative stating that in their opinion the proposed reduction in capital will not cause such subsidiaries to fail to meet its relevant margins, and such other information as the BMA may require. At December 31, 2007, Bermuda statutory restrictions permit Validus Re and Talbot to pay dividends of up to $1.4 billion and $209.0 million, respectively, to the Company. We intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common shares and paid a dividend of $0.20 to shareholders of record at March 3, 2008. The timing and amount of any cash dividends, however, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations and cash flows, our financial position and capital requirements, general business conditions, legal, tax, regulatory, rating agency and contractual constraints or restrictions and any other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, the indenture governing our Junior Subordinated Deferrable Debentures would restrict us from declaring or paying dividends on our common shares if we are downgraded by A.M. Best to a financial strength rating of B (Fair) or below or if A.M. Best withdraws its financial strength rating on any of our material insurance subsidiaries. Future sales of our common shares and grants of restricted shares may affect the market price of our common shares and the future exercise of options and warrants may result in immediate and substantial dilution of the common shares. As of March 6, 2008 (but without giving effect to unvested restricted shares), we had 74,205,749 common shares outstanding and 8,693,216 shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants. Approximately 42,385,701 of these shares were subject to the volume limitations and other conditions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which we refer to as the Securities Act. Furthermore, certain of our sponsoring shareholders and their transferees have the right to require us to register these common shares under the United States Securities Act for sale to the public, either in an independent offering pursuant to a demand registration or in conjunction with a public offering, subject to a lock-up agreement of no more than 90 days. Following any registration of this type, the common shares to which the registration relates will be freely transferable. In addition, we have filed one or more registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register common shares issued or reserved for issuance under the Long Term Incentive Plan. The number of Common Shares that have been reserved for issuance under the Plan is equal to 13,126,896. We cannot predict what effect, if any, future sales of our common shares, or the availability of common shares for future sale, will have on the market price of our common shares. Sales of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, or the perception that sales of this type could occur, 36 Table of Contents could depress the market price of our common shares and may make it more difficult for our shareholders to sell their common shares at a time and price that they deem appropriate. Our Bye-laws authorize our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of common shares and preferred shares without stockholder approval. Specifically, we have an authorized share capital of approximately 571,428,571 shares ($0.175 par value per share), which can consist of common shares and/or preference shares, as determined by our Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has the right to issue the remaining shares without obtaining any approval from our stockholders and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any series or designation of such series. Any issuance of our preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common shares and could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing the payment of any dividends (including any liquidating dividends) and any change in control of us. If a significant number of either common or preferred shares are issued, it may cause the market price of our common shares to decline. We cannot predict what effect, if any, future sales of our common shares, or the availability of common shares for future sale, will have on the market price of our common shares. Sales of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the market price of our common shares and may make it more difficult for shareholders to sell their common shares at a time and price which they deem appropriate. Our classified board structure may prevent a change in our control. Our board of directors is divided into three classes of directors. Each year one class of directors is elected by the shareholders for a three year term. The staggered terms of our directors may reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt at a change in control, even though a tender offer or change in control might be in the best interest of our shareholders. There are provisions in our Bye-laws that reduce the voting rights of voting common shares that are held by a person or group to the extent that such person or group holds more than 9.09% of the aggregate voting power of all common shares entitled to vote on a matter. In general, and except as provided below, shareholders have one vote for each voting common share held by them and are entitled to vote at all meetings of shareholders. However, if, and for so long as, the common shares of a shareholder, including any votes conferred by controlled shares (as defined below), would otherwise represent more than 9.09% of the aggregate voting power of all common shares entitled to vote on a matter, including an election of directors, the votes conferred by such shares will be reduced by whatever amount is necessary such that, after giving effect to any such reduction (and any other reductions in voting power required by our Bye-laws), the votes conferred by such shares represent 9.09% of the aggregate voting power of all common shares entitled to vote on such matter. Controlled shares include, among other things, all shares that a person is deemed to own directly, indirectly or constructively (within the meaning of Section 958 of the Code, or Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)). At December 31, 2007, there were 74,205,749 voting common shares, of which 6,745,303 voting common shares would confer votes that represent 9.09% of the aggregate voting power of all common shares entitled to vote generally at an election of directors. An investor who does not hold, and is not deemed under the provisions of our Bye-laws to own, any of our common shares may therefore purchase up to such amount without being subject to voting cutback provisions in our Bye-laws. In addition, we have the authority under our Bye-laws to request information from any shareholder for the purpose of determining ownership of controlled shares by such shareholder. There are regulatory limitations on the ownership and transfer of our common shares which could result in the delay or denial of any transfers shareholders might seek to make. The BMA must approve all issuances and transfers of securities of a Bermuda exempted company like us. We have received permission from the BMA to issue our common shares, and for the free transferability of our common shares as long as the common shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange or other appointed exchange, to and 37 Table of Contents among persons who are residents and non-residents of Bermuda for exchange control purposes. Any other transfers remain subject to approval by the BMA and such approval may be denied or delayed. A shareholder of our company may have greater difficulties in protecting its interests than as a shareholder of a U.S. corporation. The Companies Act 1981 (the Companies Act), which applies to our company, differs in material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. Taken together with the provisions of our Bye-laws, some of these differences may result in a shareholder having greater difficulties in protecting its interests as a shareholder of our company than it would have as a shareholder of a U.S. corporation. This affects, among other things, the circumstances under which transactions involving an interested director are voidable, whether an interested director can be held accountable for any benefit realized in a transaction with our company, what approvals are required for business combinations by our company with a large shareholder or a wholly owned subsidiary, what rights a shareholder may have as a shareholder to enforce specified provisions of the Companies Act or our Bye-laws, and the circumstances under which we may indemnify our directors and officers. We are a Bermuda company and it may be difficult for our shareholders to enforce judgments against us or against our directors and executive officers. We were incorporated under the laws of Bermuda and our business is based in Bermuda. In addition, certain of our directors and officers reside outside the United States, and a portion of our assets and the assets of such persons may be located in jurisdictions outside the United States. As such, it may be difficult or impossible to effect service of process within the United States upon us or those persons, or to recover against us or them on judgments of U.S. courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. Further, no claim may be brought in Bermuda against us or our directors and officers in the first instance for violation of U.S. federal securities laws because these laws have no extraterritorial application under Bermuda law and do not have force of law in Bermuda; however, a Bermuda court may impose civil liability, including the possibility of monetary damages, on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under Bermuda law. Currently, of our executive officers, George Reeth, Joseph E. (Jeff) Consolino, C. Jerome Dill and Conan Ward reside in Bermuda, Edward Noonan and Stuart Mercer maintain residences in both Bermuda and the United States, Michael Belfatti resides in the United States and Rupert Atkin, Gilles Bonvarlet and Michael Carpenter reside in the United Kingdom. Of our directors, Edward Noonan maintains residences in both Bermuda and the United States, George Reeth resides in Bermuda, Jean-Marie Nessi resides in France and the remainder reside in the United States. We have been advised by Bermuda counsel, that there is doubt as to whether the courts of Bermuda would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against us or our directors and officers, as well as the experts named herein, predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, or original actions brought in Bermuda against us or such persons predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Further, we have been advised by Bermuda counsel that there is no treaty in effect between the United States and Bermuda providing for the enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts in civil and commercial matters, and there are grounds upon which Bermuda courts may decline to enforce the judgments of U.S. courts. Some remedies available under the laws of U.S. jurisdictions, including some remedies available under the U.S. federal securities laws, may not be allowed in Bermuda courts as contrary to public policy in Bermuda. Because judgments of U.S. courts are not automatically enforceable in Bermuda, it may be difficult for our shareholders to recover against us based upon such judgments. Item 1B.
