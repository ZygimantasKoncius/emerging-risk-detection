ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before investing in our common stock you should carefully consider the following risks, together with the financial and other information contained in this Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline and you may lose all or a part of your investment. Risks Relating to Our Business We have incurred losses in the research and development of Ketotransdel® and our Transdel technology since inception. No assurance can be given that we will ever generate revenue or become profitable. Since inception we have recorded operating losses. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, we have a deficit accumulated during the development stage of approximately $10.4 million, and for the year ended December 31, 2008, we experienced a net loss of approximately $3.3 million. In addition, we expect to incur increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to incur costs for research and development and clinical trials, and in other development activities. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends upon our ability, alone or with others, to complete the development of our proposed products, obtain the required regulatory approvals and manufacture, market and sell our proposed products. Development is costly and requires significant investment. In addition, we may choose to in-license rights to particular drugs or active ingredients for use in cosmetic/cosmeceutical products. The license fees for such drugs or active ingredients may increase our costs. As we continue to engage in the development of Ketotransdel® and develop other products, including cosmetic/cosmeceutical products, there can be no assurance that we will ever be able to achieve or sustain market acceptance, profitability or positive cash flow. Our ultimate success will depend on many factors, including whether Ketotransdel® receives FDA approval. We cannot be certain that we will receive FDA approval for Ketotransdel®, or that we will reach the level of sales and revenues necessary to achieve and sustain profitability. Unless we raise additional capital, we may not be able to execute our business plan or fund business operations. Furthermore, we may be forced to reduce our expenses and cash expenditures to a material extent, which would impair or delay our ability to execute our business plan. We will need additional financing to execute our business plan and fund our operations, which additional financing may not be available on a timely basis, or at all. We have limited funds to support our operations and we may not be able to execute our current business plan and fund business operations long enough to achieve profitability unless we are able to secure additional funds. With our current cash and cash equivalents position, we have forecasted and anticipate having adequate resources in order to execute a portion of our operating plan over the next twelve months, which would include completing the Phase 3 clinical trial currently in progress for Ketotransdel®. However, in order to execute the second Phase 3 clinical trial of Ketotransdel®, which is currently required by the FDA to obtain final regulatory approval for Ketotransdel®, we would need to secure additional funds. If adequate financing is not available, we will not be able to conduct the second Phase 3 clinical trial. In addition, if one or more of the risks discussed in these risk factors occur or our expenses exceed our expectations, we may be required to raise funds sooner than anticipated. We may be required to pursue sources of additional capital to fund our operations through various means, including equity or debt financing, funding from a corporate partnership or licensing arrangement or any similar financing. Future financings through equity investments are likely to be dilutive to existing stockholders. Also, the terms of securities we may issue in future capital transactions may be more favorable for our new investors. Newly issued securities may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have additional dilutive effects. In addition, if we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our product candidates or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital and/or financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we may issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which will adversely impact our financial condition. The significant downturn in the overall economy and the ongoing disruption in the capital markets has reduced investor confidence and negatively affected investments generally and specifically in the pharmaceutical industry. In addition, the fact that we are not profitable and will need significant additional funds to execute the second Phase 3 clinical trial of Ketotransdel® currently required by the FDA and any other clinical trials we would want to commence for other products, could further impact the availability or cost of future financings. As a result, there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available when needed from any source or, if available, will be available on terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to raise funds to satisfy our capital needs on a timely basis, we may be required to cease operations. -7- Table of Contents Timing and results of clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of products as well as FDA approval of products are uncertain. We are subject to extensive government regulations. The process of obtaining FDA approval is costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the sale of any of our products, we must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that the product is safe and effective for each intended use. Preclinical and clinical studies may fail to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a product. Even promising results from preclinical and early clinical studies do not always accurately predict results in later, large scale trials. A failure to demonstrate safety and efficacy would result in our failure to obtain regulatory approvals. Moreover, if the FDA grants regulatory approval of a product, the approval may be limited to specific indications or limited with respect to its distribution, which could limit revenues. We cannot assure you that the FDA or other regulatory agencies will approve any products developed by us, on a timely basis, if at all, or, if granted, that such approval will not subject the marketing of our products to certain limits on indicated use. Any limitation on use imposed by the FDA or delay in or failure to obtain FDA approvals of products developed by us would adversely affect the marketing of these products and our ability to generate product revenue, as well as adversely affect the price of our common stock. If we fail to comply with continuing federal, state and foreign regulations, we could lose our approvals to market drugs and our business would be seriously harmed. Following initial regulatory approval of any drugs we may develop, we will be subject to continuing regulatory review, including review of adverse drug experiences and clinical results that are reported after our drug products become commercially available. This would include results from any post-marketing tests or continued actions required as a condition of approval. The manufacturer and manufacturing facilities we use to make any of our drug candidates will be subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA. If a previously unknown problem or problems with a product or a manufacturing and laboratory facility used by us is discovered, the FDA or foreign regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or on the manufacturing facility, including requiring us to withdraw the product from the market. Any changes to an approved product, including the way it is manufactured or promoted, often requires FDA approval before the product, as modified, can be marketed. In addition, we and our contract manufacturers will be subject to ongoing FDA requirements for submission of safety and other post-market information. If we or our contract manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:  issue warning letters;  impose civil or criminal penalties;  suspend or withdraw our regulatory approval;  suspend or terminate any of our ongoing clinical trials;  refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us;  impose restrictions on our operations;  close the facilities of our contract manufacturers; or  seize or detain products or require a product recall. Additionally, regulatory review covers a companys activities in the promotion of its drugs, with significant potential penalties and restrictions for promotion of drugs for an unapproved use. Sales and marketing programs are under scrutiny for compliance with various mandated requirements, such as illegal promotions to health care professionals. We are also required to submit information on our open and completed clinical trials to public registries and databases. Failure to comply with these requirements could expose us to negative publicity, fines and penalties that could harm our business. If we violate regulatory requirements at any stage, whether before or after marketing approval is obtained, we may be fined, be forced to remove a product from the market or experience other adverse consequences, including delay, which would materially harm our financial results. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain the labeling claims necessary or desirable for product promotion. -8- Table of Contents Delays in the conduct or completion of our clinical and non-clinical trials or the analysis of the data from our clinical or non-clinical trials may result in delays in our planned filings for regulatory approvals, and may adversely affect our business. We cannot predict whether we will encounter problems with any of our completed or planned clinical or non-clinical studies that will cause us or regulatory authorities to delay or suspend planned clinical and non-clinical studies. Any of the following could delay the completion of our planned clinical studies:  failure of the FDA to approve the scope or design of our clinical or non-clinical trials or manufacturing plans;  delays in enrolling volunteers in clinical trials;  insufficient supply or deficient quality of materials necessary for the performance of clinical or non-clinical trials;  negative results of clinical or non-clinical studies; and  adverse side effects experienced by study participants in clinical trials relating to a specific product. There may be other circumstances other than the ones described above, over which we may have no control that could materially delay the successful completion of our clinical and non-clinical studies. None of our pharmaceutical product candidates, other than Ketotransdel®, have commenced clinical trials. None of our pharmaceutical product candidates, other than Ketotransdel®, have commenced any clinical trials and there are a number of FDA requirements that we must satisfy in order to commence clinical trials. These requirements will require substantial time, effort and financial resources. We cannot assure you that we will ever satisfy these requirements. In addition, prior to commencing any trials of a drug candidate, we must evaluate whether a market exists for the drug candidate. This is costly and time consuming and no assurance can be given that our market studies will be accurate. We may expend significant capital and other resources on a drug candidate and find that no commercial market exists for the drug. Even if we do commence clinical trials of our other drug candidates, such drug candidates may never be approved by the FDA. Once approved, there is no guarantee that the market will accept our products, and regulatory requirements could limit the commercial usage of our products. Even if we obtain regulatory approvals, uncertainty exists as to whether the market will accept our products or if the market for our products is as large as we anticipate. A number of factors may limit the market acceptance of our products, including the timing of regulatory approvals and market entry relative to competitive products, the availability of alternative products, the price of our products relative to alternative products, the availability of third party reimbursement and the extent of marketing efforts by third party distributors or agents that we retain. We cannot assure you that our products will receive market acceptance in a commercially viable period of time, if at all. We cannot be certain that any investment made in developing products will be recovered, even if we are successful in commercialization. To the extent that we expend significant resources on research and development efforts and are not able, ultimately, to introduce successful new products as a result of those efforts, our business, financial position and results of operations may be materially adversely affected, and the market value of our common stock could decline. We may be subject to product liability claims. The development, manufacture, and sale of pharmaceutical and cosmetic/cosmeceutical products expose us to the risk of significant losses resulting from product liability claims. Although we have obtained and intend to maintain product liability insurance to offset some of this risk, we may be unable to maintain such insurance or it may not cover certain potential claims against us. In the future, we may not be able to afford to obtain insurance due to rising costs in insurance premiums in recent years. Currently we have been able to secure insurance coverage, however, we may be faced with a successful claim against us in excess of our product liability coverage that could result in a material adverse impact on our business. If insurance coverage is too expensive or is unavailable to us in the future, we may be forced to self-insure against product-related claims. Without insurance coverage, a successful claim against us and any defense costs incurred in defending ourselves may have a material adverse impact on our operations. -9- Table of Contents If our patents are determined to be unenforceable, or if we are unable to obtain new patents based on current patent applications or for future inventions, we may not be able to prevent others from using our intellectual property. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and expand patent protection for our specific products and technologies both in the United States and other countries. We cannot guarantee that any patents will be issued from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. Alternatively, a third party may successfully circumvent our patents. Our rights under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection against competitive products or otherwise cover commercially valuable products or processes. In addition, because patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy for eighteen months after the filing of the applications, and publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be sure that the inventors of subject matter covered by our patents and patent applications were the first to invent or the first to file patent applications for these inventions. In the event that a third party has also filed a patent on a similar invention, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention, which could result in a loss of our patent position. Furthermore, we may not have identified all United States and foreign patents that pose a risk of infringement. The use of our technologies could potentially conflict with the rights of others. The manufacture, use or sale of our proprietary products may infringe on the patent rights of others. If we are unable to avoid infringement of the patent rights of others, we may be required to seek a license, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming and may divert managements attention and our resources. We may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. In such case, we may be required to alter our products, pay licensing fees or cease activities. If our products conflict with patent rights of others, third parties could bring legal actions against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of affected products. If these legal actions are successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages, we could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products. We may not prevail in any legal action and a required license under the patent may not available on acceptable terms, if at all. We will be dependent on outside manufacturers in the event that we successfully develop our product candidates into commercial products; therefore, we will have limited control of the manufacturing process, access to raw materials, timing for delivery of finished products and costs. One manufacturer may constitute the sole source of one or more of our products. Third party manufacturers will manufacture all of our products, in the event that we successfully develop our product candidates into commercial products. Currently, certain of our contract manufacturers constitute the sole source of one or more of our products. If any of our existing or future manufacturers cease to manufacture or are otherwise unable to deliver any of our products or any of the components of our products, we may need to engage additional manufacturing partners. Because of contractual restraints and the lead-time necessary to obtain FDA approval of a new manufacturer, replacement of any of these manufacturers may be expensive and time consuming and may disrupt or delay our ability to supply our products and reduce our revenues. Because all of our products, in the event that we successfully develop our product candidates into commercial products, will be manufactured by third parties, we have a limited ability to control the manufacturing process, access to raw materials, the timing for delivery of finished products or costs related to this process. There can be no assurance that our contract manufacturers will be able to produce finished products in quantities that are sufficient to meet demand or at all, in a timely manner, which could result in decreased revenues and loss of market share. There may be delays in the manufacturing process over which we will have no control, including shortages of raw materials, labor disputes, backlog and failure to meet FDA standards. Increases in the prices we pay our manufacturers, interruptions in our supply of products or lapses in quality could adversely impact our margins, profitability and cash flows. We are reliant on our third-party manufacturers to maintain their manufacturing facilities in compliance with FDA and other federal, state and/or local regulations including health, safety and environmental standards. If they fail to maintain compliance with FDA or other critical regulations, they could be ordered to curtail operations, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We also rely on our outside manufacturers to assist us in the acquisition of key documents such as drug master files and other relevant documents that are required by the FDA as part of the drug approval process and post-approval oversight. Failure by our outside manufacturers to properly prepare and retain these documents could cause delays in obtaining FDA approval of our drug candidates. -10- Table of Contents We are dependent on third parties to conduct clinical trials and non-clinical studies of our drug candidates and to provide services for certain core aspects of our business. Any interruption or failure by these third parties to meet their obligations pursuant to various agreements with us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We rely on third parties to conduct and manage clinical and non-clinical studies of our drug candidates and provide us with other services. Such third party contractors are subject to FDA requirements. Our business and financial viability are dependent on the regulatory compliance of these third parties, and on the strength, validity and terms of our various contracts with these third parties. In addition, if the current adverse economic conditions continue for a prolonged period or become more severe, one or more of our suppliers may be forced to close their business or to refuse or be unable to perform in accordance with our contracts. Any interruption or failure by these third party contractors to meet their obligations pursuant to various agreements with us may be outside of our control and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our cosmetic/cosmeceutical product development program may not be successful. We recently expanded our product development program to include cosmetic/cosmeceutical products, which utilize our patented transdermal delivery system technology, TransdelTM. Because our primary focus will remain on seeking FDA approval for Ketotransdel, we plan to use limited resources on our cosmetic/cosmeceutical development program and, as a result, we will need to partner with third parties to perform formulation, clinical research, manufacturing, sales and marketing activities. We have initial clinical information to support the efficacy of anti-cellulite and anti-aging products, and we are either in or pursuing discussions with potential sales and marketing partners for these products. We cannot assure you that the results of any further studies that may be required before these products can be commercialized will be successful, that we will enter into commercial agreements with third parties for these products on acceptable terms, or at all, or that these products will be successfully commercialized. Even if we are not required to obtain FDA pre-market approval for these products, we will still be subject to a number of federal and state regulations, including regulation by the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission on any marketing claims we make about our products. There is no assurance that we will be successful in developing any other cosmetic/cosmeceutical products, including products for varicose veins and hyperpigmentation. Any products we develop may cause undesirable side effects that could limit their use, require their removal from the market and subject us to adverse regulatory action and product liability claims. Further, the market for cosmetic/cosmeceutical products is highly competitive, and there is no assurance that our products will be able to compete against the many products and treatments currently being offered or under development by other established, well-known and well-financed cosmetic, health care and pharmaceutical companies. We currently have no internal sales and marketing resources and may have to rely on third parties in the event that we successfully commercialize our product. In order to market any of our products in the United States or elsewhere, we must develop internally or obtain access to sales and marketing forces with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capability in the relevant geographic territory. We may not be able to enter into marketing and distribution arrangements or find a corporate partner to market our drug candidates, and we currently do not have the resources or expertise to market and distribute our products ourselves. If we are not able to enter into marketing or distribution arrangements or find a corporate partner who can provide support for commercialization of our products, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products. Moreover, any new marketer or distributor or corporate partner for our specific combinations, with whom we choose to contract may not establish adequate sales and distribution capabilities or gain market acceptance for our products. If we are unable to retain our key personnel or attract additional professional staff, we may be unable to maintain or expand our business. Because of the specialized scientific nature of our business, our ability to develop products and to compete will remain highly dependent, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and commercial personnel. The loss of key scientific, technical and commercial personnel, especially our Chief Executive Officer, Juliet Singh, Ph.D. or the failure to recruit additional key scientific, technical and commercial personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we have consulting agreements with certain key institutions and have an employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer, we cannot assure you that we will succeed in retaining personnel or their services under existing agreements. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical industry, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business. Risks Relating to Our Industry If we are unable to compete with other companies that develop rival products to our products, then we may never gain market share or achieve profitability. The pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive, and we face competition across the full range of our activities. If we fail to compete successfully, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Our competitors include brand name and generic manufacturers of pharmaceuticals specializing in transdermal drug delivery, especially those doing business in the United States. In the market for pain management products, our competitors include manufacturers of over-the-counter and prescription pain relievers. Because we are smaller than many of our national competitors, we may lack the financial and other resources needed to compete for market share in the pain management sector. Our other potential drug candidates will also face intense competition from larger and more well established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Many of these competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and scientific resources than we do. In addition to product safety, development and efficacy, other competitive factors in the pharmaceutical market include product quality and price, reputation, service and access to scientific and technical information. If our products are unable to compete with the products of our competitors, we may never gain market share or achieve profitability. We may not be able to keep up with the rapid technological change in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, which could make our products obsolete and reduce our potential revenues. Biotechnology and related pharmaceutical technologies have undergone and continue to be subject to rapid and significant change. Our future will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies. It is possible that developments by our competitors will render our products and technologies obsolete or unable to compete. Any products that we develop may become obsolete before we recover expenses incurred in developing those products, which may require that we raise additional funds to continue our operations. -11- Table of Contents Our ability to generate revenues will be diminished if we fail to obtain acceptable prices or an adequate level of reimbursement from third-party payors. If we succeed in bringing a specific product to market, we cannot be certain that the products will be considered cost effective and that reimbursement from insurance companies and other third-party payors will be available or, if available, will be sufficient to allow us to sell the products on a competitive basis. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products. Third-party payors, including Medicare, are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Government and other third-party payors increasingly are attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and by refusing, in some cases, to provide coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the FDA has not granted labeling approval. Third-party insurance coverage may not be available to patients for any products we discover and develop, alone or with collaborators. If government and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for our products, the market acceptance of these products may be reduced. Changes in the healthcare industry that are beyond our control may be detrimental to our business. The healthcare industry is changing rapidly as the public, governments, medical professionals and the pharmaceutical industry examine ways to broaden medical coverage while controlling the increase in healthcare costs. Potential changes could put pressure on the prices of prescription pharmaceutical products and reduce our business or prospects. We cannot predict when, if any, proposed healthcare reforms will be implemented or their affect on our business. Risks Relating to the Common Stock We are subject to financial reporting and other requirements for which our accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared. We are subject to reporting and other obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange Act) including the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 required us to conduct an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for this annual report on Form 10-K. Also, we will be required to obtain a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments commencing with our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009. These reporting and other obligations will place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational, and accounting resources. We anticipate that we will need to upgrade our systems; implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; implement an internal audit function; and hire additional accounting, internal audit and finance staff. If we are unable to accomplish these objectives in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired and we may not be able to obtain the independent registered public accounting firm certifications required by Section 404. Any failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a negative impact on our ability to manage our business and on our stock price. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or to prevent fraud. Any inability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our business and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock. Effective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we will not be able to manage our business as effectively, and our business and reputation with investors would be harmed. Any such inabilities to establish effective controls or loss of confidence would have an adverse affect on our financial condition, results of operation and access to capital. We have not performed an in-depth analysis to determine if past failures of internal controls exist, and may in the future discover areas of our internal control that need improvement. Public company compliance may make it more difficult to attract and retain officers and directors. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act and new rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. As a public company, we expect these new rules and regulations to increase our compliance costs and to make certain activities more time consuming and costly. We also expect that these new rules and regulations may make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance in the future and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. -12- Table of Contents Our stock price may be volatile. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:  changes in the pharmaceutical industry and markets;  competitive pricing pressures;  our ability to obtain working capital financing;  new competitors in our market;  additions or departures of key personnel;  limited public float in the hands of a small number of persons whose sales or lack of sales could result in positive or negative pricing pressure on the market price for our common stock;  sales of our common stock;  our ability to execute our business plan;  operating results that fall below expectations;  loss of any strategic relationship with our contract manufacturers and clinical and non-clinical research organizations;  industry or regulatory developments;  economic and other external factors; and  period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock. We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates. Our common stock may be deemed a penny stock, which would make it more difficult for our investors to sell their shares. Our common stock may be subject to the penny stock rules adopted under Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act. The penny stock rules apply to companies whose common stock is not listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market or other national securities exchange and trades at less than $4.00 per share or that have tangible net worth of less than $5,000,000 ($2,000,000 if the company has been operating for three or more years). These rules require, among other things, that brokers who trade penny stock to persons other than established customers complete certain documentation, make suitability inquiries of investors and provide investors with certain information concerning trading in the security, including a risk disclosure document and quote information under certain circumstances. Many brokers have decided not to trade penny stocks because of the requirements of the penny stock rules and, as a result, the number of broker-dealers willing to act as market makers in such securities is limited. If we remain subject to the penny stock rules for any significant period, it could have an adverse effect on the market, if any, for our securities. If our securities are subject to the penny stock rules, investors will find it more difficult to dispose of our securities. Furthermore, for companies whose securities are traded in the OTC Bulletin Board, it is more difficult (1) to obtain accurate quotations, (2) to obtain coverage for significant news events because major wire services generally do not publish press releases about such companies and (3) to obtain needed capital. -13- Table of Contents Offers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline. The sale by our stockholders of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or upon the expiration of any statutory holding period, under Rule 144, or upon expiration of lock-up periods applicable to outstanding shares, or issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an overhang and in anticipation of which the market price of our common stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make more difficult our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate. Our directors and executive officers can exert significant control over our business and affairs and may have actual or potential interests that may depart from those of our other stockholders. Our directors and executive officers together beneficially own a significant percentage of our issued and outstanding common stock, which percentage may increase in the event that they exercise any options or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock that they may hold or in the future are granted to them. The interests of such persons may differ from the interests of other stockholders. Such persons will have significant influence over all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, irrespective of how our other stockholders may vote, including the following actions:  the election of our directors;  amendment of our Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws; and  mergers, sales of assets or other corporate transactions. Concentration of stock ownership among a few stockholders may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price. Raising additional funds by issuing securities or through collaboration and licensing arrangements may cause dilution to existing stockholders, restrict operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights. We may raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders ownership will be diluted. In addition, if we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our potential products or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. Further, we may not be able to obtain additional funding, particularly if the volatile conditions in the stock and financial markets, and more particularly the market for pharmaceutical company stocks, persist. If we are unable to obtain additional funding, we may be required to delay, further reduce the scope of or discontinue one or more of our research and development projects, sell the company or certain of its assets or technologies, or dissolve and liquidate the companys assets.
