Item 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference into this report, including the risk factors listed below. Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows, and could cause our actual results to differ materially from our plans, projections, or other forward-looking statements included in “Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings. The occurrence of one or more of these risks could also materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock. We require additional financing to sustain our operations, and there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. During fiscal 2010, we incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $1,663,028 and had an excess of current liabilities compared to current assets of $5,556,284. The loss from continuing operations and working capital deficit raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Borrowings available under the credit agreement we entered into with PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC”) on January 27, 2011, along with our cash flow may not be sufficient to fund our operations and we may need to seek additional financing. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available at all or will be available at acceptable terms. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of the carrying amount of recorded assets or the amount of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Due to a material weakness, our internal controls over financial reporting were determined not to be effective for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010. Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not be effective in future periods as a result of existing or newly identified material weaknesses in internal controls. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be harmed. Pursuant to the Sarbanes−Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management’s assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be adversely impacted, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price could be adversely affected. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the design of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that, subject to the inherent limitations identified in Item 9A of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10−K, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2010 due to our independent registered public accounting firm identifying the existence of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting because we did not correctly account for the conversion feature in the convertible note issued to Rockport Investments Ltd. (“Rockport”) on March 31, 2010, as further described in Item 9A of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10−K. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We intend to take appropriate and reasonable steps to make the necessary improvements to remediate these deficiencies. We cannot be certain that our remediation efforts will ensure that our management designs, implements and maintains adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or will be sufficient to address and eliminate the material weakness identified. Our inability to remedy the identified material weakness or any additional deficiencies or material weaknesses that may be identified in the future could, among other things, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as impair our ability to meet our quarterly, annual and other reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in a timely manner, and require us to incur additional costs and to divert management resources. Current economic conditions and reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business. Our business depends on the overall demand for IT and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers. The purchase of our services may be discretionary and may require our customers to make significant commitments of capital. During the economic downturn, business spending on IT decreased. Continued weak economic conditions, or a reduction in IT spending even as economic conditions improve, could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flow, particularly through reduced contracts for service and lower prices for our services, difficulty in the collection of our accounts receivable and lower recoverability of assets. 9 We may experience difficulties in scaling our operations to react to economic pressures in the U.S. In order to continue to increase sales and marketing efforts, to expand and enhance the solutions and services we are able to offer to current and future customers and to fund potential acquisitions, we will require additional capital that may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. As a consequence, we will be required to raise additional capital through public or private equity or debt financings, collaborative relationships, bank facilities or other arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources, all of which have contracted sharply in the last three years. Any additional equity financing is expected to be dilutive to stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and increased interest costs. We have financed our operations to date primarily through private sales of equity securities, loans from related parties and business associates, and debt financing through banks. In addition, if unforeseen difficulties arise in the course of these capital-raising or other aspects of our business, we may be required to spend funds in an amount greater than anticipated. Such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds when needed, it may require us to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our expansion programs or to limit the marketing of our services. Any such disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged. Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future discretionary uses of cash. We also continue to explore other ways to maximize the value of the Company for its stockholders. The Company has not achieved profitability in each reporting period and may incur net losses in future quarters. The Company has a history of operating losses, including a loss from continuing operations of approximately $1,663,028 for fiscal 2010 and a loss from continuing operations of approximately $3,211,921 for fiscal 2009. We may incur additional operating losses in the future. Operating expenses may increase as we seek to grow our business through acquisition and as our existing business expands. Even if we achieve consistent profitability, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or be able to raise capital in sufficient amounts to enable us to continue to expand our business. An inability to sustain profitability may also result in an impairment loss in the value of our long-lived assets, principally goodwill, property and equipment, and other tangible and intangible assets. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or raise capital in sufficient amounts, our business will be materially and adversely affected. Termination of a contract by a significant customer and/or cancellation with short notice, or failure by us to attract new customers and replace customers not renewing their contracts, could reduce our revenue and profitability and adversely affect our financial condition. For fiscal 2010, our largest customer accounted for approximately 8% of revenues. Non-renewal or termination of contracts with a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business. A large portion of our revenues were derived from professional services that are generally non-recurring in nature. There can be no assurance that we will obtain additional contracts for projects similar in scope to those previously obtained from our principal customers or any other customer, that we will be able to retain existing customers or attract new customers or that we will not remain largely dependent on a limited customer base, which may continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues. In addition, we may be subject to delays in customer funding; non-renewal; delay, termination, reduction or modification of contracts in the event of changes in customer policies or as a result of budgetary constraints; and increased or unexpected costs resulting in losses under fixed-fee contracts. 10 Our success in meeting growth targets is dependent on our ability to maintain existing clients and to continually attract and retain new customers to replace customers who have not renewed their contracts. Achieving significant market acceptance requires substantial effort and expenditures on our part to create awareness of our services. An unexpected shortfall in revenues in relation to our expenses, or significant bad debt experience, could materially and adversely affect our business. Revenues are difficult to forecast. We may increase our corporate overhead expenses as we integrate past and future acquisitions and we build an infrastructure to implement our strategy. Meanwhile, our business units may increase their operating expenses for sales, marketing and technical personnel to sell, provide and support their products and services. Additionally, at any given point in time, and especially in the current challenging economic climate, we may have significant accounts receivable balances with customers that expose us to credit risks. If we have an unexpected shortfall in revenues in relation to our expenses, or significant bad debt experience, our business could be materially and adversely affected. IT services are subject to uncertain demand due to emerging and evolving markets and technology. The markets for some of our services are changing rapidly and evolving and, therefore, the ultimate level of demand for our services is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Any significant decline in demand for programming and applications development and IT consulting services could materially adversely affect our business and prospects. Significant technological changes could render our existing products and services obsolete. To be successful, we must adapt to this rapidly changing market by continually improving the responsiveness, functionality and features of our products and services to meet customers' needs. If we are unable to respond to technological advances and conform to emerging industry standards in a cost-effective and timely manner, our business could be materially and adversely affected. The IT services industry is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively. Competition for our IT solutions is significant, and we expect that competition will continue to intensify due to the low barriers to entry. We may not have the financial resources, technical expertise, sales and marketing or support capabilities to successfully meet this competition. If we are unable to compete successfully against our competitors, our business will be adversely affected. We compete against numerous large companies that have substantially greater market presence, longer operating histories, more significant customer bases, and greater financial, technical, facilities, marketing, capital and other resources than we have. Our competitors include national, regional and local IT consulting service providers, software development firms and major accounting and consulting firms such as Accenture, Cap Gemini, Deloitte, IBM Global Services, Keane, KForce and MPS Group. 11 In addition, we also encounter competition from numerous other businesses that provide one or more similar goods or services, including numerous resellers of Internet-related hardware and software and web-site development companies. Our competitors may respond more quickly than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Our competitors may also devote greater resources than we can to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services. They may develop products and services that are superior to or have greater market acceptance than ours. Competitors may also engage in more extensive research and development, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to our existing and potential employees and strategic partners. In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further impact our ability to effectively compete. New competitors, including large computer hardware, software, professional services and other technology and telecommunications companies, may enter our markets and rapidly acquire significant market share. As a result of increased competition and vertical and horizontal integration in the industry, we could encounter significant pricing pressures. These pricing pressures could result in significantly lower average selling prices for our products and services. We may not be able to offset the effects of any price reductions with an increase in the number of customers, higher revenue from consulting services, cost reductions or otherwise. In addition, professional services businesses are likely to encounter consolidation in the near future, which could result in decreased pricing and other competition. Moreover, there is a high degree of competition among companies seeking to acquire IT service companies such as those we have historically targeted for acquisition. We are and will continue to be a minor participant in the business of seeking business relationships with, and acquisitions of, such companies. A large number of established and, in some cases, well-financed entities, including venture capital and private equity firms, are active in acquiring companies that we may find desirable acquisition candidates. Many of these investment-oriented entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do. Consequently, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in negotiating and executing possible investments in these entities. Entrepreneur-founders of privately held IT service companies, including those suffering as a result of the volatile economic climate of recent years and those facing potential bankruptcy restructuring or liquidation, generally place greater emphasis on gaining access to capital than obtaining the management skills and networking services that we can provide. Even if we are able to successfully compete with these other entities, this competition may affect the terms and conditions of potential acquisitions and, as a result, we may pay more than expected for targeted companies. If we cannot acquire interests in attractive companies on reasonable terms, our growth by acquisition strategy may not succeed. Operations interruptions caused by systems failures could adversely affect our business. Our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware systems and infrastructure. We currently maintain most of our computer systems in our facilities in New York, New York and at business unit offices in Burlington, Massachusetts, Carmel, Indiana, West Chester, Ohio, Indianapolis, Indiana, Jacksonville, Florida, Alpharetta, Georgia, and Makati City, Philippines. Interruptions could result from natural disasters, as well as power loss, telecommunications failure and similar events. We also lease telecommunications lines from local and regional carriers, whose service may be interrupted. Any damage or failure that interrupts or delays network operations could materially and adversely affect our business. 12 Security breaches could expose our Company to a risk of loss or liability. Our infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, viruses or similar problems. If a person or entity circumvents our security measures, they could jeopardize the security of confidential information stored on our systems, misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations. We may be required to make significant additional investments and efforts to protect against or remedy security breaches. Security breaches that result in access to confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or liability. Acquisitions or divestitures of our business may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We continually assess our business and may decide to buy or sell businesses. The purchase or sale of any significant business increases demands on management by diverting their attention away from the day-to-day operations of our business, and also increases demands on financial resources and information and internal control systems. Successful integration of a new business is not guaranteed, and the divestiture of an existing business could reduce our future operating cash flows and revenues, make our financial results more volatile, and/or cause a decline in revenues. A divestiture could also cause a decline in the price of our common stock and increase reliance on other elements of our core business operations. If we do not successfully manage the risks associated with an acquisition or divestiture, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, there could be other negative unforeseen effects from an acquisition or divestiture. See also “Risk Factor – We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or successfully integrate their operations with our own” and “Risk Factor - Unsuccessful acquisitions could adversely affect our business.” During the second quarter of 2010, we hired an investment banker to research several potential alternative strategies. These strategies include evaluation of acquisition targets, the potential sale or merger of the Company or ZCS, and/or voluntary delistment off of the Nasdaq exchange. All strategies are being deliberated as a means of enhancing shareholder value. However there is no assurance that any of these strategic alternatives will be accomplished. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or successfully integrate their operations with our own. A key element of our expansion strategy is to grow through acquisitions. If we identify suitable candidates, we may not be able to make investments or acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms. Acquisitions may cause a disruption of our ongoing business, distract management, require other resources and make it difficult to maintain our standards, controls and procedures. We may not be able to retain key employees of the acquired companies or maintain good relations with their customers or suppliers. We may be required to incur additional debt, if available, and we may be required to issue equity securities, which may be dilutive to existing stockholders, to fund acquisitions. 13 Unsuccessful acquisitions could adversely affect our business. There can be no assurance that any completed acquisition will enhance our business. Since the normal consideration in our acquisitions comprises both cash and shares of our common stock, if we proceed with one or more significant acquisitions, the potential impacts are (1) a substantial portion of our available cash could be used to consummate the acquisitions and/or we could incur or assume significant amounts of additional indebtedness, and (2) our stockholders could suffer significant dilution of their interest in our common stock. Also, acquisitions are required to be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, which results in us recording significant amounts of goodwill. The inability of a subsidiary to sustain profitability may result in an impairment loss in the value associated with that subsidiary, principally goodwill. In accordance with accounting standards, purchased goodwill should not be amortized, but rather, should be periodically reviewed for impairment. Such impairment could be caused by internal factors as well as external factors beyond our control. Furthermore, at the time goodwill is considered impaired, an amount equal to the impairment loss should be charged as an operating expense in the statement of operations. The timing of such an impairment (if any) of goodwill acquired in past and future transactions is uncertain and difficult to predict. Our results of operations in periods following any such impairment could be materially adversely affected. We are required, no more frequently, than annually, to determine whether goodwill acquired in past acquisitions has been impaired in accordance with accounting standards, and, if so, charge such impairment as an expense. We have goodwill of approximately $17.8 million at December 31, 2010, so if we are required to take any such impairment charges, or if financial analysts or investors believe we may need to take such action in the future, our stock price and operating results could be materially adversely affected. We review for impairment annually on October 1, or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed fair value. Due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and customer demand, it is possible that our actual business operations will differ from the forecasts we used to support our goodwill. Significant judgments are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill including estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates, estimating the applicable tax rates and interest rates, projecting the future industry trends and market conditions, and making other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions, including changes in our reporting structure, could materially affect our determinations of fair value. Our success depends on our retaining key personnel. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the sectors in which we operate. The loss of existing personnel or the failure to recruit additional qualified managerial, technical, and sales personnel, as well as expenses in connection with hiring and retaining personnel, could adversely affect our business. We also depend on the performance of our executive officers and key employees, most of who have not entered into employment agreements. 14 As of December 31, 2010, we had 218 full-time employees. We will need to attract, train and retain more employees for management, engineering, programming, sales and marketing, and customer service and support positions. Competition for qualified employees, particularly engineers, programmers and consultants continues to be high. Because of the competition in our industry and other reasons, we may not be successful in attracting, training and retaining the people we need to continue to offer solutions and services to present and future customers in a cost effective manner or at all. We may be subject to liability for the use of third-party intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We may receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, including claims regarding patents, copyrights, and trademarks. In addition, former employers of our former, current, or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers. Any such claim, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and distract management from day-to-day operations. If we are not successful in defending such claims, we could be required to stop providing our services, pay monetary amounts as damages, enter into royalty or licensing arrangements, or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers. We cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we license and use software from third parties in our business. These third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and may expose us to additional liability. This liability, or our inability to use any of this third party software, could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Fluctuation in quarterly operating results may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. Our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, not all of which are within our control. Quarter to quarter comparisons of the results of operations as an indication of future performance should not be relied upon. It is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our common stock may fall. Factors that could cause quarterly results to fluctuate include: · change in customer demand for, or the inability of our customers to pay for, our products and services; · timing of the expansion of operations; · changes in pricing by us or our competitors; · introduction of new products or services by competitors or Zanett; · costs related to acquisitions of technology or businesses; · continued volatility in the U.S. economy or a slow economic recovery; or · termination or non-renewal of customer contracts. 15 Changes in government regulations may adversely impact our business. There are an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the Internet. These laws and regulations relate to liability for information received from or transmitted over the Internet, online content regulation, user privacy, taxation and quality of products and services. The government may also seek to regulate some segments of our activities as basic telecommunications services. Moreover, the applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing intellectual property ownership and infringement, copyright, trademark, trade secret, obscenity, libel, employment, personal privacy and other issues is uncertain and developing. We cannot predict the impact, if any, that future regulation or regulatory changes may have on our business. We may be faced with potential claims for liability if we cannot adequately meet our customers’ expectations. Our services involve development, implementation and maintenance of computer systems and computer software that are critical to the operations of our customers' businesses. Our failure or inability to meet a customer's expectations in the performance of our services could harm our business reputation or result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure or inability. In addition, in the course of performing services, our personnel often gain access to technologies and content that includes confidential or proprietary customer information. Any such unauthorized disclosure or use could result in a claim for substantial damages. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that are uninsured, exceed available insurance coverage or result in changes to our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of a large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could adversely affect us. We may become subject to legal claims relating to the content in the web sites we may host or in email messages that we transmit. The law relating to the liability of online service providers, private network operators and Internet service providers for information carried on or disseminated through their networks is currently unsettled. We may become subject to legal claims relating to the content in the web sites we may host or in email messages that we transmit. For example, lawsuits may be brought against us claiming that material inappropriate for viewing by young children can be accessed from the web sites we may host. Claims could also involve matters such as defamation, invasion of privacy and copyright infringement. Providers of Internet products and services have been sued in the past, sometimes successfully, based on the content of material. If we have to take costly measures to reduce our exposure to these risks, or are required to defend ourselves against such claims, our business may be materially adversely affected. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of future sales by existing stockholders. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by existing stockholders of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or the perception that these sales may occur. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to issue equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that it reflects fair value. As of December 31, 2010, we had granted options to purchase 1,416,148 shares under our 2001 Stock Option Plan, as amended. The total number of options authorized under the 2001 Stock Option Plan, as amended, is 10,000,000. 16 If the holders of these options and any other options we have issued were to exercise their rights and sell the shares issued to them, it could have an adverse effect on the market price of the common stock. We have not historically paid, and do not anticipate in the foreseeable future paying cash dividends on our common stock. We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Instead, we intend to retain future earnings for reinvestment in our business and/or to fund future acquisitions. Our former credit facility with Bank of America, and the credit agreement we entered into with PNC on January 27, 2011 prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends, except for dividends or other distributions made by ZCS to us and except after meeting certain conditions that we do not currently satisfy. The concentrated ownership of our Company may discourage potential transactions involving Zanett. Claudio Guazzoni, our Chief Executive Officer owned approximately 22.8% of the outstanding common stock as of April 14, 2011, and in addition, Mr. Guazzoni’s uncle, Bruno Guazzoni, owned, as of April 14, 2011, approximately 26.2% of the outstanding common stock. Moreover, as a result of the voting agreement entered into between Claudio Guazzoni and Rockport Investments, Ltd. (“Rockport”) on March 31, 2010, Mr. Guazzoni will have the right to vote an additional approximately 32.4% of the outstanding Common Stock. As a result, the Guazzoni family possesses significant influence over Zanett’s decision making on business matters, including the election of directors. The concentration of Zanett share ownership may: · delay or prevent a change in the control of Zanett; · impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other transaction involving our Company; or · discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of Zanett. Our rapid growth has strained, and may continue to strain, managerial and operational resources. Our rapid growth has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a significant strain on managerial and operational resources. Further, as we grow, we will be required to manage multiple relationships with various customers, strategic partners and other third parties. Further growth or an increase in the number of strategic relationships may increase this strain on existing managerial and operational resources, inhibiting our ability to successfully implement our strategy without incurring additional corporate expenses. Our future growth is dependent on producing revenue sufficient to cover increasing expenses. Expenses will increase as we continue to build our infrastructure to implement our strategy. We expect to hire additional employees and expand information technology systems. We also may increase our operating expenses to: 17 · broaden our support capabilities for our clients; · explore acquisition opportunities and alliances with other companies; and · facilitate business arrangements among our business units. If the higher expenses are not accompanied by increased revenue, our earnings will be lower than anticipated or we may incur losses.
