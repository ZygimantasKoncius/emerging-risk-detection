ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  (Continued) Visteons emergence from bankruptcy will reduce the Companys U.S. net operating losses and other tax attributes and limit the ability to offset future U.S. taxable income with tax losses and credits incurred prior to the emergence from bankruptcy. The discharge of a debt obligation by a taxpayer in a bankruptcy proceeding for an amount less than its adjusted issue price (as defined for tax purposes) generally creates cancellation of indebtedness income (CODI), that is excludable from a taxpayers taxable income. However certain tax attributes otherwise available and of value to a debtor will be reduced to the extent of the excludable CODI. Additionally, Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383 provide an annual limitation with respect to the ability of a corporation to utilize its tax attributes, as well as certain built-in-losses, against future U.S. taxable income in the event of a change in ownership. As a result of Visteons emergence from bankruptcy the Company expects to have excludable CODI that will reduce the U.S. net operating losses and other tax attributes and the Company expects a limitation under Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383 as a result of an ownership change.
