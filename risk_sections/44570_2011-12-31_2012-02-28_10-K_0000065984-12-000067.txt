As discussed in more detail in “Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business,” in December 2011, Entergy entered into an agreement to spin off its transmission business and merge it with a newly-formed subsidiary of ITC Holdings Corp. · The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business segment includes the ownership and operation of six nuclear power plants located in the northern United States and the sale of the electric power produced by those plants to wholesale customers. This business also provides services to other nuclear power plant owners. Entergy Wholesale Commodities also owns interests in non-nuclear power plants that sell the electric power produced by those plants to wholesale customers. Following are the percentages of Entergy’s consolidated revenues and net income generated by its operating segments and the percentage of total assets held by them: % of Revenue % of Net Income % of Total Assets Segment 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Utility 79 78 75 82 65 57 80 80 80 Entergy Wholesale Commodities 21 22 25 36 39 51 26 26 30 Parent & Other - - - (18) (4) (8) (6) (6) (10) 1 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis Results of Operations 2011 Compared to 2010 Following are income statement variances for Utility, Entergy Wholesale Commodities, Parent & Other, and Entergy comparing 2011 to 2010 showing how much the line item increased or (decreased) in comparison to the prior period: Utility Entergy Wholesale Commodities Parent & Other Entergy (In Thousands) 2010 Consolidated Net Income (Loss) $829,719 $489,422 ($48,836) $1,270,305 Net revenue (operating revenue less fuel expense, purchased power, and other regulatory charges/credits) (146,947) (155,898) 3,620 (299,225) Other operation and maintenance expenses 1,674 (141,588) 38,270 (101,644) Taxes other than income taxes 248 1,083 396 1,727 Depreciation and amortization 16,326 16,008 (26) 32,308 Gain on sale of business - (44,173) - (44,173) Other income (3,388) (39,717) 1,799 (41,306) Interest expense (37,502) (51,183) 27,145 (61,540) Other 1,688 (23,334) - (21,646) Income taxes (benefit) (426,916) (43,193) 139,133 (330,976) 2011 Consolidated Net Income (Loss) $1,123,866 $491,841 ($248,335) $1,367,372 Refer to “SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA - FIVE-YEAR COMPARISON OF ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES” which accompanies Entergy Corporation’s financial statements in this report for further information with respect to operating statistics. Net income for Utility in 2011 was significantly affected by a settlement with the IRS related to the mark-to-market income tax treatment of power purchase contracts, which resulted in a reduction in income tax expense. The net income effect was partially offset by a regulatory charge, which reduced net revenue, because a portion of the benefits will be shared with customers. See Notes 3 and 8 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the settlement and benefit sharing. 2 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis Net Revenue Utility Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2011 to 2010. Amount (In Millions) 2010 net revenue $5,051 Mark-to-market tax settlement sharing (196) Purchased power capacity (21) Net wholesale revenue (14) Volume/weather 13 ANO decommissioning trust 24 Retail electric price 49 Other (2) 2011 net revenue $4,904 The mark-to-market tax settlement sharing variance results from a regulatory charge because a portion of the benefits of a settlement with the IRS related to the mark-to-market income tax treatment of power purchase contracts will be shared with customers, slightly offset by the amortization of a portion of that charge beginning in October 2011. See Notes 3 and 8 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the settlement and benefit sharing. The purchased power capacity variance is primarily due to price increases for ongoing purchased power capacity and additional capacity purchases. The net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to lower margins on co-owner contracts and higher wholesale energy costs. The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 2,061 GWh in weather-adjusted usage across all sectors. Weather-adjusted residential retail sales growth reflected an increase in the number of customers. Industrial sales growth has continued since the beginning of 2010. Entergy’s service territory has benefited from the national manufacturing economy and exports, as well as industrial facility expansions. Increases have been offset to some extent by declines in the paper, wood products, and pipeline segments. The increase was also partially offset by the effect of less favorable weather on residential sales. The ANO decommissioning trust variance is primarily related to the deferral of investment gains from the ANO 1 and 2 decommissioning trust in 2010 in accordance with regulatory treatment. The gains resulted in an increase in interest and investment income in 2010 and a corresponding increase in regulatory charges with no effect on net income. The retail electric price variance is primarily due to: · rate actions at Entergy Texas, including a base rate increase effective August 2010 and an additional increase beginning May 2011; · a formula rate plan increase at Entergy Louisiana effective May 2011; and · a base rate increase at Entergy Arkansas effective July 2010. These were partially offset by formula rate plan decreases at Entergy New Orleans effective October 2010 and October 2011. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of these proceedings. 3 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis Entergy Wholesale Commodities Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2011 to 2010. Amount (In Millions) 2010 net revenue $2,200 Realized price changes (159) Fuel expenses (30) Harrison County (27) Volume 60 2011 net revenue $2,044 As shown in the table above, net revenue for Entergy Wholesale Commodities decreased by $156 million, or 7%, in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to: · lower pricing in its contracts to sell power; · higher fuel expenses, primarily at the nuclear plants; and · the absence of the Harrison County plant, which was sold in December 2010. These factors were partially offset by higher volume resulting from fewer planned and unplanned outage days in 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. Following are key performance measures for Entergy Wholesale Commodities for 2011 and 2010: 2011 2010 Owned capacity 6,599 6,351 GWh billed 43,520 42,682 Average realized price per MWh $54.48 $59.04 Entergy Wholesale Commodities Nuclear Fleet Capacity factor 93% 90% GWh billed 40,918 39,655 Average realized revenue per MWh $54.73 $59.16 Refueling Outage Days: FitzPatrick - 35 Indian Point 2 - 33 Indian Point 3 30 - Palisades - 26 Pilgrim 25 - Vermont Yankee 25 29 Realized Revenue per MWh for Entergy Wholesale Commodities Nuclear Plants The recent economic downturn and negative trends in the energy commodity markets have resulted in lower natural gas prices and therefore lower market prices for electricity in the New York and New England power regions, which is where five of the six Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are located. Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear business experienced a decrease in realized price per MWh to $54.73 in 2011 from $59.16 in 2010, and is likely to experience a decrease again in 2012 because, as shown in the contracted sale of energy table in “Market and Credit Risk Sensitive Instruments,” Entergy Wholesale Commodities has sold forward 88% of its planned nuclear energy output for 2012 for an average contracted energy price of $49 per MWh. In addition, Entergy Wholesale Commodities has sold forward 81% of its planned energy output for 2013 for an average contracted energy price range of $45-50 per MWh. 4 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis Other Income Statement Items Utility Other operation and maintenance expenses increased from $1,949 million for 2010 to $1,951 million for 2011 primarily due to: · an increase of $17 million in nuclear expenses primarily due to higher labor costs, including higher contract labor; · an increase of $15 million in contract costs due to the transition and implementation of joining the MISO RTO; · an increase of $9 million in legal expenses primarily resulting from an increase in legal and regulatory activity increasing the use of outside legal services; · an increase of $8 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses primarily due to the addition of Acadia Unit 2 in April 2011; and · several individually insignificant items. These increases were substantially offset by: · a decrease of $29 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily resulting from an increase in the accrual for incentive-based compensation in 2010 and a decrease in stock option expense. The decrease in stock option expense is offset by credits recorded by the parent company, Entergy Corporation; · the deferral in 2011 of $13.4 million of 2010 Michoud plant maintenance costs pursuant to the settlement of Entergy New Orleans’ 2010 test year formula rate plan filing approved by the City Council in September 2011. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the 2010 test year formula rate plan filing and settlement; · the amortization of $11 million of Entergy Texas rate case expenses in 2010. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the Entergy Texas rate case settlement; and · a decrease of $10 million in operating expenses due to the sale of surplus oil inventory in 2011. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation rates at Entergy Arkansas as a result of the rate case settlement agreement approved by the APSC in June 2010. Interest expense decreased primarily due to: · the refinancing of long-term debt at lower interest rates by certain of the Utility operating companies; · a revision caused by FERC’s acceptance of a change in the treatment of funds received from independent power producers for transmission interconnection projects; and · interest expense accrued in 2010 related to the expected result of the LPSC Staff audit of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s fuel adjustment clause for the period 1995 through 2004. 5 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis Entergy Wholesale Commodities Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased from $1,047 million for 2010 to $905 million for 2011 primarily due to: · the write-off of $64 million of capital costs in 2010, primarily for software that would not be utilized, and $16 million of additional costs incurred in 2010 in connection with Entergy’s decision to unwind the infrastructure created for the planned spin-off of its non-utility nuclear business; · a decrease of $30 million due to the absence of expenses from the Harrison County plant, which was sold in December 2010; · a decrease in compensation and benefits costs resulting from an increase of $19 million in the accrual for incentive-based compensation in 2010; · a decrease of $12 million in spending on tritium remediation work; and · the write-off of $10 million of capitalized engineering costs in 2010 associated with a potential uprate project. The gain on sale resulted from the sale in 2010 of Entergy’s ownership interest in the Harrison County Power Project 550 MW combined-cycle plant to two Texas electric cooperatives that owned a minority share of the plant. Entergy sold its 61 percent share of the plant for $219 million and realized a pre-tax gain of $44.2 million on the sale. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service and declining useful life of nuclear assets. Other income decreased primarily due to a decrease in interest income earned on loans to the parent company, Entergy Corporation, and a decrease of $13 million in realized earnings on decommissioning trust fund investments. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the write-off of $39 million of debt financing costs in 2010, primarily incurred for a $1.2 billion credit facility that will not be used, in connection with Entergy’s decision to unwind the infrastructure created for the planned spin-off of its non-utility nuclear business. Other expenses decreased primarily due to a credit to decommissioning expense of $34.1 million in 2011 resulting from a reduction in the decommissioning liability for a plant as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study obtained to comply with a state regulatory requirement. See “Critical Accounting Estimates – Nuclear Decommissioning Costs” below for further discussion of accounting for asset retirement obligations. Parent & Other Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to lower intercompany stock option credits recorded by the parent company, Entergy Corporation, and an increase of $13 million related to the planned spin-off and merger of Entergy’s transmission business. See “Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business” below for further discussion. Interest expense increased primarily due to $1 billion of Entergy Corporation senior notes issued in September 2010, with the proceeds used to pay down borrowings outstanding on Entergy Corporation’s revolving credit facility that were at a lower interest rate. 6 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis Income Taxes The effective income tax rate for 2011 was 17.3%. The difference in the effective income tax rate versus the statutory rate of 35% in 2011 was primarily due to a settlement with the IRS related to the mark-to-market income tax treatment of power purchase contracts, which resulted in a reduction in income tax expense of $422 million. See Note 3 to the financial statements herein for further discussion of the settlement. The effective income tax rate for 2010 was 32.7%. The difference in the effective income tax rate versus the statutory rate of 35% in 2010 was primarily due to: · a favorable Tax Court decision holding that the U.K. Windfall Tax may be used as a credit for purposes of computing the U.S. foreign tax credit, which allowed Entergy to reverse a provision for uncertain tax positions of $43 million, included in Parent and Other, on the issue. See Note 3 to the financial statements for further discussion of this tax litigation; · a $19 million tax benefit recorded in connection with Entergy’s decision to unwind the infrastructure created for the planned spin-off of its non-utility nuclear business; and · the recognition of a $14 million Louisiana state income tax benefit related to storm cost financing. Partially offsetting the decreased effective income tax rate was a charge of $16 million resulting from a change in tax law associated with the recently enacted federal healthcare legislation, as discussed below in “Critical Accounting Estimates” and state income taxes and certain book and tax differences for Utility plant items. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to the effective income tax rates, and for additional discussion regarding income taxes. 2010 Compared to 2009 Following are income statement variances for Utility, Entergy Wholesale Commodities, Parent & Other, and Entergy comparing 2010 to 2009 showing how much the line item increased or (decreased) in comparison to the prior period: Utility Entergy Wholesale Commodities Parent & Other Entergy (In Thousands) 2009 Consolidated Net Income (Loss) $708,905 $641,094 ($98,949) $1,251,050 Net revenue (operating revenue less fuel expense, purchased power, and other regulatory charges/credits) 357,211 (163,518) 8,622 202,315 Other operation and maintenance expenses 112,384 124,758 (18,550) 218,592 Taxes other than income taxes 28,872 2,717 (1,149) 30,440 Depreciation and amortization (24,112) 11,413 (182) (12,881) Gain on sale of business - 44,173 - 44,173 Other income (14,915) 66,222 (25,681) 25,626 Interest expense 31,035 (6,461) (19,851) 4,723 Other 7,758 19,728 - 27,486 Income taxes 65,545 (53,606) (27,440) (15,501) 2010 Consolidated Net Income (Loss) $829,719 $489,422 ($48,836) $1,270,305 7 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis Refer to “SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA - FIVE-YEAR COMPARISON OF ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES” which accompanies Entergy Corporation’s financial statements in this report for further information with respect to operating statistics. In November 2007 the Board approved a plan to pursue a separation of Entergy’s non-utility nuclear business from Entergy through a spin-off of the business to Entergy shareholders. In April 2010, Entergy announced that it planned to unwind the business infrastructure associated with the proposed spin-off transaction. As a result of the plan to unwind the business infrastructure, Entergy recorded expenses in 2010 for the write-off of certain capitalized costs incurred in connection with the planned spin-off transaction. These costs are discussed in more detail below and throughout this section. Net Revenue Utility Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2010 to 2009. Amount (In Millions) 2009 net revenue $4,694 Volume/weather 231 Retail electric price 137 Provision for regulatory proceedings 26 Rough production cost equalization 19 ANO decommissioning trust (24) Fuel recovery (44) Other 12 2010 net revenue $5,051 The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 8,362 GWh, or 8%, in billed electricity usage in all retail sectors, including the effect on the residential sector of colder weather in the first quarter 2010 compared to 2009 and warmer weather in the second and third quarters 2010 compared to 2009. The industrial sector reflected strong sales growth on continuing signs of economic recovery. The improvement in this sector was primarily driven by inventory restocking and strong exports with the chemicals, refining, and miscellaneous manufacturing sectors leading the improvement. The retail electric price variance is primarily due to: · increases in the formula rate plan riders at Entergy Gulf States Louisiana effective November 2009, January 2010, and September 2010, at Entergy Louisiana effective November 2009, and at Entergy Mississippi effective July 2009; · a base rate increase at Entergy Arkansas effective July 2010; · rate actions at Entergy Texas, including base rate increases effective in May and August 2010; · a formula rate plan provision of $16.6 million recorded in the third quarter 2009 for refunds that were made to customers in accordance with settlements approved by the LPSC; and · the recovery in 2009 by Entergy Arkansas of 2008 extraordinary storm costs, as approved by the APSC, which ceased in January 2010. The recovery of storm costs is offset in other operation and maintenance expenses. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the proceedings referred to above. 8 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis The provision for regulatory proceedings variance is primarily due to provisions recorded in 2009 at Entergy Arkansas. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of regulatory proceedings affecting Entergy Arkansas. The rough production cost equalization variance is due to an additional $18.6 million allocation recorded in the second quarter of 2009 for 2007 rough production cost equalization receipts ordered by the PUCT to Texas retail customers over what was originally allocated to Entergy Texas prior to the jurisdictional separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, effective December 2007, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements. The ANO decommissioning trust variance is primarily related to the deferral of investment gains from the ANO 1 and 2 decommissioning trust in 2010 in accordance with regulatory treatment. The gains resulted in an increase in interest and investment income in 2010 and a corresponding increase in regulatory charges with no effect on net income. The fuel recovery variance resulted primarily from an adjustment to deferred fuel costs in the fourth quarter 2009 relating to unrecovered nuclear fuel costs incurred since January 2008 that will now be recovered after a revision to the fuel adjustment clause methodology. Entergy Wholesale Commodities Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2010 to 2009. Amount (In Millions) 2009 net revenue $2,364 Nuclear realized price changes (96) Nuclear volume (60) Other (8) 2010 net revenue $2,200 As shown in the table above, net revenue for Entergy Wholesale Commodities decreased by $164 million, or 7%, in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to results from its nuclear operations. The net revenue decrease was primarily due to lower pricing in its contracts to sell nuclear power and lower nuclear volume resulting from more planned and unplanned outage days in 2010. Included in net revenue is $46 million and $53 million of amortization of the Palisades purchased power agreement in 2010 and 2009, respectively, which is non-cash revenue and is discussed in Note 15 to the financial statements. Following are key performance measures for Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear plants for 2010 and 2009: 2010 2009 Net MW in operation at December 31 4,998 4,998 Average realized revenue per MWh $59.16 $61.07 GWh billed 39,655 40,981 Capacity factor 90% 93% Refueling Outage Days: FitzPatrick 35 - Indian Point 2 33 - Indian Point 3 - 36 Palisades 26 41 Pilgrim - 31 Vermont Yankee 29 - 9 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis Overall, including its non-nuclear plants, Entergy Wholesale Commodities billed 42,682 GWh in 2010 and 43,969 GWh in 2009, with average realized revenue per MWh of $59.04 in 2010 and $60.46 in 2009. Other Income Statement Items Utility Other operation and maintenance expenses increased from $1,837 million for 2009 to $1,949 million for 2010 primarily due to: · an increase of $70 million in compensation and benefits costs, resulting from decreasing discount rates, the amortization of benefit trust asset losses, and an increase in the accrual for incentive-based compensation. See “Critical Accounting Estimates - Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” below and also Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs; · an increase of $25 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses resulting from higher outage costs in 2010 primarily because the scope of the outages was greater than in 2009; · an increase of $17 million in transmission and distribution expenses resulting from increased vegetation contract work; · an increase of $13 million in nuclear expenses primarily due to higher nuclear labor and contract costs; · an increase of $12.5 million due to the capitalization in 2009 of Ouachita Plant service charges previously expensed; and · an increase of $11 million due to the amortization of Entergy Texas rate case expenses. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the Entergy Texas rate case settlement. The increase was partially offset by: · a decrease of $19.4 million due to 2008 storm costs at Entergy Arkansas which were deferred per an APSC order and were recovered through revenues in 2009; · a decrease of $16 million due to higher write-offs of uncollectible customer accounts in 2009; and · charges of $14 million in 2009 due to the Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav storm cost recovery settlement agreement, as discussed further in Note 2 to the financial statements. Other income decreased primarily due to: · a decrease of $50 million in carrying charges on storm restoration costs because of the completion of financing or securitization of the costs, as discussed further in Note 2 to the financial statements; and · a gain of $16 million recorded in 2009 on the sale of undeveloped real estate by Entergy Louisiana Properties, LLC. The decrease was partially offset by: · an increase of $24 million due to investment gains from the ANO 1 and 2 decommissioning trust, as discussed above; · an increase of $14 million resulting from higher earnings on decommissioning trust funds; and · an increase of distributions of $13 million earned by Entergy Louisiana and $7 million earned by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana on investments in preferred membership interests of Entergy Holdings Company. The distributions on preferred membership interests are eliminated in consolidation and have no effect on net income because the investment is in another Entergy subsidiary. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of these investments in preferred membership interests. 10 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis Interest expense increased primarily due to an increase in long-term debt outstanding resulting from net debt issuances by certain of the Utility operating companies in the second half of 2009 and in 2010. See Notes 4 and 5 to the financial statements for details of long-term debt outstanding. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in depreciation rates at Entergy Arkansas as a result of the rate case settlement agreement approved by the APSC in June 2010. Entergy Wholesale Commodities Other operation and maintenance expenses increased from $922 million for 2009 to $1,047 million for 2010 primarily due to: · the write-off of $64 million of capital costs, primarily for software that will not be utilized, and $16 million of additional costs incurred in connection with Entergy’s decision to unwind the infrastructure created for the planned spin-off of its non-utility nuclear business; · an increase of $36 million in compensation and benefits costs, resulting from decreasing discount rates, the amortization of benefit trust asset losses, and an increase in the accrual for incentive-based compensation. See “Critical Accounting Estimates - Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” below and also Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs; · spending of $15 million related to tritium remediation work at the Vermont Yankee site; and · the write-off of $10 million of capitalized engineering costs associated with a potential uprate project. The gain on sale resulted from the sale of Entergy’s ownership interest in the Harrison County Power Project 550 MW combined-cycle plant to two Texas electric cooperatives that owned a minority share of the plant. Entergy sold its 61 percent share of the plant for $219 million and realized a pre-tax gain of $44.2 million on the sale. Other income increased primarily due to $86 million in charges in 2009 resulting from the recognition of impairments that are not considered temporary of certain equity securities held in Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ decommissioning trust funds, partially offset by a decrease of $28 million in realized earnings on the decommissioning trust funds. Interest expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in fees paid to Entergy Corporation for providing collateral in the form of guarantees in connection with some of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities agreements to sell power. The guarantee fees paid are intercompany transactions and are eliminated in consolidation. The decrease was substantially offset by the write-off of $39 million of debt financing costs, primarily incurred for a $1.2 billion credit facility that will not be used, in connection with Entergy’s decision to unwind the infrastructure created for the planned spin-off of its non-utility nuclear business. Parent & Other Other income decreased primarily due to increases in the distributions paid of $13 million to Entergy Louisiana and $7 million to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana on investments in preferred membership interests of Entergy Holdings Company, as discussed above. Interest expense decreased primarily due to lower borrowings, including the redemption of $267 million of notes payable in December 2009, as well as lower interest rates on borrowings under Entergy Corporation’s revolving credit facility. 11 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis Income Taxes The effective income tax rate for 2010 was 32.7%. The difference in the effective income tax rate versus the statutory rate of 35% in 2010 was primarily due to: · a favorable Tax Court decision holding that the U.K. Windfall Tax may be used as a credit for purposes of computing the U.S. foreign tax credit, which allowed Entergy to reverse a provision for uncertain tax positions of $43 million, included in Parent and Other, on the issue. See Note 3 to the financial statements for further discussion of this tax litigation; · a $19 million tax benefit recorded in connection with Entergy’s decision to unwind the infrastructure created for the planned spin-off of its non-utility nuclear business; and · the recognition of a $14 million Louisiana state income tax benefit related to storm cost financing. Partially offsetting the decreased effective income tax rate was a charge of $16 million resulting from a change in tax law associated with the recently enacted federal healthcare legislation, as discussed below in “Critical Accounting Estimates” and state income taxes and certain book and tax differences for Utility plant items. The effective income tax rate for 2009 was 33.6%. The difference in the effective income tax rate versus the federal statutory rate of 35% in 2009 was primarily due to: · recognition of a capital loss of $73.1 million resulting from the sale of preferred stock of an Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiary to a third party; · reduction of a valuation allowance of $24.3 million on state loss carryovers; · reduction of a valuation allowance of $16.2 million on a federal capital loss carryover; · reduction of the provision for uncertain tax positions of $15.2 million resulting from settlements and agreements with taxing authorities; · adjustment to state income taxes of $13.8 million for Entergy Wholesale Commodities to reflect the effect of a change in the methodology of computing Massachusetts state income taxes as required by that state’s taxing authority; and · additional deferred tax benefit of approximately $8 million associated with writedowns on nuclear decommissioning qualified trust securities. These reductions were partially offset by increases related to book and tax differences for utility plant items and state income taxes at the Utility operating companies. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to the effective income tax rates, and for additional discussion regarding income taxes. Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business On December 5, 2011, Entergy announced that it would spin off its transmission business and merge it with a newly formed subsidiary of ITC Holdings Corp. (ITC). In order to effect the spin-off and merger, Entergy entered into (i) a Merger Agreement with Mid South TransCo LLC, a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary of Entergy (TransCo); ITC; and Ibis Transaction Subsidiary LLC (Merger Sub), a newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of ITC; and (ii) a Separation Agreement with TransCo, ITC, each of the Utility operating companies, and Entergy Services, Inc. These agreements, which have been approved by the Boards of Directors of Entergy and ITC, provide for the separation of Entergy’s transmission business (the “Transmission Business”), the distribution to Entergy’s stockholders of all of the common units of TransCo, a holding company subsidiary formed to hold the Transmission Business, and the merger of Merger Sub with and into TransCo, with TransCo continuing as the surviving entity in the Merger (the Merger), following which each common unit of TransCo will be converted into the right to receive one fully paid and nonassessable share of ITC common stock. Both the Distribution (as defined below) and the Merger are expected to qualify as tax-free transactions. 12 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, Entergy will distribute the TransCo common units to its shareholders. At Entergy’s election, it may distribute the TransCo common units by means of a pro rata dividend in a spin-off or pursuant to an exchange offer in a split-off, or a combination of a spin-off and a split-off (the Distribution). In connection with the Merger, ITC expects to effectuate a $700 million recapitalization, currently anticipated to take the form of a one-time special dividend to its shareholders of record as of a record date prior to the Merger, which will be determined by the board of directors of ITC at a later date (the Special Dividend). Entergy’s shareholders who become shareholders of ITC as a result of the Merger will not receive the Special Dividend. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, immediately after the consummation of the Separation (as defined below), the consummation of the Financings (as defined below), the payment of the Special Dividend and the consummation of the Distribution, Merger Sub will merge with and into TransCo, with TransCo continuing as the surviving entity, and Entergy shareholders who hold common units of TransCo will have those units exchanged for ITC common stock on a one-for-one basis. Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Separation Agreement and the Merger Agreement is expected to result in Entergy’s shareholders holding at least 50.1% of ITC’s common stock and existing ITC shareholders holding no more than 49.9% of ITC’s common stock immediately after the Merger. The Merger Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties. The Merger Agreement may be terminated: (i) by mutual consent of Entergy and ITC, (ii) by either Entergy or ITC if the Merger has not been completed by June 30, 2013, subject to an up to six month extension by either Entergy or ITC in certain circumstances, (iii) by either Entergy or ITC if the transactions are enjoined or otherwise prohibited by applicable law, (iv) by Entergy, on the one hand, or ITC, on the other hand, upon a material breach of the Merger Agreement by the other party that has not been cured by the cure period specified in the Merger Agreement, (v) by either Entergy or ITC if ITC’s shareholders fail to approve the ITC shareholder proposals, (vi) by Entergy if the ITC Board of Directors withdraws or changes its recommendation of the ITC shareholder proposals in a manner adverse to Entergy, (vii) by Entergy if ITC willfully breaches in any material respect its non-solicitation covenant and the breach has not been cured by the cure period specified in the Merger Agreement, (viii) by Entergy if there is a law or order that enjoins the transactions or imposes a burdensome condition on Entergy, (ix) by either Entergy or ITC if there is a law or order that enjoins the transactions or imposes a burdensome condition on ITC, (x) by ITC, prior to ITC shareholder approval, to enter into a transaction for a superior proposal, provided that ITC complies with its notice and other obligations in the non-solicitation provision and pays Entergy the termination fee concurrently with termination or (xi) by ITC if Entergy takes certain actions with respect to the migration of the Transmission Business to a regional transmission organization if such actions could reasonably be expected to have certain adverse effects on TransCo or ITC after the Merger. In the event that (i) ITC terminates the Merger Agreement to accept a superior acquisition proposal, (ii) Entergy terminates the Merger Agreement because the ITC Board of Directors has withdrawn its recommendation of the ITC shareholder proposals, approves or recommends another acquisition proposal, fails to reaffirm its recommendation or materially breaches the non-solicitation provisions, (iii) either of the parties terminates the Merger Agreement because the approval of ITC’s shareholders is not obtained or (iv) Entergy terminates because of ITC’s uncured willful breach of the Merger Agreement, and in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv) an ITC takeover transaction was publicly announced and not withdrawn prior to termination and within 12 months of termination ITC agrees to or consummates a takeover transaction, then ITC must pay Entergy a $113,570,800 termination fee. Consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions for a transaction such as the Merger, including, among others, (i) consummation of the Separation, the Distribution, the Financings and the Special Dividend, (ii) the approval of the ITC shareholder proposals by the shareholders of ITC, (iii) the authorization for listing on the New York Stock Exchange of ITC common stock to be issued in the Merger, (iv) the receipt by Entergy of regulatory approvals necessary to become a member of an acceptable regional transmission organization, (v) the receipt of regulatory approvals necessary to consummate the transaction and the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, and no such regulatory approvals impose a burdensome condition on ITC or Entergy, (vi) the absence of a material adverse effect on the Transmission Business or ITC, (vii) the receipt by Entergy of a solvency opinion and (viii) the receipt of a private letter ruling from the IRS substantially to the effect that certain requirements for the tax-free treatment of the distribution of TransCo are met and an opinion 13 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis that the Distribution and the Merger will be treated as tax-free reorganizations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Separation Agreement are planned for completion in 2013. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, Entergy will engage in a series of preliminary restructuring transactions that result in the transfer to TransCo’s subsidiaries of the assets relating to the Transmission Business (the Separation). TransCo and its subsidiaries will consummate certain financing transactions (the TransCo Financing) totaling approximately $1.775 billion pursuant to which (i) TransCo’s subsidiaries will borrow through a one-year term funded bridge facility and (ii) TransCo will issue senior securities of TransCo to Entergy (the TransCo Securities). Neither Entergy nor the Utility operating companies will guarantee or otherwise be liable for the payment of the TransCo Securities. Entergy will issue new debt or enter into agreements under which certain unrelated creditors will agree to purchase existing corporate debt of Entergy, which will be exchangeable into the TransCo Securities at closing (the Exchangeable Debt Financing). In addition, prior to the closing TransCo may obtain a working capital revolving credit facility in a principal amount agreed to by Entergy and ITC (such financing, together with the TransCo Financing and the Exchangeable Debt Financing, the Financings). Under the terms of the Separation Agreement, concurrently with the TransCo Financing, each Utility operating company will contribute its respective transmission assets to a subsidiary that will become a TransCo subsidiary in the Separation in exchange for the equity interest in that subsidiary and the net proceeds received by that subsidiary from the one-year funded bridge facility described above. Each Utility operating company will distribute the equity interests in the subsidiaries holding the transmission assets to Entergy, which will then contribute such interests to TransCo. The Utility operating companies intend to apply all or a portion of the amounts received by them from the subsidiaries to the prepayment or redemption of outstanding preferred and debt securities, with the goal, following completion of the Separation, of maintaining their capitalization balanced between equity and debt generally consistent with the balance of their capitalization prior to the Separation. Although the aggregate amount and particular series of preferred and debt securities of each Utility operating company to be redeemed as well as the redemption dates are uncertain at this time and are expected to remain subject to change, each Utility operating company currently anticipates that all of its outstanding preferred securities, if any, will be redeemed or otherwise retired prior to the Separation and that debt securities in the following approximate aggregate amounts will be redeemed prior to or following the Separation: $.51 billion for Entergy Arkansas, $.27 billion for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, $.38 billion for Entergy Louisiana, $.29 billion for Entergy Mississippi, $.01 billion for Entergy New Orleans, and $.30 billion for Entergy Texas. Entergy and the Utility operating companies may, subject to certain conditions, modify or supplement the manner in which the Separation is consummated. As of December 31, 2011, net transmission plant in service, which does not include transmission-related construction work in progress or general or intangible plant, for the Utility operating companies was $.94 billion for Entergy Arkansas, $.50 billion for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, $.71 billion for Entergy Louisiana, $.51 billion for Entergy Mississippi, $.02 billion for Entergy New Orleans, and $.62 billion for Entergy Texas. Consummation of the Separation is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions applicable to Entergy and ITC contained in the Separation Agreement and the Merger Agreement, including that the sum of the principal amount of TransCo Securities issued to Entergy and the principal amount of the bridge facility entered into by TransCo’s subsidiaries is at least $1.775 billion. Entergy Wholesale Commodities Authorizations to Operate Its Nuclear Power Plants The NRC operating license for Palisades expires in 2031 and for FitzPatrick expires in 2034. The NRC operating license for Vermont Yankee was to expire in March 2012. In March 2011 the NRC renewed Vermont Yankee’s operating license for an additional 20 years, as a result of which the license now expires in 2032. For additional discussion regarding the continued operation of the Vermont Yankee plant, see “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets” in Note 1 to the financial statements. The NRC operating license for Pilgrim expires in June 2012, for Indian Point 2 expires in September 2013, and for Indian Point 3 expires in December 2015, and NRC license renewal applications are in process for these plants. Under federal law, nuclear power plants may continue to operate beyond their license expiration dates while their renewal applications are pending NRC approval. Various parties have expressed opposition to renewal of the 14 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis licenses. With respect to the Pilgrim license renewal, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) of the NRC, after issuing an order denying a new hearing request, terminated its proceeding on Pilgrim’s license renewal application. With the ASLB process concluded the proceeding, including appeals of certain ASLB decisions, is now before the NRC. In April 2007, Entergy submitted an application to the NRC to renew the operating licenses for Indian Point 2 and 3 for an additional 20 years. The ASLB has admitted 21 contentions raised by the State of New York or other parties, which were combined into 16 discrete issues. Two of the issues have been resolved, leaving 14 issues that are currently subject to ASLB hearings. In July 2011, the ASLB granted the State of New York’s motion for summary disposition of an admitted contention challenging the adequacy of a section of Indian Point’s environmental analysis as incorporated in the FSEIS (discussed below). That section provided cost estimates for Severe Accident Mitigation Alternatives (SAMAs), which are hardware and procedural changes that could be implemented to mitigate estimated impacts of off-site radiological releases in case of a hypothesized severe accident. In addition to finding that the SAMA cost analysis was insufficient, the ASLB directed the NRC staff to explain why cost-beneficial SAMAs should not be required to be implemented. Entergy appealed the ASLB’s decision to the NRC and the NRC staff supported Entergy’s appeal, while the State of New York opposed it. In December 2011 the NRC denied Entergy’s appeal as premature, stating that the appeal could be renewed at the conclusion of the ASLB proceedings. In November 2011 the ASLB issued an order establishing deadlines for the submission of several rounds of testimony on most of the contentions pending before the ASLB and for the filing of motions to limit or exclude testimony. Initial hearings before the ASLB on the contentions for which testimony is submitted are expected to begin by the end of 2012. Filing deadlines for testimony on certain admitted contentions remain to be set by the ASLB. The NRC staff currently is also performing its technical and environmental reviews of the application. The NRC staff issued a Final Safety Evaluation Report (FSER) in August 2009, a supplement to the FSER in August 2011, and a Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (FSEIS) in December 2010. The NRC staff has stated its intent to file a supplemental FSEIS in May 2012. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has taken the position that Indian Point must obtain a new state-issued Clean Water Act Section 401 water quality certification as part of the license renewal process. In addition, the consistency of Indian Point’s operations with New York State’s coastal management policies must be resolved as required by the Coastal Zone Management Act. Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ efforts to obtain these certifications and determinations continue in 2012. The hearing process is an integral component of the NRC’s regulatory framework, and evidentiary hearings on license renewal applications are not uncommon. Entergy intends to participate fully in the hearing process as permitted by the NRC’s hearing rules. As noted in Entergy’s responses to the various intervenor filings, Entergy believes the contentions proposed by the intervenors are unsupported and without merit. Entergy will continue to work with the NRC staff as it completes its technical and environmental reviews of the license renewal application. 15 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis Liquidity and Capital Resources This section discusses Entergy’s capital structure, capital spending plans and other uses of capital, sources of capital, and the cash flow activity presented in the cash flow statement. Capital Structure Entergy’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. 2011 2010 Debt to capital 57.3% 57.3% Effect of excluding securitization bonds (2.3)% (2.0)% Debt to capital, excluding securitization bonds (1) 55.0% 55.3% Effect of subtracting cash (1.5)% (3.2)% Net debt to net capital, excluding securitization bonds (1) 53.5% 52.1% (1) Calculation excludes the Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy Texas, respectively. Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of notes payable, capital lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt, common shareholders’ equity, and subsidiaries’ preferred stock without sinking fund. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy uses the net debt to net capital ratio and the ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy’s financial condition. Long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion, makes up substantially all of Entergy’s total debt outstanding. Following are Entergy’s long-term debt principal maturities and estimated interest payments as of December 31, 2011. To estimate future interest payments for variable rate debt, Entergy used the rate as of December 31, 2011. The amounts below include payments on the Entergy Louisiana and System Energy sale-leaseback transactions, which are included in long-term debt on the balance sheet. Long-term debt maturities and estimated interest payments 2012 2013 2014 2015-2016 after 2016 (In Millions) Utility $721 $1,197 $614 $1,524 $10,872 Entergy Wholesale Commodities 24 15 16 21 59 Parent and Other 1,972 43 43 610 535 Total $2,717 $1,255 $673 $2,155 $11,466 Note 5 to the financial statements provides more detail concerning long-term debt outstanding. Entergy Corporation has in place a credit facility that has a borrowing capacity of approximately $3.5 billion and expires in August 2012, which Entergy intends to renew before expiration. Because the facility is now within one year of its expiration date, borrowings outstanding on the facility are classified as currently maturing long-term debt on the balance sheet. Entergy Corporation also has the ability to issue letters of credit against the total borrowing capacity of the credit facility. The facility fee is currently 0.125% of the commitment amount. Facility fees and interest rates on loans under the credit facility can fluctuate depending on the senior unsecured debt ratings of Entergy Corporation. The weighted average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 was 0.745% on the drawn portion of the facility. 16 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis As of December 31, 2011, amounts outstanding and capacity available under the $3.5 billion credit facility are: Capacity Borrowings Letters of Credit Capacity Available (In Millions) $3,451 $1,920 $28 $1,503 A covenant in Entergy Corporation’s credit facility requires Entergy to maintain a consolidated debt ratio of 65% or less of its total capitalization. The calculation of this debt ratio under Entergy Corporation’s credit facility is different than the calculation of the debt to capital ratio above. Entergy is currently in compliance with the covenant. If Entergy fails to meet this ratio, or if Entergy or one of the Utility operating companies (except Entergy New Orleans) defaults on other indebtedness or is in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, an acceleration of the Entergy Corporation credit facility’s maturity date may occur. Capital lease obligations are a minimal part of Entergy’s overall capital structure, and are discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements. Following are Entergy’s payment obligations under those leases: 2012 2013 2014 2015-2016 after 2016 (In Millions) Capital lease payments $7 $6 $5 $9 $38 Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy Texas each had credit facilities available as of December 31, 2011 as follows: Company Expiration Date Amount of Facility Interest Rate (a) Amount Drawn as of Dec. 31, 2011 Entergy Arkansas April 2012 $78 million (b) 3.25% - Entergy Gulf States Louisiana August 2012 $100 million (c) 0.71% - Entergy Louisiana August 2012 $200 million (d) 0.67% $50 million Entergy Mississippi May 2012 $35 million (e) 2.05% - Entergy Mississippi May 2012 $25 million (e) 2.05% - Entergy Mississippi May 2012 $10 million (e) 2.05% - Entergy Texas August 2012 $100 million (f) 0.77% - (a) The interest rate is the weighted average interest rate as of December 31, 2011 applied, or that would be applied, to outstanding borrowings under the facility. (b) The credit facility requires Entergy Arkansas to maintain a debt ratio of 65% or less of its total capitalization. Borrowings under the Entergy Arkansas credit facility may be secured by a security interest in its accounts receivable. (c) The credit facility allows Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to issue letters of credit against the borrowing capacity of the facility. As of December 31, 2011, no letters of credit were outstanding. The credit facility requires Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to maintain a consolidated debt ratio of 65% or less of its total capitalization. (d) The credit facility allows Entergy Louisiana to issue letters of credit against the borrowing capacity of the facility. As of December 31, 2011, no letters of credit were outstanding. The credit facility requires Entergy Louisiana to maintain a consolidated debt ratio of 65% or less of its total capitalization. (e) Borrowings under the Entergy Mississippi credit facilities may be secured by a security interest in its accounts receivable. Entergy Mississippi is required to maintain a consolidated debt ratio of 65% or less of its total capitalization. 17 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis (f) The credit facility allows Entergy Texas to issue letters of credit against the borrowing capacity of the facility. As of December 31, 2011, no letters of credit were outstanding. The credit facility requires Entergy Texas to maintain a consolidated debt ratio of 65% or less of its total capitalization. Pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement, securitization bonds are excluded from debt and capitalization in calculating the debt ratio. Operating Lease Obligations and Guarantees of Unconsolidated Obligations Entergy has a minimal amount of operating lease obligations and guarantees in support of unconsolidated obligations. Entergy’s guarantees in support of unconsolidated obligations are not likely to have a material effect on Entergy’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Following are Entergy’s payment obligations as of December 31, 2011 on non-cancelable operating leases with a term over one year: 2012 2013 2014 2015-2016 after 2016 (In Millions) Operating lease payments $85 $78 $79 $100 $166 The operating leases are discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements. Summary of Contractual Obligations of Consolidated Entities Contractual Obligations 2012 2013-2014 2015-2016 after 2016 Total (In Millions) Long-term debt (1) $2,717 $1,928 $2,155 $11,466 $18,266 Capital lease payments (2) $7 $11 $9 $38 $65 Operating leases (2) $85 $157 $100 $166 $508 Purchase obligations (3) $1,803 $2,604 $1,654 $5,199 $11,260 (1) Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements. (2) Lease obligations are discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements. (3) Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. Almost all of the total are fuel and purchased power obligations. In addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy currently expects to contribute approximately $162.9 million to its pension plans and approximately $80.4 million to other postretirement plans in 2012, although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. Entergy’s preliminary estimates of 2012 funding requirements indicate that the contributions will not exceed historical levels of pension contributions. Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy has $812 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. Capital Funds Agreement Pursuant to an agreement with certain creditors, Entergy Corporation has agreed to supply System Energy with sufficient capital to: · maintain System Energy’s equity capital at a minimum of 35% of its total capitalization (excluding short-term debt); · permit the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf; · pay in full all System Energy indebtedness for borrowed money when due; and · enable System Energy to make payments on specific System Energy debt, under supplements to the agreement assigning System Energy’s rights in the agreement as security for the specific debt. 18 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital Following are the amounts of Entergy’s planned construction and other capital investments by operating segment for 2012 through 2014: Planned construction and capital investments 2012 2013 2014 (In Millions) Maintenance Capital: Utility: Generation $128 $129 $131 Transmission 282 273 255 Distribution 433 485 496 Other 91 89 103 Total 934 976 985 Entergy Wholesale Commodities 90 120 107 1,024 1,096 1,092 Capital Commitments: Utility: Generation $1,428 $583 $358 Transmission 170 128 264 Distribution 17 11 11 Other 45 47 35 Total 1,660 769 668 Entergy Wholesale Commodities 259 241 291 1,919 1,010 959 Total $2,943 $2,106 $2,051 Maintenance Capital refers to amounts Entergy plans to spend on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of its service, equipment, or systems and to support normal customer growth. Capital Commitments refers to non-routine capital investments for which Entergy is either contractually obligated, has Board approval, or otherwise expects to make to satisfy regulatory or legal requirements. Amounts reflected in this category include the following: · The currently planned construction or purchase of additional generation supply sources within the Utility’s service territory through the Utility’s portfolio transformation strategy, including three resources identified in the Summer 2009 Request for Proposal that are discussed below. · Entergy Louisiana’s Waterford 3 steam generators replacement project, which is discussed below. · System Energy’s planned approximate 178 MW uprate of the Grand Gulf nuclear plant. On November 30, 2009, the MPSC issued a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for implementation of the uprate. A license amendment application was submitted to the NRC in September 2010. After performing more detailed project design, engineering, analysis and major materials purchases, System Energy’s current estimate of the total capital investment to be made in the course of the implementation of the Grand Gulf uprate project is approximately $754 million, including SMEPA’s share. The estimate includes spending on certain major equipment refurbishment and replacement that would have been required over the normal course of the plant’s life even if the uprate were not done. The purpose of performing this major equipment refurbishment and replacement in connection with the uprate is to avoid additional plant outages and construction costs in the future while improving plant reliability. The investment estimate may be revised in the future as System Energy evaluates the progress of the project, including the costs required to install instrumentation in the steam dryer in response to recent guidance from the NRC staff obtained during the review process for certain Requests for Additional Information (RAIs) issued by the NRC in December 2011. The NRC’s review of the project is ongoing. System Energy is responding to the recent RAIs and will seek to minimize potential cost effects or delay, if any, to the Grand Gulf uprate implementation schedule. 19 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis · Transmission upgrades and spending to support the Utility’s plan to join the MISO RTO by December 2013. · Spending to comply with current and anticipated North American Electric Reliability Corporation transmission planning requirements. · Entergy Wholesale Commodities investments associated with specific investments such as dry cask storage, nuclear license renewal, component replacement and identified repairs, spending in response to the Indian Point Safety Evaluation, NYPA value sharing, and wedgewire screens at Indian Point. · A minimal amount of environmental compliance spending, although Entergy continues to review potential environmental spending needs and financing alternatives for any such spending, and future spending estimates could change based on the results of this continuing analysis and the implementation of new environmental laws and regulations. The Utility’s owned generating capacity remains short of customer demand, and its supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. Estimated capital expenditures are also subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of business restructuring, regulatory constraints and requirements, environmental regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. Summer 2009 Long-Term Request for Proposal The 2012-2014 capital expenditure estimate includes the construction or purchase of three resources identified in the Summer 2009 Long-Term Request for Proposal: a self-build option at Entergy Louisiana’s Ninemile site and agreements by two of the Utility operating companies to acquire the 620 MW Hot Spring Energy Facility and the 450 MW Hinds Energy Facility. Ninemile Point Unit 6 Self-Build Project In June 2011, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC an application seeking certification that the public necessity and convenience would be served by Entergy Louisiana’s construction of a combined-cycle gas turbine generating facility (Ninemile 6) at its existing Ninemile Point electric generating station. Ninemile 6 will be a nominally-sized 550 MW unit that is estimated to cost approximately $721 million to construct, excluding interconnection and transmission upgrades. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana joined in the application, seeking certification of its purchase under a life-of-unit power purchase agreement of up to 35% of the capacity and energy generated by Ninemile 6. The Ninemile 6 capacity and energy is proposed to be allocated 55% to Entergy Louisiana, 25% to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, and 20% to Entergy New Orleans. In February 2012 the City Council passed a resolution authorizing Entergy New Orleans to purchase 20% of the Ninemile 6 energy and capacity. If approvals are obtained from the LPSC and other permitting agencies, Ninemile 6 construction is expected to begin in 2012, and the unit is expected to commence commercial operation by mid-2015. The ALJ has established a schedule for the LPSC proceeding that includes February 27 - March 7, 2012, hearing dates. Hot Spring Energy Facility Purchase Agreement In April 2011, Entergy Arkansas announced that it signed an asset purchase agreement to acquire the Hot Spring Energy Facility, a 620 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle turbine plant located in Hot Spring County, Arkansas, from a subsidiary of KGen Power Corporation. The purchase price is expected to be approximately $253 million. Entergy Arkansas also expects to invest in various plant upgrades at the facility after closing and expects the total cost of the acquisition, including plant upgrades, transaction costs, and contingencies, to be approximately $277 million. A new transmission service request has been submitted to the ICT to determine if investments for 20 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis supplemental upgrades in the Entergy transmission system are needed to make energy from the Hot Spring Energy Facility deliverable to Entergy Arkansas for the period after Entergy Arkansas exits the System Agreement. The initial results of the service request were received in January 2012 and indicate that available transfer capability does not exist with existing transmission facilities and that upgrades are required. The studies do not provide a final and definitive indication of what those upgrades would be. Entergy Arkansas has submitted transmission service requests for facilities studies which, when performed by the ICT, will provide more detailed estimates of the transmission upgrades and the associated costs required to obtain network service for the Hot Spring plant. Accordingly there are still uncertainties that must be resolved. The purchase is contingent upon, among other things, obtaining necessary approvals, including full cost recovery, from various federal and state regulatory and permitting agencies. These include regulatory approvals from the APSC and the FERC, as well as clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust law. In February 2012 the FERC issued an order approving the acquisition. Closing is expected to occur in mid-2012. In July 2011, Entergy Arkansas filed its application with the APSC requesting approval of the acquisition and full cost recovery. In January 2012, Entergy Arkansas, the APSC General Staff, and the Arkansas Attorney General filed a Motion to Suspend the Procedural Schedule and Joint Stipulation and Settlement for consideration by the APSC. Under the settlement, the parties agreed that the acquisition costs may be recovered through a capacity acquisition rider and agreed that the level of the return on equity reflected in the rider would be submitted to the APSC for resolution. Because the transmission upgrade costs remain uncertain, the parties requested that the APSC suspend the procedural schedule and cancel the hearing scheduled for January 24, 2012, pending resolution of the transmission costs. The APSC issued an order accepting the settlement as part of the record and directing Entergy Arkansas to file the transmission studies when available and directing the parties to propose a procedural schedule to address the results of those studies. Hinds Energy Facility Purchase Agreement In April 2011, Entergy Mississippi announced that it has signed an asset purchase agreement to acquire the Hinds Energy Facility, a 450 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle turbine plant located in Jackson, Mississippi, from a subsidiary of KGen Power Corporation. The purchase price is expected to be approximately $206 million. Entergy Mississippi also expects to invest in various plant upgrades at the facility after closing and expects the total cost of the acquisition to be approximately $246 million. A new transmission service request has been submitted to determine if investments for supplemental upgrades in the Entergy transmission system are needed to make the Hinds Energy Facility deliverable to Entergy Mississippi for the period after Entergy Mississippi exits the System Agreement. Facilities studies are ongoing to determine transmission upgrades costs associated with the plant, with results expected by early March 2012. The purchase is contingent upon, among other things, obtaining necessary approvals, including full cost recovery, from various federal and state regulatory and permitting agencies. These include regulatory approvals from the MPSC and the FERC, as well as clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust law. In February 2012 the FERC issued an order approving the acquisition. Closing is expected to occur in mid-2012. In July 2011, Entergy Mississippi filed with the MPSC requesting approval of the acquisition and full cost recovery. A hearing on the request for a certificate of public convenience and necessity is scheduled for February 28, 2012. A hearing on Entergy Mississippi’s proposed cost recovery has not been scheduled. Waterford 3 Steam Generator Replacement Project Entergy Louisiana planned to replace the Waterford 3 steam generators, along with the reactor vessel closure head and control element drive mechanisms, in the spring 2011. Replacement of these components is common to pressurized water reactors throughout the nuclear industry. In December 2010, Entergy Louisiana advised the LPSC that the replacement generators would not be completed and delivered by the manufacturer in time to install them during the spring 2011 refueling outage. During the final steps in the manufacturing process, the manufacturer discovered separation of stainless steel cladding from the carbon steel base metal in the channel head of both 21 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis replacement steam generators (RSGs), in areas beneath and adjacent to the divider plate. As a result of this damage, the manufacturer was unable to meet the contractual delivery deadlines, and the RSGs were not installed in the spring 2011. Entergy Louisiana worked with the manufacturer to fully develop and evaluate repair options, and expects the replacement steam generators to be delivered in time for the Fall 2012 refueling outage. Extensive inspections of the existing steam generators at Waterford 3 in cooperation with the manufacturer were completed in April 2011. The review of data obtained during these inspections supports the conclusion that Waterford 3 can operate safely for another full cycle before the replacement of the existing steam generators. Entergy Louisiana has formally reported its findings to the NRC. At this time, a requirement to perform a mid-cycle outage for further inspections in order to allow the plant to continue operation until its Fall 2012 refueling outage is not anticipated. Entergy Louisiana currently expects the cost of the project, including carrying costs, to be approximately $687 million, assuming the replacement occurs during the Fall 2012 refueling outage. In June 2008, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC for approval of the replacement project, including full cost recovery. Following discovery and the filing of testimony by the LPSC staff and an intervenor, the parties entered into a stipulated settlement of the proceeding. The LPSC unanimously approved the settlement in November 2008. The settlement resolved the following issues: 1) the accelerated degradation of the steam generators is not the result of any imprudence on the part of Entergy Louisiana; 2) the decision to undertake the replacement project at the then-estimated cost of $511 million is in the public interest, is prudent, and would serve the public convenience and necessity; 3) the scope of the replacement project is in the public interest; 4) undertaking the replacement project at the target installation date during the 2011 refueling outage is in the public interest; and 5) the jurisdictional costs determined to be prudent in a future prudence review are eligible for cost recovery, either in an extension or renewal of the formula rate plan or in a full base rate case including necessary pro forma adjustments. Upon completion of the replacement project, the LPSC will undertake a prudence review with regard to the following aspects of the replacement project: 1) project management; 2) cost controls; 3) success in achieving stated objectives; 4) the costs of the replacement project; and 5) the outage length and replacement power costs. In November 2011 the LPSC approved a one-year extension of Entergy Louisiana’s current formula rate plan. The next formula rate plan filing, for the 2011 test year, will be made in May 2012 and will include a separate identification of any operating and maintenance expense savings that are expected to occur once the Waterford 3 steam generator replacement project is complete. Pursuant to the LPSC decision, from September 2012 through December 2012 earnings above an 11.05% return on common equity (based on the 2011 test year) would be accrued and used to offset the Waterford 3 replacement steam generator revenue requirement for the first twelve months that the unit is in rates. If the project is not in service by January 1, 2013, earnings above a 10.25% return on common equity (based on the 2011 test year) for the period January 1, 2013 through the date that the project is placed in service will be accrued and used to offset the incremental revenue requirement for the first twelve months that the unit is in rates. Upon the in-service date of the replacement steam generators, rates will increase, subject to refund following any prudence review, by the full revenue requirement associated with the replacement steam generators, less (i) the previously accrued excess earnings from September 2012 until the in-service date and (ii) any earnings above a 10.25% return on common equity (based on the 2011 test year) for the period following the in-service date, provided that the excess earnings accrued prior to the in-service date shall only offset the revenue requirement for the first year of operation of the replacement steam generators. These rates are anticipated to remain in effect until Entergy Louisiana’s next full rate case is resolved. Entergy Louisiana currently anticipates filing a full rate case by January 2013. Dividends and Stock Repurchases Declarations of dividends on Entergy’s common stock are made at the discretion of the Board. Among other things, the Board evaluates the level of Entergy’s common stock dividends based upon Entergy’s earnings, financial strength, and future investment opportunities. At its January 2012 meeting, the Board declared a dividend of $0.83 per share, which is the same quarterly dividend per share that Entergy has paid since the second quarter 2010. The prior quarterly dividend per share was $0.75. Entergy paid $590 million in 2011, $604 million in 2010, and $577 million in 2009 in cash dividends on its common stock. 22 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis In accordance with Entergy’s stock-based compensation plan, Entergy periodically grants stock options to key employees, which may be exercised to obtain shares of Entergy’s common stock. According to the plan, these shares can be newly issued shares, treasury stock, or shares purchased on the open market. Entergy’s management has been authorized by the Board to repurchase on the open market shares up to an amount sufficient to fund the exercise of grants under the plan. In addition to the authority to fund grant exercises, in January 2007 the Board approved a program under which Entergy was authorized to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of its common stock. In January 2008, the Board authorized an incremental $500 million share repurchase program to enable Entergy to consider opportunistic purchases in response to equity market conditions. Entergy completed both the $1.5 billion and $500 million programs in the third quarter 2009. In October 2009 the Board granted authority for an additional $750 million share repurchase program which was completed in the fourth quarter 2010. In October 2010 the Board granted authority for an additional $500 million share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2011, $350 million of authority remains under the $500 million share repurchase program. The amount of repurchases may vary as a result of material changes in business results or capital spending or new investment opportunities, or if limitations in the credit markets continue for a prolonged period. Sources of Capital Entergy’s sources to meet its capital requirements and to fund potential investments include: · internally generated funds; · cash on hand ($694 million as of December 31, 2011); · securities issuances; · bank financing under new or existing facilities; and · sales of assets. Circumstances such as weather patterns, fuel and purchased power price fluctuations, and unanticipated expenses, including unscheduled plant outages and storms, could affect the timing and level of internally generated funds in the future. Provisions within the Articles of Incorporation or pertinent indentures and various other agreements relating to the long-term debt and preferred stock of certain of Entergy Corporation’s subsidiaries could restrict the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on their common and preferred stock. As of December 31, 2011, under provisions in their mortgage indentures, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi had restricted retained earnings unavailable for distribution to Entergy Corporation of $394.9 million and $68.5 million, respectively. All debt and common and preferred equity issuances by the Registrant Subsidiaries require prior regulatory approval and their preferred equity and debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in corporate charters, bond indentures, and other agreements. Entergy believes that the Registrant Subsidiaries have sufficient capacity under these tests to meet foreseeable capital needs. The FERC has jurisdiction over securities issuances by the Utility operating companies and System Energy (except securities with maturities longer than one year issued by Entergy Arkansas and Entergy New Orleans, which are subject to the jurisdiction of the APSC and the City Council, respectively). No regulatory approvals are necessary for Entergy Corporation to issue securities. The current FERC-authorized short-term borrowing limits are effective through October 31, 2013. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Texas, and System Energy have obtained long-term financing authorizations from the FERC that extend through July 2013. Entergy Arkansas has obtained long-term financing authorization from the APSC that extends through December 2012. Entergy New Orleans has obtained long-term financing authorization from the City Council that extends through July 2012. In addition to borrowings from commercial banks, the FERC short-term borrowing orders authorize the Registrant Subsidiaries to continue as participants in the Entergy System money pool. The money pool is an 23 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis intercompany borrowing arrangement designed to reduce Entergy’s subsidiaries’ dependence on external short-term borrowings. Borrowings from the money pool and external short-term borrowings combined may not exceed the FERC-authorized limits. See Notes 4 and 5 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy’s borrowing limits, authorizations, and amounts outstanding. In January 2012, Entergy Corporation issued $500 million of 4.70% senior notes due January 2017. Entergy Corporation used the proceeds to repay borrowings under its $3.5 billion credit facility. In January 2012, Entergy Louisiana issued $250 million of 1.875% Series first mortgage bonds due December 2014. Entergy Louisiana used the proceeds to repay short-term borrowings under the Entergy System money pool. Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike In September 2008, Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike caused catastrophic damage to portions of Entergy's service territories in Louisiana and Texas, and to a lesser extent in Arkansas and Mississippi. The storms resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage to distribution, transmission, and generation infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages. In September 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana and the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation (LURC), an instrumentality of the State of Louisiana, filed with the LPSC an application requesting that the LPSC grant financing orders authorizing the financing of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana’s storm costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to Act 55 of the Louisiana Regular Session of 2007 (Act 55 financings). In July 2010 the Louisiana Local Government Environmental Facilities and Community Development Authority (LCDA) issued $468.9 million in bonds under Act 55. From the $462.4 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LCDA to the LURC, the LURC deposited $200 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve for Entergy Louisiana and transferred $262.4 million directly to Entergy Louisiana. In July 2010 the LCDA issued another $244.1 million in bonds under Act 55. From the $240.3 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LCDA to the LURC, the LURC deposited $90 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and transferred $150.3 million directly to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. Entergy, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, and Entergy Louisiana do not report the bonds on their balance sheets because the bonds are the obligation of the LCDA, and there is no recourse against Entergy, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy Louisiana in the event of a bond default. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the Act 55 financings. In November 2009, Entergy Texas Restoration Funding, LLC (Entergy Texas Restoration Funding), a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy Texas, issued $545.9 million of senior secured transition bonds (securitization bonds) to finance Entergy Texas Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav restoration costs. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the proceeding approving the issuance of the securitization bonds and see Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the securitization bonds. In the third quarter 2009, Entergy settled with its insurer on its Hurricane Ike claim and Entergy Texas received $75.5 million in proceeds (Entergy received a total of $76.5 million). Entergy Arkansas January 2009 Ice Storm In January 2009, a severe ice storm caused significant damage to Entergy Arkansas’s transmission and distribution lines, equipment, poles, and other facilities. A law was enacted in April 2009 in Arkansas that authorizes securitization of storm damage restoration costs. In June 2010, the APSC issued a financing order authorizing the issuance of storm cost recovery bonds, including carrying costs of $11.5 million and $4.6 million of up-front financing costs. In August 2010, Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding, LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy Arkansas, issued $124.1 million of storm cost recovery bonds. See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the issuance of the storm cost recovery bonds. 24 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis Entergy Louisiana Securitization Bonds – Little Gypsy In August 2011, the LPSC issued a financing order authorizing the issuance of bonds to recover Entergy Louisiana’s investment recovery costs associated with the cancelled Little Gypsy repowering project. In September 2011, Entergy Louisiana Investment Recovery Funding I, L.L.C., a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy Louisiana, issued $207.2 million of senior secured investment recovery bonds. The bonds have an interest rate of 2.04% and an expected maturity date of June 2021. See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the issuance of the investment recovery bonds. Cash Flow Activity As shown in Entergy’s Statements of Cash Flows, cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were as follows: 2011 2010 2009 (In Millions) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period $1,295 $1,710 $1,920 Cash flow provided by (used in): Operating activities 3,128 3,926 2,933 Investing activities (3,447) (2,574) (2,094) Financing activities (282) (1,767) (1,048) Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents - - (1) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents (601) (415) (210) Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $694 $1,295 $1,710 Operating Cash Flow Activity 2011 Compared to 2010 Entergy's cash flow provided by operating activities decreased by $797 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the receipt in July 2010 of $703 million from the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation as a result of the Louisiana Act 55 storm cost financings for Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike. The Act 55 storm cost financings are discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements. The decrease in Entergy Wholesale Commodities net revenue that is discussed above also contributed to the decrease in operating cash flow. 2010 Compared to 2009 Entergy’s cash flow provided by operating activities increased $993 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the receipt in July 2010 of $703 million from the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation as a result of the Louisiana Act 55 storm cost financings, as noted in the preceding paragraph. In addition, the absence of the Hurricane Gustav, Hurricane Ike, and Arkansas ice storm restoration spending that occurred in 2009 also contributed to the increase. These factors were partially offset by an increase of $323 million in pension contributions at Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities and a decrease in net revenue at Entergy Wholesale Commodities. See “Critical Accounting Estimates - Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” below and also Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of pension funding. 25 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis Investing Activities 2011 Compared to 2010 Net cash used in investing activities increased $873 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the following activity: · the purchase of the Acadia Power Plant by Entergy Louisiana for approximately $300 million in April 2011, the purchase of the Rhode Island State Energy Center for approximately $346 million by an Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiary in December 2011, and the sale of an Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiary’s ownership interest in the Harrison County Power Project for proceeds of $219 million in 2010. These transactions are described in more detail in Note 15 to the financial statements; · an increase in nuclear fuel purchases because of variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of fuel reload requirements, material and services deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle; and · a slight increase in construction expenditures, including spending resulting from April 2011 storms that caused damage to transmission and distribution lines, equipment, poles, and other facilities, primarily in Arkansas. The capital cost of repairing that damage was approximately $55 million. Entergy’s construction spending plans for 2012 through 2014 are discussed in “Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis - Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital.” These increases were offset by the investment in 2010 of a total of $290 million in Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana’s storm reserve escrow accounts as a result of their Act 55 storm cost financings, which are discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements. 2010 Compared to 2009 Net cash used in investing activities increased $480 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the following activity: · an increase in net uses of cash for nuclear fuel purchases, which was caused by the consolidation of the nuclear fuel company variable interest entities that is discussed in Note 18 to the financial statements. With the consolidation of the nuclear fuel company variable interest entities, their purchases of nuclear fuel from Entergy are now eliminated in consolidation, whereas before 2010 they were a source of investing cash flows; · the investment of a total of $290 million in Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana’s storm reserve escrow accounts as a result of their Act 55 storm cost financings, which are discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements; · an increase in construction expenditures, primarily in the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, as decreases for the Utility resulting from Hurricane Gustav, Hurricane Ike, and Arkansas ice storm restoration spending in 2009 were offset by spending on various projects; and · the sale of an Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiary’s ownership interest in the Harrison County Power Project for proceeds of $219 million in 2010. The sale is described in more detail in Note 15 to the financial statements. Financing Activities 2011 Compared to 2010 Net cash used in financing activities decreased $1,485 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily because long-term debt activity provided approximately $554 million of cash in 2011 and used approximately $307 million of cash in 2010. The most significant long-term debt activity in 2011 included the issuance of $207 million of securitization bonds by a subsidiary of Entergy Louisiana, the issuance of $200 million of first mortgage bonds by Entergy 26 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis Louisiana, and Entergy Corporation increasing the borrowings outstanding on its 5-year credit facility by $288 million. For the details of Entergy’s long-term debt outstanding on December 31, 2011 and 2010 see Note 5 to the financial statements herein. In addition to the long-term debt activity, Entergy Corporation repurchased $236 million of its common stock in 2011 and repurchased $879 million of its common stock in 2010. Entergy’s stock repurchases are discussed further in the “Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital - Dividends and Stock Repurchases” section above. 2010 Compared to 2009 Net cash used in financing activities increased $719 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily because long-term debt activity used approximately $307 million of cash in 2010 and provided approximately $160 million of cash in 2009. The most significant net use for long-term debt activity was by Entergy Corporation, which reduced its 5-year credit facility balance by $934 million and repaid a total of $275 million of notes and bank term loans, while issuing $1 billion of notes in 2010. For the details of Entergy’s long-term debt outstanding see Note 5 to the financial statements herein. In addition, Entergy Corporation repurchased $879 million of its common stock in 2010 and repurchased $613 million of its common stock in 2009. Entergy’s stock repurchases are discussed further in the “Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital - Dividends and Stock Repurchases” section above. Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery The rates that the Utility operating companies and System Energy charge for their services significantly influence Entergy’s financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. These companies are regulated and the rates charged to their customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. Governmental agencies, including the APSC, the City Council, the LPSC, the MPSC, the PUCT, and the FERC, are primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. Following is a summary of the Utility operating companies’ authorized returns on common equity and current retail base rates. The Utility operating companies’ base rate, fuel and purchased power cost recovery, and storm cost recovery proceedings are discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements.

Federal Regulation Independent Coordinator of Transmission In 2000, the FERC issued an order encouraging utilities to voluntarily place their transmission facilities under the control of independent RTOs (regional transmission organizations). Delays in implementing the FERC RTO order occurred due to a variety of reasons, including the fact that utility companies, other stakeholders, and federal and state regulators have had to work to resolve various issues related to the establishment of such RTOs. In November 2006, the Utility operating companies installed the Southwest Power Pool (SPP), a regional transmission organization, as their Independent Coordinator of Transmission (ICT). The installation does not transfer control of Entergy’s transmission system to the ICT, but rather vests with the ICT responsibility for: · granting or denying transmission service on the Utility operating companies’ transmission system. · administering the Utility operating companies’ OASIS node for purposes of processing and evaluating transmission service requests and ensuring compliance with the Utility operating companies’ obligation to post transmission-related information. · developing a base plan for the Utility operating companies’ transmission system that will result in the ICT making the determination on whether costs of transmission upgrades should be rolled into the Utility operating companies’ transmission rates or directly assigned to the customer requesting or causing an upgrade to be constructed. This should result in a transmission pricing structure that ensures that the Utility operating companies’ retail native load customers are required to pay for only those upgrades necessary to reliably and economically serve their needs. · serving as the reliability coordinator for the Entergy transmission system. · overseeing the operation of the weekly procurement process (WPP). · evaluating interconnection-related investments already made on the Entergy System for purposes of determining the future allocation of the uncredited portion of these investments, pursuant to a detailed methodology. The ICT agreement also clarifies the rights that customers receive when they fund a supplemental upgrade. The FERC, in conjunction with the APSC, the LPSC, the MPSC, the PUCT, and the City Council, hosted a conference on June 24, 2009, to discuss the ICT arrangement and transmission access on the Entergy transmission system. During the conference, several issues were raised by regulators and market participants, including the adequacy of the Utility operating companies’ capital investment in the transmission system, the Utility operating companies’ compliance with the existing North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) reliability planning standards, the availability of transmission service across the system, and whether the Utility operating companies could have purchased lower cost power from merchant generators located on the transmission system rather than running their older generating facilities. On July 20, 2009, the Utility operating companies filed comments with the FERC responding to the issues raised during the conference. The comments explain that: 1) the Utility operating companies believe that the ICT arrangement has fulfilled its objectives; 2) the Utility operating companies’ transmission 28 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis planning practices comply with laws and regulations regarding the planning and operation of the transmission system; and 3) these planning practices have resulted in a system that meets applicable reliability standards and is sufficiently robust to allow the Utility operating companies both to substantially increase the amount of transmission service available to third parties and to make significant amounts of economic purchases from the wholesale market for the benefit of the Utility operating companies’ retail customers. The Utility operating companies also explain that, as with other transmission systems, there are certain times during which congestion occurs on the Utility operating companies’ transmission system that limits the ability of the Utility operating companies as well as other parties to fully utilize the generating resources that have been granted transmission service. Additionally, the Utility operating companies commit in their response to exploring and working on potential reforms or alternatives for the ICT arrangement that could take effect following the initial term. The Utility operating companies’ comments also recognize that NERC is in the process of amending certain of its transmission reliability planning standards and that the amended standards, if approved by the FERC, will result in more stringent transmission planning criteria being applicable in the future. The FERC may also make other changes to transmission reliability standards. These changes to the reliability standards would result in increased capital expenditures by the Utility operating companies. The Entergy Regional State Committee (E-RSC), which is comprised of representatives from all of the Utility operating companies' retail regulators, has been formed to consider several of these issues related to Entergy's transmission system. Among other things, the E-RSC in concert with the FERC conducted a cost/benefit analysis comparing the ICT arrangement to other transmission proposals, including participation in a regional transmission organization. In September 2010, as modified in October 2010, the Utility operating companies filed a request for a two-year interim extension, with certain modifications, of the ICT arrangement, which was scheduled to expire on November 17, 2010. In November 2010 the FERC issued an order accepting the Utility operating companies’ proposal to extend the ICT arrangement with SPP by an additional term of two years, providing time for analysis of longer term structures. In addition, in December 2010 the FERC issued an order that granted the E-RSC additional authority over transmission upgrades and cost allocation. System Agreement The FERC regulates wholesale rates (including Entergy Utility intrasystem energy allocations pursuant to the System Agreement) and interstate transmission of electricity, as well as rates for System Energy’s sales of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. The Utility operating companies historically have engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which is a rate schedule that has been approved by the FERC. Certain of the Utility operating companies’ retail regulators and other parties are pursuing litigation involving the System Agreement at the FERC. The proceedings include challenges to the allocation of costs as defined by the System Agreement and allegations of imprudence by the Utility operating companies in their execution of their obligations under the System Agreement. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussions of this litigation. Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi Notices of Termination of System Agreement Participation Citing its concerns that the benefits of its continued participation in the current form of the System Agreement have been seriously eroded, in December 2005, Entergy Arkansas submitted its notice that it will terminate its participation in the current System Agreement effective ninety-six (96) months from the date of the notice or such earlier date as authorized by the FERC. In October 2007 the MPSC issued a letter confirming its belief that Entergy Mississippi should exit the System Agreement in light of the recent developments involving the System Agreement. In November 2007, Entergy Mississippi provided its written notice to terminate its participation in the System Agreement effective ninety-six (96) months from the date of the notice or such earlier date as authorized by the FERC. 29 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis On February 2, 2009, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi filed with the FERC their notices of cancellation to terminate their participation in the Entergy System Agreement, effective December 18, 2013 and November 7, 2015, respectively. While the FERC had indicated previously that the notices should be filed 18 months prior to Entergy Arkansas’s termination (approximately mid-2012), the filing explains that resolving this issue now, rather than later, is important to ensure that informed long-term resource planning decisions can be made during the years leading up to Entergy Arkansas’s withdrawal and that all of the Utility operating companies are properly positioned to continue to operate reliably following Entergy Arkansas’s and, eventually, Entergy Mississippi’s, departure from the System Agreement. In November 2009 the FERC accepted the notices of cancellation and determined that Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi are permitted to withdraw from the System Agreement following the 96 month notice period without payment of a fee or the requirement to otherwise compensate the remaining Utility operating companies as a result of withdrawal. In February 2011 the FERC denied the LPSC’s and the City Council’s rehearing requests. The LPSC has appealed the FERC’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and oral argument was held January 13, 2012. Arkansas Public Service Commission System Agreement Investigation The APSC had previously commenced an investigation, in 2004, into whether Entergy Arkansas’s continued participation in the System Agreement is in the best interests of its customers. In February 2010 the APSC issued a show cause order opening an investigation regarding the prudence of Entergy Arkansas’s entering a successor pooling agreement with the other Entergy Utility operating companies, as opposed to becoming a standalone entity upon exit from the System Agreement in December 2013, and whether Entergy Arkansas, as a standalone utility, should join the SPP RTO. The APSC subsequently added evaluation of Entergy Arkansas joining the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator (MISO) RTO on a standalone basis as an alternative to be considered. In August 2010, the APSC directed Entergy Arkansas and all parties to compare five strategic options at the same time as follows: (1) Entergy Arkansas Self-Provide; (2) Entergy Arkansas with 3rd party coordination agreements; (3) Successor Arrangements; (4) Entergy Arkansas as a standalone member of SPP RTO; and (5) Entergy Arkansas as a standalone member of the MISO RTO. LPSC and City Council Action Related to the Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi Notices of Termination In light of the notices of Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi to terminate participation in the current System Agreement, in January 2008 the LPSC unanimously voted to direct the LPSC Staff to begin evaluating the potential for a successor arrangement. The New Orleans City Council opened a docket to gather information on progress towards a successor arrangement. The LPSC subsequently passed a resolution stating that it cannot evaluate successor arrangements without having certainty about System Agreement exit obligations. Entergy’s Proposal to Join the MISO RTO On April 25, 2011, Entergy announced that each of the Utility operating companies propose joining the MISO RTO, which is expected to provide long-term benefits for the customers of each of the Utility operating companies. MISO is a regional transmission organization that operates in 12 U.S. states (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin) and also in Canada. The Utility operating companies provided analysis in May 2011 to their retail regulators supporting this decision. The APSC received additional information from Entergy, MISO, and other parties and held an evidentiary hearing in September 2011. The APSC issued an order in the proceeding in October 2011 finding that it is prudent for Entergy Arkansas to join an RTO but deferred a decision on Entergy Arkansas’s plan to join the MISO RTO until Entergy Arkansas files an application to transfer control of its transmission assets to the MISO RTO. 30 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis Entergy’s May 2011 filings estimate that the transition and implementation costs of joining the MISO RTO could be up to $105 million if all of the Utility operating companies join the MISO RTO, most of which will be spent in late 2012 and 2013. Maintaining the viability of the alternatives of Entergy Arkansas joining the MISO RTO alone or standing alone within an ICT arrangement is expected to result in an additional cost of approximately $35 million, for a total estimated cost of up to $140 million. This amount could increase with extended litigation in various regulatory proceedings. It is expected that costs will be incurred to obtain regulatory approvals, to revise or implement commercial and legal agreements, to integrate transmission and generation facilities, to develop back-office accounting and settlement systems, and to build out communications infrastructure. In the fourth quarter 2011, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans filed applications with their local regulators concerning their proposal to join the MISO RTO and transfer control of each company’s transmission assets to the MISO RTO. Entergy Texas expects to submit its filing in 2012. The applications to join the MISO RTO seek a finding that membership in the MISO RTO is in the public interest. Becoming a member of the MISO RTO will not affect the ownership by the Utility operating companies of their generation and transmission facilities or the responsibility for maintaining those facilities. Once the Utility operating companies are fully integrated as members, however, the MISO RTO will assume control of transmission planning and congestion management and, through its Day 2 market, the commitment and dispatch of generation that is bid into the MISO RTO’s markets. The APSC, the LPSC, and the MPSC have established procedural schedules with hearings scheduled in May/June 2012. The FERC filings related to integrating the Utility operating companies into the MISO RTO are planned for late 2012 or early 2013. The target implementation date for joining the MISO RTO is December 2013. Entergy believes that the decision to join the MISO RTO should be evaluated separately from and independent of the decision regarding the ownership of Entergy’s transmission system, and Entergy plans to pursue the MISO RTO proposal and the planned spin-off and merger of the transmission business on parallel regulatory paths. In December 2011, however, the LPSC ALJ in the MISO RTO proceeding ordered Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana to file testimony regarding the impact of the proposed spin-off and merger of Entergy’s transmission business on the application to join the MISO RTO. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana complied with this order, but also filed a notice of objection and reservation of rights in response to the order, stating that the testimony, as well as related discovery and other proceedings, are not relevant to the decision to join the MISO RTO. In the APSC proceeding regarding the MISO RTO proposal, in February 2012 the APSC ordered the parties to consider to what extent, if any, the proposed spin-off and merger of Entergy’s transmission business might affect Entergy Arkansas’s membership in an RTO or otherwise affect the proceeding. The next round of testimony in the APSC proceeding is scheduled for March 2012. In June 2011, MISO filed with the FERC a request for a transitional waiver of provisions of its open access transmission, energy, and operating reserve markets tariff regarding allocation of transmission network upgrade costs, in order to establish a transition for the integration of the Utility operating companies. Several parties intervened in the proceeding, including Entergy, the APSC, the LPSC, and the City Council, and some of the parties also filed comments or protests. In September 2011 the FERC issued an order denying on procedural grounds MISO’s request, further advising MISO that submitting modified tariff sheets is the appropriate method for implementing the transition that MISO seeks for the Utility operating companies. The FERC did not address the merits of any transition arrangements that may be appropriate to integrate the Utility operating companies into the MISO RTO. MISO worked with its stakeholders to prepare the appropriate changes to its tariff and filed the proposed tariff changes with the FERC in November 2011. Numerous entities filed interventions and protests to MISO’s filing. On January 25, 2012, the FERC sent a letter to MISO requesting additional information relating to MISO’s proposed tariff changes. Notice to SERC Reliability Corporation Regarding Reliability Standards and FERC Investigation Entergy has notified the SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC) of potential violations of certain North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) reliability standards, including certain Critical Infrastructure Protection, Facilities Design, Connection and Maintenance, and System Protection and Control standards. Entergy is working with the SERC to provide information concerning these potential violations. In addition, FERC’s Division of Investigations is conducting an investigation of certain issues relating to the Utility operating companies compliance with certain Reliability Standards related to protective system maintenance, facility ratings and modeling, training, and communications. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the Federal Power Act and FERC regulations. 31 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis U.S. Department of Justice Investigation In September 2010, Entergy was notified that the U.S. Department of Justice had commenced a civil investigation of competitive issues concerning certain generation procurement, dispatch, and transmission system practices and policies of the Utility operating companies. The investigation is ongoing. Market and Credit Risk Sensitive Instruments Market risk is the risk of changes in the value of commodity and financial instruments, or in future net income or cash flows, in response to changing market conditions. Entergy holds commodity and financial instruments that are exposed to the following significant market risks: · The commodity price risk associated with the sale of electricity by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. · The interest rate and equity price risk associated with Entergy’s investments in pension and other postretirement benefit trust funds. See Note 11 to the financial statements for details regarding Entergy’s pension and other postretirement benefit trust funds. · The interest rate and equity price risk associated with Entergy’s investments in nuclear plant decommissioning trust funds, particularly in the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. See Note 17 to the financial statements for details regarding Entergy’s decommissioning trust funds. · The interest rate risk associated with changes in interest rates as a result of Entergy’s issuances of debt. Entergy manages its interest rate exposure by monitoring current interest rates and its debt outstanding in relation to total capitalization. See Notes 4 and 5 to the financial statements for the details of Entergy’s debt outstanding. The Utility business has limited exposure to the effects of market risk because it operates primarily under cost-based rate regulation. To the extent approved by their retail rate regulators, the Utility operating companies hedge the exposure to natural gas price volatility of their fuel and gas purchased for resale costs, which are recovered from customers. Entergy’s commodity and financial instruments are exposed to credit risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss from nonperformance by suppliers, customers, or financial counterparties to a contract or agreement. Entergy is also exposed to a potential demand on liquidity due to credit support requirements within its supply or sales agreements. Commodity Price Risk Power Generation As a wholesale generator, Entergy Wholesale Commodities core business is selling energy, measured in MWh, to its customers. Entergy Wholesale Commodities enters into forward contracts with its customers and sells energy in the day ahead or spot markets. In addition to selling the energy produced by its plants, Entergy Wholesale Commodities sells unforced capacity, which allows load-serving entities to meet specified reserve and related requirements placed on them by the ISOs in their respective areas. Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ forward fixed price power contracts consist of contracts to sell energy only, contracts to sell capacity only, and bundled contracts in which it sells both capacity and energy. While the terminology and payment mechanics vary in these contracts, each of these types of contracts requires Entergy Wholesale Commodities to deliver MWh of energy, make capacity available, or both. The following is a summary as of December 31, 2011 of the amount of Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear power plants’ planned energy output that is sold forward under physical or financial contracts: 32 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis Energy 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Percent of planned generation sold forward: Unit-contingent 61% 38% 14% 12% 12% Unit-contingent with guarantee of availability (1) 16% 19% 15% 13% 13% Firm LD 24% 24% 10% -% -% Offsetting positions (13)% -% -% -% -% Total energy sold forward 88% 81% 39% 25% 25% Planned generation (TWh) (2) (3) 41 40 41 41 40 Average revenue under contract per MWh (4) $49 $45-50 $49-54 $49-57 $50-59 Capacity 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Percent of capacity sold forward: Bundled capacity and energy contracts 18% 16% 16% 16% 16% Capacity contracts 39% 26% 25% 11% -% Total capacity sold forward 57% 42% 41% 27% 16% Planned net MW in operation (3) 4,998 4,998 4,998 4,998 4,998 Average revenue under contract per kW per month (applies to capacity contracts only) $2.4 $3.2 $3.1 $2.9 $- Blended Capacity and Energy Recap (based on revenues) % of planned generation and capacity sold forward 90% 80% 43% 27% 26% Average revenue under contract per MWh (4) $51 $47 $51 $52 $52 (1) A sale of power on a unit-contingent basis coupled with a guarantee of availability provides for the payment to the power purchaser of contract damages, if incurred, in the event the seller fails to deliver power as a result of the failure of the specified generation unit to generate power at or above a specified availability threshold. All of Entergy’s outstanding guarantees of availability provide for dollar limits on Entergy’s maximum liability under such guarantees. (2) Amount of output expected to be generated by Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear units considering plant operating characteristics, outage schedules, and expected market conditions which impact dispatch. (3) Assumes NRC license renewal for plants whose current licenses expire within five years and the continued operation of all six plants. NRC license renewal applications are in process for three units, as follows (with current license expirations in parentheses): Pilgrim (June 2012), Indian Point 2 (September 2013), and Indian Point 3 (December 2015). For a discussion regarding the continued operation of the Vermont Yankee plant, see “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets” in Note 1 to the financial statements. (4) Revenue on a per unit basis at which generation output, capacity, or a combination of both is expected to be sold to third parties (including offsetting positions), given existing contract or option exercise prices based on expected dispatch or capacity, excluding the revenue associated with the amortization of the below-market PPA for Palisades. Revenue may fluctuate due to factors including positive or negative basis differentials, option premiums and market prices at time of option expiration, costs to convert firm LD to unit-contingent, and other risk management costs. Also, average revenue under contract excludes payments owed under the value sharing agreement with NYPA. 33 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis Entergy estimates that a $10 per MWh change in the annual average energy price in the markets in which the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear business sells power, based on the respective year-end market conditions, planned generation volumes, and hedged positions, would have a corresponding effect on pre-tax net income of $48 million in 2012 and would have had a corresponding effect on pre-tax net income of $17 million in 2011. Entergy’s purchase of the FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3 plants from NYPA included value sharing agreements with NYPA. In October 2007, NYPA and the subsidiaries that own the FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3 plants amended and restated the value sharing agreements to clarify and amend certain provisions of the original terms. Under the amended value sharing agreements, the Entergy subsidiaries agreed to make annual payments to NYPA based on the generation output of the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick plants from January 2007 through December 2014. Entergy subsidiaries will pay NYPA $6.59 per MWh for power sold from Indian Point 3, up to an annual cap of $48 million, and $3.91 per MWh for power sold from FitzPatrick, up to an annual cap of $24 million. The annual payment for each year’s output is due by January 15 of the following year. Entergy will record the liability for payments to NYPA as power is generated and sold by Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick. In 2011, 2010, and 2009, Entergy Wholesale Commodities recorded a $72 million liability for generation during each of those years. An amount equal to the liability was recorded each year to the plant asset account as contingent purchase price consideration for the plants. This amount will be depreciated over the expected remaining useful life of the plants. Some of the agreements to sell the power produced by Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ power plants contain provisions that require an Entergy subsidiary to provide collateral to secure its obligations under the agreements. The Entergy subsidiary is required to provide collateral based upon the difference between the current market and contracted power prices in the regions where Entergy Wholesale Commodities sells power. The primary form of collateral to satisfy these requirements is an Entergy Corporation guaranty. Cash and letters of credit are also acceptable forms of collateral. At December 31, 2011, based on power prices at that time, Entergy had liquidity exposure of $133 million under the guarantees in place supporting Entergy Wholesale Commodities transactions, $20 million of guarantees that support letters of credit, and $6 million of posted cash collateral to the ISOs. As of December 31, 2011, the liquidity exposure associated with Entergy Wholesale Commodities assurance requirements would increase by $132 million for a $1 per MMBtu increase in gas prices in both the short-and long-term markets. In the event of a decrease in Entergy Corporation’s credit rating to below investment grade, based on power prices as of December 31, 2011, Entergy would have been required to provide approximately $44 million of additional cash or letters of credit under some of the agreements. As of December 31, 2011, substantially all of the counterparties or their guarantors for 100% of the planned energy output under contract for Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants through 2016 have public investment grade credit ratings. Nuclear Matters After the nuclear incident in Japan resulting from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the NRC established a task force to conduct a review of processes and regulations relating to nuclear facilities in the United States. The task force issued a near term (90-day) report in July 2011 that has made recommendations, which are currently being evaluated by the NRC. It is anticipated that the NRC will issue certain orders and requests for information to nuclear plant licensees by the end of the first quarter 2012 that will begin to implement the task force’s recommendations. These orders may require U.S. nuclear operators, including Entergy, to undertake plant modifications or perform additional analyses that could, among other things, result in increased costs and capital requirements associated with operating Entergy’s nuclear plants. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of Entergy’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and 34 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in these assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Nuclear Decommissioning Costs Entergy subsidiaries own nuclear generation facilities in both its Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities business units. Regulations require Entergy subsidiaries to decommission the nuclear power plants after each facility is taken out of service, and money is collected and deposited in trust funds during the facilities’ operating lives in order to provide for this obligation. Entergy conducts periodic decommissioning cost studies to estimate the costs that will be incurred to decommission the facilities. The following key assumptions have a significant effect on these estimates: · Cost Escalation Factors - Entergy’s current decommissioning cost studies include an assumption that decommissioning costs will escalate over present cost levels by annual factors ranging from approximately 2.5% to 3.5%. A 50 basis point change in this assumption could change the ultimate cost of decommissioning a facility by as much as an approximate average of 20% to 25%. To the extent that a high probability of license renewal is assumed, a change in the estimated inflation or cost escalation rate has a larger effect on the undiscounted cash flows because the rate of inflation is factored into the calculation for a longer period of time. · Timing - In projecting decommissioning costs, two assumptions must be made to estimate the timing of plant decommissioning. First, the date of the plant’s retirement must be estimated. A high probability that the plant’s license will be renewed and operate for some time beyond the original license term has currently been assumed for purposes of calculating the decommissioning liability for a number of Entergy’s nuclear units. Second, an assumption must be made whether decommissioning will begin immediately upon plant retirement, or whether the plant will be held in SAFSTOR status for later decommissioning, as permitted by applicable regulations. SAFSTOR is decommissioning a facility by placing it in a safe stable condition that is maintained until it is subsequently decontaminated and dismantled to levels that permit license termination, normally within 60 years from permanent cessation of operations. While the effect of these assumptions cannot be determined with precision, a change of assumption of either the probability of license renewal or use of a SAFSTOR period can possibly change the present value of these obligations. Future revisions to appropriately reflect changes needed to the estimate of decommissioning costs will affect net income, only to the extent that the estimate of any reduction in the liability exceeds the amount of the undepreciated asset retirement cost at the date of the revision, for unregulated portions of Entergy’s business. Any increases in the liability recorded due to such changes are capitalized and depreciated over the asset’s remaining economic life. · Spent Fuel Disposal - Federal law requires the DOE to provide for the permanent storage of spent nuclear fuel, and legislation has been passed by Congress to develop a repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. However, funding for the Yucca Mountain repository was almost completely eliminated from the federal budget for the current and prior years, and hearings on the facility’s NRC license have been suspended indefinitely. The DOE has not yet begun accepting spent nuclear fuel and is in non-compliance with federal law. The DOE continues to delay meeting its obligation and Entergy is continuing to pursue damages claims against the DOE for its failure to provide timely spent fuel storage. Until a federal site is available, however, nuclear plant operators must provide for interim spent fuel storage on the nuclear plant site, which can require the construction and maintenance of dry cask storage sites or other facilities. The costs of developing and maintaining these facilities can have a significant effect (as much as an average of 20% to 30% of estimated decommissioning costs). Entergy’s decommissioning studies may include cost estimates for spent fuel storage. However, these estimates could change in the future based on the timing of the opening of an appropriate facility designated by the federal government to receive spent nuclear fuel. · Technology and Regulation - Over the past several years, more practical experience with the actual decommissioning of facilities has been gained and that experience has been incorporated into Entergy’s current decommissioning cost estimates. However, given the long duration of decommissioning projects, additional experience, including technological advancements in decommissioning, could occur and affect current cost estimates. If regulations regarding nuclear decommissioning were to change, this could have a potentially significant effect on cost estimates. The effect of these potential changes is not presently determinable. 35 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis · Interest Rates - The estimated decommissioning costs that form the basis for the decommissioning liability recorded on the balance sheet are discounted to present values using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. When the decommissioning cost estimate is significantly changed requiring a revision to the decommissioning liability and the change results in an increase in cash flows, that increase is discounted using a current credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Under accounting rules, if the revision in estimate results in a decrease in estimated cash flows, that decrease is discounted using the previous credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Therefore, to the extent that one of the factors noted above changes resulting in a significant increase in estimated cash flows, current interest rates will affect the calculation of the present value of the additional decommissioning liability. In the first quarter 2011, System Energy recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liability for Grand Gulf as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study. The revised estimate resulted in a $38.9 million reduction in its decommissioning liability, along with a corresponding reduction in the related regulatory asset. In the fourth quarter 2011, Entergy Wholesale Commodities recorded a reduction of $34.1 million in its decommissioning cost liability for a plant as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study obtained to comply with a state regulatory requirement. The revised cost study resulted in a change in the undiscounted cash flows and a credit to decommissioning expense of $34.1 million ($21 million net-of-tax) was recorded, reflecting the excess of the reduction in the liability over the amount of undepreciated assets. Unbilled Revenue As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation. Impairment of Long-lived Assets and Trust Fund Investments Entergy has significant investments in long-lived assets in all of its segments, and Entergy evaluates these assets against the market economics and under the accounting rules for impairment whenever there are indications that impairments may exist. This evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and uncertainty. In the Utility business, portions of River Bend are not included in rate base, which could reduce the revenue that would otherwise be recovered for the applicable portions of its generation. In the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, Entergy’s investments in merchant nuclear generation assets are subject to impairment if adverse market conditions arise, if a unit ceases operation, or for certain units if their operating licenses are not renewed. Entergy’s investments in merchant non-nuclear generation assets are subject to impairment if adverse market conditions arise or if a unit ceases operation. In order to determine if Entergy should recognize an impairment of a long-lived asset that is to be held and used, accounting standards require that the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the asset be compared to the asset’s carrying value. The carrying value of the asset includes any capitalized asset retirement cost associated with the recording of an additional decommissioning liability, therefore changes in assumptions that affect the decommissioning liability can increase or decrease the carrying value of the asset subject to impairment. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is recorded; if such cash flows are less than the carrying value, Entergy is required to record an impairment charge to write the asset down to its fair value. If an asset is held for sale, an impairment is required to be recognized if the fair value (less costs to sell) of the asset is less than its carrying value. 36 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis These estimates are based on a number of key assumptions, including: · Future power and fuel prices - Electricity and gas prices have been very volatile in recent years, and this volatility is expected to continue. This volatility necessarily increases the imprecision inherent in the long-term forecasts of commodity prices that are a key determinant of estimated future cash flows. · Market value of generation assets - Valuing assets held for sale requires estimating the current market value of generation assets. While market transactions provide evidence for this valuation, the market for such assets is volatile and the value of individual assets is impacted by factors unique to those assets. · Future operating costs - Entergy assumes relatively minor annual increases in operating costs. Technological or regulatory changes that have a significant impact on operations could cause a significant change in these assumptions. · Timing - Entergy currently assumes, for a number of its nuclear units, that the plant’s license will be renewed. A change in that assumption could have a significant effect on the expected future cash flows and result in a significant effect on operations. For additional discussion regarding the continued operation of the Vermont Yankee plant, see “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets” in Note 1 to the financial statements. Effective January 1, 2009, Entergy adopted an accounting pronouncement providing guidance regarding recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments related to investments in debt securities. The assessment of whether an investment in a debt security has suffered an other-than-temporary impairment is based on whether Entergy has the intent to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized costs. Further, if Entergy does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security, an other-than-temporary-impairment is considered to have occurred and it is measured by the present value of cash flows expected to be collected less the amortized cost basis (credit loss). For debt securities held as of January 1, 2009 for which an other-than-temporary impairment had previously been recognized but for which assessment under the new guidance indicates this impairment is temporary, Entergy recorded an adjustment to its opening balance of retained earnings of $11.3 million ($6.4 million net-of-tax). Entergy did not have any material other than temporary impairments relating to credit losses on debt securities in 2011, 2010, or 2009. The assessment of whether an investment in an equity security has suffered an other than temporary impairment continues to be based on a number of factors including, first, whether Entergy has the ability and intent to hold the investment to recover its value, the duration and severity of any losses, and, then, whether it is expected that the investment will recover its value within a reasonable period of time. Entergy’s trusts are managed by third parties who operate in accordance with agreements that define investment guidelines and place restrictions on the purchases and sales of investments. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, unrealized losses that are not considered temporarily impaired are recorded in earnings for Entergy Wholesale Commodities. Entergy Wholesale Commodities recorded charges to other income of $0.1 million in 2011, $1 million in 2010, and $86 million in 2009 resulting from the recognition of impairments of certain securities held in its decommissioning trust funds that are not considered temporary. Additional impairments could be recorded in 2012 to the extent that then current market conditions change the evaluation of recoverability of unrealized losses. Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Entergy sponsors qualified, defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age and meet certain eligibility requirements while still working for Entergy. Entergy’s reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate for the Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities segments. 37 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis Assumptions Key actuarial assumptions utilized in determining these costs include: · Discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations; · Projected health care cost trend rates; · Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets; · Rate of increase in future compensation levels; · Retirement rates; and · Mortality rates. Entergy reviews the first four assumptions listed above on an annual basis and adjusts them as necessary. The falling interest rate environment and volatility in the financial equity markets have impacted Entergy’s funding and reported costs for these benefits. In addition, these trends have caused Entergy to make a number of adjustments to its assumptions. The retirement and mortality rate assumptions are reviewed every three to five years as part of an actuarial study that compares these assumptions to the actual experience of the pension and other postretirement plans. The 2011 actuarial study reviewed plan experience from 2007 through 2010. As a result of the 2011 actuarial study, changes were made to reflect the expectation that participants have longer life expectancies and different retirement patterns than previously assumed. These changes are reflected in the December 31, 2011 financial disclosures and are a significant factor in the increase in 2012 pension and other postretirement costs compared to the 2011 costs. In selecting an assumed discount rate to calculate benefit obligations, Entergy reviews market yields on high-quality corporate debt and matches these rates with Entergy’s projected stream of benefit payments. Based on recent market trends, the discount rates used to calculate its qualified pension benefit obligation decreased from a range of 5.6% to 5.7% for its specific pension plans in 2010 to a range of 5.1% to 5.2% in 2011. The discount rate used to calculate its other postretirement benefit obligation also decreased from 5.5% in 2010 to 5.1% in 2011. Entergy reviews actual recent cost trends and projected future trends in establishing health care cost trend rates. Based on this review, Entergy’s assumed health care cost trend rate assumption used in measuring the December 31, 2011 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and 2012 postretirement cost was 7.75% for pre-65 retirees and 7.5% for post-65 retirees for 2012, gradually decreasing each successive year until it reaches 4.75% in 2022 and beyond for both pre-65 and post-65 retirees. Entergy’s health care cost trend rate assumption used in measuring the December 31, 2010 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and 2011 postretirement cost was 8.5% for pre-65 retirees and 8.0% for post-65 retirees for 2011, gradually decreasing each successive year, until it reaches a 4.75% annual increase in health care costs in 2019 for pre-65 retirees and 4.75% in 2018 and beyond for post-65 retirees. The assumed rate of increase in future compensation levels used to calculate 2011 and 2010 benefit obligations was 4.23%. In determining its expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in the calculation of benefit plan costs, Entergy reviews past performance, current and expected future asset allocations, and capital market assumptions of its investment consultant and investment managers. Since 2003, Entergy has targeted an asset allocation for its qualified pension plan assets of roughly 65% equity securities and 35% fixed-income securities. Entergy completed and adopted an optimization study in 2011 for the pension assets which recommended that the target asset allocation adjust dynamically over time, based on the funded status of the plan, from its current to its ultimate allocation of 45% equity, 55% fixed income. The ultimate asset allocation is expected to be attained when the plan is 105% funded. 38 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis The current target allocations for Entergy’s non-taxable postretirement benefit assets are 55% equity securities and 45% fixed-income securities and, for its taxable other postretirement benefit assets, 35% equity securities and 65% fixed-income securities. Entergy also completed and adopted an optimization study in 2011 for the postretirement benefit trust assets that recommends both the taxable and the non-taxable assets move to 65% equity securities and 35% fixed-income securities. Entergy plans to adjust the postretirement asset allocation during 2012. Entergy’s expected long term rate of return on qualified pension assets used to calculate 2011, 2010 and 2009 qualified pension costs was 8.5% and will be 8.5% for 2012. Entergy’s expected long term rate of return on non-taxable other postretirement assets used to calculate other postretirement costs was 7.75% for 2011 and 2010, 8.5% for 2009 and will be 8.5% for 2012. For Entergy’s taxable postretirement assets, the expected long term rate of return was 5.5% for 2011 and 2010, 6% for 2009 and will be 6.5% in 2012. Cost Sensitivity The following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost and qualified pension projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands): Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2011 Qualified Pension Cost Impact on Qualified Projected Benefit Obligation Increase/(Decrease) Discount rate (0.25%) $17,145 $188,246 Rate of return on plan assets (0.25%) $8,863 - Rate of increase in compensation 0.25% $7,503 $41,227 The following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands): Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2011 Postretirement Benefit Cost Impact on Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation Increase/(Decrease) Health care cost trend 0.25% $8,900 $52,730 Discount rate (0.25%) $6,622 $62,316 Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant. Accounting Mechanisms Accounting standards require an employer to recognize in its balance sheet the funded status of its benefit plans. Refer to Note 11 to the financial statements for a further discussion of Entergy’s funded status. In accordance with pension accounting standards, Entergy utilizes a number of accounting mechanisms that reduce the volatility of reported pension costs. Differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred and are amortized into expense only when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. If necessary, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees. 39 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis Entergy calculates the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the long-term expected rate of return on assets by the market-related value (MRV) of plan assets. Entergy determines the MRV of pension plan assets by calculating a value that uses a 20-quarter phase-in of the difference between actual and expected returns. For other postretirement benefit plan assets Entergy uses fair value when determining MRV. Costs and Funding In 2011, Entergy’s total qualified pension cost was $154 million. Entergy anticipates 2012 qualified pension cost to be $264 million. Pension funding was approximately $400 million for 2011. Entergy’s contributions to the pension trust are currently estimated to be approximately $163 million in 2012, although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. Entergy’s preliminary estimates of 2012 funding requirements indicate that the contributions will not exceed historical levels of pension contributions. Minimum required funding calculations as determined under Pension Protection Act guidance are performed annually as of January 1 of each year and are based on measurements of the assets and funding liabilities as measured at that date. Any excess of the funding liability over the calculated fair market value of assets results in a funding shortfall which, under the Pension Protection Act, must be funded over a seven-year rolling period. The Pension Protection Act also imposes certain plan limitations if the funded percentage, which is based on a calculated fair market values of assets divided by funding liabilities, does not meet certain thresholds. For funding purposes, asset gains and losses are smoothed in to the calculated fair market value of assets and the funding liability is based upon a weighted average 24-month corporate bond rate published by the U.S. Treasury; therefore, periodic changes in asset returns and interest rates can affect funding shortfalls and future cash contributions. Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy in 2011 were $114.7 million, including $33 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy expects 2012 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to be $138.4 million. This includes a projected $31.2 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy contributed $76.1 million to its postretirement plans in 2011. Entergy’s current estimate of contributions to its other postretirement plans is approximately $80.4 million in 2012. Federal Healthcare Legislation The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) became federal law on March 23, 2010, and, on March 30, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 became federal law and amended certain provisions of the PPACA. These new federal laws change the law governing employer-sponsored group health plans, like Entergy's plans, and include, among other things, the following significant provisions: · A 40% excise tax on per capita medical benefit costs that exceed certain thresholds; · Change in coverage limits for dependents; and · Elimination of lifetime caps. The total impact of PPACA is not yet determinable because technical guidance regarding application must still be issued. Additionally, ongoing litigation and discussions are in progress regarding the constitutionality of and the potential repeal of health care reform, although whether that occurs and what parts of health care reform would be invalidated or repealed is not yet known. Entergy will continue to monitor these developments to determine the possible impact on Entergy as a result of PPACA. Entergy is participating in the programs currently provided for under PPACA, such as the early retiree reinsurance program, which has provided for some limited reimbursements of certain claims for early retirees aged 55 to 64 who are not yet eligible for Medicare. One provision of the new law that is effective in 2013 eliminates the federal income tax deduction for prescription drug expenses of Medicare beneficiaries for which the plan sponsor also receives the retiree drug subsidy under Part D. Entergy receives subsidy payments under the Medicare Part D plan and therefore in the first quarter 2010 recorded a reduction to the deferred tax asset related to the unfunded other postretirement benefit obligation. The offset was recorded in 2010 as a $16 million charge to income tax expense or, for the Utility, including each Registrant Subsidiary, as a regulatory asset. 40 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis Other Contingencies As a company with multi-state domestic utility operations and a history of international investments, Entergy is subject to a number of federal, state, and international laws and regulations and other factors and conditions in the areas in which it operates, which potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, and other risks. Entergy periodically evaluates its exposure for such risks and records a reserve for those matters which are considered probable and estimable in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Environmental Entergy must comply with environmental laws and regulations applicable to the handling and disposal of hazardous waste. Under these various laws and regulations, Entergy could incur substantial costs to restore properties consistent with the various standards. Entergy conducts studies to determine the extent of any required remediation and has recorded reserves based upon its evaluation of the likelihood of loss and expected dollar amount for each issue. Additional sites could be identified which require environmental remediation for which Entergy could be liable. The amounts of environmental reserves recorded can be significantly affected by the following external events or conditions: · Changes to existing state or federal regulation by governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. · The identification of additional sites or the filing of other complaints in which Entergy may be asserted to be a potentially responsible party. · The resolution or progression of existing matters through the court system or resolution by the EPA. Litigation Entergy is regularly named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits involving employment, customers, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters. Entergy periodically reviews the cases in which it has been named as defendant and assesses the likelihood of loss in each case as probable, reasonably estimable, or remote and records reserves for cases which have a probable likelihood of loss and can be estimated. Given the environment in which Entergy operates, and the unpredictable nature of many of the cases in which Entergy is named as a defendant, the ultimate outcome of the litigation to which Entergy is exposed has the potential to materially affect the results of operations of Entergy or Registrant Subsidiaries. Uncertain Tax Positions Entergy’s operations, including acquisitions and divestitures, require Entergy to evaluate risks such as the potential tax effects of a transaction, or warranties made in connection with such a transaction. Entergy believes that it has adequately assessed and provided for these types of risks, where applicable. Any provisions recorded for these types of issues, however, could be significantly affected by events such as claims made by third parties under warranties, additional transactions contemplated by Entergy, or completion of reviews of the tax treatment of certain transactions or issues by taxing authorities. New Accounting Pronouncements The accounting standard-setting process, including projects between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to converge U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards, is ongoing and the FASB and the IASB are each currently working on several projects that have not yet resulted in final pronouncements. Final pronouncements that result from these projects could have a material effect on Entergy’s future net income, financial position, or cash flows. 41 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis In May 2011 the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-4, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs,” which states that the ASU explains how to measure fair value. The ASU states that: 1) the amendments in the ASU result in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards; 2) consequently, the amendments change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements; 3) for many of the requirements, the FASB does not intend for the ASU to result in a change in the application of the requirements of current U.S. GAAP; 4) some of the amendments clarify the FASB’s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements; and 5) other amendments change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements. ASU No. 2011-4 is effective for Entergy for the first quarter 2012. Entergy does not expect ASU No. 2011-4 to affect materially its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In September 2011 the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-8, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment.” The amendments permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment. ASU No. 2011-8 is effective for Entergy for the first quarter 2012. ASU No. 2011-8 will have no effect on Entergy’s results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 42 Table of Contents ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES REPORT OF MANAGEMENT Management of Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries has prepared and is responsible for the financial statements and related financial information included in this document. To meet this responsibility, management establishes and maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This system includes communication through written policies and procedures, an employee Code of Entegrity, and an organizational structure that provides for appropriate division of responsibility and training of personnel. This system is also tested by a comprehensive internal audit program. Entergy management assesses the effectiveness of Entergy’s internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. In making this assessment, management uses the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework. Management acknowledges, however, that all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Entergy Corporation and the Registrant Subsidiaries’ independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of Entergy’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, which is included herein on pages 400 through 407. In addition, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, composed solely of independent Directors, meets with the independent auditors, internal auditors, management, and internal accountants periodically to discuss internal controls, and auditing and financial reporting matters. The Audit Committee appoints the independent auditors annually, seeks shareholder ratification of the appointment, and reviews with the independent auditors the scope and results of the audit effort. The Audit Committee also meets periodically with the independent auditors and the chief internal auditor without management present, providing free access to the Audit Committee. Based on management’s assessment of internal controls using the COSO criteria, management believes that Entergy and each of the Registrant Subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. Management further believes that this assessment, combined with the policies and procedures noted above, provides reasonable assurance that Entergy’s and each of the Registrant Subsidiaries’ financial statements are fairly and accurately presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries. As required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, all intercompany transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Entergy’s Registrant Subsidiaries (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) also include their separate financial statements in this Form 10-K. The Registrant Subsidiaries and many other Entergy subsidiaries maintain accounts in accordance with FERC and other regulatory guidelines. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to current classifications, with no effect on net income or common shareholders’ (or members’) equity. Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements In conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, the preparation of Entergy Corporation’s consolidated financial statements and the separate financial statements of the Registrant Subsidiaries requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Adjustments to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities may be necessary in the future to the extent that future estimates or actual results are different from the estimates used. Revenues and Fuel Costs Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy Texas generate, transmit, and distribute electric power primarily to retail customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, respectively. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana also distributes natural gas to retail customers in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Entergy New Orleans sells both electric power and natural gas to retail customers in the City of New Orleans, except for Algiers, where Entergy Louisiana is the electric power supplier. The Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment derives almost all of its revenue from sales of electric power generated by plants owned by subsidiaries in that segment. Entergy recognizes revenue from electric power and natural gas sales when power or gas is delivered to customers. To the extent that deliveries have occurred but a bill has not been issued, Entergy’s Utility operating companies accrue an estimate of the revenues for energy delivered since the latest billings. The Utility operating companies calculate the estimate based upon several factors including billings through the last billing cycle in a month, actual generation in the month, historical line loss factors, and prices in effect in Entergy’s Utility operating companies’ various jurisdictions. Changes are made to the inputs in the estimate as needed to reflect changes in billing practices. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and unbilled accounts receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. Therefore, changes in price and volume differences resulting from factors such as weather affect the calculation of unbilled revenues from one period to the next, and may result in variability in reported revenues from one period to the next as prior estimates are reversed and new estimates recorded. Entergy records revenue from sales under rates implemented subject to refund less estimated amounts accrued for probable refunds when Entergy believes it is probable that revenues will be refunded to customers based upon the status of the rate proceeding as of the date the financial statements are prepared. 53 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Entergy’s Utility operating companies’ rate schedules include either fuel adjustment clauses or fixed fuel factors, which allow either current recovery in billings to customers or deferral of fuel costs until the costs are billed to customers. Where the fuel component of revenues is billed based on a pre-determined fuel cost (fixed fuel factor), the fuel factor remains in effect until changed as part of a general rate case, fuel reconciliation, or fixed fuel factor filing.System Energy’s operating revenues are intended to recover from Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans operating expenses and capital costs attributable to Grand Gulf. The capital costs are computed by allowing a return on System Energy’s common equity funds allocable to its net investment in Grand Gulf, plus System Energy’s effective interest cost for its debt allocable to its investment in Grand Gulf. Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis at rates based on the applicable estimated service lives of the various classes of property. For the Registrant Subsidiaries, the original cost of plant retired or removed, less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation. Normal maintenance, repairs, and minor replacement costs are charged to operating expenses. Substantially all of the Registrant Subsidiaries’ plant is subject to mortgage liens. Electric plant includes the portions of Grand Gulf and Waterford 3 that have been sold and leased back. For financial reporting purposes, these sale and leaseback arrangements are reflected as financing transactions. Net property, plant, and equipment for Entergy (including property under capital lease and associated accumulated amortization) by business segment and functional category, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, is shown below: 2011 Entergy Utility Entergy Wholesale Commodities Parent & Other (In Millions) Production Nuclear $8,635 $5,441 $3,194 $- Other 2,431 2,032 399 - Transmission 3,344 3,309 35 - Distribution 6,157 6,157 - - Other 1,716 1,463 250 3 Construction work in progress 1,780 1,420 359 1 Nuclear fuel 1,546 802 744 - Property, plant, and equipment - net $25,609 $20,624 $4,981 $4 54 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements 2010 Entergy Utility Entergy Wholesale Commodities Parent & Other (In Millions) Production Nuclear $8,393 $5,378 $3,015 $- Other 1,842 1,797 45 - Transmission 2,986 2,956 30 - Distribution 5,926 5,926 - - Other 1,661 1,411 248 2 Construction work in progress 1,662 1,300 361 1 Nuclear fuel 1,378 760 618 - Property, plant, and equipment - net $23,848 $19,528 $4,317 $3 Depreciation rates on average depreciable property for Entergy approximated 2.6% in 2011, 2.6% in 2010, and 2.7% in 2009.

Jointly-Owned Generating Stations Certain Entergy subsidiaries jointly own electric generating facilities with affiliates or third parties. The investments and expenses associated with these generating stations are recorded by the Entergy subsidiaries to the extent of their respective undivided ownership interests. As of December 31, 2011, the subsidiaries’ investment and accumulated depreciation in each of these generating stations were as follows: 56 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Generating Stations Fuel-Type Total Megawatt Capability (1) Ownership Investment Accumulated Depreciation (In Millions) Utility business: Entergy Arkansas - Independence Unit 1 Coal 836 31.50% $128 $96 Common Facilities Coal 15.75% $33 $24 White Bluff Units 1 and 2 Coal 1,659 57.00% $494 $337 Ouachita (2) Common Facilities Gas 66.67% $171 $142 Entergy Gulf States Louisiana - Roy S.

The investment and accumulated depreciation numbers above are only for the common facilities and not for the generating units. (3) Includes an 11.5% leasehold interest held by System Energy. System Energy’s Grand Gulf lease obligations are discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements. 57 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Nuclear Refueling Outage Costs Nuclear refueling outage costs are deferred during the outage and amortized over the estimated period to the next outage because these refueling outage expenses are incurred to prepare the units to operate for the next operating cycle without having to be taken off line. Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) AFUDC represents the approximate net composite interest cost of borrowed funds and a reasonable return on the equity funds used for construction by the Registrant Subsidiaries. AFUDC increases both the plant balance and earnings and is realized in cash through depreciation provisions included in the rates charged to customers. Income Taxes Entergy Corporation and the majority of its subsidiaries file a United States consolidated federal income tax return. Each tax-paying entity records income taxes as if it were a separate taxpayer and consolidating adjustments are allocated to the tax filing entities in accordance with Entergy’s intercompany income tax allocation agreement. Deferred income taxes are recorded for all temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for certain credits available for carryforward. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates in the period in which the tax or rate was enacted. Investment tax credits are deferred and amortized based upon the average useful life of the related property, in accordance with ratemaking treatment. Earnings per Share The following table presents Entergy’s basic and diluted earnings per share calculation included on the consolidated statements of income: For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (In Millions, Except Per Share Data) Basic earnings per average common share Income Shares $/share Income Shares $/share Income Shares $/share Net income attributable to Entergy Corporation $1,346.4 177.4 $7.59 $1,250.2 186.0 $6.72 $1,231.1 192.8 $6.39 Average dilutive effect of: Stock options - 1.0 (0.04) - 1.8 (0.06) - 2.2 (0.07) Equity units - - - - - - 3.2 0.8 (0.02) Diluted earnings per average common share $1,346.4 178.4 $7.55 $1,250.2 187.8 $6.66 $1,234.3 195.8 $6.30 The calculation of diluted earnings per share excluded 5,712,604 options outstanding at December 31, 2011, 5,380,262 options outstanding at December 31, 2010, and 4,368,614 options outstanding at December 31, 2009 that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future. Those options were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise price of those options exceeded the average market price for the year. See Note 7 to the financial statements for a discussion of the equity units. 58 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Stock-based Compensation Plans Entergy grants stock options to key employees of the Entergy subsidiaries, which is described more fully in Note 12 to the financial statements. Entergy accounts for stock options using the fair value based method. Awards under Entergy’s plans generally vest over three years. Accounting for the Effects of Regulation Entergy’s Utility operating companies and System Energy are rate-regulated enterprises whose rates meet three criteria specified in accounting standards. The Utility operating companies and System Energy have rates that (i) are approved by a body (its regulator) empowered to set rates that bind customers; (ii) are cost-based; and (iii) can be charged to and collected from customers. These criteria may also be applied to separable portions of a utility’s business, such as the generation or transmission functions, or to specific classes of customers. Because the Utility operating companies and System Energy meet these criteria, each of them capitalizes costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if the rate actions of its regulator make it probable that those costs will be recovered in future revenue. Such capitalized costs are reflected as regulatory assets in the accompanying financial statements. When an enterprise concludes that recovery of a regulatory asset is no longer probable, the regulatory asset must be removed from the entity’s balance sheet. An enterprise that ceases to meet the three criteria for all or part of its operations should report that event in its financial statements. In general, the enterprise no longer meeting the criteria should eliminate from its balance sheet all regulatory assets and liabilities related to the applicable operations. Additionally, if it is determined that a regulated enterprise is no longer recovering all of its costs, it is possible that an impairment may exist that could require further write-offs of plant assets. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana does not apply regulatory accounting standards to the Louisiana retail deregulated portion of River Bend, the 30% interest in River Bend formerly owned by Cajun, and its steam business. The Louisiana retail deregulated portion of River Bend is operated under a deregulated asset plan representing a portion (approximately 15%) of River Bend plant costs, generation, revenues, and expenses established under a 1992 LPSC order. The plan allows Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to sell the electricity from the deregulated assets to Louisiana retail customers at 4.6 cents per kWh or off-system at higher prices, with certain provisions for sharing incremental revenue above 4.6 cents per kWh between ratepayers and shareholders. Cash and Cash Equivalents Entergy considers all unrestricted highly liquid debt instruments with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects Entergy’s best estimate of losses on the accounts receivable balances. The allowance is based on accounts receivable agings, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Utility operating company customer accounts receivable are written off consistent with approved regulatory requirements. Investments Entergy records decommissioning trust funds on the balance sheet at their fair value. Because of the ability of the Registrant Subsidiaries to recover decommissioning costs in rates and in accordance with the regulatory treatment for decommissioning trust funds, the Registrant Subsidiaries have recorded an offsetting amount of unrealized gains/(losses) on investment securities in other regulatory liabilities/assets. For the portion of River Bend that is not rate-regulated, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has recorded an offsetting amount of unrealized gains/(losses) in other deferred credits. Decommissioning trust funds for Pilgrim, Indian Point 2, Vermont Yankee, and Palisades do not meet the criteria for regulatory accounting treatment. Accordingly, unrealized gains recorded on the assets in these trust funds are recognized in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders’ equity because these assets are classified as available for sale. Unrealized losses (where cost exceeds fair market value) on the assets in these trust funds are also recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of 59 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements shareholders’ equity unless the unrealized loss is other than temporary and therefore recorded in earnings. The assessment of whether an investment in a debt security has suffered an other-than-temporary impairment is based on whether Entergy has the intent to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized costs. Further, if Entergy does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security, an other-than-temporary impairment is considered to have occurred and it is measured by the present value of cash flows expected to be collected less the amortized cost basis (credit loss). The assessment of whether an investment in an equity security has suffered an other-than-temporary impairment is based on a number of factors including, first, whether Entergy has the ability and intent to hold the investment to recover its value, the duration and severity of any losses, and, then, whether it is expected that the investment will recover its value within a reasonable period of time. Entergy’s trusts are managed by third parties who operate in accordance with agreements that define investment guidelines and place restrictions on the purchases and sales of investments. See Note 17 to the financial statements for details on the decommissioning trust funds and other than temporary impairments recorded in 2011, 2010, and 2009. Equity Method Investments Entergy owns investments that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting because Entergy’s ownership level results in significant influence, but not control, over the investee and its operations. Entergy records its share of earnings or losses of the investee based on the change during the period in the estimated liquidation value of the investment, assuming that the investee’s assets were to be liquidated at book value. In accordance with this method, earnings are allocated to owners or members based on what each partner would receive from its capital account if, hypothetically, liquidation were to occur at the balance sheet date and amounts distributed were based on recorded book values. Entergy discontinues the recognition of losses on equity investments when its share of losses equals or exceeds its carrying amount for an investee plus any advances made or commitments to provide additional financial support. See Note 14 to the financial statements for additional information regarding Entergy’s equity method investments. Derivative Financial Instruments and Commodity Derivatives The accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities require that all derivatives be recognized at fair value on the balance sheet, either as assets or liabilities, unless they meet various exceptions including the normal purchase, normal sales criteria. The changes in the fair value of recognized derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and the type of hedge transaction. Contracts for commodities that will be physically delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold in the ordinary course of business, including certain purchases and sales of power and fuel, meet the normal purchase, normal sales criteria and are not recognized on the balance sheet. Revenues and expenses from these contracts are reported on a gross basis in the appropriate revenue and expense categories as the commodities are received or delivered. For other contracts for commodities in which Entergy is hedging the variability of cash flows related to a variable-rate asset, liability, or forecasted transactions that qualify as cash flow hedges, the changes in the fair value of such derivative instruments are reported in other comprehensive income. To qualify for hedge accounting, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be documented to include the risk management objective and strategy and, at inception and on an ongoing basis, the effectiveness of the hedge in offsetting the changes in the cash flows of the item being hedged. Gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings in the periods when the underlying transactions actually occur. The ineffective portions of all hedges are recognized in current-period earnings. Entergy has determined that contracts to purchase uranium do not meet the definition of a derivative under the accounting standards for derivative instruments because they do not provide for net settlement and the uranium markets are not sufficiently liquid to conclude that forward contracts are readily convertible to cash. If the uranium markets do become sufficiently liquid in the future and Entergy begins to account for uranium purchase contracts as 60 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements derivative instruments, the fair value of these contracts would be accounted for consistent with Entergy’s other derivative instruments. Fair Values The estimated fair values of Entergy’s financial instruments and derivatives are determined using bid prices and market quotes. Considerable judgment is required in developing the estimates of fair value. Therefore, estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that Entergy could realize in a current market exchange. Gains or losses realized on financial instruments held by regulated businesses may be reflected in future rates and therefore do not accrue to the benefit or detriment of stockholders. Entergy considers the carrying amounts of most financial instruments classified as current assets and liabilities to be a reasonable estimate of their fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. See Note 16 to the financial statements for further discussion of fair value. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Entergy periodically reviews long-lived assets held in all of its business segments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of these assets is uncertain. Generally, the determination of recoverability is based on the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from such operations and assets. Projected net cash flows depend on the future operating costs associated with the assets, the efficiency and availability of the assets and generating units, and the future market and price for energy over the remaining life of the assets. Three nuclear power plants in the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business segment (Pilgrim, Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3) have applications pending for renewed NRC licenses. Various parties have expressed opposition to renewal of the licenses. Under federal law, nuclear power plants may continue to operate beyond their license expiration dates while their renewal applications are pending NRC approval. If the NRC does not renew the operating license for any of these plants, the plant’s operating life could be shortened, reducing its projected net cash flows and impairing its value as an asset. In March 2011 the NRC renewed Vermont Yankee’s operating license for an additional 20 years. The renewed operating license expires in March 2032. In May 2011, the Vermont Department of Public Service and the New England Coalition petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit seeking judicial review of the NRC’s issuance of the renewed operating license, alleging that the license had been issued without a valid and effective water quality certification under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee and Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. intervened in the proceeding. Motions by the parties for summary disposition were denied by the court, and oral argument is scheduled for May 2012. Vermont Yankee also is operating under a Certificate of Public Good from the State of Vermont that expires in March 2012, but has an application pending before the Vermont Public Service Board (VPSB) for a new Certificate of Public Good for operation until March 2032. As the United States district court noted in its decision discussed below (regarding Entergy’s challenge to certain conditions imposed by Vermont), title 3, section 814 of the Vermont Statutes provides that a license subject to an agency’s notice and hearing requirements does not expire until a final determination on an application for renewal has been made. In April 2011, Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee and Entergy Nuclear Operations, the owner and operator respectively of Vermont Yankee, filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Vermont. The suit challenged certain conditions imposed by Vermont upon Vermont Yankee’s continued operation and storage of spent nuclear fuel, including the requirement to obtain not only a new Certificate of Public Good, but also approval by Vermont’s General Assembly. In January 2012 the court entered judgment in Entergy’s favor and specifically: · Declared that Vermont’s laws requiring Vermont Yankee to cease operation in March 2012 and prohibiting the storage of spent nuclear fuel from operation after that date, absent approval by the General Assembly, were based on radiological safety concerns and are preempted by the Atomic Energy Act; · Permanently enjoined Vermont from enforcing these preempted requirements of the state’s laws; and 61 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements · Permanently enjoined Vermont under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution from conditioning the issuance of a new Certificate of Public Good upon the existence of a below wholesale market power sale agreement with Vermont utilities or Vermont Yankee’s selling power to Vermont utilities at rates below those available to wholesale customers in other states. In February 2012 the Vermont defendants filed a notice of appeal of the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In January 2012, Entergy filed a motion requesting that the VPSB grant, based on the existing record in its proceeding, Vermont Yankee’s pending application for a new Certificate of Public Good. The VPSB scheduled a status conference for March 9, 2012, and requested comments from the parties by March 2, 2012. In a February 23, 2012 memorandum to the parties, the VPSB asked that the parties’ comments respond to certain questions relating to, among other issues, the VPSB’s authority to issue the Certificate of Public Good and Vermont Yankee’s authority to operate beyond March 21, 2012 and store spent fuel from such operations, despite the decision and order of the United States district court. In light of these questions from the VPSB, Vermont Yankee filed a cross-appeal of the district court’s decision. Vermont Yankee also filed two motions with the district court asking it (1) to issue an injunction prohibiting Vermont from taking any action to force Vermont Yankee to shut down during the appeal of the district court’s decision or during the Certificate of Public Good proceeding before the VPSB and any judicial appeal from that proceeding, and (2) to amend the district court’s final judgment to include certain additional provisions of Vermont law relating to Vermont Yankee’s operation and storage of spent nuclear fuel from operation after March 21, 2012, that were part of the statutes the court found to be preempted in its decision, but which were not specifically included in the final judgment. Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ investments are subject to impairment if adverse market conditions arise, if a unit ceases operation, or for certain units if their authorizations to operate are not renewed. Specifically regarding Vermont Yankee, if Entergy concludes that Vermont Yankee is unlikely to operate significantly beyond its original license expiration date in March 2012, it could result in an impairment of part or all of the carrying value of the plant. In preparing its 2011 financial statements, Entergy evaluated whether the carrying value of Vermont Yankee was impaired as of December 31, 2011, before the outcome of the federal court lawsuit was known. For purposes of that evaluation, Entergy considered a number of factors associated with the plant’s continued operation, including the status of the federal lawsuit, the status of the state regulatory issues as described above, the potential sale of the plant, and the application of federal laws regarding the continued operation of nuclear facilities. Based on its evaluation of those factors, Entergy determined that the carrying value of Vermont Yankee was not impaired as of December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011 the net carrying value of the plant, including nuclear fuel, is $465 million. River Bend AFUDC The River Bend AFUDC gross-up is a regulatory asset that represents the incremental difference imputed by the LPSC between the AFUDC actually recorded by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana on a net-of-tax basis during the construction of River Bend and what the AFUDC would have been on a pre-tax basis. The imputed amount was only calculated on that portion of River Bend that the LPSC allowed in rate base and is being amortized through August 2025. Reacquired Debt The premiums and costs associated with reacquired debt of Entergy’s Utility operating companies and System Energy (except that portion allocable to the deregulated operations of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana) are included in regulatory assets and are being amortized over the life of the related new issuances, in accordance with ratemaking treatment. 62 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Taxes Imposed on Revenue-Producing Transactions Governmental authorities assess taxes that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer, including, but not limited to, sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes. Entergy presents these taxes on a net basis, excluding them from revenues, unless required to report them differently by a regulatory authority. Presentation of Preferred Stock without Sinking Fund Accounting standards regarding non-controlling interests and the classification and measurement of redeemable securities require the classification of preferred securities between liabilities and shareholders’ equity on the balance sheet if the holders of those securities have protective rights that allow them to gain control of the board of directors in certain circumstances. These rights would have the effect of giving the holders the ability to potentially redeem their securities, even if the likelihood of occurrence of these circumstances is considered remote. The Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans articles of incorporation provide, generally, that the holders of each company’s preferred securities may elect a majority of the respective company’s board of directors if dividends are not paid for a year, until such time as the dividends in arrears are paid. Therefore, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans present their preferred securities outstanding between liabilities and shareholders’ equity on the balance sheet. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, both organized as limited liability companies, have outstanding preferred securities with similar protective rights with respect to unpaid dividends, but provide for the election of board members that would not constitute a majority of the board; and their preferred securities are therefore classified for all periods presented as a component of members’ equity. The outstanding preferred securities of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Asset Management (whose preferred holders also had protective rights until the securities were repurchased in December 2011), are similarly presented between liabilities and equity on Entergy’s consolidated balance sheets and the outstanding preferred securities of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana are presented within total equity in Entergy’s consolidated balance sheets. The preferred dividends or distributions paid by all subsidiaries are reflected for all periods presented outside of consolidated net income. New Accounting Pronouncements The accounting standard-setting process, including projects between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to converge U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards, is ongoing and the FASB and the IASB are each currently working on several projects that have not yet resulted in final pronouncements. Final pronouncements that result from these projects could have a material effect on Entergy’s future net income, financial position, or cash flows. In May 2011 the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-4, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs,” which states that the ASU explains how to measure fair value. The ASU states that: 1) the amendments in the ASU result in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards; 2) consequently, the amendments change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements; 3) for many of the requirements, the FASB does not intend for the ASU to result in a change in the application of the requirements of current U.S. GAAP; 4) some of the amendments clarify the FASB’s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements; and 5) other amendments change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements. ASU No. 2011-4 is effective for Entergy for the first quarter 2012. Entergy does not expect ASU No. 2011-4 to affect materially its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In September 2011 the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-8, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment.” The amendments permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment. ASU No. 2011-8 is effective for Entergy for the first quarter 2012. The adoption of ASU No. 2011-8 will have no effect on Entergy’s results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 63 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements NOTE 2.

The regulatory asset, however, is being recovered and amortized at Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. As a result, a billing occurs monthly over the same term as the recovery and receipts will be submitted to Entergy Texas. Entergy Texas has recorded a receivable from Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has recorded a corresponding payable. (b) Does not earn a return on investment, but is offset by related liabilities. Fuel and purchased power cost recovery Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas are allowed to recover fuel and purchased power costs through fuel mechanisms included in electric and gas rates that are recorded as fuel cost recovery revenues. The difference between revenues collected and the current fuel and purchased power costs is generally recorded as “Deferred fuel costs” on the Utility operating companies’ financial statements. The table below shows the amount of deferred fuel costs as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, that Entergy expects to recover (or return to customers) through fuel mechanisms, subject to subsequent regulatory review. 2011 2010 (In Millions) Entergy Arkansas $209.8 $61.5 Entergy Gulf States Louisiana (a) $2.9 $77.8 Entergy Louisiana (a) $1.5 $8.8 Entergy Mississippi ($15.8) $3.2 Entergy New Orleans (a) ($7.5) ($2.8) Entergy Texas ($64.7) ($77.4) (a) 2011 and 2010 include $100.1 million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, $68 million for Entergy Louisiana, and $4.1 million for Entergy New Orleans of fuel, purchased power, and capacity costs, which do not currently earn a return on investment and whose recovery periods are indeterminate but are expected to be over a period greater than twelve months. Entergy Arkansas Production Cost Allocation Rider The APSC approved a production cost allocation rider for recovery from customers of the retail portion of the costs allocated to Entergy Arkansas as a result of the System Agreement proceedings, which are discussed in the “System Agreement Cost Equalization Proceedings” section below. These costs cause an increase in Entergy Arkansas’s deferred fuel cost balance because Entergy Arkansas pays the costs over seven months but collects them from customers over twelve months. 67 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Energy Cost Recovery Rider Entergy Arkansas’s retail rates include an energy cost recovery rider to recover fuel and purchased energy costs in monthly bills. The rider utilizes prior calendar year energy costs and projected energy sales for the twelve-month period commencing on April 1 of each year to develop an energy cost rate, which is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over-recovery or under-recovery, including carrying charges, of the energy cost for the prior calendar year. The energy cost recovery rider tariff also allows an interim rate request depending upon the level of over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs. In early October 2005, the APSC initiated an investigation into Entergy Arkansas's interim energy cost recovery rate. The investigation focused on Entergy Arkansas's 1) gas contracting, portfolio, and hedging practices; 2) wholesale purchases during the period; 3) management of the coal inventory at its coal generation plants; and 4) response to the contractual failure of the railroads to provide coal deliveries. In March 2006, the APSC extended its investigation to cover the costs included in Entergy Arkansas's March 2006 annual energy cost rate filing, and a hearing was held in the APSC energy cost recovery investigation in October 2006. In January 2007 the APSC issued an order in its review of the energy cost rate. The APSC found that Entergy Arkansas failed to maintain an adequate coal inventory level going into the summer of 2005 and that Entergy Arkansas should be responsible for any incremental energy costs resulting from two outages caused by employee and contractor error. The coal plant generation curtailments were caused by railroad delivery problems and Entergy Arkansas has since resolved litigation with the railroad regarding the delivery problems. The APSC staff was directed to perform an analysis with Entergy Arkansas’s assistance to determine the additional fuel and purchased energy costs associated with these findings and file the analysis within 60 days of the order. After a final determination of the costs is made by the APSC, Entergy Arkansas would be directed to refund that amount with interest to its customers as a credit on the energy cost recovery rider. Entergy Arkansas requested rehearing of the order. In March 2007, in order to allow further consideration by the APSC, the APSC granted Entergy Arkansas’s petition for rehearing and for stay of the APSC order. In October 2008 Entergy Arkansas filed a motion to lift the stay and to rescind the APSC's January 2007 order in light of the arguments advanced in Entergy Arkansas’s rehearing petition and because the value for Entergy Arkansas’s customers obtained through the resolved railroad litigation is significantly greater than the incremental cost of actions identified by the APSC as imprudent. In December 2008, the APSC denied the motion to lift the stay pending resolution of Entergy Arkansas’s rehearing request and the unresolved issues in the proceeding. The APSC ordered the parties to submit their unresolved issues list in the pending proceeding, which the parties did. In February 2010 the APSC denied Entergy Arkansas’s request for rehearing, and held a hearing in September 2010 to determine the amount of damages, if any, that should be assessed against Entergy Arkansas. A decision is pending. Entergy Arkansas expects the amount of damages, if any, to have an immaterial effect on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. The APSC also established a separate docket to consider the resolved railroad litigation, and in February 2010 it established a procedural schedule that concluded with testimony through September 2010. Testimony has been filed and the APSC will decide the case based on the record in the proceeding, including the prefiled testimony. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana recover electric fuel and purchased power costs for the billing month based upon the level of such costs incurred two months prior to the billing month. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s purchased gas adjustments include estimates for the billing month adjusted by a surcharge or credit that arises from an annual reconciliation of fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges. 68 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements In January 2003 the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate a proceeding to audit the fuel adjustment clause filings of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and its affiliates. The audit included a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana through its fuel adjustment clause for the period 1995 through 2004. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC Staff reached a settlement to resolve the audit that requires Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to refund $18 million to customers, including the realignment to base rates of $2 million of SO2 costs. The ALJ held a stipulation hearing and in November 2011 the LPSC issued an order approving the settlement. The refund was made in the November 2011 billing cycle. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana had previously recorded provisions for the estimated outcome of this proceeding. In December 2011 the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate another proceeding to audit the fuel adjustment clause filings of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and its affiliates. The audit includes a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana through its fuel adjustment clause for the period 2005 through 2009. In April 2010 the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate an audit of Entergy Louisiana's fuel adjustment clause filings. The audit includes a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed through the fuel adjustment clause by Entergy Louisiana for the period from 2005 through 2009. Discovery is in progress, but a procedural schedule has not been established. Entergy Mississippi Entergy Mississippi’s rate schedules include an energy cost recovery rider that is adjusted quarterly to reflect accumulated over- or under-recoveries from the second prior quarter. Entergy Mississippi’s fuel cost recoveries are subject to annual audits conducted pursuant to the authority of the MPSC. In July 2008 the MPSC began a proceeding to investigate the fuel procurement practices and fuel adjustment schedules of the Mississippi utility companies, including Entergy Mississippi. The MPSC stated that the goal of the proceeding is fact-finding so that the MPSC may decide whether to amend the current fuel cost recovery process. Hearings were held in July and August 2008. Further proceedings have not been scheduled. Mississippi Attorney General Complaint The Mississippi attorney general filed a complaint in state court in December 2008 against Entergy Corporation, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Services, Inc., and Entergy Power, Inc. alleging, among other things, violations of Mississippi statutes, fraud, and breach of good faith and fair dealing, and requesting an accounting and restitution. The litigation is wide ranging and relates to tariffs and procedures under which Entergy Mississippi purchases power not generated in Mississippi to meet electricity demand. Entergy believes the complaint is unfounded. On December 29, 2008, the defendant Entergy companies filed to remove the attorney general’s suit to U.S. District Court (the forum that Entergy believes is appropriate to resolve the types of federal issues raised in the suit), where it is currently pending, and additionally answered the complaint and filed a counter-claim for relief based upon the Mississippi Public Utilities Act and the Federal Power Act. The Mississippi attorney general has filed a pleading seeking to remand the matter to state court. In May 2009, the defendant Entergy companies filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings asserting grounds of federal preemption, the exclusive jurisdiction of the MPSC, and factual errors in the attorney general’s complaint. In July 2011, the attorney general requested a status conference regarding its motion to remand. The court granted the attorney general’s request for a status conference, which was held in September 2011. Consistent with the court’s instructions, both parties submitted letters to the court in September 2011 providing updates on the facts of the case and the law, and the court has now taken the parties’ arguments under advisement. 69 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Entergy New Orleans Entergy New Orleans’s electric rate schedules include a fuel adjustment tariff designed to reflect no more than targeted fuel and purchased power costs, adjusted by a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel and purchased power costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges. Entergy New Orleans’s gas rate schedules include a purchased gas adjustment to reflect estimated gas costs for the billing month, adjusted by a surcharge or credit similar to that included in the electric fuel adjustment clause, including carrying charges. Entergy Texas Entergy Texas’s rate schedules include a fixed fuel factor to recover fuel and purchased power costs, including carrying charges, not recovered in base rates. Semi-annual revisions of the fixed fuel factor are made in March and September based on the market price of natural gas and changes in fuel mix. The amounts collected under Entergy Texas’s fixed fuel factor and any interim surcharge or refund are subject to fuel reconciliation proceedings before the PUCT. In January 2008, Entergy Texas made a compliance filing with the PUCT describing how its 2007 rough production cost equalization receipts under the System Agreement were allocated between Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s Texas and Louisiana jurisdictions. In December 2008 the PUCT adopted an ALJ proposal for decision recommending an additional $18.6 million allocation to Texas retail customers. Because the PUCT allocation to Texas retail customers is inconsistent with the LPSC allocation to Louisiana retail customers, the PUCT's decision resulted in trapped costs between the Texas and Louisiana jurisdictions with no mechanism for recovery. Entergy Texas filed with the FERC a proposed amendment to the System Agreement bandwidth formula to specifically calculate the payments to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas of Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s rough production cost equalization receipts for 2007. In May 2009 the FERC issued an order rejecting the proposed amendment. Because of the FERC's order, Entergy Texas recorded the effects of the PUCT's allocation of the additional $18.6 million to Texas retail customers in the second quarter 2009. On an after-tax basis, the charge to earnings was approximately $13.0 million (including interest). The PUCT and FERC decisions are now final. In May 2009, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund $46.1 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through February 2009. Pursuant to a stipulation among the various parties, in June 2009 the PUCT issued an order approving a refund of $59.2 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery overcollections through March 2009. The refund was made for most customers over a three-month period beginning July 2009. In October 2009, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund approximately $71 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through September 2009. Pursuant to a stipulation among the various parties, the PUCT issued an order approving a refund of $87.8 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery overcollections through October 2009. The refund was made for most customers over a three-month period beginning January 2010. In June 2010, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund approximately $66 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through May 2010. In September 2010 the PUCT issued an order providing for a $77 million refund, including interest, for fuel cost recovery over-collections through June 2010. The refund was made for most customers over a three-month period beginning with the September 2010 billing cycle. In December 2010, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund fuel cost recovery over-collections through October 2010. Pursuant to a stipulation among the parties that was approved by the PUCT in March 2011, Entergy Texas refunded over-collections through November 2010 of approximately $73 million, including interest through the refund period. The refund was made for most customers over a three-month period that began with the February 2011 billing cycle. 70 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements In December 2011, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund approximately $43 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through October 2011. Entergy Texas and the parties to the proceeding reached an agreement that Entergy Texas will refund $67 million, including interest, over a three-month period, which refund includes additional over-recoveries through December 2011. Entergy Texas and the parties requested that interim rates consistent with the settlement be approved effective with the March 2012 billing month, and this request was granted by the presiding ALJ on February 16, 2012. Entergy Texas’s December 2009 rate case filing, which is discussed below, also included a request to reconcile $1.8 billion of fuel and purchased power costs covering the period April 2007 through June 2009. Entergy Texas’s November 2011 rate case filing, which is discussed below, also includes a request to reconcile $1.3 billion of fuel and purchased power costs covering the period July 2009 through June 2011. Retail Rate Proceedings The following chart summarizes the Utility operating companies' current retail base rates: Company Authorized Return on Common Equity Entergy Arkansas 10.2% - Current retail base rates implemented in the July 2010 billing cycle pursuant to a settlement approved by the APSC. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana 9.9%-11.4% Electric; 10.0%-11.0% Gas - Current retail electric base rates implemented based on Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's 2010 test year formula rate plan filing approved by the LPSC. - Current retail gas base rates reflect the rate stabilization plan filing for the 2010 test year ended September 2010. Entergy Louisiana 9.45%- 11.05% - Current retail base rates based on Entergy Louisiana's 2010 test year formula rate plan filing approved by the LPSC. Entergy Mississippi 10.54%- 12.72% - Current retail base rates reflect Entergy Mississippi's latest formula rate plan filing, based on the 2010 test year, and a stipulation approved by the MPSC. Entergy New Orleans 10.7% - 11.5% Electric; 10.25% - 11.25% Gas - Current retail base rates reflect Entergy New Orleans's 2010 test year formula rate plan filing and a settlement approved by the City Council. Entergy Texas 10.125% - Current retail base rates reflect Entergy Texas's 2009 base rate case filing and a settlement approved by the PUCT. 71 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Filings with the APSC (Entergy Arkansas) Retail Rates 2009 Base Rate Filing In September 2009, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC for a general change in rates, charges, and tariffs. In June 2010 the APSC approved a settlement and subsequent compliance tariffs that provide for a $63.7 million rate increase, effective for bills rendered for the first billing cycle of July 2010. The settlement provides for a 10.2% return on common equity. Filings with the LPSC Formula Rate Plans (Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana) In March 2005 the LPSC approved a settlement proposal to resolve various dockets covering a range of issues for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana. The settlement included the establishment of a three-year formula rate plan for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana that, among other provisions, established a return on common equity mid-point of 10.65% for the initial three-year term of the plan and permits Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to recover incremental capacity costs outside of a traditional base rate proceeding. Under the formula rate plan, over- and under-earnings outside an allowed range of 9.9% to 11.4% are allocated 60% to customers and 40% to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made its initial formula rate plan filing in June 2005. The formula rate plan was subsequently extended one year. Entergy Louisiana made a rate filing with the LPSC requesting a base rate increase in January 2004. In May 2005 the LPSC approved a settlement that included the adoption of a three-year formula rate plan, the terms of which included an ROE mid-point of 10.25% for the initial three-year term of the plan and permit Entergy Louisiana to recover incremental capacity costs outside of a traditional base rate proceeding. Under the formula rate plan, over- and under-earnings outside an allowed regulatory range of 9.45% to 11.05% will be allocated 60% to customers and 40% to Entergy Louisiana. The initial formula rate plan filing was made in May 2006. The formula rate plans for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana have subsequently been extended, with return on common equity provisions consistent with the previously approved provisions, to cover the 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 test years. Retail Rates - Electric (Entergy Gulf States Louisiana) In October 2009 the LPSC approved a settlement that resolved Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s 2007 test year filing and provided for a formula rate plan for the 2008, 2009, and 2010 test years. 10.65% is the target midpoint return on equity for the formula rate plan, with an earnings bandwidth of +/- 75 basis points (9.90% - 11.40%). Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, effective with the November 2009 billing cycle, reset its rates to achieve a 10.65% return on equity for the 2008 test year. The rate reset, a $44.3 million increase that includes a $36.9 million cost of service adjustment, plus $7.4 million net for increased capacity costs and a base rate reclassification, was implemented for the November 2009 billing cycle, and the rate reset was subject to refund pending review of the 2008 test year filing that was made in October 2009. In January 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana implemented an additional $23.9 million rate increase pursuant to a special rate implementation filing made in December 2009, primarily for incremental capacity costs approved by the LPSC. In May 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC staff submitted a joint report on the 2008 test year filing and requested that the LPSC accept the report, which resulted in a $0.8 million reduction in rates effective in the June 2010 billing cycle and a $0.5 million refund. At its May 19, 2010 meeting, the LPSC accepted the joint report. 72 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements In May 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2009 test year. The filing reflected a 10.25% return on common equity, which is within the allowed earnings bandwidth, indicating no cost of service rate change is necessary under the formula rate plan. The filing does reflect, however, a revenue requirement increase to provide supplemental funding for the decommissioning trust maintained for the LPSC-regulated 70% share of River Bend, in response to a NRC notification of a projected shortfall of decommissioning funding assurance. The filing also reflected a rate increase for incremental capacity costs. In July 2010 the LPSC approved a $7.8 million increase in the revenue requirement for decommissioning, effective September 2010. In August 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made a revised 2009 test year filing. The revised filing reflected a 10.12% earned return on common equity, which is within the allowed earnings bandwidth resulting in no cost of service adjustment. The revised filing also reflected two increases outside of the formula rate plan sharing mechanism: (1) the previously approved decommissioning revenue requirement, and (2) $25.2 million for capacity costs. The rates reflected in the revised filing became effective, beginning with the first billing cycle of September 2010. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC staff subsequently submitted a joint report on the 2009 test year filing consistent with these terms and the LPSC approved the joint report in January 2011. In May 2011, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made a special formula rate plan rate implementation filing with the LPSC that implements effective with the May 2011 billing cycle a $5.1 million rate decrease to reflect adjustments in accordance with a previous LPSC order relating to the acquisition of Unit 2 of the Acadia Energy Center by Entergy Louisiana. As a result of the closing of the acquisition and termination of the pre-acquisition power purchase agreement with Acadia, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s allocation of capacity related to this unit ended, resulting in a reduction in the additional capacity revenue requirement. In May 2011, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2010 test year. The filing reflects an 11.11% earned return on common equity, which is within the allowed earnings bandwidth, indicating no cost of service rate change is necessary under the formula rate plan. The filing also reflects a $22.8 million rate decrease for incremental capacity costs. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC Staff subsequently filed a joint report that also stated that no cost of service rate change is necessary under the formula rate plan, and the LPSC approved it in October 2011. In November 2011 the LPSC approved a one-year extension of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s formula rate plan. In addition, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is required to file a full rate case by January 2013, if the LPSC has not acted to deny the requested transmission change-of-control to the MISO RTO. If the LPSC has denied this request, then the rate case must be filed by September 30, 2012. (Entergy Louisiana) In October 2009 the LPSC approved a settlement that resolved Entergy Louisiana’s 2006 and 2007 test year filings and provided for a new formula rate plan for the 2008, 2009, and 2010 test years. 10.25% is the target midpoint return on equity for the formula rate plan, with an earnings bandwidth of +/- 80 basis points (9.45% - 11.05%). Entergy Louisiana was permitted, effective with the November 2009 billing cycle, to reset its rates to achieve a 10.25% return on equity for the 2008 test year. The rate reset, a $2.5 million increase that included a $16.3 million cost of service adjustment less a $13.8 million net reduction for decreased capacity costs and a base rate reclassification, was implemented for the November 2009 billing cycle, and the rate reset was subject to refund pending review of the 2008 test year filing that was made in October 2009. In April 2010, Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff submitted a joint report on the 2008 test year filing and requested that the LPSC accept the report, which resulted in a $0.1 million reduction in rates effective in the May 2010 billing cycle and a $0.1 million refund. In addition, Entergy Louisiana moved the recovery of approximately $12.5 million of capacity costs from fuel adjustment clause recovery to base rate recovery. At its April 21, 2010 meeting, the LPSC accepted the joint report. 73 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements In May 2010, Entergy Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2009 test year. The filing reflected a 10.82% return on common equity, which is within the allowed earnings bandwidth, indicating no cost of service rate change is necessary under the formula rate plan. The filing does reflect, however, a revenue requirement increase to provide supplemental funding for the decommissioning trust maintained for Waterford 3, in response to a NRC notification of a projected shortfall of decommissioning funding assurance. The filing also reflected a rate change for incremental capacity costs. In July 2010 the LPSC approved a $3.5 million increase in the retail revenue requirement for decommissioning, effective September 2010. In August 2010, Entergy Louisiana made a revised 2009 test year formula rate plan filing. The revised filing reflected a 10.82% earned return on common equity, which is within the allowed earnings bandwidth resulting in no cost of service adjustment. The filing also reflected two increases outside of the formula rate plan sharing mechanism: (1) the previously approved decommissioning revenue requirement, and (2) $2.2 million for capacity costs. The rates reflected in the revised filing became effective beginning with the first billing cycle of September 2010. Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff subsequently submitted a joint report on the 2009 test year filing consistent with these terms and the LPSC approved the joint report in December 2010. In May 2011, Entergy Louisiana made a special formula rate plan rate implementation filing with the LPSC that implements effective with the May 2011 billing cycle a $43.1 million net rate increase to reflect adjustments in accordance with a previous LPSC order relating to the acquisition of Unit 2 of the Acadia Energy Center. The net rate increase represents the decrease in the additional capacity revenue requirement resulting from the termination of the power purchase agreement with Acadia and the increase in the revenue requirement resulting from the ownership of the Acadia facility. In August 2011, Entergy Louisiana made a filing to correct the May 2011 filing and decrease the rate by $1.1 million. In May 2011, Entergy Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2010 test year. The filing reflects an 11.07% earned return on common equity, which is just outside of the allowed earnings bandwidth and results in no cost of service rate change under the formula rate plan. The filing also reflects a very slight ($9 thousand) rate increase for incremental capacity costs. Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC Staff subsequently filed a joint report that reflects an 11.07% earned return and results in no cost of service rate change under the formula rate plan, and the LPSC approved the joint report in October 2011. In November 2011 the LPSC approved a one-year extension of Entergy Louisiana’s current formula rate plan. The next formula rate plan filing, for the 2011 test year, will be made in May 2012 and will include a separate identification of any operating and maintenance expense savings that are expected to occur once the Waterford 3 steam generator replacement project is complete. Pursuant to the LPSC decision, from September 2012 through December 2012 earnings above an 11.05% return on common equity (based on the 2011 test year) would be accrued and used to offset the Waterford 3 replacement steam generator revenue requirement for the first twelve months that the unit is in rates. If the project is not in service by January 1, 2013, earnings above a 10.25% return on common equity (based on the 2011 test year) for the period January 1, 2013 through the date that the project is placed in service will be accrued and used to offset the incremental revenue requirement for the first twelve months that the unit is in rates. Upon the in-service date of the replacement steam generators, rates will increase, subject to refund following any prudence review, by the full revenue requirement associated with the replacement steam generators, less (i) the previously accrued excess earnings from September 2012 until the in-service date and (ii) any earnings above a 10.25% return on common equity (based on the 2011 test year) for the period following the in-service date, provided that the excess earnings accrued prior to the in-service date shall only offset the revenue requirement for the first year of operation of the replacement steam generators. These rates are anticipated to remain in effect until Entergy Louisiana’s next full rate case is resolved. Entergy Louisiana is required to file a full rate case by January 2013, if the LPSC has not acted to deny the requested transmission change-of-control to the MISO RTO. If the LPSC has denied this request, then the rate case must be filed by September 30, 2012. 74 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Retail Rates - Gas (Entergy Gulf States Louisiana) In January 2012, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2011. The filing showed an earned return on common equity of 10.48%, which is within the earnings bandwidth of 10.5%, plus or minus fifty basis points. The sixty-day review and comment period for this filing remains open. In January 2011, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2010. The filing showed an earned return on common equity of 8.84% and a revenue deficiency of $0.3 million. In March 2011 the LPSC Staff filed its findings, suggesting an adjustment that produced an 11.76% earned return on common equity for the test year and a $0.2 million rate reduction. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana implemented the $0.2 million rate reduction effective with the May 2011 billing cycle. The LPSC docket is now closed. In January 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2009. The filing showed an earned return on common equity of 10.87%, which is within the earnings bandwidth of 10.5% plus or minus fifty basis points, resulting in no rate change. In April 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed a revised evaluation report reflecting changes agreed upon with the LPSC Staff. The revised evaluation report also resulted in no rate change. Filings with the MPSC (Entergy Mississippi) Formula Rate Plan Filings In September 2009, Entergy Mississippi filed with the MPSC proposed modifications to its formula rate plan rider. In March 2010 the MPSC issued an order: (1) providing the opportunity for a reset of Entergy Mississippi's return on common equity to a point within the formula rate plan bandwidth and eliminating the 50/50 sharing that had been in the plan, (2) modifying the performance measurement process, and (3) replacing the revenue change limit of two percent of revenues, which was subject to a $14.5 million revenue adjustment cap, with a limit of four percent of revenues, although any adjustment above two percent requires a hearing before the MPSC. The MPSC did not approve Entergy Mississippi's request to use a projected test year for its annual scheduled formula rate plan filing and, therefore, Entergy Mississippi will continue to use a historical test year for its annual evaluation reports under the plan. In March 2010, Entergy Mississippi submitted its 2009 test year filing, its first annual filing under the new formula rate plan rider. In June 2010 the MPSC approved a joint stipulation between Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff that provides for no change in rates, but does provide for the deferral as a regulatory asset of $3.9 million of legal expenses associated with certain litigation involving the Mississippi Attorney General, as well as ongoing legal expenses in that litigation until the litigation is resolved. In March 2011, Entergy Mississippi submitted its formula rate plan 2010 test year filing. The filing shows an earned return on common equity of 10.65% for the test year, which is within the earnings bandwidth and results in no change in rates. In November 2011 the MPSC approved a joint stipulation between Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff that provides for no change in rates. Filings with the City Council (Entergy New Orleans) Formula Rate Plan On July 31, 2008, Entergy New Orleans filed an electric and gas base rate case with the City Council. On April 2, 2009, the City Council approved a comprehensive settlement. The settlement provided for a net $35.3 million reduction in combined fuel and non-fuel electric revenue requirement, including conversion of a $10.6 million voluntary recovery credit, implemented in January 2008, to a permanent reduction and substantial realignment of Grand Gulf 75 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements cost recovery from fuel to electric base rates, and a $4.95 million gas base rate increase, both effective June 1, 2009, with adjustment of the customer charges for all rate classes. A new three-year formula rate plan was also adopted, with terms including an 11.1% benchmark electric return on common equity (ROE) with a +/- 40 basis point bandwidth and a 10.75% benchmark gas ROE with a +/- 50 basis point bandwidth. Earnings outside the bandwidth reset to the midpoint benchmark ROE, with rates changing on a prospective basis depending on whether Entergy New Orleans is over- or under-earning. The formula rate plan also includes a recovery mechanism for City Council-approved capacity additions, plus provisions for extraordinary cost changes and force majeure events. In May 2010, Entergy New Orleans filed its electric and gas formula rate plan evaluation reports. The filings requested a $12.8 million electric base revenue decrease and a $2.4 million gas base revenue increase. Entergy New Orleans and the City Council's Advisors reached a settlement that resulted in an $18.0 million electric base revenue decrease and zero gas base revenue change effective with the October 2010 billing cycle. The City Council approved the settlement in November 2010. In May 2011, Entergy New Orleans filed its electric and gas formula rate plan evaluation reports for the 2010 test year. The filings requested a $6.5 million electric rate decrease and a $1.1 million gas rate decrease. Entergy New Orleans and the City Council’s Advisors reached a settlement that results in an $8.5 million incremental electric rate decrease and a $1.6 million gas rate decrease. The settlement also provides for the deferral of $13.4 million of Michoud plant maintenance expenses incurred in 2010 and the establishment of a regulatory asset that will be amortized over the period October 2011 through September 2018. The City Council approved the settlement in September 2011. The new rates were effective with the first billing cycle of October 2011. The 2008 rate case settlement also included $3.1 million per year in electric rates to fund the Energy Smart energy efficiency programs. In September 2009 the City Council approved the energy efficiency programs filed by Entergy New Orleans. The rate settlement provides an incentive for Entergy New Orleans to meet or exceed energy savings targets set by the City Council and provides a mechanism for Entergy New Orleans to recover lost contribution to fixed costs associated with the energy savings generated from the energy efficiency programs. Filings with the PUCT and Texas Cities (Entergy Texas) Retail Rates 2009 Rate Case In December 2009, Entergy Texas filed a rate case requesting a $198.7 million increase reflecting an 11.5% return on common equity based on an adjusted June 2009 test year. The rate case also includes a $2.8 million revenue requirement to provide supplemental funding for the decommissioning trust maintained for the 70% share of River Bend for which Entergy Texas retail customers are partially responsible, in response to an NRC notification of a projected shortfall of decommissioning funding assurance. Beginning in May 2010, Entergy Texas implemented a $17.5 million interim rate increase, subject to refund. Intervenors and PUCT Staff filed testimony recommending adjustments that would result in a maximum rate increase, based on the PUCT Staff’s testimony, of $58 million. The parties filed a settlement in August 2010 intended to resolve the rate case proceeding. The settlement provides for a $59 million base rate increase for electricity usage beginning August 15, 2010, with an additional increase of $9 million for bills rendered beginning May 2, 2011. The settlement stipulates an authorized return on equity of 10.125%. The settlement states that Entergy Texas's fuel costs for the period April 2007 through June 2009 are reconciled, with $3.25 million of disallowed costs, which were included in an interim fuel refund. The settlement also sets River Bend decommissioning costs at $2.0 million annually. Consistent with the settlement, in the third quarter 2010, Entergy Texas amortized $11 million of rate case costs. The PUCT approved the settlement in December 2010. 76 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements 2011 Rate Case In November 2011, Entergy Texas filed a rate case requesting a $112 million base rate increase reflecting a 10.6% return on common equity based on an adjusted June 2011 test year. The rate case also proposed a purchased power recovery rider. The parties have agreed to a procedural schedule that contemplates a final decision by July 30, 2012, with rates relating back to June 30, 2012. On January 12, 2012, the PUCT voted not to address the purchased power recovery rider in the current rate case, but the PUCT voted to set a baseline in the rate case proceeding that would be applicable if a purchased power capacity rider is approved in a separate proceeding. System Agreement Cost Equalization Proceedings The Utility operating companies historically have engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which is a rate schedule that has been approved by the FERC. Certain of the Utility operating companies’ retail regulators and other parties are pursuing litigation involving the System Agreement at the FERC. The proceedings include challenges to the allocation of costs as defined by the System Agreement and allegations of imprudence by the Utility operating companies in their execution of their obligations under the System Agreement. In June 2005, the FERC issued a decision in System Agreement litigation that had been commenced by the LPSC, and essentially affirmed its decision in a December 2005 order on rehearing. The FERC decision concluded, among other things, that: · The System Agreement no longer roughly equalizes total production costs among the Utility operating companies. · In order to reach rough production cost equalization, the FERC imposed a bandwidth remedy by which each company’s total annual production costs will have to be within +/- 11% of Entergy System average total annual production costs. · In calculating the production costs for this purpose under the FERC’s order, output from the Vidalia hydroelectric power plant will not reflect the actual Vidalia price for the year but is priced at that year’s average price paid by Entergy Louisiana for the exchange of electric energy under Service Schedule MSS-3 of the System Agreement, thereby reducing the amount of Vidalia costs reflected in the comparison of the Utility operating companies’ total production costs. · The remedy ordered by FERC in 2005 required no refunds and became effective based on calendar year 2006 production costs and the first reallocation payments were made in 2007. The FERC’s decision reallocates total production costs of the Utility operating companies whose relative total production costs expressed as a percentage of Entergy System average production costs are outside an upper or lower bandwidth. Under the current circumstances, this will be accomplished by payments from Utility operating companies whose production costs are more than 11% below Entergy System average production costs to Utility operating companies whose production costs are more than the Entergy System average production cost, with payments going first to those Utility operating companies whose total production costs are farthest above the Entergy System average. Assessing the potential effects of the FERC’s decision requires assumptions regarding the future total production cost of each Utility operating company, which assumptions include the mix of solid fuel and gas-fired generation available to each company and the costs of natural gas and purchased power. Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Texas, and Entergy Mississippi are more dependent upon gas-fired generation sources than Entergy Arkansas or Entergy New Orleans. Of these, Entergy Arkansas is the least dependent upon gas-fired generation sources. Therefore, increases in natural gas prices likely will increase the amount by which Entergy Arkansas’s total production costs are below the Entergy System average production costs. 77 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements The LPSC, APSC, MPSC, and the Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers appealed the FERC’s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Entergy and the City of New Orleans intervened in the various appeals. The D.C. Circuit issued its decision in April 2008. The D.C. Circuit concluded that the FERC’s orders had failed to adequately explain both its conclusion that it was prohibited from ordering refunds for the 20-month period from September 13, 2001 - May 2, 2003 and its determination to implement the bandwidth remedy commencing on January 1, 2006, rather than June 1, 2005. The D.C. Circuit remanded the case to FERC for further proceedings on these issues. On October 20, 2011, the FERC issued an order addressing the D.C. Circuit remand on these two issues. On the first issue, the FERC concluded that it did have the authority to order refunds, but decided that it would exercise its equitable discretion and not require refunds for the 20-month period from September 13, 2001 - May 2, 2003. Because the ruling on refunds relied on findings in the interruptible load proceeding that is discussed below, the FERC concluded that the refund ruling will be held in abeyance pending the outcome of the rehearing requests in that proceeding. On the second issue, the FERC reversed its prior decision and ordered that the prospective bandwidth remedy begin on June 1, 2005 (the date of its initial order in the proceeding) rather than January 1, 2006, as it had previously ordered. Pursuant to the October 20, 2011 order, Entergy was required to calculate the additional bandwidth payments for the period June - December 2005 utilizing the bandwidth formula tariff prescribed by the FERC that was filed in a December 2006 compliance filing and accepted by the FERC in an April 2007 order. As is the case with bandwidth remedy payments, these payments and receipts will ultimately be paid by Utility operating company customers to other Utility operating company customers. In December 2011, Entergy filed with the FERC its compliance filing that provides the payments and receipts among the Utility operating companies pursuant to the FERC’s October 2011 order. The filing shows the following payments/receipts among the Utility operating companies: Payments or (Receipts) (In Millions) Entergy Arkansas $156 Entergy Gulf States Louisiana ($75) Entergy Louisiana $- Entergy Mississippi ($33) Entergy New Orleans ($5) Entergy Texas ($43) Entergy Arkansas made its payment in January 2012. In February 2012, Entergy Arkansas filed for an interim adjustment to its production cost allocation rider requesting that the $156 million payment be collected from customers over the 22-month period from March 2012 through December 2013. On February 27, 2012, the APSC staff responded to Entergy Arkansas’s filing and requested that the APSC: 1) determine whether Entergy Arkansas must make a request separate from the production cost allocation rider to ask for recovery of the payment and 2) find that Arkansas law does not allow retroactive ratemaking and not permit recovery of the payment from customers through the production cost allocation rider. In the alternative the APSC staff requested that the APSC determine that an interim production cost allocation rider rate does not become effective without an APSC order. The LPSC and the APSC have requested rehearing of the FERC’s October 2011 order. The APSC, LPSC, the PUCT, and other parties intervened in the December 2011 compliance filing proceeding, and the APSC and the LPSC also filed protests. Calendar Year 2011 Production Costs The liabilities and assets for the preliminary estimate of the payments and receipts required to implement the FERC’s remedy based on calendar year 2011 production costs were recorded in December 2011, based on certain year-to-date information. The preliminary estimate was recorded based on the following estimate of the payments/receipts among the Utility operating companies for 2012. 78 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Payments or (Receipts) (In Millions) Entergy Arkansas $37 Entergy Gulf States Louisiana $- Entergy Louisiana ($37) Entergy Mississippi $- Entergy New Orleans $- Entergy Texas $- The actual payments/receipts for 2012, based on calendar year 2011 production costs, will not be calculated until the Utility operating companies’ FERC Form 1s have been filed. Once the calculation is completed, it will be filed at the FERC. The level of any payments and receipts is significantly affected by a number of factors, including, among others, weather, the price of alternative fuels, the operating characteristics of the Entergy System generating fleet, and multiple factors affecting the calculation of the non-fuel related revenue requirement components of the total production costs, such as plant investment. 2011 Rate Filing Based on Calendar Year 2010 Production Costs In May 2011, Entergy filed with the FERC the 2011 rates in accordance with the FERC’s orders in the System Agreement proceeding. The filing shows the following payments/receipts among the Utility operating companies for 2011, based on calendar year 2010 production costs, commencing for service in June 2011, are necessary to achieve rough production cost equalization under the FERC’s orders: Payments or (Receipts) (In Millions) Entergy Arkansas $77 Entergy Gulf States Louisiana ($12) Entergy Louisiana $- Entergy Mississippi ($40) Entergy New Orleans ($25) Entergy Texas $- Several parties intervened in the proceeding at the FERC, including the LPSC, which filed a protest as well. In July 2011, the FERC accepted Entergy's proposed rates for filing, effective June 1, 2011, subject to refund, set the proceeding for hearing procedures, and then held those procedures in abeyance pending FERC decisions in the prior production cost proceedings currently before the FERC on review. Prior Years’ Rough Production Cost Equalization Rates Each May since 2007 Entergy has filed with the FERC the rates to implement the FERC’s orders in the System Agreement proceeding. These filings show the following payments/receipts among the Utility operating companies are necessary to achieve rough production cost equalization as defined by the FERC’s orders: 79 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements 2007 Payments or (Receipts) Based on 2006 Costs 2008 Payments or (Receipts) Based on 2007 Costs 2009 Payments or (Receipts) Based on 2008 Costs 2010 Payments or (Receipts) Based on 2009 Costs (In Millions) Entergy Arkansas $252 $252 $390 $41 Entergy Gulf States Louisiana ($120) ($124) ($107) $- Entergy Louisiana ($91) ($36) ($140) ($22) Entergy Mississippi ($41) ($20) ($24) ($19) Entergy New Orleans $- ($7) $- $- Entergy Texas ($30) ($65) ($119) $- The APSC has approved a production cost allocation rider for recovery from customers of the retail portion of the costs allocated to Entergy Arkansas. Management believes that any changes in the allocation of production costs resulting from the FERC’s decision and related retail proceedings should result in similar rate changes for retail customers, subject to specific circumstances that have caused trapped costs. See “Fuel and purchased power cost recovery, Entergy Texas,” above for discussion of a PUCT decision that resulted in $18.6 million of trapped costs between Entergy’s Texas and Louisiana jurisdictions. See “2007 Rate Filing Based on Calendar Year 2006 Production Costs” below for a discussion of a FERC decision that could result in $14.5 million of trapped costs at Entergy Arkansas. Based on the FERC’s April 27, 2007 order on rehearing that is discussed above, in the second quarter 2007 Entergy Arkansas recorded accounts payable and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy Texas recorded accounts receivable to reflect the rough production cost equalization payments and receipts required to implement the FERC’s remedy based on calendar year 2006 production costs. Entergy Arkansas recorded a corresponding regulatory asset for its right to collect the payments from its customers, and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy Texas recorded corresponding regulatory liabilities for their obligations to pass the receipts on to their customers. The companies have followed this same accounting practice each year since then. The regulatory asset and liabilities are shown as “System Agreement cost equalization” on the respective balance sheets. 2007 Rate Filing Based on Calendar Year 2006 Production Costs Several parties intervened in the 2007 rate proceeding at the FERC, including the APSC, the MPSC, the Council, and the LPSC, which have also filed protests. The PUCT also intervened. Intervenor testimony was filed in which the intervenors and also the FERC Staff advocated a number of positions on issues that affect the level of production costs the individual Utility operating companies are permitted to reflect in the bandwidth calculation, including the level of depreciation and decommissioning expense for nuclear facilities. The effect of the various positions would be to reallocate costs among the Utility operating companies. The Utility operating companies filed rebuttal testimony explaining why the bandwidth payments are properly recoverable under the AmerenUE contract, and explaining why the positions of FERC Staff and intervenors on the other issues should be rejected. A hearing in this proceeding concluded in July 2008, and the ALJ issued an initial decision in September 2008. The ALJ’s initial decision concluded, among other things, that: (1) the decisions to not exercise Entergy Arkansas’s option to purchase the Independence plant in 1996 and 1997 were prudent; (2) Entergy Arkansas properly flowed a portion of the bandwidth payments through to AmerenUE in accordance with the wholesale power contract; and (3) the level of nuclear depreciation and decommissioning expense reflected in the bandwidth calculation should be calculated based on NRC-authorized license life, rather than the nuclear depreciation and decommissioning expense authorized by the retail regulators for purposes of retail ratemaking. Following briefing by the parties, the matter was submitted to the FERC for decision. On January 11, 2010, the FERC issued its decision both affirming and overturning certain 80 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements of the ALJ’s rulings, including overturning the decision on nuclear depreciation and decommissioning expense. The FERC’s conclusion related to the AmerenUE contract does not permit Entergy Arkansas to recover a portion of its bandwidth payment from AmerenUE. The Utility operating companies requested rehearing of that portion of the decision and requested clarification on certain other portions of the decision. AmerenUE argued that its current wholesale power contract with Entergy Arkansas, pursuant to which Entergy Arkansas sells power to AmerenUE, does not permit Entergy Arkansas to flow through to AmerenUE any portion of Entergy Arkansas’s bandwidth payment. According to AmerenUE, Entergy Arkansas has sought to collect from AmerenUE approximately $14.5 million of the 2007 Entergy Arkansas bandwidth payment. The AmerenUE contract expired in August 2009. In April 2008, AmerenUE filed a complaint with the FERC seeking refunds of this amount, plus interest, in the event the FERC ultimately determines that bandwidth payments are not properly recovered under the AmerenUE contract. In response to the FERC’s decision discussed in the previous paragraph, Entergy Arkansas recorded a regulatory provision in the fourth quarter 2009 for a potential refund to AmerenUE. 2008 Rate Filing Based on Calendar Year 2007 Production Costs Several parties intervened in the 2008 rate proceeding at the FERC, including the APSC, the LPSC, and AmerenUE, which have also filed protests. Several other parties, including the MPSC and the City Council, have intervened in the proceeding without filing a protest. In direct testimony filed on January 9, 2009, certain intervenors and also the FERC staff advocated a number of positions on issues that affect the level of production costs the individual Utility operating companies are permitted to reflect in the bandwidth calculation, including the level of depreciation and decommissioning expense for the nuclear and fossil-fueled generating facilities. The effect of these various positions would be to reallocate costs among the Utility operating companies. In addition, three issues were raised alleging imprudence by the Utility operating companies, including whether the Utility operating companies had properly reflected generating units’ minimum operating levels for purposes of making unit commitment and dispatch decisions, whether Entergy Arkansas’s sales to third parties from its retained share of the Grand Gulf nuclear facility were reasonable, prudent, and non-discriminatory, and whether Entergy Louisiana’s long-term Evangeline gas purchase contract was prudent and reasonable. The parties reached a partial settlement agreement of certain of the issues initially raised in this proceeding. The partial settlement agreement was conditioned on the FERC accepting the agreement without modification or condition, which the FERC did on August 24, 2009. A hearing on the remaining issues in the proceeding was completed in June 2009, and in September 2009 the ALJ issued an initial decision. The initial decision affirms Entergy’s position in the filing, except for two issues that may result in a reallocation of costs among the Utility operating companies. In October 2011 the FERC issued an order on the ALJ’s initial decision. The FERC’s order resulted in a minor reallocation of payments/receipts among the Utility operating companies on one issue in the 2008 rate filing. Entergy made a compliance filing in December 2011 showing the updated payment/receipt amounts. The LPSC filed a protest in response to the compliance filing. 2009 Rate Filing Based on Calendar Year 2008 Production Costs Several parties intervened in the 2009 rate proceeding at the FERC, including the LPSC and Ameren, which have also filed protests. In July 2009 the FERC accepted Entergy's proposed rates for filing, effective June 1, 2009, subject to refund, and set the proceeding for hearing and settlement procedures. Settlement procedures were terminated and a hearing before the ALJ was held in April 2010. In August 2010 the ALJ issued an initial decision. The initial decision substantially affirms Entergy's position in the filing, except for one issue that may result in some reallocation of costs among the Utility operating companies. The LPSC, the FERC trial staff, and Entergy have submitted briefs on exceptions in the proceeding. 2010 Rate Filing Based on Calendar Year 2009 Production Costs In May 2010, Entergy filed with the FERC the 2010 rates in accordance with the FERC’s orders in the System Agreement proceeding, and supplemented the filing in September 2010. Several parties intervened in the proceeding at the FERC, including the LPSC and the City Council, which have also filed protests. In July 2010 the FERC accepted Entergy’s proposed rates for filing, effective June 1, 2010, subject to refund, and set the proceeding for 81 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements hearing and settlement procedures. Settlement procedures have been terminated, and the ALJ scheduled hearings to begin in March 2011. Subsequently, in January 2011 the ALJ issued an order directing the parties and FERC Staff to show cause why this proceeding should not be stayed pending the issuance of FERC decisions in the prior production cost proceedings currently before the FERC on review. In March 2011 the ALJ issued an order placing this proceeding in abeyance. Interruptible Load Proceeding In April 2007 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued its opinion in the LPSC’s appeal of the FERC’s March 2004 and April 2005 orders related to the treatment under the System Agreement of the Utility operating companies’ interruptible loads. In its opinion, the D.C. Circuit concluded that the FERC (1) acted arbitrarily and capriciously by allowing the Utility operating companies to phase-in the effects of the elimination of the interruptible load over a 12-month period of time; (2) failed to adequately explain why refunds could not be ordered under Section 206(c) of the Federal Power Act; and (3) exercised appropriately its discretion to defer addressing the cost of sulfur dioxide allowances until a later time. The D.C. Circuit remanded the matter to the FERC for a more considered determination on the issue of refunds. The FERC issued its order on remand in September 2007, in which it directed Entergy to make a compliance filing removing all interruptible load from the computation of peak load responsibility commencing April 1, 2004 and to issue any necessary refunds to reflect this change. In addition, the order directed the Utility operating companies to make refunds for the period May 1995 through July 1996. In November 2007 the Utility operating companies filed a refund report describing the refunds to be issued pursuant to the FERC's orders. The LPSC filed a protest to the refund report in December 2007, and the Utility operating companies filed an answer to the protest in January 2008. The refunds were made in October 2008 by the Utility operating companies that owed refunds to the Utility operating companies that were due a refund under the decision. The APSC and the Utility operating companies appealed the FERC decisions to the D.C. Circuit. Because of its refund obligation to its customers as a result of this proceeding and a related LPSC proceeding, Entergy Louisiana recorded provisions during 2008 of approximately $16 million, including interest, for rate refunds. The refunds were made in the fourth quarter 2009. Following the filing of petitioners' initial briefs, the FERC filed a motion requesting the D.C. Circuit hold the appeal of the FERC’s decisions ordering refunds in the interruptible load proceeding in abeyance and remand the record to the FERC. The D.C. Circuit granted the FERC’s unopposed motion in June 2009. In December 2009 the FERC established a paper hearing to determine whether the FERC had the authority and, if so, whether it would be appropriate to order refunds resulting from changes in the treatment of interruptible load in the allocation of capacity costs by the Utility operating companies. In August 2010 the FERC issued an order stating that it has the authority and refunds are appropriate. The APSC, MPSC, and Entergy requested rehearing of the FERC’s decision. In June 2011 the FERC issued an order granting rehearing in part and denying rehearing in part, in which the FERC determined to invoke its discretion to deny refunds. The FERC held that in this case where “the Entergy system as a whole collected the proper level of revenue, but, as was later established, incorrectly allocated peak load responsibility among the various Entergy operating companies….the Commission will apply here our usual practice in such cases, invoking our equitable discretion to not order refunds, notwithstanding our authority to do so.” The LPSC has requested rehearing of the FERC’s June 2011 decision. On October 6, 2011 the FERC issued an “Order Establishing Paper Hearing” inviting parties that oppose refunds to file briefs within 30 days addressing the LPSC’s argument that FERC precedent supports refunds under the circumstances present in this proceeding. Parties that favor refunds were then invited to file reply briefs within 21 days of the date that the initial briefs are due. Briefs were submitted and the matter is pending. In September 2010 the FERC had issued an order setting the refund report filed in the proceeding in November 2007 for hearing and settlement judge procedures. In May 2011, Entergy filed a settlement agreement that resolved all issues relating to the refund report set for hearing. In June 2011 the settlement judge certified the settlement as uncontested and the settlement agreement is currently pending before the FERC. In July 2011, Entergy filed an amended/corrected refund report and a motion to defer action on the settlement agreement until after the FERC rules on the LPSC’s rehearing request regarding the June 2011 decision denying refunds. 82 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Prior to the FERC’s June 2011 order on rehearing, Entergy Arkansas filed an application in November 2010 with the APSC for recovery of the refund that it paid. The APSC denied Entergy Arkansas’s application, and also denied Entergy Arkansas’s petition for rehearing. If the FERC were to order Entergy Arkansas to pay refunds on rehearing in the interruptible load proceeding the APSC’s decision would trap FERC-approved costs at Entergy Arkansas with no regulatory-approved mechanism to recover them. In August 2011, Entergy Arkansas filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas asking for a declaratory judgment. In the complaint Entergy Arkansas asks the court to declare that the rejection of Entergy Arkansas’s application by the APSC is preempted by the Federal Power Act. The APSC filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. A trial in the proceeding is scheduled for July 2012. Entergy Arkansas Opportunity Sales Proceeding In June 2009, the LPSC filed a complaint requesting that the FERC determine that certain of Entergy Arkansas’s sales of electric energy to third parties: (a) violated the provisions of the System Agreement that allocate the energy generated by Entergy System resources, (b) imprudently denied the Entergy System and its ultimate consumers the benefits of low-cost Entergy System generating capacity, and (c) violated the provision of the System Agreement that prohibits sales to third parties by individual companies absent an offer of a right-of-first-refusal to other Utility operating companies. The LPSC’s complaint challenges sales made beginning in 2002 and requests refunds. On July 20, 2009, the Utility operating companies filed a response to the complaint requesting that the FERC dismiss the complaint on the merits without hearing because the LPSC has failed to meet its burden of showing any violation of the System Agreement and failed to produce any evidence of imprudent action by the Entergy System. In their response, the Utility operating companies explained that the System Agreement clearly contemplates that the Utility operating companies may make sales to third parties for their own account, subject to the requirement that those sales be included in the load (or load shape) for the applicable Utility operating company. The response further explains that the FERC already has determined that Entergy Arkansas’s short-term wholesale sales did not trigger the “right-of-first-refusal” provision of the System Agreement. While the D.C. Circuit recently determined that the “right-of-first-refusal” issue was not properly before the FERC at the time of its earlier decision on the issue, the LPSC has raised no additional claims or facts that would warrant the FERC reaching a different conclusion. On December 7, 2009, the FERC issued an order setting the matter for hearing and settlement procedures. The LPSC filed direct testimony in the proceeding alleging, among other things, (1) that Entergy violated the System Agreement by permitting Entergy Arkansas to make non-requirements sales to non-affiliated third parties rather than making such energy available to the other Utility operating companies’ customers; and (2) that over the period 2000 - 2009, these non-requirements sales caused harm to the Utility operating companies’ customers of $144 million and these customers should be compensated for this harm by Entergy. In subsequent testimony, the LPSC modified its original damages claim in favor of quantifying damages by re-running intra-system bills, which has not occurred. The Utility operating companies believe the LPSC's allegations are without merit. A hearing in the matter was held in August 2010. In December 2010 the ALJ issued an initial decision. The ALJ found that the System Agreement allowed for Entergy Arkansas to make the sales to third parties but concluded that the sales should be accounted for in the same manner as joint account sales. The ALJ concluded that “shareholders” should make refunds of the damages to the Utility operating companies, along with interest. Entergy Corporation, or an Entergy Corporation subsidiary, is the shareholder of each of the Utility operating companies. Entergy disagrees with several aspects of the ALJ’s initial decision and in January 2011 filed with the FERC exceptions to the decision. FERC consideration of the initial decision is pending. Entergy is unable to estimate the potential damages in this matter because certain aspects of how the refunds would be calculated require clarification by the FERC. 83 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Storm Cost Recovery Filings with Retail Regulators Entergy Arkansas In January 2009 a severe ice storm caused significant damage to Entergy Arkansas's transmission and distribution lines, equipment, poles, and other facilities. A law was enacted in April 2009 in Arkansas that authorizes securitization of storm damage restoration costs. In June 2010 the APSC issued a financing order authorizing the issuance of approximately $126.3 million in storm cost recovery bonds, which includes carrying costs of $11.5 million and $4.6 million of up-front financing costs. See Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of the August 2010 issuance of the securitization bonds. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike In September 2008, Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike caused catastrophic damage to Entergy's service territory. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana filed their Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike storm cost recovery case with the LPSC in May 2009. In September 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana and the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation (LURC), an instrumentality of the State of Louisiana, filed with the LPSC an application requesting that the LPSC grant financing orders authorizing the financing of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana’s storm costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to Act 55 of the Louisiana Regular Session of 2007 (Act 55 financings). Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana’s Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita storm costs were financed primarily by Act 55 financings, as discussed below. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana also filed an application requesting LPSC approval for ancillary issues including the mechanism to flow charges and Act 55 financing savings to customers via a Storm Cost Offset rider. In December 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana entered into a stipulation agreement with the LPSC Staff that provides for total recoverable costs of approximately $234 million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and $394 million for Entergy Louisiana, including carrying costs. Under this stipulation, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana agrees not to recover $4.4 million and Entergy Louisiana agrees not to recover $7.2 million of their storm restoration spending. The stipulation also permits replenishing Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's storm reserve in the amount of $90 million and Entergy Louisiana's storm reserve in the amount of $200 million when the Act 55 financings are accomplished. In March and April 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and other parties to the proceeding filed with the LPSC an uncontested stipulated settlement that includes these terms and also includes Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana's proposals under the Act 55 financings, which includes a commitment to pass on to customers a minimum of $15.5 million and $27.75 million of customer benefits, respectively, through prospective annual rate reductions of $3.1 million and $5.55 million for five years. A stipulation hearing was held before the ALJ on April 13, 2010. On April 21, 2010, the LPSC approved the settlement and subsequently issued two financing orders and one ratemaking order intended to facilitate the implementation of the Act 55 financings. In June 2010 the Louisiana State Bond Commission approved the Act 55 financings. In July 2010 the Louisiana Local Government Environmental Facilities and Community Development Authority (LCDA) issued $468.9 million in bonds under Act 55. From the $462.4 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LCDA to the LURC, the LURC deposited $200 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve for Entergy Louisiana and transferred $262.4 million directly to Entergy Louisiana. From the bond proceeds received by Entergy Louisiana from the LURC, Entergy Louisiana used $262.4 million to acquire 2,624,297.11 Class B preferred, non-voting, membership interest units of Entergy Holdings Company LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy, that carry a 9% annual distribution rate. Distributions are payable quarterly commencing on September 15, 2010, and the membership interests have a liquidation price of $100 per unit. The preferred membership interests are callable at the option of Entergy Holdings Company LLC after ten years under the terms of the LLC agreement. The terms of the membership interests include certain financial covenants to which Entergy Holdings Company LLC is subject, including the requirement to maintain a net worth of at least $1 billion. 84 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements In July 2010 the LCDA issued another $244.1 million in bonds under Act 55. From the $240.3 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LCDA to the LURC, the LURC deposited $90 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and transferred $150.3 million directly to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. From the bond proceeds received by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana from the LURC, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana used $150.3 million to acquire 1,502,643.04 Class B preferred, non-voting, membership interest units of Entergy Holdings Company LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy, that carry a 9% annual distribution rate. Distributions are payable quarterly commencing on September 15, 2010, and the membership interests have a liquidation price of $100 per unit. The preferred membership interests are callable at the option of Entergy Holdings Company LLC after ten years under the terms of the LLC agreement. The terms of the membership interests include certain financial covenants to which Entergy Holdings Company LLC is subject, including the requirement to maintain a net worth of at least $1 billion. Entergy, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, and Entergy Louisiana do not report the bonds on their balance sheets because the bonds are the obligation of the LCDA, and there is no recourse against Entergy, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy Louisiana in the event of a bond default. To service the bonds, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana collect a system restoration charge on behalf of the LURC, and remit the collections to the bond indenture trustee. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana do not report the collections as revenue because they are merely acting as the billing and collection agents for the state. Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita In August and September 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused catastrophic damage to large portions of the Utility’s service territories in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, including the effect of extensive flooding that resulted from levee breaks in and around the greater New Orleans area. The storms and flooding resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage to electric distribution, transmission, and generation and gas infrastructure, and the loss of sales and customers due to mandatory evacuations and the destruction of homes and businesses. In March 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation (LURC), an instrumentality of the State of Louisiana, filed at the LPSC an application requesting that the LPSC grant financing orders authorizing the financing of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana storm costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to Act 55 of the Louisiana Legislature (Act 55 financings). The Act 55 financings are expected to produce additional customer benefits as compared to traditional securitization. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana also filed an application requesting LPSC approval for ancillary issues including the mechanism to flow charges and savings to customers via a Storm Cost Offset rider. On April 8, 2008, the Louisiana Public Facilities Authority (LPFA), which is the issuer of the bonds pursuant to the Act 55 financings, approved requests for the Act 55 financings. On April 10, 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC Staff filed with the LPSC an uncontested stipulated settlement that includes Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana’s proposals under the Act 55 financings, which includes a commitment to pass on to customers a minimum of $10 million and $30 million of customer benefits, respectively, through prospective annual rate reductions of $2 million and $6 million for five years. On April 16, 2008, the LPSC approved the settlement and issued two financing orders and one ratemaking order intended to facilitate implementation of the Act 55 financings. In May 2008, the Louisiana State Bond Commission granted final approval of the Act 55 financings. In July 2008 the LPFA issued $687.7 million in bonds under the aforementioned Act 55. From the $679 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LPFA to the LURC, the LURC deposited $152 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve for Entergy Louisiana and transferred $527 million directly to Entergy Louisiana. From the bond proceeds received by Entergy Louisiana from the LURC, Entergy Louisiana invested $545 million, 85 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements including $17.8 million that was withdrawn from the restricted escrow account as approved by the April 16, 2008 LPSC orders, in exchange for 5,449,861.85 Class A preferred, non-voting, membership interest units of Entergy Holdings Company LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy, that carry a 10% annual distribution rate. Distributions are payable quarterly commencing on September 15, 2008 and have a liquidation price of $100 per unit. The preferred membership interests are callable at the option of Entergy Holdings Company LLC after ten years under the terms of the LLC agreement. The terms of the membership interests include certain financial covenants to which Entergy Holdings Company LLC is subject, including the requirement to maintain a net worth of at least $1 billion. In August 2008 the LPFA issued $278.4 million in bonds under the aforementioned Act 55. From the $274.7 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LPFA to the LURC, the LURC deposited $87 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and transferred $187.7 million directly to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. From the bond proceeds received by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana from the LURC, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana invested $189.4 million, including $1.7 million that was withdrawn from the restricted escrow account as approved by the April 16, 2008 LPSC orders, in exchange for 1,893,918.39 Class A preferred, non-voting, membership interest units of Entergy Holdings Company LLC that carry a 10% annual distribution rate. Distributions are payable quarterly commencing on September 15, 2008 and have a liquidation price of $100 per unit.

The terms of the membership interests include certain financial covenants to which Entergy Holdings Company LLC is subject, including the requirement to maintain a net worth of at least $1 billion. Entergy, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, and Entergy Louisiana do not report the bonds on their balance sheets because the bonds are the obligation of the LPFA, and there is no recourse against Entergy, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy Louisiana in the event of a bond default. To service the bonds, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana collect a system restoration charge on behalf of the LURC, and remit the collections to the bond indenture trustee. Entergy, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, and Entergy Louisiana do not report the collections as revenue because they are merely acting as the billing and collection agent for the state. Entergy New Orleans In December 2005 the U.S. Congress passed the Katrina Relief Bill, a hurricane aid package that included Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding (for the states affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma) that allowed state and local leaders to fund individual recovery priorities. In March 2007 the City Council certified that Entergy New Orleans incurred $205 million in storm-related costs through December 2006 that are eligible for CDBG funding under the state action plan. Entergy New Orleans received $180.8 million of CDBG funds in 2007 and $19.2 million in 2010. In October 2006, the City Council approved a rate filing settlement agreement that, among other things, authorized a $75 million storm reserve for damage from future storms, which will be created over a ten-year period through a storm reserve rider that began in March 2007. These storm reserve funds will be held in a restricted escrow account. Entergy Texas Entergy Texas filed an application in April 2009 seeking a determination that $577.5 million of Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav restoration costs are recoverable, including estimated costs for work to be completed. On August 5, 2009, Entergy Texas submitted to the ALJ an unopposed settlement agreement intended to resolve all issues in the storm cost recovery case. Under the terms of the agreement $566.4 million, plus carrying costs, are eligible for recovery. Insurance proceeds will be credited as an offset to the securitized amount. Of the $11.1 million difference between Entergy Texas’s request and the amount agreed to, which is part of the black box agreement and not 86 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements directly attributable to any specific individual issues raised, $6.8 million is operation and maintenance expense for which Entergy Texas recorded a charge in the second quarter 2009. The remaining $4.3 million was recorded as utility plant. The PUCT approved the settlement in August 2009, and in September 2009 the PUCT approved recovery of the costs, plus carrying costs, by securitization. See Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of the November 2009 issuance of the securitization bonds. New Nuclear Generation Development Costs Pursuant to the Mississippi Baseload Act and the Mississippi Public Utilities Act, Entergy Mississippi is developing a project option for new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf Nuclear Station. This project is in the early stages, and several issues remain to be addressed over time before significant additional capital would be committed to this project. In 2010, Entergy Mississippi paid for and has recognized on its books $49 million in costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf; these costs previously had been recorded on the books of Entergy New Nuclear Utility Development, LLC, a System Energy subsidiary. In October 2010, Entergy Mississippi filed an application with the MPSC requesting that the MPSC determine that it is in the public interest to preserve the option to construct new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf and that the MPSC approve the deferral of Entergy Mississippi’s costs incurred to date and in the future related to this project, including the accrual of AFUDC or similar carrying charges. In October 2011, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff filed with the MPSC a joint stipulation. The stipulation states that there should be a deferral of the $57 million of costs incurred through September 2011 in connection with planning, evaluation, monitoring, and other and related generation resource development activities for new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf. The costs shall be treated as a regulatory asset until the proceeding is resolved. The Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and Entergy Mississippi also agree that the MPSC should conduct a hearing during 2012 to consider the relief requested by Entergy Mississippi in its application, including evidence regarding whether costs incurred in connection with planning, evaluation, monitoring, and other and related generation resource development activities for new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf were prudently incurred and are otherwise allowable. The Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and Entergy Mississippi further agree that such prudently incurred costs shall be recoverable in a manner to be determined by the MPSC. In the Stipulation, the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and Entergy Mississippi agree that the development of a nuclear unit project option is consistent with the Mississippi Baseload Act. The Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and Entergy Mississippi further agree that the deferral of costs incurred in connection with planning, evaluation, monitoring, and other and related generation resource development activities for new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf also is consistent with the Mississippi Baseload Act. Entergy Mississippi will not accrue carrying charges or continue to accrue AFUDC on the costs, pending the outcome of the proceeding. The MPSC approved the stipulation in November 2011. Error in the Allocation of Transmission Costs In the fourth quarter 2011, Entergy determined that the allocation of transmission costs among the Utility operating companies under the System Agreement inadvertently excluded certain transmission costs. This exclusion resulted in the over or understatement of System Agreement bills among the Utility operating companies during the period from 1996 through the third quarter 2011. The effect was immaterial to the balance sheets, results of operations, and cash flows of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy Texas for all prior reporting periods and on a cumulative basis. Therefore, cumulative adjustments were recorded in the fourth quarter 2011 to correct for the amounts previously misstated. These adjustments increased (reduced) 2011 income before income taxes by $8.9 million for Entergy Arkansas, $5.8 million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, ($17.1) million for Entergy Louisiana, and ($3.1) million for Entergy Texas. The effect was also immaterial to the balance sheets, results of operations, and cash flows of Entergy Mississippi and Entergy New Orleans for all prior reporting periods. Correcting the cumulative effect of the error in the fourth quarter 2011 would have been material, however, to the results of operations of Entergy Mississippi and Entergy New Orleans. Accordingly, Entergy Mississippi and Entergy New Orleans are restating their 2009 and 2010 financial statements. The effects of the correction for 2009 and 2010 were the following increases or (decreases) to the previously reported amounts for the following financial statement items: 87 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Income before income taxes Income taxes Net income Accounts receivable- associated companies Taxes accrued/ Prepayments and other (In Millions) Entergy Mississippi 2009 $2.8 $1.1 $1.7 $- $- 2010 $2.7 $1.0 $1.7 $11.1 $4.3 Entergy New Orleans 2009 ($0.9) ($0.4) ($0.5) $- $- 2010 $0.2 $0.1 $0.1 ($5.8) $2.3 The cumulative effects of the correction on beginning retained earnings for 2009 were the following increase and (decrease): Cumulative Effect of the Correction on Beginning Retained Earnings for 2009 Entergy Mississippi $3.5 million Entergy New Orleans ($3.0 million) There was no effect on the Entergy financial statements for any period because the error only involved the allocation of shared transmission costs among the Utility operating companies under the System Agreement and, therefore, had no effect on a consolidated basis. 88 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements NOTE 3.

If a tax deduction is taken on a tax return, but does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, an increase in income tax liability, above what is payable on the tax return, is required to be recorded. A reconciliation of Entergy’s beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 2011 2010 2009 (In Thousands) Gross balance at January 1 $4,949,788 $4,050,491 $1,825,447 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 211,966 480,843 2,286,759 Additions for tax positions of prior years 332,744 871,682 697,615 Reductions for tax positions of prior years (259,895) (438,460) (372,862) Settlements (841,528) (10,462) (385,321) Lapse of statute of limitations (5,295) (4,306) (1,147) Gross balance at December 31 4,387,780 4,949,788 4,050,491 Offsets to gross unrecognized tax benefits: Credit and loss carryovers (3,212,397) (3,771,301) (3,349,589) Cash paid to taxing authorities (363,266) (373,000) (373,000) Unrecognized tax benefits net of unused tax attributes and payments (1) $812,117 $805,487 $327,902 (1) Potential tax liability above what is payable on tax returns The balances of unrecognized tax benefits include $521 million, $605 million, and $522 million as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, which, if recognized, would lower the effective income tax rates. Because of the effect of deferred tax accounting, the remaining balances of unrecognized tax benefits of $3.867 billion, $4.345 billion, and $3.528 billion as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, if disallowed, would not affect the annual effective income tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. Entergy has made deposits with the IRS against its potential liabilities arising from audit adjustments and settlements related to its uncertain tax positions. Deposits are expected to be made to the IRS as the cash tax benefits of uncertain tax positions are realized. As of December 31, 2011, Entergy has deposits of $363 million on account with the IRS to cover its uncertain tax positions. Entergy accrues interest expense, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Entergy’s December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 accrued balance for the possible payment of interest is approximately $99 million, $45 million, and $48 million, respectively. 97 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements A reconciliation of the Registrant Subsidiaries’ beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for 2011, 2010, and 2009 is as follows: 2011 Entergy Arkansas Entergy Gulf States Louisiana Entergy Louisiana Entergy Mississippi Entergy New Orleans Entergy Texas System Energy (In Thousands) Gross balance at January 1, 2011 $240,239 $353,886 $505,188 $24,163 $18,176 $14,229 $224,518 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 11,216 9,398 8,748 457 50,212 1,760 44,419 Additions for tax positions of prior years 44,202 50,944 21,052 21,902 7,343 7,533 14,200 Reductions for tax positions of prior years (3,255) (21,719) (27,991) (5,022) (12,289) (3,432) (4,942) Settlements 43,091 (2,016) (60,810) (30,448) (7,390) (865) 2,988 Gross balance at December 31, 2011 335,493 390,493 446,187 11,052 56,052 19,225 281,183 Offsets to gross unrecognized tax benefits: Loss carryovers (146,429) (26,394) (216,720) (5,930) (1,211) (10,645) (10,752) Cash paid to taxing authorities (75,977) (45,493) 0 (7,556) (1,174) (1,376) (41,878) Unrecognized tax benefits net of unused tax attributes and payments $113,087 $318,606 $229,467 ($2,434) $53,667 $7,204 $228,553 2010 Entergy Arkansas Entergy Gulf States Louisiana Entergy Louisiana Entergy Mississippi Entergy New Orleans Entergy Texas System Energy (In Thousands) Gross balance at January 1, 2010 $293,920 $311,311 $352,577 $17,137 ($53,295) $32,299 $211,247 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 38,205 87,755 183,188 4,679 173 5,169 16,829 Additions for tax positions of prior years 1,838 25,960 34,236 6,857 72,169 5,868 10,402 Reductions for tax positions of prior years (92,699) (71,033) (64,868) (4,469) (863) (29,100) (13,116) Settlements (1,025) (107) 55 (41) (8) (7) (844) Gross balance at December 31, 2010 240,239 353,886 505,188 24,163 18,176 14,229 224,518 Offsets to gross unrecognized tax benefits: Loss carryovers (123,968) (29,257) (131,805) (6,477) (3,751) (6,269) (10,487) Cash paid to taxing authorities (75,977) (45,493) - (7,556) (1,174) (1,376) (41,878) Unrecognized tax benefits net of unused tax attributes and payments $40,294 $279,136 $373,383 $10,130 $13,251 $6,584 $172,153 98 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements 2009 Entergy Arkansas Entergy Gulf States Louisiana Entergy Louisiana Entergy Mississippi Entergy New Orleans Entergy Texas System Energy (In Thousands) Gross balance at January 1, 2009 $240,203 $275,378 $298,650 $31,724 $26,050 $39,202 $172,168 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 9,826 5,436 10,197 283 17 97 6,812 Additions for tax positions of prior years 80,968 102,466 108,399 1,256 109 28,821 30,586 Reductions for tax positions of prior years (22,830) (33,000) (45,613) (4,235) (70,391) (17,853) (244) Settlements (14,247) (38,969) (19,056) (11,891) (9,080) (17,968) 1,925 Gross balance at December 31, 2009 293,920 311,311 352,577 17,137 (53,295) 32,299 211,247 Offsets to gross unrecognized tax benefits: Loss carryovers (39,847) (20,031) (70,428) (1,618) (633) (30,921) (1,297) Cash paid to taxing authorities (75,977) (45,493) - (7,556) (1,174) (1,376) (41,878) Unrecognized tax benefits net of unused tax attributes and payments $178,096 $245,787 $282,149 $7,963 ($55,102) $2 $168,072 The Registrant Subsidiaries’ balances of unrecognized tax benefits included amounts which, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate as follows: December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 (In Millions) Entergy Arkansas $- $0.2 $1.2 Entergy Gulf States Louisiana $107.9 $129.6 $69.8 Entergy Louisiana $281.3 $286.7 $192.7 Entergy Mississippi $3.8 $5.3 $3.3 Entergy New Orleans $- $- $0.3 Entergy Texas $7.3 $6.0 $1.2 System Energy $- $12.1 $8.7 The Registrant Subsidiaries accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

The issues decided by the Tax Court are as follows: · The ability to credit the U.K. Windfall Tax against U.S. tax as a foreign tax credit. The U.K. Windfall Tax relates to Entergy’s former investment in London Electricity. · The validity of Entergy’s change in method of tax accounting for street lighting assets and the related increase in depreciation deductions. The IRS did not appeal street lighting depreciation, and that matter is considered final. The IRS filed an appeal of the U.K. Windfall Tax decision, however, with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in December 2010. Oral arguments were heard in November 2011, and a decision is pending. Concurrent with the Tax Court’s issuance of a favorable decision regarding the above issues, the Tax Court issued a favorable decision in a separate proceeding, PPL Corp. v. Commissioner, regarding the creditability of the U.K. Windfall Tax. The IRS appealed the PPL decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In December 2011, the Third Circuit reversed the Tax Court’s holding in PPL Corp. v. Commissioner, stating that the U.K. tax was not eligible for the foreign tax credit. Entergy is awaiting a decision in its proceeding before the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Although Entergy believes that the Third Circuit opinion is incorrect, its decision constitutes adverse, although not controlling authority. After considering the Third Circuit decision, in the fourth quarter 2011, Entergy revised its provision for uncertain tax positions associated with this issue. The total tax included in IRS Notices of Deficiency relating to the U.K. Windfall Tax credit issue is $82 million. The total tax and interest associated with this issue for all years is approximately $239 million. This assumes that Entergy would utilize a portion of its cash deposits discussed in “Unrecognized tax benefits” above to offset underpayment interest. In February 2008 the IRS issued a Statutory Notice of Deficiency for the year 2000. The deficiency resulted from a disallowance of the same two 1997-1998 issues discussed above as well as one additional issue. That issue is depreciation deductions that resulted from Entergy’s purchase price allocations on its acquisitions of its non-utility nuclear plants. Entergy filed a Tax Court petition in May 2008 challenging the three issues in dispute. In June 2010 a trial on these issues was held in Washington, D.C. In February 2011 a joint stipulation of settled issues was filed addressing the depreciation issue in the Tax Court case. As a result, the IRS agreed that Entergy was entitled to allocate all of the cash consideration to plant and equipment rather than to nuclear decommissioning trusts thereby entitling Entergy to its claimed depreciation. Income Tax Audits Entergy and its subsidiaries file U.S. federal and various state and foreign income tax returns. Other than the matters discussed in the Income Tax Litigation section above, the IRS’s and substantially all state taxing authorities’ examinations are completed for years before 2004. 2002-2003 IRS Audit In September 2009, Entergy entered into a partial agreement with the IRS for the years 2002 and 2003. It is a partial agreement because Entergy did not agree to the IRS’s disallowance of foreign tax credits for the U.K. Windfall Tax and the street lighting depreciation issues as they relate to 2002. As discussed above the, the IRS did not appeal the Tax Court ruling on the street lighting depreciation. Therefore, the U.K. Windfall tax credit issue will be governed by the decision by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for the tax years 1997 and 1998. 100 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements 2004-2005 IRS Audit The IRS issued its 2004-2005 Revenue Agent’s Report (RAR) in May 2009. In June 2009, Entergy filed a formal protest with the IRS Appeals Division indicating disagreement with certain issues contained in the 2004-2005 RAR. The major issues in dispute are: · Depreciation of street lighting assets (Because the IRS did not appeal the Tax Court’s 2010 decision on this issue, it will be fully allowed in the final Appeals Division calculations for this audit). · Qualified research expenditures for purposes of the research credit. · Inclusion of nuclear decommissioning liabilities in cost of goods sold. The initial IRS appeals conference to discuss these disputed issues occurred in September 2010. Negotiations are ongoing. 2006-2007 IRS Audit The IRS issued its 2006-2007 RAR in October 2011. In connection with the 2006-2007 IRS audit and resulting RAR, Entergy resolved the significant issues discussed below. In August 2011, Entergy entered into a settlement agreement with the IRS relating to the mark-to-market income tax treatment of various wholesale electric power purchase and sale agreements, including Entergy Louisiana’s contract to purchase electricity from the Vidalia hydroelectric facility. See Note 8 to the financial statements for further details regarding this contract and a previous LPSC-approved settlement regarding sharing of tax benefits from the tax treatment of the contract. With respect to income tax accounting for wholesale electric power purchase agreements, Entergy recognized income for tax purposes of approximately $1.5 billion, which represents a reversal of previously deducted temporary differences on which deferred taxes had been provided. Also in connection with this settlement, Entergy recognized a gain for income tax purposes of approximately $1.03 billion on the formation of a wholly-owned subsidiary in 2005 with a corresponding step-up in the tax basis of depreciable assets resulting in additional tax depreciation at Entergy Louisiana. Because Entergy Louisiana is entitled to deduct additional tax depreciation of $1.03 billion in the future, Entergy Louisiana recorded a deferred tax asset for this additional tax basis. The tax expense associated with the gain is offset by recording the deferred tax asset and by utilization of net operating losses. With the recording of the deferred tax asset, there was a corresponding increase to Entergy Louisiana’s member’s equity account. The agreement with the IRS effectively settled the tax treatment of various wholesale electric power purchase and sale agreements, resulting in the reversal in third quarter 2011 of approximately $422 million of deferred tax liabilities and liabilities for uncertain tax positions at Entergy Louisiana, with a corresponding reduction in income tax expense. Under the terms of an LPSC-approved final settlement, Entergy Louisiana will share over a 15-year period a portion of the benefits of the settlement with its customers, and recorded a $199 million regulatory charge and a corresponding net-of-tax regulatory liability to reflect this obligation. After consideration of the taxable income recognition and the additional depreciation deductions provided for in the settlement, Entergy’s net operating loss carryover was reduced by approximately $2.5 billion. 101 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Other Tax Matters Entergy regularly negotiates with the IRS to achieve settlements. The results of all pending litigations and audit issues could result in significant changes to the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits, as discussed above. When Entergy Louisiana, Inc. restructured effective December 31, 2005, Entergy Louisiana agreed, under the terms of the merger plan, to indemnify its parent, Entergy Louisiana Holdings, Inc. (formerly, Entergy Louisiana, Inc.) for certain tax obligations that arose from the 2002-2003 IRS partial agreement. Because the agreement with the IRS was settled in the fourth quarter 2009, Entergy Louisiana paid Entergy Louisiana Holdings approximately $289 million pursuant to these intercompany obligations in the fourth quarter 2009. On November 20, 2009, Entergy Corporation and subsidiaries amended the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement such that Entergy Corporation shall be treated, under all provisions of such Agreement, in a manner that is identical to the treatment afforded all subsidiaries, direct or indirect, of Entergy Corporation. In the fourth quarter 2009, Entergy filed Applications for Change in Method of Accounting with the IRS for certain costs under Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code. In the Applications, Entergy proposed to treat the nuclear decommissioning liability associated with the operation of its nuclear power plants as a production cost properly includable in cost of goods sold. The effect of this change for Entergy was a $5.7 billion reduction in 2009 taxable income within the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment. In March 2010, Entergy filed an Application for Change in Accounting Method with the IRS. In the application Entergy proposed to change the definition of unit of property for its generation assets to determine the appropriate characterization of costs associated with such units as capital or repair under the Internal Revenue Code and related Treasury Regulations. The effect of this change was an approximate $1.3 billion reduction in 2010 taxable income for Entergy, including reductions of $292 million for Entergy Arkansas, $132 million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, $185 million for Entergy Louisiana, $48 million for Entergy Mississippi, $45 million for Entergy Texas, $13 million for Entergy New Orleans, and $180 million for System Energy. During the second quarter 2011, Entergy filed an Application for Change in Accounting Method with the IRS related to the allocation of overhead costs between production and non-production activities. The accounting method affects the amount of overhead that will be capitalized or deducted for tax purposes. The accounting method is expected to be implemented for the 2014 tax year. 102 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements NOTE 4. REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES, LINES OF CREDIT AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) Entergy Corporation has in place a credit facility that has a borrowing capacity of approximately $3.5 billion and expires in August 2012, which Entergy intends to renew before expiration. Because the facility is now within one year of its expiration date, borrowings outstanding on the facility are classified as currently maturing long-term debt on the balance sheet. Entergy Corporation also has the ability to issue letters of credit against the total borrowing capacity of the credit facility. The facility fee is currently 0.125% of the commitment amount. Facility fees and interest rates on loans under the credit facility can fluctuate depending on the senior unsecured debt ratings of Entergy Corporation. The weighted average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 was 0.745% on the drawn portion of the facility. Following is a summary of the borrowings outstanding and capacity available under the facility as of December 31, 2011. Capacity Borrowings Letters of Credit Capacity Available (In Millions) $3,451 $1,920 $28 $1,503 Entergy Corporation’s facility requires it to maintain a consolidated debt ratio of 65% or less of its total capitalization. Entergy is in compliance with this covenant. If Entergy fails to meet this ratio, or if Entergy Corporation or one of the Utility operating companies (except Entergy New Orleans) defaults on other indebtedness or is in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, an acceleration of the facility maturity date may occur. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy Texas each had credit facilities available as of December 31, 2011 as follows: Company Expiration Date Amount of Facility Interest Rate (a) Amount Drawn as of December 31, 2011 Entergy Arkansas April 2012 $78 million (b) 3.25% - Entergy Gulf States Louisiana August 2012 $100 million (c) 0.71% - Entergy Louisiana August 2012 $200 million (d) 0.67% $50 million Entergy Mississippi May 2012 $35 million (e) 2.05% - Entergy Mississippi May 2012 $25 million (e) 2.05% - Entergy Mississippi May 2012 $10 million (e) 2.05% - Entergy Texas August 2012 $100 million (f) 0.77% - (a) The interest rate is the rate as of December 31, 2011 that would be applied to outstanding borrowings under the facility. (b) The credit facility requires Entergy Arkansas to maintain a debt ratio of 65% or less of its total capitalization. Borrowings under the Entergy Arkansas credit facility may be secured by a security interest in its accounts receivable. (c) The credit facility allows Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to issue letters of credit against the borrowing capacity of the facility. As of December 31, 2011, no letters of credit were outstanding. The credit facility requires Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to maintain a consolidated debt ratio of 65% or less of its total capitalization. (d) The credit facility allows Entergy Louisiana to issue letters of credit against the borrowing capacity of the facility. As of December 31, 2011, no letters of credit were outstanding. The credit facility requires Entergy Louisiana to maintain a consolidated debt ratio of 65% or less of its total capitalization. 103 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements (e) Borrowings under the Entergy Mississippi credit facilities may be secured by a security interest in its accounts receivable. Entergy Mississippi is required to maintain a consolidated debt ratio of 65% or less of its total capitalization. (f) The credit facility allows Entergy Texas to issue letters of credit against the borrowing capacity of the facility. As of December 31, 2011, no letters of credit were outstanding. The credit facility requires Entergy Texas to maintain a consolidated debt ratio of 65% or less of its total capitalization. Pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement securitization bonds are excluded from debt and capitalization in calculating the debt ratio. The facility fees on the credit facilities range from 0.09% to 0.15% of the commitment amount. The short-term borrowings of the Registrant Subsidiaries are limited to amounts authorized by the FERC. The current FERC-authorized limits are effective through October 31, 2013. In addition to borrowings from commercial banks, these companies are authorized under a FERC order to borrow from the Entergy System money pool. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ dependence on external short-term borrowings. Borrowings from the money pool and external borrowings combined may not exceed the FERC-authorized limits. The following are the FERC-authorized limits for short-term borrowings and the outstanding short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2011 (aggregating both money pool and external short-term borrowings) for the Registrant Subsidiaries: Authorized Borrowings (In Millions) Entergy Arkansas $250 - Entergy Gulf States Louisiana $200 - Entergy Louisiana $250 $168 Entergy Mississippi $175 $2 Entergy New Orleans $100 - Entergy Texas $200 - System Energy $200 - Variable Interest Entities (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy) See Note 18 to the financial statements for a discussion of the consolidation of the nuclear fuel company variable interest entities (VIE).

The VIE for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana does not issue commercial paper, but borrows directly on its bank credit facility. 104 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements The amount outstanding on the Entergy Gulf States Louisiana credit facility is included in long-term debt on its balance sheet and the commercial paper outstanding for the other VIEs is classified as a current liability on the respective balance sheets. The commitment fees on the credit facilities are 0.20% of the undrawn commitment amount. Each credit facility requires the respective lessee (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, or Entergy Corporation as Guarantor for System Energy) to maintain a consolidated debt ratio of 70% or less of its total capitalization. The variable interest entities had notes payable that are included in long-term debt on the respective balance sheets as of December 31, 2011 as follows: Company Description Amount Entergy Arkansas VIE 9% Series H due June 2013 $30 million Entergy Arkansas VIE 5.69% Series I due July 2014 $70 million Entergy Arkansas VIE 3.23% Series J due July 2016 $55 million Entergy Gulf States Louisiana VIE 5.56% Series N due May 2013 $75 million Entergy Gulf States Louisiana VIE 5.41% Series O due July 2012 $60 million Entergy Louisiana VIE 5.69% Series E due July 2014 $50 million Entergy Louisiana VIE 3.30% Series F due March 2016 $20 million System Energy VIE 6.29% Series F due September 2013 $70 million System Energy VIE 5.33% Series G due April 2015 $60 million In accordance with regulatory treatment, interest on the nuclear fuel company variable interest entities’ credit facilities, commercial paper, and long-term notes payable is included as fuel expense.

An equity unit consisted of (1) a note, initially due February 2011 and initially bearing interest at an annual rate of 5.75%, and (2) a purchase contract that obligated the holder of the equity unit to purchase for $50 between 0.5705 and 0.7074 shares of Entergy Corporation common stock on or before February 17, 2009. Entergy paid the holders quarterly contract adjustment payments of 1.875% per year on the stated amount of $50 per equity unit. Under the terms of the purchase contracts, Entergy attempted to remarket the notes in February 2009 but was unsuccessful, the note holders put the notes to Entergy, Entergy retired the notes, and Entergy issued shares of common stock to settle the purchase contracts. Entergy Corporation reissues treasury shares to meet the requirements of the Stock Plan for Outside Directors (Directors’ Plan), two Equity Ownership Plans of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries, the Equity Awards Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries, and certain other stock benefit plans. The Directors’ Plan awards to non-employee directors a portion of their compensation in the form of a fixed number of shares of Entergy Corporation common stock. In January 2007, the Board approved a repurchase program that authorized Entergy to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of its common stock. In January 2008, the Board authorized an incremental $500 million share repurchase program to enable Entergy to consider opportunistic purchases in response to equity market conditions. Entergy completed both the $1.5 billion and $500 million programs in the third quarter 2009. In October 2009, the Board granted authority for an additional $750 million share repurchase program which was completed in the fourth quarter 2010. In October 2010, the Board granted authority for an additional $500 million share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2011, $350 million remains under the $500 million share repurchase program. Retained Earnings and Dividend Restrictions Provisions within the articles of incorporation or pertinent indentures and various other agreements relating to the long-term debt and preferred stock of certain of Entergy Corporation’s subsidiaries could restrict the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on their common and preferred equity. As of December 31, 2011, under provisions in their mortgage indentures, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi had retained earnings 119 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements unavailable for distribution to Entergy Corporation of $394.9 million and $68.5 million, respectively. Entergy Corporation received dividend payments from subsidiaries totaling $595 million in 2011, $580 million in 2010, and $417 million in 2009.

NOTE 8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries are involved in a number of legal, regulatory, and tax proceedings before various courts, regulatory commissions, and governmental agencies in the ordinary course of business. While management is unable to predict the outcome of such proceedings, management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material effect on Entergy’s results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. Entergy discusses regulatory proceedings in Note 2 to the financial statements and discusses tax proceedings in Note 3 to the financial statements. Vidalia Purchased Power Agreement Entergy Louisiana has an agreement extending through the year 2031 to purchase energy generated by a hydroelectric facility known as the Vidalia project. Entergy Louisiana made payments under the contract of approximately $185.6 million in 2011, $216.5 million in 2010, and $204.9 million in 2009. If the maximum percentage (94%) of the energy is made available to Entergy Louisiana, current production projections would require estimated payments of approximately $172.1 million in 2012, and a total of $2.5 billion for the years 2013 through 2031. Entergy Louisiana currently recovers the costs of the purchased energy through its fuel adjustment clause. In an LPSC-approved settlement related to tax benefits from the tax treatment of the Vidalia contract, Entergy Louisiana agreed to credit rates by $11 million each year for up to ten years, beginning in October 2002. In addition, in accordance with an LPSC settlement, Entergy Louisiana credited rates in August 2007 by $11.3 million (including interest) as a result of a settlement with the IRS of the 2001 tax treatment of the Vidalia contract. As 120 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements discussed in more detail in Note 3 to the financial statements, in August 2011, Entergy agreed to a settlement with the IRS regarding the mark-to-market income tax treatment of various wholesale electric power purchase and sale agreements, including the Vidalia agreement. In October 2011, the LPSC approved a final settlement under which Entergy Louisiana agreed to share the remaining benefits of this tax accounting election by crediting customers an additional $20.235 million per year for 15 years beginning January 2012. Entergy Louisiana recorded a $199 million regulatory charge and a corresponding net-of-tax regulatory liability to reflect this obligation. The provisions of the settlement also provide that the LPSC shall not recognize or use Entergy Louisiana’s use of the cash benefits from the tax treatment in setting any of Entergy Louisiana’s rates. Therefore, to the extent Entergy Louisiana’s use of the proceeds would ordinarily have reduced its rate base, no change in rate base shall be reflected for ratemaking purposes. Nuclear Insurance Third Party Liability Insurance The Price-Anderson Act requires that reactor licensees purchase insurance and participate in a secondary insurance pool that provides insurance coverage for the public in the event of a nuclear power plant accident. The costs of this insurance are borne by the nuclear power industry. Congress amended and renewed the Price-Anderson Act in 2005 for a term through 2025. The Price-Anderson Act requires nuclear power plants to show evidence of financial protection in the event of a nuclear accident. This protection must consist of two layers of coverage: 1. The primary level is private insurance underwritten by American Nuclear Insurers (ANI) and provides public liability insurance coverage of $375 million. If this amount is not sufficient to cover claims arising from an accident, the second level, Secondary Financial Protection, applies. 2. Within the Secondary Financial Protection level, each nuclear reactor has a contingent obligation to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the primary level, regardless of proximity to the incident or fault, up to a maximum of $117.5 million per reactor per incident (Entergy’s maximum total contingent obligation per incident is $1.3 billion). This consists of a $111.9 million maximum retrospective premium plus a five percent surcharge, which equates to $117.5 million, that may be payable, if needed, at a rate that is currently set at $17.5 million per year per incident per nuclear power reactor. 3. In the event that one or more acts of terrorism cause a nuclear power plant accident, which results in third-party damages – off-site property and environmental damage, off-site bodily injury, and on-site third-party bodily injury (i.e. contractors); the primary level provided by ANI combined with the Secondary Financial Protection would provide $12.6 billion in coverage. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2007 created a government program that provides for up to $100 billion in coverage in excess of existing coverage for a terrorist event. Currently, 104 nuclear reactors are participating in the Secondary Financial Protection program. The product of the maximum retrospective premium assessment to the nuclear power industry and the number of nuclear power reactors provides over $12.2 billion in secondary layer insurance coverage to compensate the public in the event of a nuclear power reactor accident. The Price-Anderson Act provides that all potential liability for a nuclear accident is limited to the amounts of insurance coverage available under the primary and secondary layers. Entergy Arkansas has two licensed reactors and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy each have one licensed reactor (10% of Grand Gulf is owned by a non-affiliated company (SMEPA) that would share on a pro-rata basis in any retrospective premium assessment to System Energy under the Price-Anderson Act). The Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment includes the ownership and operation of six nuclear power reactors and the ownership of the shutdown Indian Point 1 reactor and Big Rock Point facility. 121 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Property Insurance Entergy’s nuclear owner/licensee subsidiaries are members of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a mutual insurance company that provides property damage coverage, including decontamination and premature decommissioning expense, to the members’ nuclear generating plants. Effective April 1, 2011, Entergy was insured against such losses per the following structures: Utility Plants (ANO 1 and 2, Grand Gulf, River Bend, and Waterford 3) · Primary Layer (per plant) - $500 million per occurrence · Excess Layer (per plant) - $750 million per occurrence · Blanket Layer (shared among the Utility plants) - $350 million per occurrence · Total limit - $1.6 billion per occurrence · Deductibles: · $2.5 million per occurrence - Turbine/generator damage · $2.5 million per occurrence - Other than turbine/generator damage · $10 million per occurrence plus 10% of amount above $10 million - Damage from a windstorm, flood, earthquake, or volcanic eruption Note: ANO 1 and 2 share in the primary and excess layers with common policies because the policies are issued on a per site basis. Entergy Wholesale Commodities Plants (Indian Point, FitzPatrick, Pilgrim, Vermont Yankee, Palisades, and Big Rock Point) · Primary Layer (per plant) - $500 million per occurrence · Excess Layer - $615 million per occurrence · Total limit - $1.115 billion per occurrence · Deductibles: · $2.5 million per occurrence - Turbine/generator damage · $2.5 million per occurrence - Other than turbine/generator damage · $10 million per occurrence plus 10% of amount above $10 million - Damage from a windstorm, flood, earthquake, or volcanic eruption Note: The Indian Point Units share in the primary and excess layers with common policies because the policies are issued on a per site basis. Big Rock Point has its own primary policy with no excess coverage. In addition, Waterford 3, Grand Gulf, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants are also covered under NEIL’s Accidental Outage Coverage program. This coverage provides certain fixed indemnities in the event of an unplanned outage that results from a covered NEIL property damage loss, subject to a deductible period. The following summarizes this coverage effective April 1, 2011: Waterford 3 · $2.95 million weekly indemnity · $413 million maximum indemnity · Deductible: 26 week deductible period Grand Gulf · $400,000 weekly indemnity (total for four policies) · $56 million maximum indemnity (total for four policies) · Deductible: 26 week deductible period 122 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Indian Point 2, Indian Point 3, and Palisades · $4.5 million weekly indemnity · $490 million maximum indemnity · Deductible: 12 week deductible period FitzPatrick and Pilgrim · $4.0 million weekly indemnity · $490 million maximum indemnity · Deductible: 12 week deductible period Vermont Yankee · $3.5 million weekly indemnity · $435 million maximum indemnity · Deductible: 12 week deductible period Under the property damage and accidental outage insurance programs, all NEIL insured plants could be subject to assessments should losses exceed the accumulated funds available from NEIL. Effective April 1, 2011, the maximum amounts of such possible assessments per occurrence were as follows: Assessments (In Millions) Utility: Entergy Arkansas $20.1 Entergy Gulf States Louisiana $16.3 Entergy Louisiana $19.3 Entergy Mississippi $0.07 Entergy New Orleans $0.07 Entergy Texas N/A System Energy $16.3 Entergy Wholesale Commodities $- Potential assessments for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants are covered by insurance obtained through NEIL’s reinsurers. Entergy maintains property insurance for its nuclear units in excess of the NRC’s minimum requirement of $1.06 billion per site for nuclear power plant licensees. NRC regulations provide that the proceeds of this insurance must be used, first, to render the reactor safe and stable, and second, to complete decontamination operations. Only after proceeds are dedicated for such use and regulatory approval is secured would any remaining proceeds be made available for the benefit of plant owners or their creditors. In the event that one or more acts of terrorism causes property damage under one or more or all nuclear insurance policies issued by NEIL (including, but not limited to, those described above) within 12 months from the date the first property damage occurs, the maximum recovery under all such nuclear insurance policies shall be an aggregate of $3.24 billion plus the additional amounts recovered for such losses from reinsurance, indemnity, and any other sources applicable to such losses. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2007 created a government program that provides for up to $100 billion in coverage in excess of existing coverage for a terrorist event. 123 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Conventional Property Insurance Entergy’s conventional property insurance program provides coverage of up to $400 million on an Entergy system-wide basis for all operational perils (direct physical loss or damage due to machinery breakdown, electrical failure, fire, lightning, hail, or explosion) on an “each and every loss” basis; up to $400 million in coverage for certain natural perils (direct physical loss or damage due to earthquake, tsunami, flood, ice storm, and tornado) on an annual aggregate basis; and up to $125 million for certain other natural perils (direct physical loss or damage due to a named windstorm or storm surge) on an annual aggregate basis. The conventional property insurance program provides up to $50 million in coverage for the Entergy New Orleans gas distribution system on an annual aggregate basis. The coverage is subject to a $20 million self-insured retention per occurrence for operational perils and a $35 million self-insured retention per occurrence for natural perils and for the Entergy New Orleans gas distribution system. Covered property generally includes power plants, substations, facilities, inventories, and gas distribution-related properties. Excluded property generally includes above-ground transmission and distribution lines, poles, and towers. The primary layer consists of a $65 million layer in excess of the self-insured retention and the excess layer consists of a $335 million layer in excess of the $65 million primary layer. Both layers are placed on a quota share basis through several insurers. This coverage is in place for Entergy Corporation, the Registrant Subsidiaries, and certain other Entergy subsidiaries, including the owners of the nuclear power plants in the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment. Entergy also, purchases $300 million in terrorism insurance coverage for its conventional property. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2007 created a government program that provides for up to $100 billion in coverage in excess of existing coverage for a terrorist event. In addition to the conventional property insurance program, Entergy has purchased additional coverage ($20 million per occurrence) for some of its non-regulated, non-generation assets. This policy serves to buy-down the $20 million deductible and is placed on a scheduled location basis. The applicable deductibles are $100,000 to $250,000, except for properties that are damaged by flooding and properties whose values are greater than $20 million; these properties have a $500,000 deductible. Gas System Rebuild Insurance Proceeds (Entergy New Orleans) Entergy New Orleans received insurance proceeds for future construction expenditures associated with rebuilding its gas system, and the October 2006 City Council resolution approving the settlement of Entergy New Orleans’s rate and storm-cost recovery filings requires Entergy New Orleans to record those proceeds in a designated sub-account of other deferred credits until the proceeds are spent on the rebuild project. This other deferred credit is shown as “Gas system rebuild insurance proceeds” on Entergy New Orleans’s balance sheet. Employment and Labor-related Proceedings The Registrant Subsidiaries and other Entergy subsidiaries are responding to various lawsuits in both state and federal courts and to other labor-related proceedings filed by current and former employees and third parties not selected for open positions. These actions include, but are not limited to, allegations of wrongful employment actions; wage disputes and other claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act or its state counterparts; claims of race, gender and disability discrimination; disputes arising under collective bargaining agreements; unfair labor practice proceedings and other administrative proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board; claims of retaliation; and claims for or regarding benefits under various Entergy Corporation sponsored plans. Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries are responding to these suits and proceedings and deny liability to the claimants. Management believes that loss exposure has been and will continue to be handled so that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not be material, in the aggregate, to the financial position, results of operation, or cash flows of Entergy or the Utility operating companies. 124 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Asbestos Litigation (Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) Numerous lawsuits have been filed in federal and state courts primarily in Texas and Louisiana, primarily by contractor employees who worked in the 1940-1980s timeframe, against Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, and to a lesser extent the other Utility operating companies, as premises owners of power plants, for damages caused by alleged exposure to asbestos. Many other defendants are named in these lawsuits as well. Currently, there are approximately 500 lawsuits involving approximately 5,000 claimants. Management believes that adequate provisions have been established to cover any exposure. Additionally, negotiations continue with insurers to recover reimbursements. Management believes that loss exposure has been and will continue to be handled so that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not be material, in the aggregate, to the financial position, results of operation, or cash flows of the Utility operating companies. Grand Gulf - Related Agreements Capital Funds Agreement (Entergy Corporation and System Energy) System Energy has entered into agreements with Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans whereby they are obligated to purchase their respective entitlements of capacity and energy from System Energy’s interest in Grand Gulf, and to make payments that, together with other available funds, are adequate to cover System Energy’s operating expenses. System Energy would have to secure funds from other sources, including Entergy Corporation’s obligations under the Capital Funds Agreement, to cover any shortfalls from payments received from Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans under these agreements. Unit Power Sales Agreement (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and System Energy) System Energy has agreed to sell all of its share of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans in accordance with specified percentages (Entergy Arkansas-36%, Entergy Louisiana-14%, Entergy Mississippi-33%, and Entergy New Orleans-17%) as ordered by the FERC. Charges under this agreement are paid in consideration for the purchasing companies’ respective entitlement to receive capacity and energy and are payable irrespective of the quantity of energy delivered. The agreement will remain in effect until terminated by the parties and the termination is approved by the FERC, most likely upon Grand Gulf’s retirement from service. Monthly obligations are based on actual capacity and energy costs. The average monthly payments for 2011 under the agreement are approximately $17.2 million for Entergy Arkansas, $6.9 million for Entergy Louisiana, $14.4 million for Entergy Mississippi, and $8.4 million for Entergy New Orleans. Availability Agreement (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and System Energy) Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans are individually obligated to make payments or subordinated advances to System Energy in accordance with stated percentages (Entergy Arkansas-17.1%, Entergy Louisiana-26.9%, Entergy Mississippi-31.3%, and Entergy New Orleans-24.7%) in amounts that, when added to amounts received under the Unit Power Sales Agreement or otherwise, are adequate to cover all of System Energy’s operating expenses as defined, including an amount sufficient to amortize the cost of Grand Gulf 2 over 27 years (See Reallocation Agreement terms below) and expenses incurred in connection with a permanent shutdown of Grand Gulf. System Energy has assigned its rights to payments and advances to certain creditors as security for certain obligations. Since commercial operation of Grand Gulf began, payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement have exceeded the amounts payable under the Availability Agreement. Accordingly, no payments under the Availability Agreement have ever been required. If Entergy Arkansas or Entergy Mississippi fails to make its Unit Power Sales Agreement payments, and System Energy is unable to obtain funds from other sources, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans could become subject to claims or demands by System Energy or its creditors for payments or advances under the Availability Agreement (or the assignments thereof) equal to the difference between their required Unit Power Sales Agreement payments and their required Availability Agreement payments. 125 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Reallocation Agreement (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and System Energy) System Energy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans entered into the Reallocation Agreement relating to the sale of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf and the related costs, in which Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans agreed to assume all of Entergy Arkansas’s responsibilities and obligations with respect to Grand Gulf under the Availability Agreement. FERC’s decision allocating a portion of Grand Gulf capacity and energy to Entergy Arkansas supersedes the Reallocation Agreement as it relates to Grand Gulf. Responsibility for any Grand Gulf 2 amortization amounts has been individually allocated (Entergy Louisiana-26.23%, Entergy Mississippi-43.97%, and Entergy New Orleans-29.80%) under the terms of the Reallocation Agreement. However, the Reallocation Agreement does not affect Entergy Arkansas’s obligation to System Energy’s lenders under the assignments referred to in the preceding paragraph. Entergy Arkansas would be liable for its share of such amounts if Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans were unable to meet their contractual obligations. No payments of any amortization amounts will be required so long as amounts paid to System Energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, including other funds available to System Energy, exceed amounts required under the Availability Agreement, which is expected to be the case for the foreseeable future. Reimbursement Agreement (System Energy) In December 1988, in two separate but substantially identical transactions, System Energy sold and leased back undivided ownership interests in Grand Gulf for the aggregate sum of $500 million. The interests represent approximately 11.5% of Grand Gulf. During the term of the leases, System Energy is required to maintain letters of credit for the equity investors to secure certain amounts payable to the equity investors under the transactions. Under the provisions of the reimbursement agreement relating to the letters of credit, System Energy has agreed to a number of covenants regarding the maintenance of certain capitalization and fixed charge coverage ratios. System Energy agreed, during the term of the reimbursement agreement, to maintain a ratio of debt to total liabilities and equity less than or equal to 70%. In addition, System Energy must maintain, with respect to each fiscal quarter during the term of the reimbursement agreement, a ratio of adjusted net income to interest expense of at least 1.50 times earnings. As of December 31, 2011, System Energy was in compliance with these covenants. NOTE 9. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) Accounting standards require the recording of liabilities for all legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the normal operation of those assets. For Entergy, substantially all of its asset retirement obligations consist of its liability for decommissioning its nuclear power plants. In addition, an insignificant amount of removal costs associated with non-nuclear power plants is also included in the decommissioning line item on the balance sheets. These liabilities are recorded at their fair values (which are the present values of the estimated future cash outflows) in the period in which they are incurred, with an accompanying addition to the recorded cost of the long-lived asset. The asset retirement obligation is accreted each year through a charge to expense, to reflect the time value of money for this present value obligation. The accretion will continue through the completion of the asset retirement activity. The amounts added to the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets will be depreciated over the useful lives of the assets. The application of accounting standards related to asset retirement obligations is earnings neutral to the rate-regulated business of the Registrant Subsidiaries. 126 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements In accordance with ratemaking treatment and as required by regulatory accounting standards, the depreciation provisions for the Registrant Subsidiaries include a component for removal costs that are not asset retirement obligations under accounting standards. In accordance with regulatory accounting principles, the Registrant Subsidiaries have recorded regulatory assets (liabilities) in the following amounts to reflect their estimates of the difference between estimated incurred removal costs and estimated removal costs recovered in rates: December 31, 2011 2010 (In Millions) Entergy Arkansas ($16.4) ($24.0) Entergy Gulf States Louisiana ($30.3) ($24.9) Entergy Louisiana ($62.6) ($52.9) Entergy Mississippi $48.5 $46.1 Entergy New Orleans $16.3 $15.4 Entergy Texas $4.5 $7.3 System Energy $11.8 $12.2 The cumulative decommissioning and retirement cost liabilities and expenses recorded in 2011 by Entergy were as follows: Liabilities as of December 31, 2010 Accretion Change in Cash Flow Estimate Spending Liabilities as of December 31, 2011 (In Millions) Utility: Entergy Arkansas $602.2 $38.0 $- $- $640.2 Entergy Gulf States Louisiana $339.9 $19.9 $- $- $359.8 Entergy Louisiana $321.2 $24.6 $- $- $345.8 Entergy Mississippi $5.4 $0.3 $- $- $5.7 Entergy New Orleans $3.4 $0.2 $- ($0.7) $2.9 Entergy Texas $3.6 $0.3 $- $- $3.9 System Energy $452.8 $31.5 ($38.9) $- $445.4 Entergy Wholesale Commodities $1,420.0 $115.6 ($34.1) ($8.6) $1,492.9 The cumulative decommissioning and retirement cost liabilities and expenses recorded in 2010 by Entergy were as follows: Liabilities as of December 31, 2009 Accretion Change in Cash Flow Estimate Spending Liabilities as of December 31, 2010 (In Millions) Utility: Entergy Arkansas $566.4 $35.8 $- $- $602.2 Entergy Gulf States Louisiana $321.2 $18.7 $- $- $339.9 Entergy Louisiana $298.2 $23.0 $- $- $321.2 Entergy Mississippi $5.1 $0.3 $- $- $5.4 Entergy New Orleans $3.2 $0.2 $- $- $3.4 Entergy Texas $3.4 $0.2 $- $- $3.6 System Energy $421.4 $31.4 $- $- $452.8 Entergy Wholesale Commodities $1,320.6 $107.6 $- ($8.2) $1,420.0 127 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Entergy periodically reviews and updates estimated decommissioning costs. The actual decommissioning costs may vary from the estimates because of regulatory requirements, changes in technology, and increased costs of labor, materials, and equipment. As described below, during 2011 Entergy updated decommissioning cost estimates for certain nuclear power plants. There were no updates to decommissioning cost estimates for 2010. In the first quarter of 2011, System Energy recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liability for Grand Gulf as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study. The revised estimate resulted in a $38.9 million reduction in its decommissioning liability, along with a corresponding reduction in the related regulatory asset. In the fourth quarter of 2011, Entergy Wholesale Commodities recorded a reduction of $34.1 million in the decommissioning cost liability for a plant as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study obtained to comply with a state regulatory requirement. The revised cost study resulted in a change in the undiscounted cash flows and a credit to decommissioning expense of $34.1 million ($21 million net-of-tax) was recorded, reflecting the excess of the reduction in the liability over the amount of undepreciated assets. For the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick plants purchased in 2000, NYPA retained the decommissioning trusts and the decommissioning liability. NYPA and Entergy subsidiaries executed decommissioning agreements, which specify their decommissioning obligations. NYPA has the right to require the Entergy subsidiaries to assume the decommissioning liability provided that it assigns the corresponding decommissioning trust, up to a specified level, to the Entergy subsidiaries. If the decommissioning liability is retained by NYPA, the Entergy subsidiaries will perform the decommissioning of the plants at a price equal to the lesser of a pre-specified level or the amount in the decommissioning trusts. Entergy recorded an asset, which is now $521.6 million as of December 31, 2011, representing its estimate of the present value of the difference between the stipulated contract amount for decommissioning the plants less the decommissioning cost estimated in an independent decommissioning cost study. The asset is increased by monthly accretion based on the applicable discount rate necessary to ultimately provide for the estimated future value of the decommissioning contract. The monthly accretion is recorded as interest income. Entergy maintains decommissioning trust funds that are committed to meeting the costs of decommissioning the nuclear power plants. The fair values of the decommissioning trust funds and the related asset retirement obligation regulatory assets of Entergy as of December 31, 2011 are as follows: Decommissioning Trust Fair Values Regulatory Asset (In Millions) Utility: ANO 1 and ANO 2 $541.7 $181.5 River Bend $420.9 $5.5 Waterford 3 $254.0 $116.1 Grand Gulf $423.4 $59.6 Entergy Wholesale Commodities $2,148.0 $- 128 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements The fair values of the decommissioning trust funds and the related asset retirement obligation regulatory assets of Entergy as of December 31, 2010 are as follows: Decommissioning Trust Fair Values Regulatory Asset (In Millions) Utility: ANO 1 and ANO 2 $520.8 $161.4 River Bend $393.6 $10.9 Waterford 3 $240.5 $104.2 Grand Gulf $387.9 $98.3 Entergy Wholesale Commodities $2,052.9 $- NOTE 10.

Railcar operating lease payments were $8.3 million in 2011, $8.4 million in 2010, and $7.2 million in 2009 for Entergy Arkansas and $2.0 million in 2011, $2.3 million in 2010, and $3.1 million in 2009 for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. Oil tank facilities lease payments for Entergy Mississippi were $3.4 million in 2011, $3.4 million in 2010, and $3.4 million in 2009. 130 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Sale and Leaseback Transactions Waterford 3 Lease Obligations In 1989, in three separate but substantially identical transactions, Entergy Louisiana sold and leased back undivided interests in Waterford 3 for the aggregate sum of $353.6 million. The interests represent approximately 9.3% of Waterford 3. The leases expire in 2017. Under certain circumstances, Entergy Louisiana may repurchase the leased interests prior to the end of the term of the leases. At the end of the lease terms, Entergy Louisiana has the option to repurchase the leased interests in Waterford 3 at fair market value or to renew the leases for either fair market value or, under certain conditions, a fixed rate. Entergy Louisiana issued $208.2 million of non-interest bearing first mortgage bonds as collateral for the equity portion of certain amounts payable under the leases. Upon the occurrence of certain events, Entergy Louisiana may be obligated to assume the outstanding bonds used to finance the purchase of the interests in the unit and to pay an amount sufficient to withdraw from the lease transaction. Such events include lease events of default, events of loss, deemed loss events, or certain adverse “Financial Events.” “Financial Events” include, among other things, failure by Entergy Louisiana, following the expiration of any applicable grace or cure period, to maintain (i) total equity capital (including preferred membership interests) at least equal to 30% of adjusted capitalization, or (ii) a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.50 computed on a rolling 12 month basis. As of December 31, 2011, Entergy Louisiana was in compliance with these provisions. As of December 31, 2011, Entergy Louisiana had future minimum lease payments (reflecting an overall implicit rate of 7.45%) in connection with the Waterford 3 sale and leaseback transactions, which are recorded as long-term debt, as follows: Amount (In Thousands) 2012 $39,067 2013 26,301 2014 31,036 2015 28,827 2016 16,938 Years thereafter 106,335 Total 248,504 Less: Amount representing interest 60,249 Present value of net minimum lease payments $188,255 Grand Gulf Lease Obligations In 1988, in two separate but substantially identical transactions, System Energy sold and leased back undivided ownership interests in Grand Gulf for the aggregate sum of $500 million. The interests represent approximately 11.5% of Grand Gulf. The leases expire in 2015. Under certain circumstances, System Entergy may repurchase the leased interests prior to the end of the term of the leases. At the end of the lease terms, System Energy has the option to repurchase the leased interests in Grand Gulf at fair market value or to renew the leases for either fair market value or, under certain conditions, a fixed rate. System Energy is required to report the sale-leaseback as a financing transaction in its financial statements. For financial reporting purposes, System Energy expenses the interest portion of the lease obligation and the plant depreciation. However, operating revenues include the recovery of the lease payments because the transactions are accounted for as a sale and leaseback for ratemaking purposes. Consistent with a recommendation contained in a 131 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements FERC audit report, System Energy initially recorded as a net regulatory asset the difference between the recovery of the lease payments and the amounts expensed for interest and depreciation and continues to record this difference as a regulatory asset or liability on an ongoing basis, resulting in a zero net balance for the regulatory asset at the end of the lease term. The amount was a net regulatory asset (liability) of ($2.0) million and $60.6 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, System Energy had future minimum lease payments (reflecting an implicit rate of 5.13%), which are recorded as long-term debt as follows: Amount (In Thousands) 2012 $49,959 2013 50,546 2014 51,637 2015 52,253 2016 - Years thereafter - Total 204,395 Less: Amount representing interest 25,611 Present value of net minimum lease payments $178,784 132 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements NOTE 11. RETIREMENT, OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, AND DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) Qualified Pension Plans Entergy has seven qualified pension plans covering substantially all employees: “Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan for Non-Bargaining Employees,” “Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan for Bargaining Employees,” “Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan II for Non-Bargaining Employees,” “Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan II for Bargaining Employees,” “Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan III,” “Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan IV for Non-Bargaining Employees,” and “Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan IV for Bargaining Employees.” The Registrant Subsidiaries participate in two of these plans: “Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan for Non-Bargaining Employees” and “Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan for Bargaining Employees.” Except for the Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan III, the pension plans are noncontributory and provide pension benefits that are based on employees’ credited service and compensation during the final years before retirement. The Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan III includes a mandatory employee contribution of 3% of earnings during the first 10 years of plan participation, and allows voluntary contributions from 1% to 10% of earnings for a limited group of employees. The assets of the seven qualified pension plans are held in a master trust established by Entergy. Each pension plan has an undivided beneficial interest in each of the investment accounts of the master trust that is maintained by a trustee. Use of the master trust permits the commingling of the trust assets of the pension plans of Entergy Corporation and its Registrant Subsidiaries for investment and administrative purposes. Although assets are commingled in the master trust, the trustee maintains supporting records for the purpose of allocating the equity in net earnings (loss) and the administrative expenses of the investment accounts to the various participating pension plans. The fair value of the trust assets is determined by the trustee and certain investment managers. The trustee calculates a daily earnings factor, including realized and unrealized gains or losses, collected and accrued income, and administrative expenses, and allocates earnings to each plan in the master trust on a pro rata basis. Further, within each pension plan, the record of each Registrant Subsidiary’s beneficial interest in the plan assets is maintained by the plan’s actuary and is updated quarterly. Assets for each Registrant Subsidiary are increased for investment income and contributions, and decreased for benefit payments. A plan’s investment net income/(loss) (i.e. interest and dividends, realized gains and losses and expenses) is allocated to the Registrant Subsidiaries participating in that plan based on the value of assets for each Registrant Subsidiary at the beginning of the quarter adjusted for contributions and benefit payments made during the quarter. Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries fund pension costs in accordance with contribution guidelines established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The assets of the plans include common and preferred stocks, fixed-income securities, interest in a money market fund, and insurance contracts. The Registrant Subsidiaries’ pension costs are recovered from customers as a component of cost of service in each of their respective jurisdictions. 133 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Components of Qualified Net Pension Cost and Other Amounts Recognized as a Regulatory Asset and/or Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries’ total 2011, 2010, and 2009 qualified pension costs and amounts recognized as a regulatory asset and/or other comprehensive income, including amounts capitalized, included the following components: 2011 2010 2009 (In Thousands) Net periodic pension cost: Service cost -

Substantially all employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach retirement age and meet certain eligibility requirements while still working for Entergy. Entergy uses a December 31 measurement date for its postretirement benefit plans. Effective January 1, 1993, Entergy adopted an accounting standard requiring a change from a cash method to an accrual method of accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions. At January 1, 1993, the actuarially determined accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) earned by retirees and active employees was estimated to be approximately $241.4 million for Entergy (other than the former Entergy Gulf States) and $128 million for the former Entergy Gulf States (now split into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas). Such obligations are being amortized over a 20-year period that began in 1993. For the most part, the Registrant Subsidiaries recover accrued other postretirement benefit costs from customers and are required to contribute the other postretirement benefits collected in rates to an external trust. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas have received regulatory approval to recover accrued other postretirement benefit costs through rates. Entergy Arkansas began recovery in 1998, pursuant to an APSC order. This order also allowed Entergy Arkansas to amortize a regulatory asset (representing the difference between other postretirement benefit costs and cash expenditures for other postretirement benefits incurred from 1993 through 1997) over a 15-year period that began in January 1998. The LPSC ordered Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana to continue the use of the pay-as-you-go method for ratemaking purposes for postretirement benefits other than pensions. However, the LPSC retains the flexibility to examine individual companies’ accounting for other postretirement benefits to determine if special exceptions to this order are warranted. Pursuant to regulatory directives, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy contribute the other postretirement benefit costs collected in rates into external trusts. System Energy is funding, on behalf of Entergy Operations, other postretirement benefits associated with Grand Gulf. Trust assets contributed by participating Registrant Subsidiaries are in three bank-administered trusts, established by Entergy Corporation and maintained by a trustee. Each participating Registrant Subsidiary holds a beneficial interest in the trusts’ assets. The assets in the master trusts are commingled for investment and administrative purposes. Although assets are commingled, the trustee maintains supporting records for the purpose of allocating the beneficial interest in net earnings/(losses) and the administrative expenses of the investment accounts to the various participating plans and participating Registrant Subsidiaries. Beneficial interest in an investment account’s net income/(loss) is comprised of interest and dividends, realized and unrealized gains and losses, and expenses. Beneficial interest from these investments is allocated monthly to the plans and participating Registrant Subsidiary based on their portion of net assets in the pooled accounts. 141 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Components of Net Other Postretirement Benefit Cost and Other Amounts Recognized as a Regulatory Asset and/or AOCI Entergy Corporation’s and its subsidiaries’ total 2011, 2010, and 2009 other postretirement benefit costs, including amounts capitalized and amounts recognized as a regulatory asset and/or other comprehensive income, included the following components: 2011 2010 2009 (In Thousands) Other post retirement costs: Service cost -

This is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation. Entergy uses a December 31 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement plans. Employers are to record previously unrecognized gains and losses, prior service costs, and any remaining transition asset or obligation (that resulted from adopting prior pension and other postretirement benefits accounting standards) as comprehensive income and/or as a regulatory asset reflective of the recovery mechanism for pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the Utility’s jurisdictions. For the portion of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana that is not regulated, the unrecognized prior service cost, gains and losses, and transition asset/obligation for its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are recorded as other comprehensive income. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana recover other postretirement benefit costs on a pay as you go basis and record the unrecognized prior service cost, gains and losses, and transition obligation for its other postretirement benefit obligation as other comprehensive income. Accounting standards also requires that changes in the funded status be recorded as other comprehensive income and/or a regulatory asset in the period in which the changes occur. 150 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements With regard to pension and other postretirement costs, Entergy calculates the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by multiplying the long term expected rate of return on assets by the market-related value (MRV) of plan assets. Entergy determines the MRV of pension plan assets by calculating a value that uses a 20-quarter phase-in of the difference between actual and expected returns. For other postretirement benefit plan assets Entergy uses fair value when determining MRV. Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Plans’ Assets The Plan Administrator’s trust asset investment strategy is to invest the assets in a manner whereby long term earnings on the assets (plus cash contributions) provide adequate funding for retiree benefit payments. The mix of assets is based on an optimization study that identifies asset allocation targets in order to achieve the maximum return for an acceptable level of risk, while minimizing the expected contributions and pension and postretirement expense. The Plan Administrator approved a new asset allocation and implementation of an optimization study in 2011 for the pension assets. The optimization study recommended that the target asset allocation adjust dynamically based on the funded status of the plan. The study identifies updated asset allocation targets to maximize return on the assets within a prudent level of risk, as mentioned above, and to maintain a level of volatility that is not expected to have material impact on Entergy’s expected contribution and expense. Entergy has begun to adjust its asset allocation, and those adjustments are reflected in the target and actual asset allocations listed below. Entergy also completed an optimization study in 2011 for the postretirement assets that identifies new asset allocation targets. Entergy plans to adjust to this asset allocation during 2012, and the target asset allocation will be 39% domestic equity securities, 26% international equity securities and 35% fixed income securities for all trusts, taxable and non-taxable. In the optimization studies, the Plan Administrator formulates assumptions about characteristics, such as expected asset class investment returns, volatility (risk), and correlation coefficients among the various asset classes. The future market assumptions used in the optimization study are determined by examining historical market characteristics of the various asset classes, and making adjustments to reflect future conditions expected to prevail over the study period. The following targets and ranges were established to produce an acceptable, economically efficient plan to manage around the targets. The target asset allocation range below for pension shows the ranges within which the allocation may adjust based on funded status, with the expectation that the allocation to fixed income securities will increase as the pension funded status increases. Entergy’s qualified pension and postretirement weighted-average asset allocations by asset category at December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the target asset allocation and ranges for those time periods are as follows: Pension Asset Allocation Target Range 2011 2010 Domestic Equity Securities 45% 34% to 53% 44% 44% International Equity Securities 20% 16% to 24% 18% 20% Fixed Income Securities 35% 31% to 41% 37% 35% Other 0% 0% to 10% 1% 1% Postretirement Asset Allocation Non-Taxable Taxable Target Range 2011 2010 Target Range 2011 2010 Domestic Equity Securities 38% 33% to 43% 39% 39% 35% 30% to 40% 35% 39% International Equity Securities 17% 12% to 22% 15% 18% 0% 0% 0% 0% Fixed Income Securities 45% 40% to 50% 46% 43% 65% 60% to 70% 64% 60% Other 0% 0% to 5% 0% 0% 0% 0% to 5% 1% 1% 151 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements In determining its expected long term rate of return on plan assets used in the calculation of benefit plan costs, Entergy reviews past performance, current and expected future asset allocations, and capital market assumptions of its investment consultant and investment managers. The expected long term rate of return for the qualified pension plans’ assets is based on the geometric average of the historical annual performance of a representative portfolio weighted by the target asset allocation defined in the table above. The time period reflected is a long dated period spanning several decades. The expected long term rate of return for the non-taxable postretirement trust assets is determined using the same methodology described above for pension assets, but the asset allocation specific to the non-taxable postretirement assets is used. For the taxable postretirement trust assets, the investment allocation includes a high percentage of tax-exempt fixed income securities. This asset allocation in combination with the same methodology employed to determine the expected return for other trust assets (as described above), with a modification to reflect applicable taxes, is used to produce the expected long-term rate of return for taxable postretirement trust assets. Entergy currently expects long term rates of return higher than last year’s expectation for both the non-taxable and taxable postretirement trusts because of the planned increases to their equity allocations in 2012. Concentrations of Credit Risk Entergy’s investment guidelines mandate the avoidance of risk concentrations. Types of concentrations specified to be avoided include, but are not limited to, investment concentrations in a single entity, type of industry, foreign country, geographic area and individual security issuance. As of December 31, 2011 all investment managers and assets were materially in compliance with the approved investment guidelines, therefore there were no significant concentrations (defined as greater than 10 percent of plan assets) of risk in Entergy’s pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets. Fair Value Measurements Accounting standards provide the framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: · Level 1 - Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Plan has the ability to access at the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. · Level 2 - Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are, either directly or indirectly, observable for the asset or liability at the measurement date. Assets are valued based on prices derived by an independent party that uses inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, and issuer spreads. Prices are reviewed and can be challenged with the independent parties and/or overridden if it is believed such would be more reflective of fair value. Level 2 inputs include the following: - quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; - quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets; - inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or - inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 152 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements If an asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. · Level 3 - Level 3 refers to securities valued based on significant unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following tables set forth by level within the fair value hierarchy a summary of the investments held for the qualified pension and other postretirement plans measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010.

The expected 2012 pension and other postretirement plan contributions of the Registrant Subsidiaries are shown below. The required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012, however Entergy’s preliminary estimates of 2012 funding requirements indicate that the contributions will not exceed historical levels of pension contributions. 157 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements The Registrant Subsidiaries expect to contribute approximately the following to the qualified pension and other postretirement plans in 2012: Entergy Arkansas Entergy Gulf States Louisiana Entergy Louisiana Entergy Mississippi Entergy New Orleans Entergy Texas System Energy (In Thousands) Pension Contributions $31,855 $10,765 $23,774 $8,400 $4,817 $7,653 $8,855 Other Postretirement Contributions $26,675 $8,288 $9,953 $5,469 $3,669 $5,153 $4,090 Actuarial Assumptions The significant actuarial assumptions used in determining the pension PBO and the other postretirement benefit APBO as of December 31, 2011, and 2010 were as follows: 2011 2010 Weighted-average discount rate: Qualified pension 5.10% - 5.20% 5.60% - 5.70% Other postretirement 5.10% 5.50% Non-qualified pension 4.40% 4.90% Weighted-average rate of increase in future compensation levels 4.23% 4.23% The significant actuarial assumptions used in determining the net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs for 2011, 2010, and 2009 were as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Weighted-average discount rate: Qualified pension 5.60% - 5.70% 6.10% - 6.30% 6.75% Other postretirement 5.50% 6.10% 6.70% Non-qualified pension 4.90% 5.40% 6.75% Weighted-average rate of increase in future compensation levels 4.23% 4.23% 4.23% Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets: Pension assets 8.50% 8.50% 8.50% Other postretirement non-taxable assets 7.75% 7.75% 8.50% Other postretirement taxable assets 5.50% 5.50% 6.00% Entergy’s other postretirement benefit transition obligations are being amortized over 20 years ending in 2012. The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring Entergy’s December 31, 2011 APBO was 7.75% for pre-65 retirees and 7.5% for post-65 retirees for 2012, gradually decreasing each successive year until it reaches 4.75% in 2022 and beyond for both pre-65 and post-65 retirees. The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring Entergy’s 2011 Net Other Postretirement Benefit Cost was 8.5% for pre-65 retirees and 8.0% for post-65 retirees for 2011, gradually decreasing each successive year until it reaches 4.75% in 2019 and beyond for pre-65 retirees and 4.75% in 2018 and beyond for post-65 retirees.

The System Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan covering eligible employees of Entergy and its subsidiaries. The employing Entergy subsidiary makes matching contributions for all non-bargaining and certain bargaining employees to the System Savings Plan in an amount equal to 70% of the participants’ basic contributions, up to 6% of their eligible earnings per pay period. The 70% match is allocated to investments as directed by the employee. Entergy also sponsors the Savings Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries IV (established in 2002), the Savings Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries VI (established in April 2007), and the Savings Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries VII (established in April 2007) to which matching contributions are also made. The plans are defined contribution plans that cover eligible employees, as defined by each plan, of Entergy and its subsidiaries. Effective June 3, 2010, employees participating in the Savings Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries II (Savings Plan II) were transferred into the System Savings Plan when Savings Plan II merged into the System Savings Plan. Entergy’s subsidiaries’ contributions to defined contribution plans collectively were $42.6 million in 2011, $41.8 million in 2010, and $41.9 million in 2009. The majority of the contributions were to the System Savings Plan. The Registrant Subsidiaries’ 2011, 2010, and 2009 contributions to defined contribution plans were as follows: Year Entergy Arkansas Entergy Gulf States Louisiana Entergy Louisiana Entergy Mississippi Entergy New Orleans Entergy Texas (In Thousands) 2011 $3,183 $1,804 $2,260 $1,894 $725 $1,613 2010 $3,177 $1,792 $2,289 $1,886 $683 $1,626 2009 $3,197 $1,828 $2,356 $1,906 $732 $1,712 160 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements NOTE 12. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (Entergy Corporation) Entergy grants stock options and long-term incentive and restricted liability awards to key employees of the Entergy subsidiaries under its Equity Ownership Plans which are shareholder-approved stock-based compensation plans. The Equity Ownership Plan, as restated in February 2003 (2003 Plan), had 722,251 authorized shares remaining for long-term incentive and restricted liability awards as of December 31, 2011. Effective January 1, 2007, Entergy’s shareholders approved the 2007 Equity Ownership and Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan (2007 Plan). The maximum aggregate number of common shares that can be issued from the 2007 Plan for stock-based awards is 7,000,000 with no more than 2,000,000 available for non-option grants. The 2007 Plan, which only applies to awards made on or after January 1, 2007, will expire after 10 years. As of December 31, 2011, there were 1,052,035 authorized shares remaining for stock-based awards, all of which are available for non-option grants. Effective May 6, 2011, Entergy’s shareholders approved the 2011 Equity Ownership and Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan (2011 Plan). The maximum number of common shares that can be issued from the 2011 Plan for stock-based awards is 5,500,000 with no more than 2,000,000 available for incentive stock option grants. The 2011 Plan, which only applies to awards made on or after May 6, 2011, will expire after 10 years. As of December 31, 2011, there were 5,495,276 authorized shares remaining for stock-based awards, including 2,000,000 for incentive stock option grants. Stock Options Stock options are granted at exercise prices that equal the closing market price of Entergy Corporation common stock on the date of grant. Generally, stock options granted will become exercisable in equal amounts on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant. Unless they are forfeited previously under the terms of the grant, options expire ten years after the date of the grant if they are not exercised. The following table includes financial information for stock options for each of the years presented: 2011 2010 2009 (In Millions) Compensation expense included in Entergy’s Consolidated Net Income $10.4 $15.0 $16.8 Tax benefit recognized in Entergy’s Consolidated Net Income $4.0 $5.8 $6.5 Compensation cost capitalized as part of fixed assets and inventory $2.0 $2.9 $3.2 Entergy determines the fair value of the stock option grants by considering factors such as lack of marketability, stock retention requirements, and regulatory restrictions on exercisability in accordance with accounting standards. The stock option weighted-average assumptions used in determining the fair values are as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Stock price volatility 24.25% 25.73% 24.39% Expected term in years 6.64 5.46 5.33 Risk-free interest rate 2.70% 2.57% 2.22% Dividend yield 4.20% 3.74% 3.50% Dividend payment per share $3.32 $3.24 $3.00 Stock price volatility is calculated based upon the weekly public stock price volatility of Entergy Corporation common stock over the last four to five years. The expected term of the options is based upon historical option exercises and the weighted average life of options when exercised and the estimated weighted average life of all vested but unexercised options. In 2008, Entergy implemented stock ownership guidelines for its senior executive officers. These 161 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements guidelines require an executive officer to own shares of Entergy common stock equal to a specified multiple of his or her salary. Until an executive officer achieves this ownership position the executive officer is required to retain 75% of the after-tax net profit upon exercise of the option to be held in Entergy Corporation common stock. The reduction in fair value of the stock options due to this restriction is based upon an estimate of the call option value of the reinvested gain discounted to present value over the applicable reinvestment period. A summary of stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2011 and changes during the year are presented below: Number of Options Weighted- Average Exercise Price Aggregate Intrinsic Value Weighted- Average Contractual Life Options outstanding as of January 1, 2011 11,225,725 $72.45 Options granted 388,200 $72.79 Options exercised (1,079,008) $42.43 Options forfeited/expired (75,499) $86.62 Options outstanding as of December 31, 2011 10,459,418 $75.46 $- 4.7 years Options exercisable as of December 31, 2011 9,011,257 $75.36 $- 4.1 years Weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during 2011 $11.48 The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the year was $13.18 for 2010 and $12.47 for 2009. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $29.6 million during 2011, $36.6 million during 2010, and $35.6 million during 2009. The intrinsic value, which has no effect on net income, of the stock options exercised is calculated by the difference in Entergy Corporation’s common stock price on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the stock options granted. Because Entergy’s year-end stock price is less than the weighted average exercise price, the aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2011 was zero. The intrinsic value of “in the money” stock options is $67 million as of December 31, 2011. Entergy recognizes compensation cost over the vesting period of the options based on their grant-date fair value. The total fair value of options that vested was approximately $16 million during 2011, $21 million during 2010, and $22 million during 2009.

Restricted Stock Awards In January 2011, the Board approved and Entergy granted 166,800 restricted stock awards under the 2007 Equity Ownership and Long-term Cash Incentive Plan. The grants were made effective as of January 27, 2011 and were valued at $72.79 per share, which was the closing price of Entergy’s common stock on that date. One-third of the restricted stock awards will vest upon each anniversary of the grant date and are expensed ratably over the three year vesting period. Shares of restricted stock have the same dividend and voting rights as other common stock and are considered issued and outstanding shares of Entergy upon vesting. The following table includes financial information for restricted stock for each of the years presented: 2011 2010 2009 (In Millions) Compensation expense included in Entergy’s Consolidated Net Income $3.9 $- $- Tax benefit recognized in Entergy’s Consolidated Net Income $1.5 $- $- Compensation cost capitalized as part of fixed assets and inventory $0.7 $- $- Long-Term Incentive Awards Entergy grants long-term incentive awards earned under its stock benefit plans in the form of performance units, which are equal to the cash value of shares of Entergy Corporation common stock at the end of the performance period, which is the last trading day of the year. Performance units will pay out to the extent that the performance conditions are satisfied. In addition to the potential for equivalent share appreciation or depreciation, performance units will earn the cash equivalent of the dividends paid during the three-year performance period applicable to each plan. The costs of incentive awards are charged to income over the three-year period. The following table includes financial information for the long-term incentive awards for each of the years presented: 2011 2010 2009 (In Millions) Fair value of long-term incentive awards as of December 31, $7.3 $10.1 $17.2 Compensation expense included in Entergy’s Consolidated Net Income for the year $0.7 ($0.9) $5.6 Tax benefit (expense) recognized in Entergy’s Consolidated Net Income for the year $0.3 ($0.4) $2.2 Compensation cost capitalized as part of fixed assets and inventory $0.1 $0.1 $1.0 Entergy paid $0.7 million in 2011 for awards earned under the Long-Term Incentive Plan. The distribution is applicable to the 2008 – 2010 performance period. Restricted Unit Awards Entergy grants restricted unit awards earned under its stock benefit plans in the form of stock units that are subject to time-based restrictions. The restricted units are equal to the cash value of shares of Entergy Corporation common stock at the time of vesting. The costs of restricted unit awards are charged to income over the restricted period, which varies from grant to grant. The average vesting period for restricted unit awards granted is 36 months. As of December 31, 2011, there were 138,965 unvested restricted units that are expected to vest over an average period of 10 months. 163 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements The following table includes financial information for restricted unit awards for each of the years presented: 2011 2010 2009 (In Millions) Fair value of restricted awards as of December 31, $6.6 $8.3 $4.6 Compensation expense included in Entergy’s Consolidated Net Income for the year $3.7 $3.9 $2.0 Tax benefit recognized in Entergy’s Consolidated Net Income for the year $1.4 $1.5 $0.8 Compensation cost capitalized as part of fixed assets and inventory $0.7 $0.9 $0.5 Entergy paid $5.9 million in 2011 for awards under the Restricted Units Awards Plan. NOTE 13. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) Entergy’s reportable segments as of December 31, 2011 are Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. Utility includes the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electric power in portions of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, and natural gas utility service in portions of Louisiana. Entergy Wholesale Commodities includes the ownership and operation of six nuclear power plants located in the northern United States and the sale of the electric power produced by those plants to wholesale customers. Entergy Wholesale Commodities also includes the ownership of interests in non-nuclear power plants that sell the electric power produced by those plants to wholesale customers. “All Other” includes the parent company, Entergy Corporation, and other business activity, including the earnings on the proceeds of sales of previously-owned businesses. Entergy’s segment financial information is as follows: 2011 Utility Entergy Wholesale Commodities* All Other Eliminations Consolidated (In Thousands) Operating revenues $8,841,827 $2,413,773 $4,157 ($30,684) $11,229,073 Deprec., amort. & decomm. $1,027,597 $260,638 $4,562 $- $1,292,797 Interest and investment income $158,737 $136,492 $28,830 ($194,925) $129,134 Interest expense $455,739 $20,634 $121,599 ($84,345) $513,627 Income taxes $27,311 $225,456 $33,496 $- $286,263 Consolidated net income (loss) $1,123,866 $491,841 ($137,755) ($110,580) $1,367,372 Total assets $32,734,549 $10,533,080 ($507,860) ($2,058,070) $40,701,699 Investment in affiliates - at equity $199 $44,677 $- $- $44,876 Cash paid for long-lived asset additions $2,351,913 $1,048,146 ($402) $- $3,399,657 164 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements 2010 Utility Entergy Wholesale Commodities* All Other Eliminations Consolidated (In Thousands) Operating revenues $8,941,332 $2,566,156 $7,442 ($27,353) $11,487,577 Deprec., amort. & decomm. $1,006,385 $270,658 $4,587 $- $1,281,630 Interest and investment income $182,493 $171,158 $44,757 ($212,953) $185,455 Interest expense $493,241 $71,817 $129,505 ($119,396) $575,167 Income taxes (benefits) $454,227 $268,649 ($105,637) $- $617,239 Consolidated net income $829,719 $489,422 $44,721 ($93,557) $1,270,305 Total assets $31,080,240 $10,102,817 ($714,968) ($1,782,813) $38,685,276 Investment in affiliates - at equity $199 $59,456 ($18,958) $- $40,697 Cash paid for long-lived asset additions $1,766,609 $687,313 $75 $- $2,453,997 2009 Utility Entergy Wholesale Commodities* All Other Eliminations Consolidated (In Thousands) Operating revenues $8,055,353 $2,711,078 $5,682 ($26,463) $10,745,650 Deprec., amort. & decomm. $1,025,922 $251,147 $4,769 $- $1,281,838 Interest and investment income (loss) $180,505 $196,492 ($10,470) ($129,899) $236,628 Interest expense $462,206 $78,278 $86,420 ($56,460) $570,444 Income taxes (benefits) $388,682 $322,255 ($78,197) $- $632,740 Consolidated net income (loss) $708,905 $641,094 ($25,511) ($73,438) $1,251,050 Total assets $29,892,088 $11,134,791 ($646,756) ($2,818,170) $37,561,953 Investment in affiliates - at equity $200 $- $39,380 $- $39,580 Cash paid for long-lived asset additions $1,872,997 $661,596 ($5,874) $- $2,528,719 Businesses marked with * are sometimes referred to as the “competitive businesses.” Eliminations are primarily intersegment activity. Almost all of Entergy’s goodwill is related to the Utility segment. On April 5, 2010, Entergy announced that, effective immediately, it planned to unwind the business infrastructure associated with its proposed plan to spin-off its non-utility nuclear business. As a result of the plan to unwind the business infrastructure, Entergy recorded expenses in the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment. Other operating and maintenance expense includes the write-off of $64 million of capital costs, primarily for software that will not be utilized. Interest charges include the write-off of $39 million of debt financing costs, primarily incurred for the $1.2 billion credit facility related to the planned spin-off of Entergy’s non-utility nuclear business that will not be used. Approximately $16 million of other costs were incurred in 2010 in connection with unwinding the planned non-utility nuclear spin-off transaction. Geographic Areas For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the amount of revenue Entergy derived from outside of the United States was insignificant. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, Entergy had no long-lived assets located outside of the United States. 165 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Registrant Subsidiaries Each of the Registrant Subsidiaries has one reportable segment, which is an integrated utility business, except for System Energy, which is an electricity generation business. Each of the Registrant Subsidiaries’ operations is managed on an integrated basis by that company because of the substantial effect of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight on the business process, cost structures, and operating results. NOTE 14. EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS (Entergy Corporation) As of December 31, 2011, Entergy owns investments in the following companies that it accounts for under the equity method of accounting: Investment Ownership Description Entergy-Koch 50% partnership interest Entergy-Koch was in the energy commodity marketing and trading business and gas transportation and storage business until the fourth quarter 2004 when these businesses were sold. RS Cogen LLC 50% member interest Co-generation project that produces power and steam on an industrial and merchant basis in the Lake Charles, Louisiana area. Top Deer 50% member interest Wind-powered electric generation joint venture. Following is a reconciliation of Entergy’s investments in equity affiliates: 2011 2010 2009 (In Thousands) Beginning of year $40,697 $39,580 $66,247 Loss from the investments (88) (2,469) (7,793) Dispositions and other adjustments 4,267 3,586 (18,874) End of year $44,876 $40,697 $39,580 Transactions with equity method investees Entergy Gulf States Louisiana purchased approximately $41.1 million, $50.8 million, and $49.3 million of electricity generated from Entergy’s share of RS Cogen in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Entergy’s operating transactions with its other equity method investees were not significant in 2011, 2010, or 2009. NOTE 15. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS (Entergy Corporation and Entergy Louisiana) Acquisitions Acadia In April 2011, Entergy Louisiana purchased Unit 2 of the Acadia Energy Center, a 580 MW generating unit located near Eunice, Louisiana, from an independent power producer. The Acadia Energy Center, which entered commercial service in 2002, consists of two combined-cycle gas-fired generating units, each nominally rated at 580 MW. Entergy Louisiana purchased 100 percent of Acadia Unit 2 and a 50 percent ownership interest in the facility’s 166 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements common assets for approximately $300 million. In a separate transaction, Cleco Power acquired Acadia Unit 1 and the other 50 percent interest in the facility’s common assets. Cleco Power will serve as operator for the entire facility. The FERC and the LPSC approved the transaction. Rhode Island State Energy Center In December 2011 a subsidiary in the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business segment purchased the Rhode Island State Energy Center, a 583 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle generating plant located in Johnston, Rhode Island, from a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources, for approximately $346 million. The Rhode Island State Energy Center began commercial operation in 2002. Palisades Purchased Power Agreement Entergy’s purchase of the Palisades plant in 2007 included a unit-contingent, 15-year purchased power agreement (PPA) with Consumers Energy for 100% of the plant’s output, excluding any future uprates. Prices under the PPA range from $43.50/MWh in 2007 to $61.50/MWh in 2022, and the average price under the PPA is $51/MWh. For the PPA, which was at below-market prices at the time of the acquisition, Entergy will amortize a liability to revenue over the life of the agreement. The amount that will be amortized each period is based upon the difference between the present value calculated at the date of acquisition of each year’s difference between revenue under the agreement and revenue based on estimated market prices. Amounts amortized to revenue were $43 million in 2011, $46 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. The amounts to be amortized to revenue for the next five years will be $17 million in 2012, $18 million for 2013, $16 million for 2014, $15 million for 2015, and $13 million for 2016. NYPA Value Sharing Agreements Entergy’s purchase of the FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3 plants from NYPA included value sharing agreements with NYPA. In October 2007, Entergy subsidiaries and NYPA amended and restated the value sharing agreements to clarify and amend certain provisions of the original terms. Under the amended value sharing agreements, Entergy subsidiaries will make annual payments to NYPA based on the generation output of the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick plants from January 2007 through December 2014. Entergy subsidiaries will pay NYPA $6.59 per MWh for power sold from Indian Point 3, up to an annual cap of $48 million, and $3.91 per MWh for power sold from FitzPatrick, up to an annual cap of $24 million. The annual payment for each year’s output is due by January 15 of the following year. Entergy will record the liability for payments to NYPA as power is generated and sold by Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick. An amount equal to the liability will be recorded to the plant asset account as contingent purchase price consideration for the plants. In 2011, 2010, and 2009, Entergy Wholesale Commodities recorded $72 million as plant for generation during each of those years. This amount will be depreciated over the expected remaining useful life of the plants. Dispositions Harrison County In the fourth quarter 2010, an Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiary sold its ownership interest in the Harrison County Power Project 550 MW combined-cycle plant to two Texas electric cooperatives that owned a minority share of the Marshall, Texas unit. Entergy sold its 61 percent share of the plant for $219 million and realized a gain of $44.2 million ($27.2 million net-of-tax) on the sale. 167 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements NOTE 16. RISK MANAGEMENT AND FAIR VALUES (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) Market and Commodity Risks In the normal course of business, Entergy is exposed to a number of market and commodity risks. Market risk is the potential loss that Entergy may incur as a result of changes in the market or fair value of a particular instrument or commodity. All financial and commodity-related instruments, including derivatives, are subject to market risk. Entergy is subject to a number of commodity and market risks, including: Type of Risk Affected Businesses Power price risk Utility, Entergy Wholesale Commodities Fuel price risk Utility, Entergy Wholesale Commodities Foreign currency exchange rate risk Entergy Wholesale Commodities Equity price and interest rate risk - investments Utility, Entergy Wholesale Commodities Entergy manages a portion of these risks using derivative instruments, some of which are classified as cash flow hedges due to their financial settlement provisions while others are classified as normal purchase/normal sales transactions due to their physical settlement provisions. Normal purchase/normal sale risk management tools include power purchase and sales agreements, fuel purchase agreements, capacity contracts, and tolling agreements. Financially-settled cash flow hedges can include natural gas and electricity futures, forwards, swaps, and options; and interest rate swaps. Entergy will occasionally enter into financially settled option contracts to manage market risk under certain hedging transactions which may or may not be designated as hedging instruments. Entergy enters into derivatives only to manage natural risks inherent in its physical or financial assets or liabilities. Entergy manages fuel price volatility for its Louisiana jurisdictions (Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans) and Entergy Mississippi primarily through the purchase of short-term natural gas swaps. These swaps are marked-to-market with offsetting regulatory assets or liabilities. The notional volumes of these swaps are based on a portion of projected annual exposure to gas for electric generation and projected winter purchases for gas distribution at Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans. Entergy’s exposure to market risk is determined by a number of factors, including the size, term, composition, and diversification of positions held, as well as market volatility and liquidity. For instruments such as options, the time period during which the option may be exercised and the relationship between the current market price of the underlying instrument and the option’s contractual strike or exercise price also affects the level of market risk. A significant factor influencing the overall level of market risk to which Entergy is exposed is its use of hedging techniques to mitigate such risk. Entergy manages market risk by actively monitoring compliance with stated risk management policies as well as monitoring the effectiveness of its hedging policies and strategies. Entergy’s risk management policies limit the amount of total net exposure and rolling net exposure during the stated periods. These policies, including related risk limits, are regularly assessed to ensure their appropriateness given Entergy’s objectives. 168 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Derivatives The fair values of Entergy’s derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2011 are as follows: Instrument Balance Sheet Location Fair Value (a) Offset (a) Business Derivatives designated as hedging instruments Assets: Electricity forwards, swaps and options Prepayments and other (current portion) $197 million ($25) million Entergy Wholesale Commodities Electricity forwards, swaps and options Other deferred debits and other assets (non-current portion) $112 million ($1) million Entergy Wholesale Commodities Liabilities: Electricity forwards, swaps and options Other current liabilities (current portion) $- ($-) Entergy Wholesale Commodities Electricity forwards, swaps and options Other non-current liabilities (non-current portion) $1 million ($1) million Entergy Wholesale Commodities Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments Assets: Electricity forwards, swaps and options Prepayments and other (current portion) $37 million ($8) million Entergy Wholesale Commodities Electricity forwards, swaps and options Other deferred debits and other assets (non-current portion) $- ($-) Entergy Wholesale Commodities Liabilities: Electricity forwards, swaps and options Other current liabilities (current portion) $33 million ($33) million Entergy Wholesale Commodities Electricity forwards, swaps and options Other non-current liabilities (non-current portion) $- ($-) Entergy Wholesale Commodities Natural gas swaps Other current liabilities $30 million ($-) Utility 169 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements The fair values of Entergy’s derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010 are as follows: Instrument Balance Sheet Location Fair Value (a) Offset (a) Business Derivatives designated as hedging instruments Assets: Electricity forwards, swaps and options Prepayments and other (current portion) $160 million ($7) million Entergy Wholesale Commodities Electricity forwards, swaps and options Other deferred debits and other assets (non-current portion) $82 million ($29) million Entergy Wholesale Commodities Liabilities: Electricity forwards, swaps and options Other current liabilities (current portion) $5 million ($5) million Entergy Wholesale Commodities Electricity forwards, swaps and options Other non-current liabilities (non-current portion) $47 million ($30) million Entergy Wholesale Commodities Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments Assets: Electricity forwards, swaps and options Prepayments and other (current portion) $2 million ($-) Entergy Wholesale Commodities Electricity forwards, swaps and options Other deferred debits and other assets (non-current portion) $14 million ($8) million Entergy Wholesale Commodities Liabilities: Electricity forwards, swaps and options Other current liabilities (current portion) $2 million ($2) million Entergy Wholesale Commodities Electricity forwards, swaps and options Other non-current liabilities (non-current portion) $7 million ($7) million Entergy Wholesale Commodities Natural gas swaps Other current liabilities $2 million ($-) Utility (a) The balances of derivative assets and liabilities in these tables are presented gross. Certain investments, including those not designated as hedging instruments, are subject to master netting agreements and are presented on the Entergy Consolidated Balance Sheets on a net basis in accordance with accounting guidance for Derivatives and Hedging. 170 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements The effect of Entergy’s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges on the consolidated income statements for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 is as follows: Instrument Amount of gain recognized in AOCI (effective portion) Income Statement location Amount of gain reclassified from accumulated OCI into income (effective portion) 2011 Electricity forwards, swaps and options $296 million Competitive businesses operating revenues $168 million 2010 Electricity forwards, swaps and options $206 million Competitive businesses operating revenues $220 million 2009 Electricity forwards, swaps, and options $315 million Competitive businesses operating revenues $322 million Electricity over-the-counter instruments that financially settle against day-ahead power pool prices are used to manage price exposure for Entergy Wholesale Commodities generation. Based on market prices as of December 31, 2011, cash flow hedges relating to power sales totaled $310 million of net unrealized gains. Approximately $197 million is expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) to operating revenues in the next twelve months. The actual amount reclassified from accumulated OCI, however, could vary due to future changes in market prices. Gains totaling approximately $168 million, $220 million, and $322 million were realized on the maturity of cash flow hedges, before taxes of $59 million, $77 million, and $113 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Unrealized gains or losses recorded in OCI result from hedging power output at the Entergy Wholesale Commodities power plants. The related gains or losses from hedging power are included in operating revenues when realized. The maximum length of time over which Entergy is currently hedging the variability in future cash flows with derivatives for forecasted power transactions at December 31, 2011 is approximately three years. Planned generation currently sold forward from Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants is 88% for 2012 of which approximately 47% is sold under financial derivatives and the remainder under normal purchase/sale contracts. The change in the value of Entergy’s cash flow hedges due to ineffectiveness was $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and was insignificant for the year ended December 31, 2010. The ineffective portion of cash flow hedges is recorded in competitive business operating revenues. Certain agreements to sell the power produced by Entergy Wholesale Commodities power plants contain provisions that require an Entergy subsidiary to provide collateral to secure its obligations when the current market prices exceed the contracted power prices. The primary form of collateral to satisfy these requirements is an Entergy Corporation guaranty. As of December 31, 2011, there were no hedge contracts with counterparties in a liability position. Entergy may effectively liquidate a cash flow hedge instrument by entering into a contract offsetting the original hedge, and then de-designating the original hedge. In this situation, gains or losses accumulated in OCI prior to de-designation continue to be deferred in OCI until they are included in income as the original hedged transaction occurs. From the point of de-designation, the gains or losses on the original hedge and the offsetting contract are recorded as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and offset as they flow through to earnings. Natural gas over-the-counter swaps that financially settle against NYMEX futures are used to manage fuel price volatility for the Utility’s Louisiana and Mississippi customers. All benefits or costs of the program are recorded in fuel costs. The total volume of natural gas swaps outstanding as of December 31, 2011 is 37,980,000 MMBtu for Entergy, 10,890,000 MMBtu for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, 15,730,000 MMBtu for Entergy Louisiana, 171 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements 10,360,000 MMBtu for Entergy Mississippi, and 1,000,000 MMBtu for Entergy New Orleans. Credit support for these natural gas swaps is covered by master agreements that do not require collateralization based on mark-to-market value, but do carry adequate assurance language that may lead to collateralization requests. The effect of Entergy’s derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated income statements for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 is as follows: Instrument Amount of gain recognized in AOCI Income Statement location Amount of gain (loss) recorded in income 2011 Natural gas swaps $ - Fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale ($62) million Electricity forwards, swaps and options de-designated as hedged items $1 million Competitive business operating revenues $11 million 2010 Natural gas swaps $ - Fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale ($95) million Electricity forwards, swaps and options de-designated as hedged items $15 million Competitive business operating revenues $ - 2009 Natural gas swaps $ - Fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale ($160) million Due to regulatory treatment, the natural gas swaps are marked to market through fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale and then such amounts are simultaneously reversed and recorded as an offsetting regulatory asset or liability. The gains or losses recorded as fuel expenses when the swaps are settled are recovered or refunded through fuel cost recovery mechanisms. 172 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements The fair values of the Registrant Subsidiaries’ derivative instruments on their balance sheets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows: Instrument Balance Sheet Location Fair Value Registrant Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments 2011 Liabilities: Natural gas swaps Gas hedge contracts $8.6 million Entergy Gulf States Louisiana Natural gas swaps Gas hedge contracts $12.4 million Entergy Louisiana Natural gas swaps Other current liabilities $7.8 million Entergy Mississippi Natural gas swaps Other current liabilities $1.5 million Entergy New Orleans 2010 Assets: Natural gas swaps Prepayments and other $0.3 million Entergy Mississippi Liabilities: Natural gas swaps Gas hedge contracts $1.0 million Entergy Gulf States Louisiana Natural gas swaps Gas hedge contracts $0.4 million Entergy Louisiana Natural gas swaps Other current liabilities $0.5 million Entergy New Orleans The effects of the Registrant Subsidiaries’ derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on their statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 are as follows: Instrument Statement of Income Location Amount of loss recorded in income Registrant 2011 Natural gas swaps Fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale ($17.9) million Entergy Gulf States Louisiana Natural gas swaps Fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale ($25.6) million Entergy Louisiana Natural gas swaps Fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale ($15.0) million Entergy Mississippi Natural gas swaps Fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale ($3.2) million Entergy New Orleans 2010 Natural gas swaps Fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale ($25.0) million Entergy Gulf States Louisiana Natural gas swaps Fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale ($40.5) million Entergy Louisiana Natural gas swaps Fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale ($27.5) million Entergy Mississippi Natural gas swaps Fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale ($1.7) million Entergy New Orleans 173 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Instrument Statement of Income Location Amount of loss recorded in income Registrant 2009 Natural gas swaps Fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale ($42.0) million Entergy Gulf States Louisiana Natural gas swaps Fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale ($66.4) million Entergy Louisiana Natural gas swaps Fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale ($40.7) million Entergy Mississippi Natural gas swaps Fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale ($10.5) million Entergy New Orleans Fair Values The estimated fair values of Entergy’s financial instruments and derivatives are determined using bid prices, market quotes, and financial modeling. Considerable judgment is required in developing the estimates of fair value. Therefore, estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that Entergy could realize in a current market exchange. Gains or losses realized on financial instruments other than forward energy contracts held by competitive businesses are reflected in future rates and therefore do not accrue to the benefit or detriment of shareholders. Entergy considers the carrying amounts of most financial instruments classified as current assets and liabilities to be a reasonable estimate of their fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. Accounting standards define fair value as an exit price, or the price that would be received to sell an asset or the amount that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable market participants at the date of measurement. Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries use assumptions or market input data that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities at fair value. The inputs can be readily observable, corroborated by market data, or generally unobservable. Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries endeavor to use the best available information to determine fair value. Accounting standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy establishes the highest priority for unadjusted market quotes in an active market for the identical asset or liability and the lowest priority for unobservable inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are: · Level 1 - Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of individually owned common stocks, cash equivalents, debt instruments, and gas hedge contracts. · Level 2 - Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are, either directly or indirectly, observable for the asset or liability at the measurement date. Assets are valued based on prices derived by independent third parties that use inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, and issuer spreads. Prices are reviewed and can be challenged with the independent parties and/or overridden by Entergy if it is believed such would be more reflective of fair value. Level 2 inputs include the following: - quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; - quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets; - inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or - inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 174 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Level 2 consists primarily of individually owned debt instruments or shares in common trusts. Common trust funds are stated at estimated fair value based on the fair market value of the underlying investments. · Level 3 - Level 3 inputs are pricing inputs that are generally less observable or unobservable from objective sources. These inputs are used with internally developed methodologies to produce management’s best estimate of fair value for the asset or liability. Level 3 consists primarily of derivative power contracts used as cash flow hedges of power sales at merchant power plants. The values for the cash flow hedges that are recorded as derivative contract assets or liabilities are based on both observable inputs including public market prices and unobservable inputs such as model-generated prices for longer-term markets and are classified as Level 3 assets and liabilities. The amounts reflected as the fair value of derivative assets or liabilities are based on the estimated amount that the contracts are in-the-money at the balance sheet date (treated as an asset) or out-of-the-money at the balance sheet date (treated as a liability) and would equal the estimated amount receivable or payable by Entergy if the contracts were settled at that date. These derivative contracts include cash flow hedges that swap fixed for floating cash flows for sales of the output from Entergy’s Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. The fair values are based on the mark-to-market comparison between the fixed contract prices and the floating prices determined each period from quoted forward power market prices and estimates regarding the costs associated with the transportation of the power from the plants’ bus bar to the contract’s point of delivery, generally a power market hub, for the period thereafter. The differences between the fixed price in the swap contract and these market-related prices multiplied by the volume specified in the contract and discounted at the counterparties’ credit adjusted risk free rate are recorded as derivative contract assets or liabilities. As of December 31, 2011, Entergy had in-the-money derivative contracts with a fair value of $312 million with counterparties or their guarantor who are all currently investment grade. As of December 31, 2011 there are no out-of-the-money contracts supported by corporate guarantees, which would require additional cash or letters of credit in the event of a decrease in Entergy Corporation’s credit rating to below investment grade. The following tables set forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, Entergy’s assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to a fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. 2011 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total (In Millions) Assets: Temporary cash investments $613 $- $- $613 Decommissioning trust funds (a): Equity securities 397 1,732 - 2,129 Debt securities 639 1,020 - 1,659 Power contracts - - 312 312 Securitization recovery trust account 50 - - 50 Storm reserve escrow account 335 - - 335 $2,034 $2,752 $312 $5,098 Liabilities: Gas hedge contracts $30 $- $- $30 175 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements 2010 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total (In Millions) Assets: Temporary cash investments $1,218 $- $- $1,218 Decommissioning trust funds (a): Equity securities 387 1,689 - 2,076 Debt securities 497 1,023 - 1,520 Power contracts - - 214 214 Securitization recovery trust account 43 - - 43 Storm reserve escrow account 329 - - 329 $2,474 $2,712 $214 $5,400 Liabilities: Power contracts $- $- $17 $17 Gas hedge contracts 2 - - 2 $2 $- $17 $19 (a) The decommissioning trust funds hold equity and fixed income securities.

DECOMMISSIONING TRUST FUNDS (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy) Entergy holds debt and equity securities, classified as available-for-sale, in nuclear decommissioning trust accounts. The NRC requires Entergy subsidiaries to maintain trusts to fund the costs of decommissioning ANO 1, ANO 2, River Bend, Waterford 3, Grand Gulf, Pilgrim, Indian Point 1 and 2, Vermont Yankee, and Palisades (NYPA currently retains the decommissioning trusts and liabilities for Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick). The funds are invested primarily in equity securities; fixed-rate, fixed-income securities; and cash and cash equivalents. Entergy records decommissioning trust funds on the balance sheet at their fair value. Because of the ability of the Registrant Subsidiaries to recover decommissioning costs in rates and in accordance with the regulatory treatment for decommissioning trust funds, the Registrant Subsidiaries have recorded an offsetting amount of unrealized gains/(losses) on investment securities in other regulatory liabilities/assets. For the nonregulated portion of River Bend, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has recorded an offsetting amount of unrealized gains/(losses) in other deferred credits. Decommissioning trust funds for Pilgrim, Indian Point 2, Vermont Yankee, and Palisades do not meet the criteria for regulatory accounting treatment. Accordingly, unrealized gains recorded on the assets in these trust funds are recognized in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders’ equity because these assets are classified as available for sale. Unrealized losses (where cost exceeds fair market value) on the assets in these trust funds are also recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders’ equity unless the unrealized loss is other than temporary and therefore recorded in earnings. Generally, Entergy records realized gains and losses on its debt and equity securities using the specific identification method to determine the cost basis of its securities. 180 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements The securities held as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 are summarized as follows: Fair Value Total Unrealized Gains Total Unrealized Losses (In Millions) 2011 Equity Securities $2,129 $423 $14 Debt Securities 1,659 115 5 Total $3,788 $538 $19 2010 Equity Securities $2,076 $436 $9 Debt Securities 1,520 67 12 Total $3,596 $503 $21 Deferred taxes on unrealized gains/(losses) are recorded in other comprehensive income for the decommissioning trusts which do not meet the criteria for regulatory accounting treatment as described above.

During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, gross gains of $2.7 million, $4.4 million, and $4.4 million, respectively, and gross losses of $1.2 million, $0.6 million, and $6.5 million, respectively, were recorded in earnings. Other-than-temporary impairments and unrealized gains and losses Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy evaluate unrealized losses at the end of each period to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. The assessment of whether an investment in a debt security has suffered an other-than-temporary impairment is based on whether Entergy has the intent to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized costs. Further, if Entergy does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security, an other-than-temporary impairment is considered to have occurred and it is measured by the present value of cash flows expected to be collected less the amortized cost basis (credit loss). For debt securities held as of January 1, 2009 for which an other-than-temporary impairment had previously been recognized but for which assessment under the new guidance indicates this impairment is temporary, Entergy recorded an adjustment to its opening balance of retained earnings of $11.3 million ($6.4 million net-of-tax). Entergy did not have any material other-than-temporary impairments relating to credit losses on debt securities for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. The assessment of whether an investment in an equity security has suffered an other-than-temporary impairment continues to be based on a number of factors including, first, whether Entergy has the ability and intent to hold the investment to recover its value, the duration and severity of any losses, and, then, whether it is expected that the investment will recover its value within a reasonable period of time. Entergy’s trusts are managed by third parties who operate in accordance with agreements that define investment guidelines and place restrictions on the purchases and sales of investments. Entergy recorded charges to other income of $0.1 million in 2011, $1 million in 2010, and $86 million in 2009, resulting from the recognition of the other-than-temporary impairment of certain equity securities held in its decommissioning trust funds. 188 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements NOTE 18. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) Under applicable authoritative accounting guidance, a variable interest entity (VIE) is an entity that conducts a business or holds property that possesses any of the following characteristics: an insufficient amount of equity at risk to finance its activities, equity owners who do not have the power to direct the significant activities of the entity (or have voting rights that are disproportionate to their ownership interest), or where equity holders do not receive expected losses or returns. An entity may have an interest in a VIE through ownership or other contractual rights or obligations, and is required to consolidate a VIE if it is the VIE’s primary beneficiary. The FASB issued authoritative accounting guidance that became effective in the first quarter 2010 that revised the manner in which entities evaluate whether consolidation is required for VIEs. Under the revised guidance, the primary beneficiary of a VIE is the entity that has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance, and has the obligation to absorb losses or has the right to residual returns that would potentially be significant to the entity. In conjunction with the adoption of the new guidance, Entergy updated reviews of its contracts and arrangements to determine whether Entergy is the primary beneficiary of a VIE based on the revisions to the previous consolidation model and other provisions of this standard. Based on this review Entergy determined that Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy should consolidate the respective companies from which they lease nuclear fuel, usually in a sale and leaseback transaction. This determination is because Entergy directs the nuclear fuel companies with respect to nuclear fuel purchases, assists the nuclear fuel companies in obtaining financing, and, if financing cannot be arranged, the lessee (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, or System Energy) is responsible to repurchase nuclear fuel to allow the nuclear fuel company (the VIE) to meet its obligations. Under the previous guidance, the determination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE was based on ownership interests and the risks and rewards in the entity attributable to the variable interest holders. Therefore, the Entergy companies did not previously consolidate the nuclear fuel companies. Because Entergy has historically accounted for the leases with the nuclear fuel companies as capital lease obligations, the effect of consolidating the nuclear fuel companies did not materially affect Entergy’s financial statements. During the term of the arrangements, none of the Entergy operating companies have been required to provide financial support apart from their scheduled lease payments. See Note 4 to the financial statements for details of the nuclear fuel companies’ credit facility and commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt that are reported by Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy. These amounts also represent Entergy’s and the respective Registrant Subsidiary’s maximum exposure to losses associated with their respective interests in the nuclear fuel companies. Entergy Texas determined that Entergy Gulf States Reconstruction Funding I, LLC, and Entergy Texas Restoration Funding, LLC, companies wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy Texas, are variable interest entities and that Entergy Texas is the primary beneficiary. In June 2007, Entergy Gulf States Reconstruction Funding issued senior secured transition bonds (securitization bonds) to finance Entergy Texas’s Hurricane Rita reconstruction costs. In November 2009, Entergy Texas Restoration Funding issued senior secured transition bonds (securitization bonds) to finance Entergy Texas’s Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav restoration costs. With the proceeds, the variable interest entities purchased from Entergy Texas the transition property, which is the right to recover from customers through a transition charge amounts sufficient to service the securitization bonds. The transition property is reflected as a regulatory asset on the consolidated Entergy Texas balance sheet. The creditors of Entergy Texas do not have recourse to the assets or revenues of the variable interest entities, including the transition property, and the creditors of the variable interest entities do not have recourse to the assets or revenues of Entergy Texas. Entergy Texas has no payment obligations to the variable interest entities except to remit transition charge collections. See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional details regarding the securitization bonds. Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding, LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy Arkansas, is a variable interest entity and Entergy Arkansas is the primary beneficiary. In August 2010, Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding issued storm cost recovery bonds to finance Entergy Arkansas’s January 2009 ice storm damage restoration costs. With the proceeds, Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding purchased from Entergy 189 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements Arkansas the storm recovery property, which is the right to recover from customers through a storm recovery charge amounts sufficient to service the securitization bonds. The storm recovery property is reflected as a regulatory asset on the consolidated Entergy Arkansas balance sheet. The creditors of Entergy Arkansas do not have recourse to the assets or revenues of Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding, including the storm recovery property, and the creditors of Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding do not have recourse to the assets or revenues of Entergy Arkansas. Entergy Arkansas has no payment obligations to Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding except to remit storm recovery charge collections. See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional details regarding the storm cost recovery bonds. Entergy Louisiana Investment Recovery Funding I, L.L.C., a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy Louisiana, is a variable interest entity and Entergy Louisiana is the primary beneficiary. In September 2011, Entergy Louisiana Investment Recovery Funding issued investment recovery bonds to recover Entergy Louisiana’s investment recovery costs associated with the cancelled Little Gypsy repowering project. With the proceeds, Entergy Louisiana Investment Recovery Funding purchased from Entergy Louisiana the investment recovery property, which is the right to recover from customers through an investment recovery charge amounts sufficient to service the bonds. The investment recovery property is reflected as a regulatory asset on the consolidated Entergy Louisiana balance sheet. The creditors of Entergy Louisiana do not have recourse to the assets or revenues of Entergy Louisiana Investment Recovery Funding, including the investment recovery property, and the creditors of Entergy Louisiana Investment Recovery Funding do not have recourse to the assets or revenues of Entergy Louisiana. Entergy Louisiana has no payment obligations to Entergy Louisiana Investment Recovery Funding except to remit investment recovery charge collections. See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional details regarding the investment recovery bonds. Entergy Louisiana and System Energy are also considered to each hold a variable interest in the lessors from which they lease undivided interests representing approximately 9.3% of the Waterford 3 and 11.5% of the Grand Gulf nuclear plants, respectively. Entergy Louisiana and System Energy are the lessees under these arrangements, which are described in more detail in Note 10 to the financial statements. Entergy Louisiana made payments on its lease, including interest, of $50.4 million in 2011, $35.1 million in 2010, and $32.5 million in 2009. System Energy made payments on its lease, including interest, of $49.4 million in 2011, $48.6 million in 2010, and $47.8 million in 2009. The lessors are banks acting in the capacity of owner trustee for the benefit of equity investors in the transactions pursuant to trust agreements entered solely for the purpose of facilitating the lease transactions. It is possible that Entergy Louisiana and System Energy may be considered as the primary beneficiary of the lessors, but Entergy is unable to apply the revised authoritative accounting guidance with respect to these VIEs because the lessors are not required to, and could not, provide the necessary financial information to consolidate the lessors. Because Entergy accounts for these leasing arrangements as capital financings, however, Entergy believes that consolidating the lessors would not materially affect the financial statements. In the unlikely event of default under a lease, remedies available to the lessor include payment by the lessee of the fair value of the undivided interest in the plant, payment of the present value of the basic rent payments, or payment of a predetermined casualty value. Entergy believes, however, that the obligations recorded on the balance sheets materially represent each company’s potential exposure to loss. Entergy has also reviewed various lease arrangements, power purchase agreements, and other agreements in which it holds a variable interest. In these cases, Entergy has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the related VIE because it does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance, or it does not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to residual returns that would potentially be significant to the entity, or both. 190 Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Notes to Financial Statements NOTE 19.

Entergy owns and operates power plants with approximately 30,000 MW of aggregate electric generating capacity, including over 10,000 MW of nuclear-fueled capacity. Entergy’s Utility business delivers electricity to 2.8 million utility customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Entergy generated annual revenues of $11.2 billion in 2011 and had approximately 15,000 employees as of December 31, 2011. Entergy operates primarily through two business segments: Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. · The Utility business segment includes the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electric power in portions of Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas, and Louisiana, including the City of New Orleans; and operates a small natural gas distribution business. As discussed in more detail in “Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis in December 2011, Entergy entered into an agreement to spin off its transmission business and merge it with a newly-formed subsidiary of ITC Holdings Corp. · The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business segment includes the ownership and operation of six nuclear power plants located in the northern United States and the sale of the electric power produced by those plants to wholesale customers. This business also provides services to other nuclear power plant owners. Entergy Wholesale Commodities also owns interests in non-nuclear power plants that sell the electric power produced by those plants to wholesale customers. See Note 13 to the financial statements for financial information regarding Entergy’s business segments. Strategy Entergy aspires to achieve industry-leading total shareholder returns in an environmentally responsible fashion by leveraging the scale and expertise inherent in its core nuclear and utility operations. Entergy’s current scope includes electricity generation, transmission and distribution as well as natural gas transportation and distribution. Entergy focuses on operational excellence with an emphasis on safety, reliability, customer service, sustainability, cost efficiency, and risk management. Entergy also focuses on portfolio management to make periodic buy, build, hold, or sell decisions based upon its analytically-derived points of view, which are updated as market conditions evolve. Utility The Utility business segment includes six wholly-owned retail electric utility subsidiaries: Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas. These companies generate, transmit, distribute and sell electric power to retail and wholesale customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans also provide natural gas utility services to customers in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and New Orleans, Louisiana, respectively. Also included in the Utility is System Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Corporation that owns or leases 90 percent of Grand Gulf. System Energy sells its power and capacity from Grand Gulf at wholesale to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans. The six retail utility subsidiaries are each regulated by the FERC and by state utility commissions, or, in the case of Entergy New Orleans, the City Council. System Energy is regulated by the FERC because all of its transactions are at wholesale. The Utility continues to operate as a rate-regulated business as efforts toward deregulation have been abandoned or have not been initiated in its service territories. The overall generation portfolio of the Utility, which relies heavily on natural gas and nuclear generation, is consistent with Entergy’s strong support for the environment. 195 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Customers As of December 31, 2011, the Utility operating companies provided retail electric and gas service to customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, as follows: Electric Customers Gas Customers Area Served (In Thousands) (%) (In Thousands) (%) Entergy Arkansas Portions of Arkansas 693 25% Entergy Gulf States Louisiana Portions of Louisiana 384 14% 92 48% Entergy Louisiana Portions of Louisiana 669 24% Entergy Mississippi Portions of Mississippi 437 16% Entergy New Orleans City of New Orleans* 161 6% 101 52% Entergy Texas Portions of Texas 413 15% Total customers 2,757 100% 193 100% * Excludes the Algiers area of the city, where Entergy Louisiana provides electric service. Electric Energy Sales The electric energy sales of the Utility operating companies are subject to seasonal fluctuations, with the peak sales period normally occurring during the third quarter of each year. On August 3, 2011, Entergy reached a 2011 peak demand of 22,387 MWh, compared to the 2010 peak of 21,799 MWh recorded on August 2, 2010.

Selected 2011 Natural Gas Sales Data Entergy New Orleans and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana provide both electric power and natural gas to retail customers. Entergy New Orleans and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana sold 10,074,754 and 7,005,074 Mcf, respectively, of natural gas to retail customers in 2011. In 2011, 97% of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s operating revenue was derived from the electric utility business, and only 3% from the natural gas distribution business. For Entergy New Orleans, 84% of operating revenue was derived from the electric utility business and 16% from the natural gas distribution business in 2011. Following is data concerning Entergy New Orleans’s 2011 retail operating revenue sources. Customer Class Electric Operating Revenue Natural Gas Revenue Residential 42% 52% Commercial 37% 24% Industrial 7% 8% Governmental/Municipal 14% 16% Retail Rate Regulation General (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) Each Utility operating company regularly participates in retail rate proceedings. The status of material retail rate proceedings is described in Note 2 to the financial statements. Certain aspects of the Utility operating companies’ retail rate mechanisms are discussed below. Entergy Arkansas Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery Entergy Arkansas’s rate schedules include an energy cost recovery rider to recover fuel and purchased energy costs in monthly bills. The rider utilizes prior calendar year energy costs and projected energy sales for the twelve-month period commencing on April 1 of each year to develop an energy cost rate, which is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over-recovery or under-recovery, including carrying charges, of the energy cost for the prior calendar year. The energy cost recovery rider tariff also allows an interim rate request depending upon the level of over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs. In December 2007, the APSC issued an order stating that Entergy Arkansas’s energy cost recovery rider will remain in effect, and any future termination of the rider would be subject to eighteen months advance notice by the APSC, which would occur following notice and hearing. 197 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Storm Cost Recovery See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of proceedings regarding recovery of Entergy Arkansas’s storm restoration costs. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana Fuel Recovery Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s electric rates include a fuel adjustment clause designed to recover the cost of fuel and purchased power costs. The fuel adjustment clause contains a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense and related carrying charges arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges. To help stabilize electricity costs, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana received approval from the LPSC to hedge its exposure to natural gas price volatility through the use of financial instruments. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana hedges approximately one-third of the projected exposure to natural gas price changes for the gas used to serve its native electric load for all months of the year. The hedge quantity is reviewed on an annual basis. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s gas rates include a purchased gas adjustment clause based on estimated gas costs for the billing month adjusted by a surcharge or credit that arises from an annual reconciliation of fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges. To help stabilize retail gas costs, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana received approval from the LPSC to hedge its exposure to natural gas price volatility for its gas purchased for resale through the use of financial instruments. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana hedges approximately one-half of the projected natural gas volumes used to serve its natural gas customers for November through March. The hedge quantity is reviewed on an annual basis. Storm Cost Recovery See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s filings to recover storm-related costs. Entergy Louisiana Fuel Recovery Entergy Louisiana’s rate schedules include a fuel adjustment clause designed to recover the cost of fuel and purchased power costs. The fuel adjustment clause contains a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense and related carrying charges arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges. In the Delaney vs. Entergy Louisiana proceeding, the LPSC ordered Entergy Louisiana, beginning with the May 2000 fuel adjustment clause filing, to re-price costs flowed through its fuel adjustment clause related to the Evangeline gas contract so that the price included for fuel adjustment clause recovery shall thereafter be at the rate of the Henry Hub first of the month cash market price (as reported by the publication Inside FERC) plus $0.24 per mmBtu for the month for which the fuel adjustment clause is calculated, irrespective of the actual cost for the Evangeline contract quantity reflected in that month’s fuel adjustment clause. The Evangeline gas contract expires on January 1, 2013. To help stabilize electricity costs, Entergy Louisiana received approval from the LPSC in 2001 to hedge its exposure to natural gas price volatility through the use of financial instruments. Entergy Louisiana hedges approximately one-third of the projected exposure to natural gas price changes for the gas used to serve its native electric load for all months of the year. The hedge quantity is reviewed on an annual basis. 198 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy In September 2002, Entergy Louisiana settled a proceeding that concerned a contract entered into by Entergy Louisiana to purchase, through 2031, energy generated by a hydroelectric facility known as the Vidalia project. In the settlement, the LPSC approved Entergy Louisiana’s proposed treatment of the regulatory effect of the benefit from a tax accounting election related to that project. In general, the settlement permitted Entergy Louisiana to keep a portion of the tax benefit in exchange for bearing the risk associated with sustaining the tax treatment. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the obligations related to the Vidalia project and the sharing of tax benefits with customers. Storm Cost Recovery See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of Entergy Louisiana’s filings to recover storm-related costs. Entergy Mississippi Fuel Recovery Entergy Mississippi’s rate schedules include energy cost recovery riders to recover fuel and purchased energy costs. The rider utilizes projected energy costs filed quarterly by Entergy Mississippi to develop an energy cost rate. The energy cost rate is redetermined each calendar quarter and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over-recovery or under-recovery of the energy cost as of the second quarter preceding the redetermination. Entergy Mississippi’s fuel cost recoveries are subject to annual audits conducted pursuant to the authority of the MPSC. Power Management Rider The MPSC approved the purchase of the Attala power plant in November 2005. In December 2005, the MPSC issued an order approving the investment cost recovery through its power management rider and limited the recovery to a period that begins with the closing date of the purchase and ends the earlier of the date costs are incorporated into base rates or December 31, 2006. As a consequence of the events surrounding Entergy Mississippi’s ongoing efforts to recover storm restoration costs associated with Hurricane Katrina, in October 2006, the MPSC approved a revision to Entergy Mississippi’s power management rider. The revision has the effect of allowing Entergy Mississippi to recover the annual ownership costs of the Attala plant until such time as a general rate case is filed. To help stabilize electricity costs, Entergy Mississippi received approval from the MPSC to hedge its exposure to natural gas price volatility through the use of financial instruments. Entergy Mississippi hedges approximately one-half of the projected exposure to natural gas price changes for the gas used to serve its native electric load for all months of the year. The hedge quantity is reviewed on an annual basis. Storm Cost Recovery Entergy Mississippi maintains a storm damage reserve pursuant to orders of the MPSC and consistent with the regulatory accounting requirements. Entergy Mississippi's storm damage reserve is funded through its storm damage rider schedule. In August 2011, Entergy Mississippi filed with the MPSC a notice of its intent to revise the storm damage rider schedule to recover over a 36-month period approximately $30 million and to increase the level of monthly accruals to the storm damage reserve from the current level of $750,000 per month to $1.75 million per month, and to increase the current level of the storm reserve cap during which funds will accrue from $15 million to $25 million. The cap is the level of the storm reserve balance at which monthly accruals would temporarily cease. The amounts of the monthly accruals and the cap have not been revised since 2001 and the current amounts do not reflect the costs of current storm restoration activities. Consideration of Entergy Mississippi’s notice is pending. 199 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Entergy New Orleans Fuel Recovery Entergy New Orleans’s electric rate schedules include a fuel adjustment tariff designed to reflect no more than targeted fuel and purchased power costs, adjusted by a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel and purchased power costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges. Entergy New Orleans’s gas rate schedules include a purchased gas adjustment to reflect estimated gas costs for the billing month, adjusted by a surcharge or credit similar to that included in the electric fuel adjustment clause, including carrying charges. In October 2005, the City Council approved modification of the current gas cost collection mechanism effective November 2005 in order to address concerns regarding its fluctuations, particularly during the winter heating season. The modifications are intended to minimize fluctuations in gas rates during the winter months. To help stabilize retail gas costs, Entergy New Orleans received approval from the City Council to hedge its exposure to natural gas price volatility for its gas purchased for resale through the use of financial instruments. Entergy New Orleans hedges approximately one-half of the projected natural gas volumes used to serve its natural gas customers for November through March. The hedge quantity is reviewed on an annual basis. Storm Cost Recovery See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of Entergy New Orleans’s efforts to recover storm-related costs. Entergy Texas Fuel Recovery Entergy Texas’s rate schedules include a fixed fuel factor to recover fuel and purchased power costs, including carrying charges, that are not included in base rates. Semi-annual revisions of the fixed fuel factor are made in March and September based on the market price of natural gas and changes in fuel mix. The amounts collected under Entergy Texas’s fixed fuel factor and any interim surcharge or refund are subject to fuel reconciliation proceedings before the PUCT. The PUCT fuel cost reviews are discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements. Storm Cost Recovery See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of proceedings regarding recovery of Entergy Texas’s storm restoration costs. Electric Industry Restructuring In June 2009, a law was enacted in Texas that requires Entergy Texas to cease all activities relating to Entergy Texas’s transition to competition. The law allows Entergy Texas to remain a part of the SERC Region, although it does not prevent Entergy Texas from joining another power region. The law provides that proceedings to certify a power region that Entergy Texas belongs to as a qualified power region can be initiated by the PUCT, or on motion by another party, when the conditions supporting such a proceeding exist. Under the new law, the PUCT may not approve a transition to competition plan for Entergy Texas until the expiration of four years from the PUCT’s certification of Entergy Texas’s power region. In response to the new law, Entergy Texas in June 2009 gave notice to the PUCT of the withdrawal of its previously filed transition to competition plan, and requested that its transition to competition proceeding be dismissed. In July 2009 the ALJ dismissed the proceeding. 200 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy The new law also contains provisions that allow Entergy Texas take advantage of a cost recovery mechanism that permits annual filings for the recovery of reasonable and necessary expenditures for transmission infrastructure improvement and changes in wholesale transmission charges. This mechanism was previously available to other non-ERCOT Texas utility companies, but not to Entergy Texas. In September 2011, the PUCT adopted a proposed rule implementing a Distribution Cost Recovery Factor to recover capital and capital-related costs related to distribution infrastructure. The Distribution Cost Recovery Factor permits utilities once per year to implement an increase in rates above amounts reflected in base rates to reflect depreciation expense, federal income tax and other taxes, and return on investment. The Distribution Cost Recovery Factor rider may be changed a maximum of four times between base rate cases, and expires in January 2017, unless otherwise extended by the Texas Legislature. The new law further amends already existing law that had required Entergy Texas to propose for PUCT approval a tariff to allow eligible customers the ability to contract for competitive generation. The amending language in the new law provides, among other things, that: 1) the tariff shall not be implemented in a manner that harms the sustainability or competitiveness of manufacturers who choose not to participate in the tariff; 2) Entergy Texas shall “purchase competitive generation service, selected by the customer, and provide the generation at retail to the customer”; and 3) Entergy Texas shall provide and price transmission service and ancillary services under that tariff at a rate that is unbundled from its cost of service. The new law directs that the PUCT may not issue an order on the tariff that is contrary to an applicable decision, rule, or policy statement of a federal regulatory agency having jurisdiction. Entergy Texas and the other parties to the PUCT proceeding to determine the design of the competitive generation tariff were involved in negotiations throughout 2011 with the objective of resolving as many disputed issues as possible regarding the tariff. While these negotiations remain pending, the PUCT has directed the parties to file testimony allowing it to consider and resolve certain threshold issues related to the design of the program, including: 1) the definition and calculation of any cost unrecovered by Entergy Texas as a result of the tariff; 2) who should be eligible to take service under the tariff; and 3) what ratepayers should be responsible for paying any unrecovered costs experienced by Entergy Texas. Testimony addressing these issues has been submitted and a hearing is scheduled for April 2012. Franchises Entergy Arkansas holds exclusive franchises to provide electric service in approximately 307 incorporated cities and towns in Arkansas. These franchises are unlimited in duration and continue unless the municipalities purchase the utility property. In Arkansas, franchises are considered to be contracts and, therefore, are terminable pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreement and applicable statutes. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana holds non-exclusive franchises to provide electric service in approximately 56 incorporated municipalities and the unincorporated areas of approximately 18 parishes, and to provide gas service in the City of Baton Rouge and the unincorporated areas of two parishes. Most of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s franchises have a term of 60 years. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s current electric franchises expire during 2015-2046. Entergy Louisiana holds non-exclusive franchises to provide electric service in approximately 116 incorporated Louisiana municipalities. Most of these franchises have 25-year terms. Entergy Louisiana also supplies electric service in approximately 45 Louisiana parishes in which it holds non-exclusive franchises. Entergy Louisiana’s electric franchises expire during 2015-2036. Entergy Mississippi has received from the MPSC certificates of public convenience and necessity to provide electric service to areas within 45 counties, including a number of municipalities, in western Mississippi. Under Mississippi statutory law, such certificates are exclusive. Entergy Mississippi may continue to serve in such municipalities upon payment of a statutory franchise fee, regardless of whether an original municipal franchise is still in existence. 201 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Entergy New Orleans provides electric and gas service in the City of New Orleans pursuant to indeterminate permits set forth in city ordinances (except electric service in Algiers, which is provided by Entergy Louisiana). These ordinances contain a continuing option for the City of New Orleans to purchase Entergy New Orleans’s electric and gas utility properties. Entergy Texas holds a certificate of convenience and necessity from the PUCT to provide electric service to areas within approximately 27 counties in eastern Texas, and holds non-exclusive franchises to provide electric service in approximately 68 incorporated municipalities. Entergy Texas was typically granted 50-year franchises, but recently has been receiving 25-year franchises. Entergy Texas’s electric franchises expire during 2013-2058. The business of System Energy is limited to wholesale power sales. It has no distribution franchises. Property and Other Generation Resources Generating Stations The total capability of the generating stations owned and leased by the Utility operating companies and System Energy as of December 31, 2011, is indicated below: Owned and Leased Capability MW(1) Company Total Gas/Oil Nuclear Coal Hydro Entergy Arkansas 4,774 1,668 1,823 1,209 74 Entergy Gulf States Louisiana 3,317 1,980 974 363 - Entergy Louisiana 5,424 4,265 1,159 - - Entergy Mississippi 3,229 2,809 - 420 - Entergy New Orleans 764 764 - - - Entergy Texas 2,538 2,269 - 269 - System Energy 1,071 - 1,071 - - Total 21,117 13,755 5,027 2,261 74 (1) “Owned and Leased Capability” is the dependable load carrying capability as demonstrated under actual operating conditions based on the primary fuel (assuming no curtailments) that each station was designed to utilize. The Entergy System's load and capacity projections are reviewed periodically to assess the need and timing for additional generating capacity and interconnections. These reviews consider existing and projected demand, the availability and price of power, the location of new load, and the economy. Summer peak load in the Entergy System service territory has averaged 21,246 MW from 2002-2011. In the 2002 time period, the Entergy System's long-term capacity resources, allowing for an adequate reserve margin, were approximately 3,000 MW less than the total capacity required for peak period demands. In this time period the Entergy System met its capacity shortages almost entirely through short-term power purchases in the wholesale spot market. In the fall of 2002, the Entergy System began a program to add new resources to its existing generation portfolio and began a process of issuing requests for proposals (RFP) to procure supply-side resources from sources other than the spot market to meet the unique regional needs of the Utility operating companies. The Entergy System has adopted a long-term resource strategy that calls for the bulk of capacity needs to be met through long-term resources, whether owned or contracted. Entergy refers to this strategy as the "Portfolio Transformation Strategy". Over the past nine years, Portfolio Transformation has resulted in the addition of about 4,500 MW of new long-term resources. These figures do not include transactions currently pending as a result of the Summer 2009 RFP. When the Summer 2009 RFP transactions are included in 202 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy the Entergy System portfolio of long-term resources and adjusting for unit deactivations of older generation, the Entergy System is approximately 500 MW short of its projected 2012 peak load plus reserve margin. This remaining need is expected to be met through a nuclear uprate at Grand Gulf and limited-term resources. The Entergy System will continue to access the spot power market to economically purchase energy in order to minimize customer cost. In addition, Entergy considers in its planning processes the notices from Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi regarding their future withdrawal from the System Agreement. Furthermore, as with other transmission systems, there are certain times during which congestion occurs on the Utility operating companies' transmission system that limits the ability of the Utility operating companies as well as other parties to fully utilize the generating resources that have been granted transmission service. RFP Procurements The RFPs issued by the Entergy System since the fall of 2002 have sought resources needed to meet near-term summer reliability requirements as well as longer-term resources through a broad range of wholesale power products, including limited-term (1 to 3 years) and long-term contractual products and asset acquisitions. Detailed evaluation processes have been developed to analyze submitted proposals, and, with the exception of the January 2008 RFP and the 2008 Western Region RFP, each RFP has been overseen by an independent monitor. The following table illustrates the results of the RFP process for resources acquired since the Fall 2002 RFP. The contracts below were primarily with non-affiliated suppliers, with the exception of contracts with EWO Marketing for the sale of 185 MW to 206 MW from the RS Cogen plant and contracts with Entergy Power for the sale of approximately 100 MW from the Independence plant.

(c) This table does not reflect (i) the River Bend 30% life-of-unit purchased power agreements totaling approximately 300 MW between Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana (200 MW), and between Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans (100 MW) related to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's unregulated portion of the River Bend nuclear station, which portion was formerly owned by Cajun Electric Power Cooperative, Inc. or (ii) the Entergy Arkansas wholesale base load capacity life-of-unit purchased power agreements executed in 2003 totaling approximately 220 MW between Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana (110 MW) and between Entergy Arkansas and Entergy New Orleans (110 MW) related to the sale of a portion of Entergy Arkansas’s coal and nuclear base load resources (which were not included in retail rates); or (iii) 12-month agreements originally executed in 2005 and which are renewed annually between Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, and between Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi, relating to the sale of a portion of Entergy Arkansas’s coal and nuclear base load resources (which were not included in retail rates) to those companies. These resources were identified outside of the formal RFP process but were submitted as formal proposals in response to the Spring 2003 RFP, which confirmed the economic merits of these resources. (d) Entergy Louisiana's June 2005 purchase of the 718 MW, gas-fired Perryville plant, of which a total of 75% of the output is sold to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas. 203 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy (e) In 2011 the LPSC approved Entergy Louisiana’s cancellation of the Little Gypsy Unit 3 re-powering project selected from the 2006 Long-Term RFP. (f) Entergy Arkansas’s September 2008 purchase of the 789 MW, combined-cycle, gas-fired Ouachita Generating Facility, of which one-third of the output was sold to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana prior to the purchase of one-third of the facility by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana in November 2009. (g) At the direction of the LPSC, but with full reservation of all legal rights, Entergy Services issued the January 2008 RFP for Supply-Side Resources seeking fixed price unit contingent products. Although the LPSC request was directed to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Services issued the RFP on behalf of all of the Utility operating companies. No proposals were selected from this RFP. (h) In October 2008, in response to the U.S. financial crisis, Entergy Services on behalf of the Utility operating companies terminated all long-term procurement efforts, including the long-term portion of the Summer 2008 RFP. (i) Represents the self-supply alternative considered in the RFP, consisting of a cost-based purchase by Entergy Texas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy Mississippi of wholesale baseload capacity from Entergy Arkansas. (j) Includes the Ninemile self-build option, acquisitions from KGen of its Hinds and Hot Spring facilities and a long-term PPA with Calpine Carville. Contracts from the Summer 2009 Long-Term RFP have been executed but are still pending regulatory approvals. Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans currently purchase, pursuant to ten-year purchased power agreements that expire in 2013, 121 MW of capacity and energy from Entergy Power sourced from Independence Steam Electric Station Unit 2. The transaction, which originated from the Fall 2002 RFP, included an option for Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans to acquire an ownership interest in the unit for a total price of $80 million, subject to various adjustments. In March 2008, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans provided notice of their intent to exercise the option. Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans continue to evaluate the economics of proceeding with this option. Based upon changes in the long-term economics of the resource relative to current options, in August 2011, Entergy Louisiana made a filing with the LPSC seeking relief from the prior directive to exercise the option to purchase an ownership interest in the Independence unit. The LPSC staff filed testimony suggesting that the option should be exercised but noting that this is largely a policy decision for the LPSC. In June 2011, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC an application seeking certification that the public necessity and convenience would be served by Entergy Louisiana’s construction of a nominally-sized 550 MW combined-cycle gas turbine generating facility (Ninemile 6) at its existing Ninemile Point electric generating station that was selected in the Summer 2009 Long-Term RFP. For additional discussion of the Ninemile 6 project see Capital Expenditure Plans and Other uses of Capital in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis. In December 2010, on behalf of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Services issued the 2010 RFP for Long-Term Renewable Energy Resources seeking up to 233 MW of renewable generation resources to meet the requirements of an LPSC general order issued in December 2010. In November 2011, Entergy Services selected five resources for a total of 143 MW for the primary selection list and two additional proposals, representing 103 MW for the secondary selection list. The seven proposals collectively represent a mixture of as-available and baseload products, technologies, and geographic locations. In June 2011, on behalf of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Services issued the 2011 RFP for Transition Plan Resources. The RFP sought up to 750 MW of flexible generation resources through one or more purchased power agreements to address Entergy Arkansas’s requirements for its 2014-2016 time frame. Entergy Arkansas concluded its review and evaluation of the proposals submitted in response to the RFP in November 2011 and selected two proposals totaling approximately 795 MW for negotiation of definitive agreements. 204 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy In December 2011, on behalf of Entergy Texas, Entergy Services issued the 2011 Western Region RFP for Long-Term Supply Side Resources. This RFP is seeking approximately 300 MW of baseload or flexible capacity, energy, and other electric products to meet the long-term reliability needs of the Western Region beginning in 2017. This RFP includes a self-build option at Entergy Texas’s Lewis Creek site. Other Procurements From Third Parties The above table does not include resource acquisitions made outside of the RFP process, including Entergy Mississippi's January 2006 acquisition of the 480 MW, combined-cycle, gas-fired Attala power plant; Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's March 2008 acquisition of the 322 MW, simple-cycle, gas-fired Calcasieu Generating Facility; and Entergy Louisiana’s April 2011 acquisition of the 580 MW, combined-cycle, gas-fired Acadia Energy Center Unit 2. The above table also does not reflect various limited- and long-term contracts that have been entered into in recent years by the Utility operating companies as a result of bilateral negotiations. Interconnections The Entergy System's generating units are interconnected by a transmission system operating at various voltages up to 500 kV. These generating units consist primarily of steam-electric production facilities and are centrally dispatched and operated. Entergy's Utility operating companies are interconnected with many neighboring utilities. In addition, the Utility operating companies are members of the SERC Reliability Corporation. The primary purpose of SERC is to ensure the reliability and adequacy of the electric bulk power supply in the southeast region of the United States. SERC is a member of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. Gas Property As of December 31, 2011, Entergy New Orleans distributed and transported natural gas for distribution within Algiers and New Orleans, Louisiana, through 2,500 miles of gas pipeline. As of December 31, 2011, the gas properties of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, which are located in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were not material to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's financial position. Title The Entergy System's generating stations are generally located on properties owned in fee simple. Most of the substations and transmission and distribution lines are constructed on private property or public rights-of-way pursuant to easements, servitudes, or appropriate franchises. Some substation properties are owned in fee simple. The Utility operating companies generally have the right of eminent domain, whereby they may perfect title to, or secure easements or servitudes on, private property for their utility operations. Substantially all of the physical properties and assets owned by Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy are subject to the liens of mortgages securing bonds issued by those companies. The Lewis Creek generating station is owned by GSG&T, Inc., a subsidiary of Entergy Texas, and is not subject to its mortgage lien. Lewis Creek is leased to and operated by Entergy Texas. 205 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Fuel Supply The sources of generation and average fuel cost per kWh for the Utility operating companies and System Energy for the years 2009-2011 were: Natural Gas Nuclear Coal Purchased Power Year % of Gen Cents Per kWh % of Gen Cents Per kWh % of Gen Cents Per kWh % of Gen Cents Per kWh 2011 25 4.85 34 .81 13 2.31 28 4.59 2010 22 5.39 36 .78 13 2.00 29 5.28 2009 19 5.64 34 .66 12 2.04 35 5.29 Actual 2011 and projected 2012 sources of generation for the Utility operating companies and System Energy, including certain power purchases from affiliates under life of unit power purchase agreements, including the Unit Power Sales Agreement, are: Natural Gas Nuclear Coal Purchased Power 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 Entergy Arkansas (a) 3% 11% 57% 52% 24% 23% 16% 14% Entergy Gulf States Louisiana 29% 31% 27% 19% 10% 11% 34% 39% Entergy Louisiana 29% 27% 36% 40% 2% 2% 33% 31% Entergy Mississippi 39% 40% 23% 23% 19% 20% 19% 17% Entergy New Orleans 37% 34% 45% 45% 9% 9% 9% 12% Entergy Texas 37% 19% 12% 16% 9% 11% 42% 54% System Energy (b) - - 100% 100% - - - - Utility (a) 25% 23% 34% 34% 13% 13% 28% 30% (a) Hydroelectric power provided less than 1% of Entergy Arkansas’s generation in 2011 and is expected to provide less than 1% of its generation in 2012. (b) Capacity and energy from System Energy’s interest in Grand Gulf is allocated as follows under the Unit Power Sales Agreement: Entergy Arkansas - 36%; Entergy Louisiana - 14%; Entergy Mississippi - 33%; and Entergy New Orleans - 17%. Pursuant to purchased power agreements, Entergy Arkansas is selling a portion of its owned capacity and energy from Grand Gulf to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans. Some of the Utility’s gas-fired plants are capable of also using fuel oil, if necessary. Although based on current economics the Utility does not expect fuel oil use in 2012, it is possible that various operational events including weather or pipeline maintenance may require the use of fuel oil. Natural Gas The Utility operating companies have long-term firm and short-term interruptible gas contracts for both supply and transportation. Long-term firm contracts for power plants comprise less than 25% of the Utility operating companies' total requirements. Short-term contracts and spot-market purchases satisfy additional gas requirements. Entergy Texas owns a gas storage facility that provides reliable and flexible natural gas service to certain generating stations. Entergy Louisiana has a long-term natural gas supply contract, which expires January 1, 2013, in which Entergy Louisiana agreed to purchase natural gas in annual amounts equal to approximately one-third of its projected annual fuel requirements for certain generating units. Annual demand charges associated with this contract are estimated to be $6.6 million. Entergy Louisiana conducted an RFP to obtain a replacement supplier for this contract and is in negotiations with the prevailing bidder. 206 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Many factors, including wellhead deliverability, storage and pipeline capacity, and demand requirements of end users, influence the availability and price of natural gas supplies for power plants. Demand is tied to weather conditions as well as to the prices and availability of other energy sources. Pursuant to federal and state regulations, gas supplies to power plants may be interrupted during periods of shortage. To the extent natural gas supplies are disrupted or natural gas prices significantly increase, the Utility operating companies will use alternate fuels, such as oil, or rely to a larger extent on coal, nuclear generation, and purchased power. Coal Entergy Arkansas has committed to four one- to three-year contracts that will supply approximately 90% of the total coal supply needs in 2012. These contracts are staggered in term so that not all contracts have to be renewed the same year. The remaining 10% of total coal requirements will be satisfied by contracts with a term of less than one year. Based on greater Powder River Basin (PRB) coal deliveries and the high cost of foreign coal, no alternative coal consumption is expected at Entergy Arkansas during 2012. Entergy Arkansas has an existing long-term railroad transportation contract that will provide up to approximately 85% of Entergy Arkansas’s coal transportation requirements for 2012. An RFP for Entergy Arkansas’ open rail transportation position was issued in 2011 and a definitive agreement is expected by mid-2012. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has executed three one- to three-year contracts that will supply approximately 90% of Nelson Unit 6 coal needs in 2012. Additional PRB coal will be purchased through contracts with a term of less than one year to provide the remaining supply needs. For the same reasons as for Entergy Arkansas’s plants, no alternative coal consumption is expected at Nelson Unit 6 during 2012. Coal will be transported to Nelson via a new transportation agreement beginning January 1, 2012 that will provide approximately 90% to 100% of rail transportation requirements for 2012. For the year 2011, coal transportation delivery to Entergy Arkansas operated coal-fired units met coal demand at the plants and it is expected that delivery times experienced in 2010 and 2011 will continue through 2012. In the fourth quarter 2011, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana experienced significant delivery shortfalls as the result of flood-related disruptions on the BNSF Railway. Inventory levels recovered by year end and improved transportation times are expected under the new transportation agreement beginning in 2012. Both Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana control a sufficient number of railcars to satisfy the rail transportation requirement. The operator of Big Cajun 2 - Unit 3, Louisiana Generating, LLC, has advised Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas that it has adequate rail car and barge capacity to meet the volumes of low-sulfur PRB coal requested for 2012. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Texas’s coal nomination requests to Big Cajun 2 - Unit 3 are made on an annual basis. Nuclear Fuel The nuclear fuel cycle consists of the following: · mining and milling of uranium ore to produce a concentrate; · conversion of the concentrate to uranium hexafluoride gas; · enrichment of the uranium hexafluoride gas; · fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies for use in fueling nuclear reactors; and · disposal of spent fuel. The Registrant Subsidiaries that own nuclear plants (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy), are responsible through a shared regulated uranium pool for contracts to acquire nuclear material to be used in fueling Entergy's Utility nuclear units. These companies own the materials and services in this shared regulated uranium pool on a pro rata fractional basis determined by the nuclear generation capability of each company. Any liabilities for obligations of the pooled contracts are on a several but not joint basis. The shared regulated uranium pool maintains inventories of nuclear materials during the various stages of 207 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy processing. The Registrant Subsidiaries purchase enriched uranium hexafluoride for their nuclear plant reload requirements at the average inventory cost from the shared regulated uranium pool. Entergy Operations Inc. contracts separately for the fabrication of nuclear fuel as agent on behalf of each of the Registrant Subsidiaries that owns a nuclear plant. All contracts for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel are between the Department of Energy (DOE) and the owner of a nuclear power plant. Based upon currently planned fuel cycles, the nuclear units in both the Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities segments have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what Entergy believes are reasonably predictable or fixed prices through most of 2012. Entergy’s ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners. There are a number of possible alternate suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, including potentially drawing upon Entergy’s inventory intended for later generation periods depending upon its risk management strategy at that time, although the pricing of any alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time. In addition, some nuclear fuel contracts are on a non-fixed price basis subject to prevailing prices at the time of delivery. The effects of market price changes may be reduced and deferred by risk management strategies, such as negotiation of floor and ceiling amounts for long-term contracts, buying for inventory or entering into forward physical contracts at fixed prices when Entergy believes it is appropriate and useful. Entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy each have made arrangements to lease nuclear fuel and related equipment and services. The lessors, which are consolidated in the financial statements of Entergy and the applicable Registrant Subsidiary, finance the acquisition and ownership of nuclear fuel through credit agreements and the issuance of notes. These arrangements are subject to periodic renewal. Natural Gas Purchased for Resale Entergy New Orleans has several suppliers of natural gas. Its system is interconnected with three interstate and three intrastate pipelines. Entergy New Orleans has a "no-notice" service gas purchase contract with Atmos Energy which guarantees Entergy New Orleans gas delivery at specific delivery points and at any volume within the minimum and maximum set forth in the contract amounts. The Atmos Energy gas supply is transported to Entergy New Orleans pursuant to a transportation service agreement with Gulf South Pipeline Co. This service is subject to FERC-approved rates. Entergy New Orleans also makes interruptible spot market purchases. In recent years, natural gas deliveries to Entergy New Orleans have been subject primarily to weather-related curtailments. As a result of the implementation of FERC-mandated interstate pipeline restructuring in 1993, curtailments of interstate gas supply could occur if Entergy New Orleans's suppliers failed to perform their obligations to deliver gas under their supply agreements. Gulf South Pipeline Co. could curtail transportation capacity only in the event of pipeline system constraints. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana purchases natural gas for resale under a firm contract from Enbridge Marketing (U.S.) Inc. The gas is delivered through a combination of intrastate and interstate pipelines. Federal Regulation of the Utility State or local regulatory authorities, as described above, regulate the retail rates of the Utility operating companies. The FERC regulates wholesale rates (including intrasystem sales pursuant to the System Agreement) and interstate transmission of electricity, as well as rates for System Energy’s sales of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. 208 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy System Agreement (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) The Utility operating companies historically have engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which is a rate schedule that has been approved by the FERC. Under the terms of the System Agreement, generating capacity and other power resources are jointly operated by the Utility operating companies. The System Agreement provides, among other things, that parties having generating reserves greater than their allocated share of reserves (long companies) shall receive payments from those parties having generating reserves that are less than their allocated share of reserves (short companies). Such payments are at amounts sufficient to cover certain of the long companies’ costs for intermediate and peaking oil/gas-fired generation, including operating expenses, fixed charges on debt, dividend requirements on preferred equity, and a fair rate of return on common equity investment. Under the System Agreement, the rates used to compensate long companies are based on costs associated with the long companies’ steam electric generating units fueled by oil or gas and having an annual average heat rate above 10,000 Btu/kWh. In addition, for all energy exchanged among the Utility operating companies under the System Agreement, the companies purchasing exchange energy are required to pay the cost of fuel consumed in generating such energy plus a charge to cover other associated costs. Citing its concerns that the benefits of its continued participation in the current form of the System Agreement have been seriously eroded, in December 2005, Entergy Arkansas submitted its notice that it will terminate its participation in the current System Agreement effective ninety-six (96) months from the date of the notice or such earlier date as authorized by the FERC. In November 2007, pursuant to the provisions of the System Agreement, Entergy Mississippi provided its written notice to terminate its participation in the System Agreement effective ninety-six (96) months from the date of the notice or such earlier date as authorized by the FERC. In light of the notices of Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi to terminate participation in the current System Agreement, in January 2008 the LPSC unanimously voted to direct the LPSC Staff to begin evaluating the potential for a new agreement. Likewise, the New Orleans City Council opened a docket to gather information on progress towards a successor agreement. In November 2009 the FERC accepted the notices of cancellation and determined that Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi are permitted to withdraw from the System Agreement following the 96 month notice period without payment of a fee or being required to otherwise compensate the remaining Utility operating companies as a result of withdrawal. In February 2011 the FERC denied the LPSC’s and the City Council’s rehearing requests. The LPSC has appealed the FERC’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and oral argument was held in the case in January 2012. See “System Agreement” in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the proceedings at the FERC involving the System Agreement and other related proceedings. Transmission See the “Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis. See “Independent Coordinator of Transmission” in the “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis. System Energy and Related Agreements System Energy recovers costs related to its interest in Grand Gulf through rates charged to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans for capacity and energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement (described below). In December 1995, System Energy commenced a rate proceeding at the FERC. In July 2001, the rate proceeding became final, with the FERC approving a prospective 10.94% return on equity. The 209 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy FERC’s decision also affected other aspects of System Energy’s charges to the Utility operating companies that it supplies with power. In 1998, the FERC approved requests by Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi to accelerate a portion of their Grand Gulf purchased power obligations. Entergy Arkansas’s and Entergy Mississippi’s acceleration of Grand Gulf purchased power obligations ceased effective July 2001 and July 2003, respectively, as approved by the FERC. Unit Power Sales Agreement The Unit Power Sales Agreement allocates capacity, energy, and the related costs from System Energy’s ownership and leasehold interests in Grand Gulf to Entergy Arkansas (36%), Entergy Louisiana (14%), Entergy Mississippi (33%), and Entergy New Orleans (17%). Each of these companies is obligated to make payments to System Energy for its entitlement of capacity and energy on a full cost-of-service basis regardless of the quantity of energy delivered. Payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are System Energy’s only source of operating revenue. The financial condition of System Energy depends upon the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf and the receipt of such payments. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans generally recover payments made under the Unit Power Sales Agreement through rates charged to their customers. In the case of Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana, payments are also recovered through sales of electricity from their respective retained shares of Grand Gulf. Under a settlement agreement entered into with the APSC in 1985 and amended in 1988, Entergy Arkansas retains 22% of its 36% share of Grand Gulf-related costs and recovers the remaining 78% of its share in rates. In the event that Entergy Arkansas is not able to sell its retained share to third parties, it may sell such energy to its retail customers at a price equal to its avoided cost, which is currently less than Entergy Arkansas’s cost from its retained share. Entergy Arkansas has life-of-resources purchased power agreements with Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans that sell a portion of the output of Entergy Arkansas’s retained share of Grand Gulf to those companies. In a series of LPSC orders, court decisions, and agreements from late 1985 to mid-1988, Entergy Louisiana was granted rate relief with respect to costs associated with Entergy Louisiana’s share of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf, subject to certain terms and conditions. Entergy Louisiana retains and does not recover from retail ratepayers 18% of its 14% share of the costs of Grand Gulf capacity and energy and recovers the remaining 82% of its share in rates. Entergy Louisiana is allowed to recover through the fuel adjustment clause at 4.6 cents per kWh for the energy related to its retained portion of these costs. Alternatively, Entergy Louisiana may sell such energy to non-affiliated parties at prices above the fuel adjustment clause recovery amount, subject to the LPSC’s approval. Availability Agreement The Availability Agreement among System Energy and Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans was entered into in 1974 in connection with the financing by System Energy of Grand Gulf. The Availability Agreement provides that System Energy make available to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans all capacity and energy available from System Energy’s share of Grand Gulf. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans also agreed severally to pay System Energy monthly for the right to receive capacity and energy from Grand Gulf in amounts that (when added to any amounts received by System Energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement) would at least equal System Energy’s total operating expenses for Grand Gulf (including depreciation at a specified rate and expenses incurred in a permanent shutdown of Grand Gulf) and interest charges. The September 1989 write-off of System Energy’s investment in Grand Gulf 2, amounting to approximately $900 million, is being amortized for Availability Agreement purposes over 27 years. The allocation percentages under the Availability Agreement are fixed as follows: Entergy Arkansas - 17.1%; Entergy Louisiana - 26.9%; Entergy Mississippi - 31.3%; and Entergy New Orleans - 24.7%. The allocation percentages under the Availability Agreement would remain in effect and would govern payments made under such agreement in the event of a shortfall of funds available to System Energy from other sources, including payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. 210 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy System Energy has assigned its rights to payments and advances from Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans under the Availability Agreement as security for its first mortgage bonds and reimbursement obligations to certain banks providing letters of credit in connection with the equity funding of the sale and leaseback transactions described in Note 10 to the financial statements under “Sale and Leaseback Transactions - Grand Gulf Lease Obligations.” In these assignments, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans further agreed that, in the event they were prohibited by governmental action from making payments under the Availability Agreement (for example, if the FERC reduced or disallowed such payments as constituting excessive rates), they would then make subordinated advances to System Energy in the same amounts and at the same times as the prohibited payments. System Energy would not be allowed to repay these subordinated advances so long as it remained in default under the related indebtedness or in other similar circumstances. Each of the assignment agreements relating to the Availability Agreement provides that Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans will make payments directly to System Energy. However, if there is an event of default, those payments must be made directly to the holders of indebtedness that are the beneficiaries of such assignment agreements. The payments must be made pro rata according to the amount of the respective obligations secured. The obligations of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans to make payments under the Availability Agreement are subject to the receipt and continued effectiveness of all necessary regulatory approvals. Sales of capacity and energy under the Availability Agreement would require that the Availability Agreement be submitted to the FERC for approval with respect to the terms of such sale. No such filing with the FERC has been made because sales of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf are being made pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. If, for any reason, sales of capacity and energy are made in the future pursuant to the Availability Agreement, the jurisdictional portions of the Availability Agreement would be submitted to the FERC for approval. Since commercial operation of Grand Gulf began, payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement to System Energy have exceeded the amounts payable under the Availability Agreement. Therefore, no payments under the Availability Agreement have ever been required. If Entergy Arkansas or Entergy Mississippi fails to make its Unit Power Sales Agreement payments, and System Energy is unable to obtain funds from other sources, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans could become subject to claims or demands by System Energy or its creditors for payments or advances under the Availability Agreement (or the assignments thereof) equal to the difference between their required Unit Power Sales Agreement payments and their required Availability Agreement payments because their Availability Agreement obligations exceed their Unit Power Sales Agreement obligations. The Availability Agreement may be terminated, amended, or modified by mutual agreement of the parties thereto, without further consent of any assignees or other creditors. Capital Funds Agreement System Energy and Entergy Corporation have entered into the Capital Funds Agreement, whereby Entergy Corporation has agreed to supply System Energy with sufficient capital to (i) maintain System Energy’s equity capital at an amount equal to a minimum of 35% of its total capitalization (excluding short-term debt) and (ii) permit the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf and pay in full all indebtedness for borrowed money of System Energy when due. Entergy Corporation has entered into various supplements to the Capital Funds Agreement. System Energy has assigned its rights under such supplements as security for its first mortgage bonds and for reimbursement obligations to certain banks providing letters of credit in connection with the equity funding of the sale and leaseback transactions described in Note 10 to the financial statements under “Sale and Leaseback Transactions - Grand Gulf Lease Obligations.” Each such supplement provides that permitted indebtedness for borrowed money incurred by System Energy in connection with the financing of Grand Gulf may be secured by System Energy’s rights under 211 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy the Capital Funds Agreement on a pro rata basis (except for the Specific Payments, as defined below). In addition, in the supplements to the Capital Funds Agreement relating to the specific indebtedness being secured, Entergy Corporation has agreed to make cash capital contributions directly to System Energy sufficient to enable System Energy to make payments when due on such indebtedness (Specific Payments). However, if there is an event of default, Entergy Corporation must make those payments directly to the holders of indebtedness benefiting from the supplemental agreements. The payments (other than the Specific Payments) must be made pro rata according to the amount of the respective obligations benefiting from the supplemental agreements. The Capital Funds Agreement may be terminated, amended, or modified by mutual agreement of the parties thereto, upon obtaining the consent, if required, of those holders of System Energy’s indebtedness then outstanding who have received the assignments of the Capital Funds Agreement. Service Companies Entergy Services, a corporation wholly-owned by Entergy Corporation, provides management, administrative, accounting, legal, engineering, and other services primarily to the Utility operating companies. Entergy Operations is also wholly-owned by Entergy Corporation and provides nuclear management, operations and maintenance services under contract for ANO, River Bend, Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf, subject to the owner oversight of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, respectively. Entergy Services and Entergy Operations provide their services to the Utility operating companies and System Energy on an “at cost” basis, pursuant to cost allocation methodologies for these service agreements that were approved by the FERC. Jurisdictional Separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas Effective December 31, 2007, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. completed a jurisdictional separation into two vertically integrated utility companies, one operating under the sole retail jurisdiction of the PUCT, Entergy Texas, and the other operating under the sole retail jurisdiction of the LPSC, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. Management believes that the jurisdictional separation better aligns Entergy Gulf States, Inc.’s Louisiana and Texas operations to serve customers in those states and to operate consistent with state-specific regulatory requirements as the utility regulatory environments in those jurisdictions evolve. The jurisdictional separation provides for regulation of each separated company by a single retail regulator, which should reduce regulatory complexity. Entergy Texas now owns all Entergy Gulf States, Inc. distribution and transmission assets located in Texas, the gas-fired generating plants located in Texas, undivided 42.5% ownership shares of Entergy Gulf States, Inc.’s 70% ownership interest in Nelson 6 and 42% ownership interest in Big Cajun 2, Unit 3, which are coal-fired generating plants located in Louisiana, and other assets and contract rights to the extent related to utility operations in Texas. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana now owns all of the remaining assets that were owned by Entergy Gulf States, Inc. On a book value basis, approximately 58.1% of the Entergy Gulf States, Inc. assets were allocated to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and approximately 41.9% were allocated to Entergy Texas. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana remained primarily liable for all of the long-term debt issued by Entergy Gulf States, Inc. that was outstanding on December 31, 2007. Under a debt assumption agreement with Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Texas assumed its pro rata share of this long-term debt, which was $1.079 billion, or approximately 46%, which had been entirely paid-off as of December 31, 2010. The pro rata share of the long-term debt assumed by Entergy Texas was determined by first determining the net assets for each company on a book value basis, and then calculating a debt assumption ratio that resulted in the common equity ratios for each company being approximately the same as the Entergy Gulf States, Inc. common equity ratio immediately prior to the jurisdictional separation. Entergy Texas purchases from Entergy Gulf States Louisiana pursuant to a life-of-unit purchased power agreement (PPA) a 42.5% share of capacity and energy from the 70% of River Bend subject to retail regulation. Entergy Texas was allocated a share of River Bend’s nuclear and environmental liabilities that is identical to the share of the plant’s output purchased by Entergy Texas under the PPA. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana purchases a 57.5% share 212 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy of capacity and energy from the gas-fired generating plants owned by Entergy Texas, and Entergy Texas purchases a 42.5% share of capacity and energy from the gas-fired generating plants owned by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. The PPAs associated with the gas-fired generating plants will terminate when the unit(s) is/are no longer dispatched by the Entergy System. The dispatch and operation of the generating plants will not change as a result of the jurisdictional separation. The jurisdictional separation occurred through completion of the following steps: · Through a Texas statutory merger-by-division, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. was renamed as Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Inc., a Texas corporation, and the new Texas business corporation Entergy Texas, Inc. was formed. · Entergy Gulf States, Inc. allocated the assets described above to Entergy Texas, and all of the capital stock of Entergy Texas was issued directly to Entergy Gulf States, Inc.’s parent company, Entergy Corporation. · Entergy Corporation formed EGS Holdings, Inc., a Texas corporation, and contributed all of the common stock of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Inc. to EGS Holdings, Inc. · EGS Holdings, Inc. formed the Louisiana limited liability company Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. and then owned all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. · Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Inc. then merged into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C., with Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. being the surviving entity. · Entergy Corporation now owns EGS Holdings, Inc. and Entergy Texas in their entirety, and EGS Holdings, Inc. now owns Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s common membership interests in their entirety. Earnings Ratios of Registrant Subsidiaries The Registrant Subsidiaries’ ratios of earnings to fixed charges and ratios of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred dividends or distributions pursuant to Item 503 of SEC Regulation S-K are as follows: Ratios of Earnings to Fixed Charges Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Entergy Arkansas 4.31 3.91 2.39 2.33 3.19 Entergy Gulf States Louisiana 4.36 3.58 2.99 2.44 2.84 Entergy Louisiana 1.86 3.41 3.52 3.14 3.44 Entergy Mississippi 3.55 3.35 3.31 2.92 3.22 Entergy New Orleans 5.37 4.43 3.61 3.71 2.74 Entergy Texas 2.34 2.10 1.92 2.04 2.07 System Energy 3.85 3.64 3.73 3.29 3.95 Ratios of Earnings to Combined Fixed Charges and Preferred Dividends or Distributions Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Entergy Arkansas 3.83 3.60 2.09 1.95 2.88 Entergy Gulf States Louisiana 4.30 3.54 2.95 2.42 2.73 Entergy Louisiana 1.70 3.19 3.27 2.87 3.08 Entergy Mississippi 3.27 3.16 3.06 2.67 2.97 Entergy New Orleans 4.74 4.08 3.33 3.45 2.54 The Registrant Subsidiaries accrue interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense and do not include it in fixed charges. 213 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Entergy Wholesale Commodities During 2010 Entergy integrated its non-utility nuclear and its non-nuclear wholesale assets businesses into a new organization called Entergy Wholesale Commodities. Entergy Wholesale Commodities includes the ownership and operation of six nuclear power plants, five of which are located in the Northeast United States, with the sixth located in Michigan, and is primarily focused on selling electric power produced by those plants to wholesale customers. Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ revenues are primarily derived from sales of energy and generation capacity from these plants. Entergy Wholesale Commodities also provides operations and management services, including decommissioning services, to nuclear power plants owned by other utilities in the United States. Entergy Wholesale Commodities also includes the ownership of, or participation in joint ventures that own, non-nuclear power plants and the sale to wholesale customers of the electric power produced by these plants. Property Nuclear Generating Stations Entergy Wholesale Commodities includes the ownership of the following nuclear power plants: Power Plant Market In Service Year Acquired Location Capacity- Reactor Type License Expiration Date Pilgrim IS0-NE 1972 July 1999 Plymouth, MA 688 MW - Boiling Water 2012 FitzPatrick NYISO 1975 Nov. 2000 Oswego, NY 838 MW - Boiling Water 2034 Indian Point 3 NYISO 1976 Nov. 2000 Buchanan, NY 1,041 MW - Pressurized Water 2015 Indian Point 2 NYISO 1974 Sept. 2001 Buchanan, NY 1,028 MW - Pressurized Water 2013 Vermont Yankee IS0-NE 1972 July 2002 Vernon, VT 605 MW - Boiling Water 2032 Palisades MISO 1971 Apr. 2007 South Haven, MI 811 MW - Pressurized Water 2031 Entergy Wholesale Commodities also includes the ownership of two non-operating nuclear facilities, Big Rock Point in Michigan and Indian Point 1 in New York that were acquired when Entergy purchased the Palisades and Indian Point 2 nuclear plants, respectively. These facilities are in various stages of the decommissioning process. The NRC operating license for Vermont Yankee was to expire in March 2012. In March 2011 the NRC renewed Vermont Yankee’s operating license for an additional 20 years, as a result of which the license now expires in 2032. For additional discussion regarding the continued operation of the Vermont Yankee plant, see “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets” in Note 1 to the financial statements. The operating licenses for Pilgrim, Indian Point 2, and Indian Point 3 expire between 2012 and 2015. Under federal law, nuclear power plants may continue to operate beyond their license expiration dates while their renewal applications are pending NRC approval. Various parties have expressed opposition to renewal of the licenses. With respect to the Pilgrim license renewal, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) of the NRC, after issuing an order denying a new hearing request, terminated its proceeding on Pilgrim’s license renewal application. With the ASLB process concluded the proceeding, including appeals of certain ASLB decisions, is now before the NRC. In April 2007, Entergy submitted an application to the NRC to renew the operating licenses for Indian Point 2 and 3 for an additional 20 years. The ASLB has admitted 21 contentions raised by the State of New York or other parties, which were combined into 16 discrete issues. Two of the issues have been resolved, leaving 14 issues that are currently subject to ASLB hearings. In July 2011, the ASLB granted the State of New York’s motion for summary 214 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy disposition of an admitted contention challenging the adequacy of a section of Indian Point’s environmental analysis as incorporated in the FSEIS (discussed below). That section provided cost estimates for Severe Accident Mitigation Alternatives (SAMAs), which are hardware and procedural changes that could be implemented to mitigate estimated impacts of off-site radiological releases in case of a hypothesized severe accident. In addition to finding that the SAMA cost analysis was insufficient, the ASLB directed the NRC staff to explain why cost-beneficial SAMAs should not be required to be implemented. Entergy appealed the ASLB’s decision to the NRC and the NRC staff supported Entergy’s appeal, while the State of New York opposed it. In December 2011 the NRC denied Entergy’s appeal as premature, stating that the appeal could be renewed at the conclusion of the ASLB proceedings. In November 2011 the ASLB issued an order establishing deadlines for the submission of several rounds of testimony on most of the contentions pending before the ASLB and for the filing of motions to limit or exclude testimony. Initial hearings before the ASLB on the contentions for which testimony is submitted are expected to begin by the end of 2012. Filing deadlines for testimony on certain admitted contentions remain to be set by the ASLB. The NRC staff currently is also performing its technical and environmental reviews of the application. The NRC staff issued a Final Safety Evaluation Report (FSER) in August 2009, a supplement to the FSER in August 2011, and a Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (FSEIS) in December 2010. The NRC staff has stated its intent to file a supplemental FSEIS in May 2012. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has taken the position that Indian Point must obtain a new state-issued Clean Water Act Section 401 water quality certification as part of the license renewal process. In addition, the consistency of Indian Point’s operations with New York State’s coastal management policies must be resolved as required by the Coastal Zone Management Act. Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ efforts to obtain these certifications and determinations continue in 2012. The hearing process is an integral component of the NRC’s regulatory framework, and evidentiary hearings on license renewal applications are not uncommon. Entergy intends to participate fully in the hearing process as permitted by the NRC’s hearing rules. As noted in Entergy’s responses to the various intervenor filings, Entergy believes the contentions proposed by the intervenors are unsupported and without merit. Entergy will continue to work with the NRC staff as it completes its technical and environmental reviews of the license renewal application. Non-nuclear Generating Stations Entergy Wholesale Commodities includes the ownership, or interests in joint ventures that own, the following non-nuclear power plants: Plant Location Ownership Net Owned Capacity(1) Type Rhode Island State Energy Center; 583 MW Johnston, RI 100% 583 MW Gas Ritchie Unit 2; 544 MW Helena, AR 100% 544 MW Gas/Oil Independence Unit 2; 842 MW (2) Newark, AR 14% 121 MW(3) Coal Top of Iowa; 80 MW (4) Worth County, IA 50% 40 MW Wind White Deer; 80 MW (4) Amarillo, TX 50% 40 MW Wind RS Cogen; 425 MW (4) Lake Charles, LA 50% 213 MW Gas/Steam Nelson 6; 550 MW Westlake, LA 11% 60 MW(3) Gas (1) “Net Owned Capacity” refers to the nameplate rating on the generating unit. (2) Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans currently purchase 101 MW of capacity and energy from Independence Unit 2. The transaction included an option for Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans to acquire an ownership interest in the unit for a total price of $80 million, subject to various adjustments. In March 2008, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans provided notice of their intent to exercise the option. Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans continue to evaluate the economics of proceeding with this option. Based upon changes in the long-term economics of the resource relative to current options, in August 2011, Entergy Louisiana made a filing with the LPSC seeking relief from the prior directive to exercise the option to purchase an ownership interest in the Independence unit. The LPSC staff filed testimony suggesting that the option should be exercised but noting that this is largely a policy decision for the LPSC. 215 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy (3) The owned MW capacity is the portion of the plant capacity owned by Entergy Wholesale Commodities. For a complete listing of Entergy’s jointly-owned generating stations, refer to “Jointly-Owned Generating Stations” in Note 1 to the financial statements. (4) Indirectly owned through interests in unconsolidated joint ventures. In the fourth quarter 2010, Entergy sold its 61 percent share of the Harrison County 550 MW combined cycle gas-fired power plant. Independent System Operators The Pilgrim and Vermont Yankee and Rhode Island plants fall under the authority of the Independent System Operator (ISO) New England and the FitzPatrick and Indian Point plants fall under the authority of the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO). The Palisades plant falls under the authority of the MISO. The primary purpose of ISO New England, NYISO, and MISO is to direct the operations of the major generation and transmission facilities in their respective regions; ensure grid reliability; administer and monitor wholesale electricity markets; and plan for their respective region’s energy needs. Energy and Capacity Sales As a wholesale generator, Entergy Wholesale Commodities core business is selling energy, measured in MWh, to its customers. Entergy Wholesale Commodities enters into forward contracts with its customers and sells energy in the day ahead or spot markets. In addition to selling the energy produced by its plants, Entergy Wholesale Commodities sells unforced capacity, which allows load-serving entities to meet specified reserve and related requirements placed on them by the ISOs in their respective areas. Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ forward fixed price power contracts consist of contracts to sell energy only, contracts to sell capacity only, and bundled contracts in which it sells both capacity and energy. While the terminology and payment mechanics vary in these contracts, each of these types of contracts requires Entergy Wholesale Commodities to deliver MWh of energy, make capacity available, or both. See “Commodity Price Risk - Power Generation” in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for additional information regarding these contracts. In addition to the contracts discussed in “Commodity Price Risk - Power Generation,” Entergy’s purchase of the Vermont Yankee plant included a value sharing agreement providing for payments to the seller in the event that the plant operates beyond March 2012 pursuant to a renewed NRC operating license. Under the value sharing agreement, to the extent that the average annual price of the energy sales from the plant exceeds the specified strike price, initially $61/MWh and then adjusted annually based on three indices, Vermont Yankee will pay 50% of the amount exceeding the strike prices to the seller. These payments, if required, will be recorded as adjustments to the purchase price of the plants. The value sharing would begin in 2012 and extend into 2022. As part of the purchase of the Palisades plant, Entergy executed a 15-year PPA with the seller, Consumers Energy, for 100% of the plant’s output, excluding any future uprates. Under the purchased power agreement, Consumers Energy will receive the value of any new environmental credits for the first ten years of the agreement. Palisades and Consumers Energy will share on a 50/50 basis the value of any new environmental credits for years 11 through 15 of the agreement. The environmental credits are defined as benefits from a change in law that causes capability of the plant as of the purchase date to become a tradable attribute (e.g., emission credit, renewable energy credit, environmental credit, “green” credit, etc.) or otherwise to have a market value. Customers Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ customers for the sale of both energy and capacity from its nuclear plants include retail power providers, utilities, electric power co-operatives, power trading organizations and other power generation companies. These customers include Consolidated Edison, NYPA, and Consumers Energy, companies from which Entergy purchased plants, and ISO New England and NYISO. Substantially all of the counterparties or their guarantors for the planned energy output under contract for Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants have public investment grade credit ratings or are load-serving entities without public credit ratings. 216 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Competition The ISO New England and NYISO markets are highly competitive. Entergy Wholesale Commodities has numerous competitors in New England and New York, including generation companies affiliated with regulated utilities, other independent power producers, municipal and co-operative generators, owners of co-generation plants and wholesale power marketers. Entergy Wholesale Commodities is an independent power producer, which means it generates power for sale to third parties at day ahead or spot market prices to the extent that the power is not sold under a fixed price contract. Municipal and co-operative generators also generate power but use most of it to deliver power to their municipal or co-operative power customers. Owners of co-generation plants produce power primarily for their own consumption. Wholesale power marketers do not own generation; rather they buy power from generators or other market participants and resell it to retail providers or other market participants. Competition in the New England and New York power markets is affected by, among other factors, the amount of generation and transmission capacity in these markets. MISO does not have a formal, centralized forward capacity market, but load serving entities do transact capacity through bilateral contracts. Palisades’s current output is contracted to Consumers Energy through 2022 and, therefore, Entergy Wholesale Commodities does not expect to be materially affected by competition in the MISO market in the near term. Seasonality Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ revenues and operating income are subject to fluctuations during the year due to seasonal factors, weather conditions, and contract pricing. Refueling outages are generally scheduled for the spring and the fall, and cause volumetric decreases during those seasons. When outdoor and cooling water temperatures are lower, generally during colder months, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear power plants operate more efficiently, and consequently, generate more electricity. Many of Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ contracts provide for shaped pricing over the course of the year. As a result of these factors, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ revenues are typically higher in the first and third quarters than in the second and fourth quarters. Fuel Supply Nuclear Fuel See “Fuel Supply, Nuclear Fuel” in the Utility portion of Part I, Item 1 for a discussion of the nuclear fuel cycle and markets. Entergy Nuclear Fuels Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary, is responsible for contracts to acquire nuclear materials, except for fuel fabrication, for Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear power plants, while Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. acts as the agent for the purchase of nuclear fuel assembly fabrication services. All contracts for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel are between the DOE and each of the nuclear power plants. Other Business Activities Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing, LLC (ENPM) was formed in 2005 to centralize the power marketing function for Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants. Upon its formation, ENPM entered into long-term power purchase agreements with the Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries that own nuclear power plants (generating subsidiaries). As part of a series of agreements, ENPM agreed to assume and/or otherwise service the existing power purchase agreements that were in effect between the generating subsidiaries and their customers. ENPM functions include origination of new energy and capacity transactions, generation scheduling, contract management (including billing and settlements), and market and credit risk mitigation. Entergy Nuclear, Inc. pursues service agreements with other nuclear power plant owners who seek the advantages of Entergy’s scale and expertise but do not necessarily want to sell their assets. Services provided by either Entergy Nuclear, Inc. or other Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries include engineering, operations and maintenance, fuel procurement, management and supervision, technical support and training, administrative support, and other managerial or technical services required to operate, maintain, and decommission nuclear electric power facilities. Entergy Nuclear, Inc. provided decommissioning services for the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant and continues to pursue opportunities for Entergy Wholesale Commodities with other nuclear plant owners through operating agreements or innovative arrangements such as structured leases. 217 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Entergy Nuclear, Inc. also offers operating license renewal and life extension services to nuclear power plant owners. TLG Services, a subsidiary of Entergy Nuclear Inc., offers decommissioning, engineering, and related services to nuclear power plant owners. In April 2009, Entergy announced that it will team with energy firm ENERCON to offer nuclear development services ranging from plant relicensing to full-service, new plant deployment. ENERCON has experience in engineering, environmental, technical and management services. In September 2003, Entergy agreed to provide plant operation support services for the 800 MW Cooper Nuclear Station located near Brownville, Nebraska. The original contract was to expire in 2014 corresponding to the original operating license life of the plant. In 2006, an Entergy subsidiary signed an agreement to provide license renewal services for the Cooper Nuclear Station. The Cooper Nuclear Station received its license renewal from the NRC on November 29, 2010. Entergy continues to provide implementation services for the renewed license. In 2010 an Entergy subsidiary signed an agreement to extend the management support services to Cooper Nuclear Station by 15 years, through January 2029. Entergy-Koch Entergy-Koch is a joint venture owned 50% each by subsidiaries of Entergy and Koch Industries, Inc, and is no longer an operating entity. Entergy-Koch began operations on February 1, 2001. Entergy contributed most of the assets and trading contracts of its power marketing and trading business and $414 million cash to the venture and Koch contributed its approximately 8,000-mile Koch Gateway Pipeline (renamed Gulf South Pipeline), gas storage facilities, and Koch Energy Trading, which marketed and traded electricity, gas, weather derivatives, and other energy-related commodities and services. In the fourth quarter 2004, Entergy-Koch sold its energy trading and pipeline businesses to third parties. Entergy received $862 million of cash distributions in 2004 from Entergy-Koch after the business sales. Due to the November 2006 expiration of contingencies on the sale of Entergy-Koch’s trading business, and the corresponding release to Entergy-Koch of sales proceeds held in escrow, Entergy received additional cash distributions of approximately $163 million during the fourth quarter of 2006 and recorded a gain of approximately $55 million (net-of-tax). In December 2009, Entergy reorganized its investment in Entergy-Koch, received a $25.6 million cash distribution, and received a distribution of certain software owned by the joint venture. Regulation of Entergy’s Business Federal Power Act The Federal Power Act provides the FERC the authority to regulate: · the transmission and wholesale sale of electric energy in interstate commerce; · sales or acquisition of certain assets; · securities issuances; · the licensing of certain hydroelectric projects; · certain other activities, including accounting policies and practices of electric and gas utilities; and · changes in control of FERC jurisdictional entities or rate schedules. The Federal Power Act gives the FERC jurisdiction over the rates charged by System Energy for Grand Gulf capacity and energy provided to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans and over some of the rates charged by Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. The FERC also regulates the provisions of the System Agreement, including the rates, and the provision of transmission service to wholesale market participants. Entergy Arkansas holds a FERC license that expires in 2053 for two hydroelectric projects totaling 70 MW of capacity. 218 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy State Regulation Utility Entergy Arkansas is subject to regulation by the APSC, which includes the authority to: · oversee utility service; · set retail rates; · determine reasonable and adequate service; · control leasing; · control the acquisition or sale of any public utility plant or property constituting an operating unit or system; · set rates of depreciation; · issue certificates of convenience and necessity and certificates of environmental compatibility and public need; and · regulate the issuance and sale of certain securities. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s electric and gas business and Entergy Louisiana are subject to regulation by the LPSC as to: · utility service; · retail rates and charges; · certification of generating facilities; · certification of power or capacity purchase contracts; · audit of the fuel adjustment charge, environmental adjustment charge, and avoided cost payment to Qualifying Facilities; · integrated resource planning; · issuance and sale of certain securities; · utility mergers and acquisitions and other changes of control; · depreciation and other matters. Entergy Louisiana is also subject to the jurisdiction of the City Council with respect to such matters within Algiers in Orleans Parish, although the precise scope of that jurisdiction differs from that of the LPSC. Entergy Mississippi is subject to regulation by the MPSC as to the following: · utility service; · service areas; · facilities; · certification of certain transmission projects; and · retail rates. Entergy Mississippi is also subject to regulation by the APSC as to the certificate of environmental compatibility and public need for the Independence Station, which is located in Arkansas. Entergy New Orleans is subject to regulation by the City Council as to the following: · utility service; · retail rates and charges; · standards of service; · depreciation, · issuance and sale of certain securities; and · other matters. 219 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy To the extent authorized by governing legislation, Entergy Texas is subject to the original jurisdiction of the municipal authorities of a number of incorporated cities in Texas with appellate jurisdiction over such matters residing in the PUCT. Entergy Texas is also subject to regulation by the PUCT as to: · retail rates and service in unincorporated areas of its service territory, and in municipalities that have ceded jurisdiction to the PUCT; · customer service standards; · certification of certain transmission projects; and · extensions of service into new areas. Regulation of the Nuclear Power Industry Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, the operation of nuclear plants is heavily regulated by the NRC, which has broad power to impose licensing and safety-related requirements. The NRC has broad authority to impose fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, as owners of all or portions of ANO, River Bend, Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf, respectively, and Entergy Operations, as the licensee and operator of these units, are subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC. Entergy subsidiaries in the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment are subject to the NRC’s jurisdiction as the owners and operator of Pilgrim, Indian Point Energy Center, FitzPatrick, Vermont Yankee, and Palisades. Substantial capital expenditures at Entergy’s nuclear plants because of revised safety requirements of the NRC could be required in the future. Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 Spent Nuclear Fuel Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE is required, for a specified fee, to construct storage facilities for, and to dispose of, all spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive waste generated by domestic nuclear power reactors. Entergy’s nuclear owner/licensee subsidiaries provide for the estimated future disposal costs of spent nuclear fuel in accordance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The affected Entergy companies entered into contracts with the DOE, whereby the DOE is to furnish disposal services at a cost of one mill per net kWh generated and sold after April 7, 1983, plus a one-time fee for generation prior to that date. Entergy Arkansas is the only one of the Utility operating companies that generated electric power with nuclear fuel prior to that date and has a recorded liability as of December 31, 2011 of $181.0 million for the one-time fee. Entergy accepted assignment of the Pilgrim, FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3, Indian Point 1 and 2, Vermont Yankee, Palisades, and Big Rock Point spent fuel disposal contracts with the DOE held by their previous owners. The previous owners have paid or retained liability for the fees for all generation prior to the purchase dates of those plants. The fees payable to the DOE may be adjusted in the future to assure full recovery. Entergy considers all costs incurred for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, except accrued interest, to be proper components of nuclear fuel expense. Provisions to recover such costs have been or will be made in applications to regulatory authorities for the Utility plants. Entergy’s total spent fuel fees to date, including the one-time fee liability of Entergy Arkansas, have almost reached $1.5 billion. The permanent spent fuel repository in the U.S. has been legislated to be Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The DOE is required by law to proceed with the licensing (the DOE filed the license application in June 2008) and, after the license is granted by the NRC, proceed with the repository construction and commencement of receipt of spent fuel. Because the DOE has not begun accepting spent fuel, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts. The DOE continues to delay meeting its obligation. Moreover, the Obama administration has expressed its intention and taken specific steps to discontinue the Yucca 220 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Mountain project and study a new spent fuel strategy. Such actions include a motion to the NRC to withdraw the license application with prejudice and the establishment of a commission to develop recommendations for alternative spent fuel storage solutions. On June 29, 2010, however, a panel of the NRC’s Atomic Safety and Licensing Board denied the administration’s motion to withdraw the application. In November 2011 the NRC Commissioners issued an order effectively affirming the ASLB’s denial of the withdrawal, but the order also shut down the continued adjudication of the license application. Accordingly, large uncertainty remains regarding the time frame under which the DOE will begin to accept spent fuel from Entergy's facilities for storage or disposal. As a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at Entergy's nuclear sites. As a result of the DOE's failure to begin disposal of spent nuclear fuel in 1998 pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and the spent fuel disposal contracts, Entergy's nuclear owner/licensee subsidiaries have incurred and will continue to incur damages. In November 2003 these subsidiaries, except for the owner of Palisades, began litigation to recover the damages caused by the DOE's delay in performance. In October 2007, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims awarded $48.7 million jointly to System Fuels and Entergy Arkansas in damages related to the DOE's breach of its obligations. In a revised decision issued in March 2010, the court awarded $9.7 million jointly to System Fuels, System Energy, and SMEPA. Also in March 2010, in two separate decisions, the court awarded $106.1 million to Entergy Nuclear Indian Point 2, and $4.2 million to Entergy Nuclear Generation Company (the owner of Pilgrim). In September 2010 the court awarded $46.6 million to Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee. All of these decisions were appealed by the DOE to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In September 2011, the appeals court affirmed most of the Entergy Nuclear Generation Company award, but remanded to the trial court for recalculation of certain damages. In January 2012 the appeals court affirmed the System Fuels and Entergy Arkansas award in large part, and reversed the trial court’s denial of certain damages sought, but remanded to the trial court for recalculation of certain damages. Also in January 2012, the appeals court affirmed the System Fuels, System Energy and SMEPA award, and reversed the trial court’s denial of certain damages, raising the final award to $10.2 million. Management cannot predict the timing or amount of any potential recoveries on other claims filed by Entergy subsidiaries, and cannot predict the timing of any eventual receipt from the DOE of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims damage awards. Pending DOE acceptance and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, the owners of nuclear plants are providing their own spent fuel storage. Storage capability additions using dry casks began operations at Palisades in 1993, at ANO in 1996, at FitzPatrick in 2002, at River Bend in 2005, at Grand Gulf in 2006, at Indian Point and Vermont Yankee in 2008, and at Waterford 3 in 2011. These facilities will be expanded as needed. Current on-site spent fuel storage capacity at Pilgrim is estimated to be sufficient until approximately 2014, by which time dry cask storage facilities are planned to be placed into service at that unit. Nuclear Plant Decommissioning Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Texas, and System Energy are entitled to recover from customers through electric rates the estimated decommissioning costs for ANO, the portion of River Bend subject to retail rate regulation, Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf, respectively. These amounts are deposited in trust funds that can only be used for future decommissioning costs. Entergy periodically reviews and updates the estimated decommissioning costs to reflect inflation and changes in regulatory requirements and technology, and then makes applications to the regulatory authorities to reflect, in rates, the changes in projected decommissioning costs. In 2008, Entergy experienced declines in the market value of assets held in the trust funds for meeting the decommissioning funding assurance obligations for the nuclear plants. This decline adversely affected certain Entergy subsidiaries’ abilities to demonstrate compliance with the NRC’s requirements for providing financial assurance for decommissioning funding for some of its plants. Following a review in 2009, Entergy concluded that there was a funding shortfall for Vermont Yankee of approximately $40 million, which it satisfied with a $40 million guarantee from Entergy Corporation that was effective as of December 31, 2009. For Waterford 3 and River Bend, Entergy subsidiaries made appropriate filings by December 31, 2009 with their retail regulators that requested decommissioning funding from customers to address the shortfalls identified by the NRC. On July 28, 2010, the LPSC approved increased decommissioning collections for Waterford 3 and the Louisiana regulated share of River Bend. On December 13, 2010, the PUCT approved increased decommissioning collections for the Texas share of River Bend. Entergy currently believes its decommissioning funding will be sufficient to address the identified shortfalls, although decommissioning cost inflation and trust fund performance will ultimately determine the adequacy of the funding amounts. 221 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy For the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick plants purchased in 2000, NYPA retained the decommissioning trusts and the decommissioning liability. NYPA and Entergy subsidiaries executed decommissioning agreements, which specify their decommissioning obligations. NYPA has the right to require the Entergy subsidiaries to assume the decommissioning liability provided that it assigns the corresponding decommissioning trust, up to a specified level, to the Entergy subsidiaries. If the decommissioning liability is retained by NYPA, the responsible Entergy subsidiary will perform the decommissioning of the plants at a price equal to the lesser of a pre-specified level or the amount in the decommissioning trusts. Additional information with respect to Entergy’s decommissioning costs and decommissioning trust funds is found in Note 9 and Note 17 to the financial statements. Price-Anderson Act The Price-Anderson Act requires that reactor licensees purchase insurance and participate in a secondary insurance pool that provides insurance coverage for the public in the event of a nuclear power plant accident. The costs of this insurance are borne by the nuclear power industry. Congress amended and renewed the Price-Anderson Act in 2005 for a term through 2025. The Price-Anderson Act limits contingent liability for a single nuclear incident to approximately $117.5 million per reactor (with 104 nuclear industry reactors currently participating). Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities have protection with respect to this liability through a combination of private insurance and an industry assessment program, as well as insurance for property damage, costs of replacement power, and other risks relating to nuclear generating units. The Price-Anderson Act and insurance applicable to the nuclear programs of Entergy are discussed in more detail in Note 8 to the financial statements. Environmental Regulation Entergy’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy’s businesses are in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance requirements and costs cannot be precisely estimated. Except to the extent discussed below, at this time compliance with federal, state, and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise protecting the environment, is incorporated into the routine cost structure of Entergy’s businesses and is not expected to have a material effect on their competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Clean Air Act and Subsequent Amendments The Clean Air Act and its amendments establish several programs that currently or in the future may affect Entergy’s fossil-fueled generation facilities and, to a much lesser extent, certain operations at nuclear and other facilities. Individual states also operate similar independent state programs or delegated federal programs that may include requirements more stringent than federal regulatory requirements. These programs include: · New source review and preconstruction permits for new sources of criteria air pollutants and significant modifications to existing facilities; · Acid rain program for control of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx); · Nonattainment area programs for control of criteria air pollutants; · Hazardous air pollutant emissions reduction programs; · Interstate Air Transport; · Operating permits program for administration and enforcement of these and other Clean Air Act programs; and · Regional Haze and Best Available Retrofit Technology programs. 222 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy New Source Review (NSR) Preconstruction permits are required for new facilities and for existing facilities that undergo a modification that results in a significant net emissions increase and is not classified as routine repair, maintenance, or replacement. Units that undergo a non-routine modification must obtain a permit modification and may be required to install additional air pollution control technologies. Entergy has an established process for identifying modifications requiring additional permitting approval and has followed the regulations and associated guidance provided by the states and the federal government with regard to the determination of routine repair, maintenance, and replacement. In recent years, however, the EPA has begun an enforcement initiative, aimed primarily at coal plants, to identify modifications that it does not consider routine for which the unit did not obtain a modified permit. Various courts and the EPA have been inconsistent in their judgments regarding modifications that are considered routine. In September 2010 the owner of a minority interest in Entergy’s White Bluff and Independence facilities, both located in Arkansas, received a request from the EPA for several categories of information concerning capital and maintenance projects at the facilities in order to determine compliance with the Clean Air Act. The EPA request for information does not allege that either facility violated the law. In February 2011, Entergy received a similar request from the EPA and has responded to it. In August 2011, Entergy’s Nelson facility, located in Louisiana, received a similar request for information from the EPA. Entergy responded to this request. Acid Rain Program The Clean Air Act provides SO2 allowances to most of the affected Entergy generating units for emissions based upon past emission levels and operating characteristics. Each allowance is an entitlement to emit one ton of SO2 per year. Plant owners are required to possess allowances for SO2 emissions from affected generating units. Virtually all Entergy fossil-fueled generating units are subject to SO2 allowance requirements. Entergy could be required to purchase additional allowances when it generates power using fuel oil. Fuel oil usage is determined by economic dispatch and influenced by the price of natural gas, incremental emission allowance costs, and the availability and cost of purchased power. Ozone Nonattainment Entergy Texas operates one fossil-fueled generating unit (Lewis Creek) in a geographic area that is not in attainment of the currently-enforced national ambient air quality standards for ozone. The nonattainment area that affects Entergy Texas is the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area. Areas in nonattainment are classified as "marginal," "moderate," "serious," or "severe." When an area fails to meet the ambient air standard, the EPA requires state regulatory authorities to prepare state implementation plans meant to cause progress toward bringing the area into attainment with applicable standards. The Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area was originally classified as "moderate" nonattainment under the 8-hour standard with an attainment date of June 15, 2010. On June 15, 2007, the Texas governor petitioned the EPA to reclassify Houston-Galveston-Brazoria from "moderate" to "severe." On October 1, 2008, the EPA granted the request by the Texas governor to voluntarily reclassify the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area from a "moderate" 8-hour ozone nonattainment area to a "severe" 8-hour ozone nonattainment area. The EPA also set April 15, 2010, as the date for the State of Texas to submit a revised state implementation plan (SIP) addressing the "severe" ozone nonattainment area requirements of the Clean Air Act. In March 2010 the Texas commission adopted the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria Attainment Demonstration SIP Revision and the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria Reasonable Further Progress SIP Revision for the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard and associated rules. EPA approval is pending. The area's new attainment date for the 8-hour ozone standard is as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than June 15, 2019. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana operates two fossil-fueled generating facilities in the Baton Rouge metropolitan area which was previously classified as a non-attainment area for the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard. However, in November 2011, the EPA finalized approval of Louisiana’s request to redesignate the Baton Rouge area to attainment for this standard. Louisiana has demonstrated that the five parish area (East Baton Rouge, Ascension, Iberville, Livingston and West Baton Rouge parishes) will be able to maintain compliance with the ozone standard for the next ten years. 223 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy In December 2006, the EPA's revocation of the 1-hour ozone standard was rejected in a judicial proceeding. As a result, numerous requirements can return for areas that had been designated as nonattainment for this standard. These requirements include the potential to increase emission fees significantly for plants operating in these areas pursuant to Section 185 of the Clean Air Act. In addition, it is possible that new emission controls may be required. Specific costs of compliance cannot be estimated at this time, but Entergy is monitoring development of the respective state implementation plans and will develop specific compliance strategies as the plans move through the adoption process. (The Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area was classified as “severe” nonattainment for 1-hour ozone.) In March 2008, the EPA revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone, creating the potential for additional counties and parishes in which Entergy operates to be placed in nonattainment status. The LDEQ recommended that eleven parishes be designated as nonattainment for the 75 parts per billion ozone standard. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana owns and operates two fossil plants and Entergy Louisiana owns and operates one fossil plant affected by this recommendation. In Arkansas, the governor recommended that Pulaski County be designated in nonattainment with the new ozone standard, where two of Entergy Arkansas’s smaller facilities are located. These initial recommendations were not approved by the EPA, however, due to various procedural delays. In September 2011, the EPA announced that it will begin implementing the 2008 ozone standards by requiring that states resubmit recommendations for nonattainment status. In Entergy’s utility service area, EPA predicts that the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria, Texas; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Memphis, Tennessee/Arkansas areas will be in non-attainment. Nonattainment designations are expected to be final in mid-2012. Following nonattainment designation, states will be required to develop state implementation plans that outline control requirements that will enable the affected counties and parishes to reach attainment status. Entergy facilities in these areas may be subject to installation of NOx controls, but the degree of control will remain unknown until the state implementation plans are developed. Entergy will continue to monitor and engage in the state implementation plan development process in Entergy states. Potential SO2 Nonattainment The EPA issued a final rule in June 2010 adopting an SO2 1-hour national ambient air quality standard of 75 ppb. The EPA designations for counties in attainment and nonattainment are expected in June 2012. Analysis will be required to determine whether emissions from Entergy facilities contribute significantly to any violation of this new standard. If violations exist, additional capital projects or operational changes may be required. Hazardous Air Pollutants The EPA has been in the process of developing a Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) retrofit standard for new and existing coal and oil-fired units. The EPA released the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS) rule in December 2011. Entergy currently is reviewing the rule and developing compliance plans to meet requirements of the rule, which could result in significant capital expenditures for Entergy’s coal-fired units. Compliance with MATS is required by the Clean Air Act within three years, or by 2015, although certain extensions of this deadline are available from state permit authorities and the EPA. Interstate Air Transport In March 2005, the EPA finalized the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which was intended to reduce SO2 and NOx emissions from electric generation plants in order to improve air quality in twenty-nine eastern states. The rule required a combination of investment of capital to install pollution control equipment and increased operating costs through the purchase of emission allowances. Entergy began implementation in 2007, including installation of controls at several facilities and the development of an emission allowance procurement strategy. 224 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Based on several court challenges, the CAIR was vacated and remanded to the EPA by the D.C. Circuit in 2008. The court allowed the CAIR to become effective in January 2009, while the EPA revised the rule. On July 7, 2011, the EPA released its final Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR, which previously was referred to as the Transport Rule). The rule is directed at limiting the interstate transport of emissions of NOx and SO2 as precursors to ozone and fine particulate matter. The final rule provides a significantly lower number of allowances to Entergy’s Utility states than did the draft rule. Entergy’s capital investment and annual allowance purchase costs under the CSAPR will depend on the economic assessment of NOx and SO2 allowance markets, the cost of control technologies, generation unit utilization, and the availability and cost of purchased power. Entergy filed a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and a petition with the EPA for reconsideration of the rule and stay of its effectiveness. Several other parties filed similar petitions. On December 30, 2011, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals stayed CSAPR and instructed EPA to continue administering CAIR, pending further judicial review. Oral argument in the case is scheduled for April 2012. The court of appeals may reverse or remand the rule in whole or in part, or may affirm the rule. This uncertainty makes it impossible to predict costs of compliance. In the interim, Entergy is taking measures to prepare for compliance with either CAIR as it continues to be implemented or CSAPR, if it is affirmed in whole or in part or eventually reissued. In October 2011 the EPA released a proposed rule increasing the emission allocation budgets for some states and moving the limited trading period back to 2014. This proposal also increased the Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas NOx allocation budgets. The EPA has not finalized this proposal. Regional Haze In June 2005, the EPA issued final Best Available Retrofit Control Technology (BART) regulations that could potentially result in a requirement to install SO2 and NOx pollution control technology on certain of Entergy’s coal and oil generation units. The rule leaves certain BART determinations to the states. The Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) prepared a State Implementation Plan (SIP) for Arkansas facilities to implement its obligations under the Clean Air Visibility Rule. The ADEQ determined that Entergy Arkansas’s White Bluff power plant affects a Class I Area’s visibility and will be subject to the EPA’s presumptive BART limits, which likely would require the installation of scrubbers and low NOx burners. Under then-current state regulations, the scrubbers would have had to be operational by October 2013. Entergy Arkansas filed a petition in December 2009 with the Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission requesting a variance from this deadline, however, because the EPA has expressed concerns about Arkansas’s Regional Haze SIP and questioned the appropriateness of issuing an air permit prior to that approval. EAI’s petition requested that, consistent with federal law, the compliance deadline be changed to as expeditiously as practicable, but in no event later than five years after EPA approval of the Arkansas Regional Haze SIP. The Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission approved the variance in March 2010. In October 2011 the EPA released a proposed rule addressing the Arkansas Regional Haze SIP. In the proposal the EPA disapproves a large portion of the Arkansas Regional Haze SIP, including the emission limits for NOx and SO2 at White Bluff. The EPA did not issue a Federal Implementation Plan for regional haze requirements because Arkansas has indicated it wishes to correct its SIP and resubmit it. Due to an extension in the comment period for the proposed rule, EPA has yet to issue a final rule. It is expected that after the EPA’s proposed rule becomes final, there will be a two-year timeframe in which the EPA must either approve a SIP issued by Arkansas or issue a Federal Implementation Plan. Potential Legislative, Regulatory, and Judicial Developments (Air) In addition to the specific instances described above, there are a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to the reduction of emissions that are under consideration at the federal, state, and local level. Because of the nature of Entergy’s business, the imposition of any of these initiatives could affect Entergy’s operations. Entergy continues to monitor these initiatives and activities in order to analyze their potential operational and cost implications. These initiatives include: · designation by the EPA and state environmental agencies of areas that are not in attainment with national ambient air quality standards; 225 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy · introduction of bills in Congress and development of regulations by the EPA proposing further limits on NOx, SO2, mercury, and carbon dioxide and other gas emissions. New legislation or regulations applicable to stationary sources could take the form of market-based cap-and-trade programs, direct requirements for the installation of air emission controls onto air emission sources, or other or combined regulatory programs. Entergy cannot estimate the effect of any future legislation at this time due to the uncertainty of the regulatory format; · efforts to implement a voluntary program intended to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and efforts in Congress to establish a mandatory federal carbon dioxide emission control structure; · passage and implementation of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative by several states in the northeastern United States and similar actions in other regions of the United States; · efforts on the state and federal level to codify renewable portfolio standards requiring utilities to produce or purchase a certain percentage of their power from defined renewable energy sources; · efforts to develop more stringent state water quality standards, effluent limitations for Entergy’s industry sector, stormwater runoff control regulations, and cooling water intake structure requirements; and · efforts by certain external groups to encourage reporting and disclosure of carbon dioxide emissions and risk. Entergy has prepared responses for the Carbon Disclosure Project’s (CDP) annual questionnaire for the past several years and has given permission for those responses to be posted to CDP’s website. In addition to these initiatives, certain states and environmental advocacy groups sought judicial action to require the EPA to promulgate regulations under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act to control carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. In April 2007 the U.S. Supreme Court held that the EPA is authorized by the current provisions of the Clean Air Act to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide and other “greenhouse gases” as “pollutants” (Massachusetts v. EPA) and that the EPA is required to regulate these emissions from motor vehicles if the emissions are anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. The Supreme Court directed the EPA to make further findings in this regard. Entergy participated as a friend of the court in Massachusetts v. EPA. Entergy will continue to advocate in support of reasonable market-based regulation of carbon dioxide. Entergy has also supported the comments of various industry groups advocating national legislation to address carbon dioxide emissions instead of attempting to regulate under the provisions of the Clean Air Act. Entergy continues to monitor these and similar actions in order to analyze their potential operational and cost implications and benefits. In 2009 the EPA published an “endangerment finding” stating that the emission of “greenhouse” gases “may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare” and that the emission of these pollutants from mobile sources (such as cars and trucks) contributes to this endangerment. The EPA issued final mobile source emission regulations on April 1, 2010. On April 2, 2010, the EPA issued a policy stating that the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources would, as of January 2, 2011 (the date that the mobile source rule “takes effect”), trigger the regulation of greenhouse gases from stationary sources under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act. In June 2010 the EPA published the final Tailoring Rule outlining the applicability criteria that determine which stationary sources and modification projects become subject to permitting requirements for greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. The Tailoring Rule establishes a two-step process for implementing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the PSD and Title V programs. The first step, which began on January 2, 2011, limits the applicability of the PSD and Title V requirements for greenhouse gas emissions to sources that are already subject to PSD and Title V based on the emission of non-greenhouse gas pollutants. Specifically, projects undertaken at stationary sources will trigger PSD permitting requirements if the project increases net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 75,000 tons per year carbon dioxide equivalent and significantly increases emissions of at least one non-greenhouse gas pollutant. During step one, only sources subject to Title V based on their emission of non-greenhouse gas pollutants were required to address greenhouse gas emissions in their Title V permit. The second step of the Tailoring Rule, which began on July 1, 2011, subjects to Title V requirements any new or existing source not already subject to Title V that emits, or has the potential to emit, at least 100,000 tons per year carbon dioxide equivalent. In addition, new sources that have the potential to emit at least 100,000 tons per year carbon dioxide equivalent and significantly modified existing sources that emit or have the potential to emit at least 75,000 tons per year carbon dioxide equivalent are subject to PSD requirements. 226 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Both the Endangerment Finding and the Tailoring Rule are subject to pending judicial review. The rules have not been stayed by the court and are in effect pending review. Entergy continues to support national legislation that would increase planning certainty for electric utilities while addressing carbon dioxide emissions in a responsible and flexible manner. By virtue of its proportionally large investment in low- or non-emitting gas-fired and nuclear generation technologies, Entergy has a low overall carbon dioxide emission “intensity,” or rate of carbon dioxide emitted per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated. In anticipation of the potential imposition of carbon dioxide emission limits on the electric industry in the future, Entergy initiated actions designed to reduce its exposure to potential new governmental requirements related to carbon dioxide emissions. These voluntary actions included establishment of a formal program to stabilize power plant carbon dioxide emissions at 2000 levels through 2005, and Entergy succeeded in actually reducing emissions below 2000 levels. Total carbon dioxide emissions representing Entergy’s ownership share of power plants in the United States were approximately 53.2 million tons in 2000 and 35.6 million tons in 2005. In 2006, Entergy changed its method of calculating emissions and now includes emissions from controllable power purchases as well as its ownership share of generation. Entergy established a second formal voluntary program to stabilize power plant carbon dioxide emissions and emissions from controllable power purchases at 20% below 2000 levels through 2010. Entergy has extended this commitment through 2020. Total carbon dioxide emissions representing Entergy’s ownership share of power plants and controllable power purchases in the United States were approximately 44.9 million tons in 2010 and approximately 46.3 million tons in 2011. Greenhouse Gas Reporting In September 2009, the EPA finalized a rule to require reporting of several greenhouse gases. This rule will require Entergy to report annually greenhouse gas emissions from operating power plants and natural gas distribution operations. Entergy developed compliance plans, collected the necessary data, and reported as required in 2011. New Source Performance Standards for Greenhouse Gas Emissions The EPA announced a schedule for establishing new source performance standards (NSPS) for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from power plants and refineries. Under the schedule, the EPA would have issued proposed regulations for power plants by July 26, 2011 and final regulations no later than May 26, 2012. However, the EPA has not yet issued the proposed regulations. These regulations would establish GHG NSPS for new and significantly modified sources, and possibly emission guidelines for existing sources. Entergy will continue to monitor and be engaged in the rulemaking process. Nelson Unit 6 (Entergy Gulf States Louisiana) Entergy Gulf States Louisiana self-reported to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) potential exceedances of annual carbon monoxide emission limits at the Nelson Unit 6 coal-fired facility for the years 2006-2010 and the failure to report these potential exceedances in semi-annual reporting and in annual Title V compliance certifications. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is not required to monitor carbon monoxide emissions from Nelson Unit 6 on a regular or continuous schedule. Stack tests performed in 2010 appear to indicate carbon monoxide emissions in excess of the maximum hourly limit for three 1-hour test runs and the annual limit. Comparison of the 2010 stack tests with the most recent previous tests from 2006, however, appear to indicate that the permit limits were calculated incorrectly and should have been higher. The 2010 test emission levels did not cause a violation of National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Additionally, the 2010 stack testing, which was performed in compliance with an EPA data request connected to the EPA’s development of a new air emissions rule, was not taken during a period of normal and representative operations for Nelson Unit 6. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana continues to develop data regarding this matter in coordination with the LDEQ. In December 2011, the LDEQ issued a compliance order setting limits for the unit until and if the permit is modified and issued a notice of potential penalty requiring the submission of additional information. 227 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Clean Water Act The 1972 amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (known as the Clean Water Act) provide the statutory basis for the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program and the basic structure for regulating the discharge of pollutants from point sources to waters of the United States. The Clean Water Act requires virtually all discharges of pollutants to waters of the United States to be permitted. Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act regulates cooling water intake structures, section 401 of the Clean Water Act requires a water quality certification from the state in support of certain federal actions and approvals, and section 404 regulates the dredge and fill of waters of the United States, including jurisdictional wetlands. NPDES Permits and Section 401 Water Quality Certifications NPDES permits are subject to renewal every five years. Consequently, Entergy is currently in various stages of the data evaluation and discharge permitting process for its power plants. Additionally, the State of New York (and more recently, Vermont) has taken the position that a new state-issued water quality certification is required as part of the NRC license renewal process. Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ Indian Point nuclear facility in New York is seeking a new section 401 certification prior to license renewal under full reservation of rights. Indian Point Entergy is involved in an administrative permitting process with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) for renewal of the Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 discharge permits. In November 2003, the NYSDEC issued a draft permit indicating that closed cycle cooling would be considered the “best technology available” for minimizing alleged adverse environmental effects attributable to the intake of cooling water at Indian Point, subject to a feasibility determination and alternatives analysis for that technology, if Entergy applied for and received NRC license renewal for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3. Upon becoming effective, the draft permit also would have required payment of approximately $24 million annually, and an annual 42 unit-day outage period, until closed cycle cooling is implemented. Entergy is participating in the administrative process to request that the draft permit be modified prior to final issuance, and opposes any requirement to install cooling towers at Indian Point. An August 2008 ruling by the NYSDEC’s Assistant Commissioner has restructured the permitting and administrative process, including the application of a new economic test designed to implement the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals standard in that court’s review of EPA’s cooling water intake structure rules, which is discussed in the 316(b) Cooling Water Intake Structures section below. The NYSDEC has directed Entergy to develop detailed feasibility information regarding the construction and operation of cooling towers, and alternatives to closed cycle cooling, prior to the issuance of a new draft permit by the NYSDEC staff and commencement of the adjudicatory proceeding. The reports include a visual impact and aesthetics report filed in June 2009, a plume and emissions report filed in September 2009, a technical feasibility report and alternatives analysis filed in February 2010, and an economic report to establish whether the technology, if feasible, satisfies the economic test that is part of the New York standard. Entergy has also requested that the Assistant Commissioner reconsider the New York standard in light of the U.S. Supreme Court decision reversing the Second Circuit’s alternative economic test adopted in the August 2008 ruling. In February 2010, Entergy provided to the NYSDEC an updated estimate of the capital cost to retrofit Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 with cooling towers. Construction costs for retrofitting with cooling towers are estimated to be at least $1.19 billion, in addition to lost generation of approximately 14.5 terawatt-hours (TWh) during the forced outage of both units that is estimated to take at least 42 weeks. Entergy also proposed an alternative to the cooling towers, the use of cylindrical wedgewire screens, the capital costs of which are currently expected to be approximately $200 million to $250 million to install. Because a cooling tower retrofitting of this size and complexity 228 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy has never been undertaken at an operating nuclear facility, significant uncertainties exist in the capital cost estimates and, therefore, the actual capital costs could be materially higher than estimated. Moreover, construction outage-related costs to Entergy have not been calculated because of the significant variability in power pricing at any given time, but they are expected to be significant and may exceed the capital costs. The capital cost estimate for the wedgewire screen construction is also subject to uncertainty. Hearings on certain issues began in 2011 in consolidation with certain issues in the water quality certification matter that is discussed further below. The NYSDEC is expected to consider the information submitted and issue another draft permit with a new best technology available determination, which could still be cooling towers. A new comment period and further contested proceedings likely would follow. Entergy submitted its application for a water quality certification to the NYSDEC in April 2009, with a reservation of rights regarding the applicability of Section 401 in this case. After Entergy submitted certain additional information in response to NYSDEC requests for additional information, in February 2010 the NYSDEC staff determined that Entergy’s water quality certification application was complete. In April 2010 the NYSDEC staff issued a proposed notice of denial of Entergy’s water quality certification application (the Notice). NYSDEC staff’s Notice triggered an administrative adjudicatory hearing before NYSDEC ALJs on the proposed Notice. The NYSDEC staff decision does not restrict Indian Point operations, but the issuance of a certification is potentially required prior to NRC issuance of renewed unit licenses. In June 2011, Entergy filed notice with the NRC that the NYSDEC, the agency that would issue or deny a water quality certification for the Indian Point license renewal process, has taken longer than one year to take final action on Entergy’s application for a water quality certification and, therefore, has waived its opportunity to require a certification under the provisions of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. The NYSDEC has notified the NRC that it disagrees with Entergy’s position and does not believe that it has waived the right to require a certification. The NYSDEC ALJs overseeing the agency’s certification adjudicatory process stated in a ruling issued in July 2011 that while the waiver issue is pending before the NRC, the NYSDEC hearing process will continue on selected issues. The judge held a Legislative Hearing (agency public comment session) and an Issues Conference (pre-trial conference) in July 2010 and set certain issues for trial in October 2011, which is continuing into 2012. After the full hearing on the merits, the ALJs will issue a recommended decision to the Commissioner who will then issue the final agency decision. A party to the proceeding can appeal the decision of the Commissioner to state court. 316(b) Cooling Water Intake Structures EPA finalized regulations in July 2004 governing the intake of water at large existing power plants employing cooling water intake structures. The rule sought to reduce perceived impacts on aquatic resources by requiring covered facilities to implement technology or other measures to meet EPA-targeted reductions in water use and corresponding perceived aquatic impacts. Entergy, other industry members and industry groups, environmental groups, and a coalition of northeastern and mid-Atlantic states challenged various aspects of the rule. In January 2007, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the rule to the EPA for reconsideration. The court instructed the EPA to reconsider several aspects of the rule that were beneficial to businesses affected by the rule after finding that these provisions of the rule were contrary to the language of the Clean Water Act or were not sufficiently explained in the rule. In April 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the Second Circuit decision on the question of whether the EPA may take into consideration a cost-benefit analysis in developing these regulations, a consideration of potential benefit to businesses affected by the rule that the Second Circuit disallowed. In March 2009, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the petitioners that cost-benefit analysis may be taken into consideration. The EPA reissued the proposed rule in April 2011, with finalization anticipated by July 27, 2012. Entergy filed comments with the EPA on the proposed rule. At the request of the EPA Region 1 (Boston), Entergy submitted extensive data to the agency in July 2008 concerning cooling water intake impacts at the Pilgrim nuclear power plant. The Engineering Study, included as part of the July 2008 submittal, concluded that cooling towers are not feasible due to restrictions in the plant's condenser design and capacity. Other technologies, such as variable speed pumps and the relocation of the cooling water intake, were also analyzed as part of that submittal. EPA has not yet responded to the July 2008 submittal. Entergy will continue to review the revised proposed rule and monitor the activities of the EPA and the states toward the implementation of section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act. Until analysis of this revised proposed rule is complete, deadlines for determining compliance with Section 316(b) and for any required capital or operational expenditures are unknown at this time. As a result, management cannot predict the amounts Entergy will ultimately be required to spend to comply with Section 316(b) and any related state regulations, although such amounts could be significant. 229 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Coastal Zone Management Act The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) requires federally-permitted activities within a coastal zone to be consistent with the state’s federally-approved coastal zone management program. Accordingly, Entergy must ensure that the requirements of the CZMA, which is administered in New York primarily by the New York Department of State, are satisfied before the NRC may issue renewed licenses for Indian Point 2 and 3. Indian Point expects to file its consistency determination application with the New York Department of State in 2012. When the application is deemed complete, the New York Department of State has six months from the date of the application to issue or deny the consistency certification. Groundwater at Certain Nuclear Sites The NRC requires nuclear power plants to regularly monitor and report the presence of radioactive material in the environment. Entergy joined other nuclear utilities and the Nuclear Energy Institute in 2006 to develop a voluntary groundwater monitoring and protection program. This initiative began after detection of very low levels of radioactive material, primarily tritium, in groundwater at several plants in the United States. Tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen that occurs naturally and is also a byproduct of nuclear plant operations. In addition to tritium, other radionuclides have been found in on site ground water at nuclear plants. As part of the groundwater monitoring and protection program, Entergy has: (1) performed reviews of plant groundwater characteristics (hydrology) and historical records of past events on site that may have potentially impacted groundwater; (2) implemented fleet procedures on how to handle events that could impact groundwater; and (3) installed groundwater monitoring wells and began periodic sampling. The program also includes protocols for notifying local officials if contamination is found. To date, radionuclides such as tritium have been detected at Entergy’s FitzPatrick, Indian Point, Palisades, Pilgrim, Grand Gulf, Vermont Yankee, and River Bend plants. Based on current information, the concentrations and locations of tritium detected at these plants pose no threat to public health or safety. At FitzPatrick, twenty-one (21) monitoring wells are installed and being routinely monitored for tritium and other radioisotopes. Tritium and Strontium-90 have been detected in several of these wells at trace concentrations well below the EPA drinking water standard. A more significant concentration of tritium was identified in the reactor building perimeter drain piping and associated collection sump. The site identified the sources as a piping leak that subsequently migrated to the environment via a failed concrete expansion joint. Repairs to the piping system were completed in September 2010. There are no drinking water wells on-site. Entergy identified and addressed two sources of the contamination at Indian Point: the Unit 1 and 2 spent fuel pools. In October 2007, the EPA announced that it was consulting with the NRC and the NYSDEC regarding Indian Point. The EPA stated that after reviewing data it confirmed with New York State that there have been no violations of federal drinking water standards for radionuclides in drinking water supplies. Indian Point has implemented an extensive groundwater monitoring and protection program, including installing approximately 35 monitoring wells. Entergy has been working cooperatively with the NRC and the NYSDEC in a split sample program to independently analyze test samples. At Palisades, Entergy identified tritium in two groundwater monitoring wells in December 2007 caused by leakage from the buried piping for a recirculation line. Following investigation and repair work on this line, the decision was made to abandon the line and install new, replacement buried pipe for this system. This effort was completed in December 2009. Groundwater from three site monitoring wells continued to show positive detections of tritium resulting in renewed investigation and subsequent piping repair during May 2011. Monitoring wells are being sampled and analyzed on a bi-weekly basis and remaining site monitoring wells are being sampled and analyzed quarterly. 230 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy At Pilgrim, 18 monitoring wells are being sampled and analyzed on a routine basis. Results continue to show low levels of tritium. A hydrogeological analysis was performed in 2009 to pinpoint locations for additional evaluation wells, and these wells were installed in 2010. Tritium was discovered in two onsite wells. Investigations are underway to determine the source of the tritium, and split sampling is being performed routinely with the State of Massachusetts. In order to further its tritium investigations, Pilgrim added two more groundwater monitoring wells in December 2011, bringing the total number of monitoring wells to 20. The Pilgrim tritium technical team meets twice per week to discuss investigative options and weekly update calls are held with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. At Grand Gulf, groundwater samples collected in June 2010 and thereafter have revealed the presence of low-level tritium. These groundwater detections are believed to be from a leak of a temporary chiller unit that occurred in 1997. The leak was detected and halted in 1997, but approximately 1,200 gallons of water spilled from the temporary chiller unit. In addition to these groundwater samples, certain surface water samples at Grand Gulf also have detected the presence of low-level tritium. These surface water detections are believed to be from tritium recapture from atmospheric deposition; however, further analysis and investigation are taking place to determine the cause of all the tritium detections. In January 2010, Vermont Yankee was notified by its off-site analytical laboratory that a sample collected from a groundwater monitoring well in mid-November 2009 showed elevated levels of tritium. In March 2010, Vermont Yankee announced that it had identified the source of the tritium leakage at the plant, and that it had stopped the leakage. Remediation of the soil is complete and groundwater remediation is ongoing. In September 2011 the NRC concluded that Vermont Yankee had complied with all applicable regulatory requirements and standards pertaining to radiological effluent monitoring, dose and assessment and radiological evaluation. It also found that there has been no impact on public health and safety due to the groundwater contamination event that led to the detection of tritium in groundwater samples in January 2010. In February 2010 the Vermont Public Service Board (VPSB) began a proceeding to conduct an investigation into whether Vermont Yankee should be required to cease operations, or take other ameliorative actions, pending completion of repairs to stop releases of tritium or other radionuclides into the environment. This investigation will also consider whether good cause exists to modify or revoke the Vermont Yankee certificate of public good that the VPSB issued in 2002 and whether any penalties should be imposed on Vermont Yankee for any identified violations of Vermont statutes or VPSB orders related to those releases. The proceeding and VPSB investigation were opened prior to Vermont Yankee locating the source and beginning the remediation of the tritium leaking into groundwater at the site. The VPSB conceded in its order that its jurisdiction to impose some or all of the relief requested may be preempted by federal law or regulation, and the parties were asked to brief preemption issues during the initial phase of the proceeding. Initial and reply briefs on the issue of the VPSB’s jurisdiction were filed by the parties, including Vermont Yankee, in August and September 2010. The VPSB held evidentiary hearings in January 2011 on the facts of the tritium leakage and remediation and on various parties’ requests for relief. There is no schedule for decision by the VPSB on jurisdiction or other issues. In December 2011, River Bend sampled a groundwater well previously installed for the purpose of collecting groundwater elevation measurements. The sample revealed the presence of tritium above the drinking water threshold set by the EPA. No groundwater wells are used for drinking on-site and tritium was not detected in any wells downgradient or surrounding this well. Notification was made to the NRC, as well as to state and local agencies. Entergy is performing an evaluation and review of this condition. Indian Point Units 1 and 2 Hazardous Waste Remediation As part of the effort to terminate the current Indian Point 2 mixed waste storage permit, Entergy was required to perform groundwater and soil sampling for metals, PCBs and other non-radiological contaminants on plant property, regardless of whether these contaminants stem from onsite activities or were related to the waste stored on-site pursuant to the permit. Entergy believes this permit is no longer necessary for the facility due to an exemption for mixed wastes (hazardous waste that is also radioactive) promulgated as part of the EPA’s hazardous waste regulations. This exemption allows mixed waste to be regulated through the NRC license instead of through a separate 231 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy EPA or state hazardous waste permit. In February 2008, Entergy submitted its report on this sampling effort to the NYSDEC. The report indicated the presence of various metals in soils and groundwater at levels above the NYSDEC cleanup objectives. It does not appear that these metals are connected to operation of the nuclear facility. At the request of the NYSDEC, Entergy submitted a plan in August 2008 for a study that identified the sources of the metals. The NYSDEC approved the work plan with some conditions related to the need to study whether the soil impact observed may have originated from plant construction materials. Entergy has conducted additional sampling and currently is evaluating the results in order to provide additional information to the NYSDEC. Entergy is unable to determine what the extent or cost of required remediation, if any, will be at this time. Prior to Entergy’s purchase of Indian Point Unit 1, the previous owner completed the cleanup and desludging of the Unit 1 water storage pool, generating mixed waste. The waste currently is stored in the Unit 1 containment building in accordance with NRC regulations controlling low level radioactive waste. The waste is also regulated by the NYSDEC. The NYSDEC requires a quarterly survey of the availability of any commercial facility capable of treating, processing, and disposing of this waste in a commercially reasonable manner. Entergy continues to review this matter and to conduct its quarterly searches for a commercially reasonable vendor that is acceptable both to the NRC and the NYSDEC. The cost of this disposal cannot be estimated at this time due to the many variables existing in the type and manner of disposal. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA), authorizes the EPA to mandate clean-up by, or to collect reimbursement of clean-up costs from, owners or operators of sites at which hazardous substances may be or have been released. Certain private parties also may use CERCLA to recover response costs. Parties that transported hazardous substances to these sites or arranged for the disposal of the substances are also deemed liable by CERCLA. CERCLA has been interpreted to impose strict, joint and several liability on responsible parties. Entergy subsidiaries in the Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities businesses have sent waste materials to various disposal sites over the years, and releases have occurred at Entergy facilities. In addition, environmental laws now regulate certain of Entergy’s operating procedures and maintenance practices that historically were not subject to regulation. Some disposal sites used by Entergy subsidiaries have been the subject of governmental action under CERCLA, resulting in site clean-up activities. Entergy subsidiaries have participated to various degrees in accordance with their respective potential liabilities in such site clean-ups and have developed experience with clean-up costs. The affected Entergy subsidiaries have established provisions for the liabilities for such environmental clean-up and restoration activities. Details of CERCLA liabilities that are not de minimis are discussed in the “Other Environmental Matters” section below. Coal Combustion Residuals In June 2010 the EPA issued a proposed rule on coal combustion residuals (CCRs) that contains two primary regulatory options: (1) regulating CCRs destined for disposal in landfills or received (including stored) in surface impoundments as so-called “special wastes” under the hazardous waste program of RCRA Subtitle C; or (2) regulating CCRs destined for disposal in landfills or surface impoundments as non-hazardous wastes under Subtitle D of RCRA. Under both options, CCRs that are beneficially used in certain processes would remain excluded from hazardous waste regulation. The proposed regulations would create new compliance requirements including modified storage, new notification and reporting practices, new financial assurance requirements, and product disposal considerations. According to EPA estimates, the annualized cost of on-site disposal under the two proposals would be $3.6 million to $9 million for the White Bluff and Independence facilities and $1.7 million to $3.3 million for the Nelson Unit 6 facility. If Entergy utilized off-site disposal, which it would not plan to do, the EPA’s total cost estimates for disposal of CCRs under Subtitle C regulation ranges from $250 to $350 million per year. 232 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Other Environmental Matters Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas Several class action and other suits have been filed in state and federal courts seeking relief from Entergy Gulf States, Inc. and others for damages caused by the disposal of hazardous waste and for asbestos-related disease allegedly resulting from exposure on Entergy Gulf States, Inc.’s premises (see “Litigation” below). Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is currently involved in the second phase of the remedial investigation of the Lake Charles Service Center site, located in Lake Charles, Louisiana. A manufactured gas plant (MGP) is believed to have operated at this site from approximately 1916 to 1931. Coal tar, a by-product of the distillation process employed at MGPs, was apparently routed to a portion of the property for disposal. The same area has also been used as a landfill. In 1999, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. signed a second administrative consent order with the EPA to perform removal action at the site. In 2002, approximately 7,400 tons of contaminated soil and debris were excavated and disposed of from an area within the service center. In 2003, a cap was constructed over the remedial area to prevent the migration of contamination to the surface. In August 2005, an administrative order was issued by the EPA requiring that a 10-year groundwater study be conducted at this site. The groundwater monitoring study commenced in January 2006 and is continuing. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas each believe that its remaining responsibility for this site will not materially exceed the existing clean-up provisions of $0.5 million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and $0.4 million for Entergy Texas. In 1994, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. performed a site assessment in conjunction with a construction project at the Louisiana Station Generating Plant (Louisiana Station). In 1995, a further assessment confirmed subsurface soil and groundwater impact to three areas on the plant site. After validation, a notification was made to the LDEQ and a phased process was executed to remediate each area of concern. The final phase of groundwater clean-up and monitoring at Louisiana Station is expected to continue for several more years. Future costs are not expected to exceed Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s existing provision of $0.7 million. Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans Several class action and other suits have been filed in state and federal courts seeking relief from Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans and others for damages caused by the disposal of hazardous waste and for asbestos-related disease allegedly resulting from exposure on Entergy Louisiana’s and Entergy New Orleans’s premises (see “Litigation” below). During 1993, the LDEQ issued new rules for solid waste regulation, including regulation of wastewater impoundments. Entergy Louisiana has determined that some of its power plant wastewater impoundments were affected by these regulations and may require remediation, repair, or closure. Completion of this work is dependent on pending LDEQ approval of submitted solid waste permit applications. As a result, a recorded liability in the amount of $1.9 million for Entergy Louisiana existed at December 31, 2011 for ongoing wastewater remediation and repairs and closures. Management believes this reserve to be adequate based on current estimates. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) notified Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas that the TCEQ believes those entities are PRPs concerning contamination existing at the San Angelo Electric Service Company (SESCO) facility in San Angelo, Texas. The facility operated as a transformer repair and scrapping facility from the 1930s until 2003. Both soil and groundwater contamination exists at the site. Entergy Gulf States, Inc. and Entergy Louisiana sent transformers to this facility during the 1980s. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Texas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy Arkansas responded to an information request from the TCEQ and continue to cooperate in this investigation. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Texas, and Entergy Louisiana joined a group of PRPs responding to site conditions in 233 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy cooperation with the State of Texas, creating cost allocation models based on review of SESCO documents and employee interviews, and investigating contribution actions against other PRPs. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy Texas have agreed to contribute to the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater at the site in a measure proportionate to those companies’ involvement at the site, while Entergy Arkansas and Entergy New Orleans likely will pay de minimis amounts. Current estimates, although preliminary and variable depending on the level of third-party cost contributions, indicate that Entergy’s total share of remediation costs likely will be less than $1 million. The TCEQ approved an agreed administrative order in September 2006 that allows the implementation of a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study at the SESCO site; with the ultimate disposition being a remedial action to remove contaminants of concern. The TCEQ approved the Remedial Investigation Work Plan in May 2007 and field sampling began in July 2007. Off-site removal of certain PCB-impacted soil and debris were completed at the site in December 2010. The Remedial Investigation report was submitted in February 2011 to the TCEQ and was approved on April 15, 2011. The PRP working group prepared a Feasibility Study and description of proposed site remediation and management actions for TCEQ’s review. This information was submitted to the TCEQ in June 2011. Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas The EPA notified Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Texas, and Entergy New Orleans that the EPA believes those entities are PRPs concerning contamination of an area known as “Devil’s Swamp Lake” near the Port of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The area allegedly was contaminated by the operations of Rollins Environmental (LA), Inc, which operated a disposal facility to which many companies contributed waste. Documents provided by the EPA indicate that Entergy Louisiana may also be a PRP. Entergy continues to monitor this developing situation. Entergy In November 2010 a transformer at the Indian Point facility failed, resulting in a fire and the release of non-PCB oil to the ground surface. The fire was extinguished by the facility’s fire deluge system. No injuries occurred due to the transformer failure or company response. Non-PCB oil and deluge water were released into the facility’s discharge canal and the environment surrounding the transformer and discharge canal, including the Hudson River, as a result of the failure, fire, and fire suppression. Once the fire was extinguished, Indian Point personnel and contractors began recovering the oil from the damaged transformer, the transformer containment moat, and the area surrounding the transformer. The State of New York has indicated its intention to assess a penalty due to the release of oil to waters of the state and the failure of the transformer containment moat to prevent this release of oil. Discussions with the state continue. Litigation Entergy uses legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against it, but certain states in which Entergy operates have proven to be unusually litigious environments. Judges and juries in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort cases. The litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk to Entergy. Ratepayer and Fuel Cost Recovery Lawsuits (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) Texas Power Price Lawsuit In August 2003, a lawsuit was filed in the district court of Chambers County, Texas by Texas residents on behalf of a purported class apparently of the Texas retail customers of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. who were billed and paid for electric power from January 1, 1994 to the present. The named defendants include Entergy Corporation, Entergy Services, Entergy Power, Entergy Power Marketing Corp., and Entergy Arkansas. Entergy Gulf States, Inc. was not a named defendant, but is alleged to be a co-conspirator. The court granted the request of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. to intervene in the lawsuit to protect its interests. 234 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Plaintiffs allege that the defendants implemented a “price gouging accounting scheme” to sell to plaintiffs and similarly situated utility customers higher priced power generated by the defendants while rejecting and/or reselling to off-system utilities less expensive power offered and/or purchased from off-system suppliers and/or generated by the Entergy system. In particular, plaintiffs allege that the defendants manipulated and continue to manipulate the dispatch of generation so that power is purchased from affiliated expensive resources instead of buying cheaper off-system power. Plaintiffs stated in their pleadings that customers in Texas were charged at least $57 million above prevailing market prices for power. Plaintiffs seek actual, consequential and exemplary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees, and disgorgement of profits. The plaintiffs’ experts have tendered a report calculating damages in a large range, from $153 million to $972 million in present value, under various scenarios. The Entergy defendants have tendered expert reports challenging the assumptions, methodologies, and conclusions of the plaintiffs’ expert reports. The case is pending in state district court, and a class certification hearing was held in August 2011. The decision of the court on class certification is pending. Mississippi Attorney General Complaint The Mississippi attorney general filed a complaint in state court in December 2008 against Entergy Corporation, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Services, and Entergy Power alleging, among other things, violations of Mississippi statutes, fraud, and breach of good faith and fair dealing, and requesting an accounting and restitution. The litigation is wide ranging and relates to tariffs and procedures under which Entergy Mississippi purchases power not generated in Mississippi to meet electricity demand. Entergy believes the complaint is unfounded. On December 29, 2008, the defendant Entergy companies filed to remove the attorney general’s suit to U.S. District Court (the forum that Entergy believes is appropriate to resolve the types of federal issues raised in the suit), where it is currently pending, and additionally answered the complaint and filed a counter-claim for relief based upon the Mississippi Public Utilities Act and the Federal Power Act. The Mississippi attorney general has filed a pleading seeking to remand the matter to state court. In May 2009, the defendant Entergy companies filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings asserting grounds of federal preemption, the exclusive jurisdiction of the MPSC, and factual errors in the attorney general’s complaint. In July 2011, the attorney general requested a status conference regarding its motion to remand. The court granted the attorney general’s request for a status conference, which was held in September 2011. Consistent with the court’s instructions, both parties submitted letters to the court in September 2011 providing updates on the facts of the case and the law, and the court has now taken the parties’ arguments under advisement. Fiber Optic Cable Litigation (Entergy Corporation and Entergy Louisiana) Several property owners have filed a class action suit against Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Services, ETHC, and Entergy Technology Company in state court in St. James Parish, Louisiana purportedly on behalf of all property owners in Louisiana who have conveyed easements to the defendants. The lawsuit alleges that Entergy installed fiber optic cable across the plaintiffs’ property without obtaining appropriate easements. The plaintiffs seek damages equal to the fair market value of the surplus fiber optic cable capacity, including a share of the profits made through use of the fiber optic cables, and punitive damages. Entergy removed the case to federal court in New Orleans; however, the district court remanded the case back to state court. In February 2004, the state court entered an order certifying this matter as a class action. Entergy’s appeals of this ruling were denied. The parties have entered into a term sheet establishing basic terms for a settlement that must be approved by the court. 235 Table of Contents Part I Item 1 Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Asbestos Litigation (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) Numerous lawsuits have been filed in federal and state courts primarily in Texas and Louisiana, primarily by contractor employees who worked in the 1940-1980s timeframe, against Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, and to a lesser extent the other Utility operating companies, as premises owners of power plants, for damages caused by alleged exposure to asbestos. Many other defendants are named in these lawsuits as well. Currently, there are approximately 500 lawsuits involving approximately 5,000 claimants. Management believes that adequate provisions have been established to cover any exposure. Additionally, negotiations continue with insurers to recover reimbursements. Management believes that loss exposure has been and will continue to be handled so that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not be material, in the aggregate, to the financial position or results of operation of the Utility operating companies. Employment and Labor-related Proceedings (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) The Registrant Subsidiaries and other Entergy subsidiaries are responding to various lawsuits in both state and federal courts and to other labor-related proceedings filed by current and former employees. Generally, the amount of damages being sought is not specified in these proceedings. These actions include, but are not limited to, allegations of wrongful employment actions; wage disputes and other claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act or its state counterparts; claims of race, gender and disability discrimination; disputes arising under collective bargaining agreements; unfair labor practice proceedings and other administrative proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board; claims of retaliation; and claims for or regarding benefits under various Entergy Corporation sponsored plans. Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries are responding to these suits and proceedings and deny liability to the claimants. Employees Employees are an integral part of Entergy’s commitment to serving customers. As of December 31, 2011, Entergy subsidiaries employed 14,682 people.

The risks that Entergy faces are not limited to those in this section. There may be additional risks and uncertainties (either currently unknown or not currently believed to be material) that could adversely affect Entergy's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. See "FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION." Utility Regulatory Risks (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas and System Energy) The terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the Utility operating companies and System Energy are determined through regulatory approval proceedings that are lengthy and subject to appeal that could result in delays in effecting rate changes and uncertainty as to ultimate results. The rates that the Utility operating companies and System Energy charge reflect their capital expenditures, operations and maintenance charges, allowed rates of return, financing costs, and related costs of service. These rates significantly influence the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and each of the Utility operating companies and System Energy. These rates are determined in regulatory proceedings and are subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. In addition, regulators can initiate proceedings to investigate the prudence of costs in the Utility operating companies' base rates and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of the companies' operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures (including storm costs), allowed rates of return and rate base, proposed resource acquisitions and previously incurred capital expenditures. The regulators can disallow costs found not to have been prudently incurred or found not to have been incurred in compliance with applicable tariffs, creating some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or reduce rates. The proceedings generally have long timelines, are primarily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited by statute, which could cause the Utility operating companies and System Energy to experience regulatory lag in recovering such costs through rates. Decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings. Although four of the Utility operating companies (Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi and Entergy New Orleans) currently obtain recovery under formula rate plans, at some point in the future these formula rate plans may no longer be extended, at which time these Utility operating companies would operate again in a more traditional rate case environment. In addition, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana were required by the LPSC to file full rate cases by January 2013 when their current formula rate plans expire. The Utility operating companies and System Energy, and the energy industry as a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments, which could result in more frequent rate cases and requests for, and the continuation of, cost recovery mechanisms. For information regarding rate case proceedings and formula rate plans applicable to certain of the Utility operating companies, see Note 2 to the financial statements. The Utility operating companies recover fuel and purchased power costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or disallowance in regulatory proceedings. The Utility operating companies recover their fuel and purchased power costs from their customers through rate mechanisms subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. Because regulatory review can result in the disallowance of incurred costs found not to have been prudently incurred with the possibility of refunds to ratepayers, there exists some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulators can initiate proceedings to investigate the continued usage or the adequacy and operation of the fuel and purchased power recovery clauses of the Utility operating companies. 238 Table of Contents Part I Item 1A & 1B Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy The Utility operating companies' cash flows can be negatively affected by the time delays between when gas, power or other commodities are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers of the costs in rates. On occasion, when the level of incurred costs for fuel and purchased power rises very dramatically, some of the Utility operating companies may agree to defer recovery of a portion of that period's fuel and purchased power costs for recovery at a later date, which could increase the near-term working capital and borrowing requirements of those companies. For a description of fuel and purchased power recovery mechanisms and information regarding the regulatory proceedings for fuel and purchased power recovery, see Note 2 to the financial statements. As a result of a challenge by the LPSC, the manner in which the Utility operating companies have traditionally shared the costs associated with coordinated planning, construction and operation of generating resources has been changed by the FERC, which will require adjustment of retail and wholesale rates in the jurisdictions where the Utility operating companies provide service and has introduced additional uncertainty in the ratemaking process. The Utility operating companies historically have engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating resources and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which is a rate schedule that has been approved by the FERC. In 2005, the FERC issued a decision requiring changes to the cost allocation methodology used in that rate schedule. In 2007 through 2011, payments were made by Entergy Arkansas to certain of the Utility operating companies in compliance with the 2005 FERC decision on the cost allocation methodology. There have been challenges to the level of payments made by Entergy Arkansas under the FERC’s decision and the prudence of the Utility operating companies’ production costs. The ability to recover in rates any changes to the cost allocation resulting from the challenges, and timing of such recovery, could be uncertain and could be the subject of additional regulatory and other proceedings. For information regarding these and other proceedings associated with the System Agreement, as well as additional information regarding the System Agreement itself, see Note 2 to financial statements, System Agreement Cost Equalization Proceedings. The outcome and timing of this FERC proceeding and resulting recovery and impact on rates cannot be predicted at this time. There is uncertainty as to the timing or form of any successor arrangement to the System Agreement and the effect of such arrangement (or absence thereof) on Entergy and the Utility operating companies. Based upon the effect of the FERC decision described in the preceding risk factor, in December 2005, Entergy Arkansas provided notice of its intent to terminate its participation in the System Agreement. In November 2007, Entergy Mississippi provided its notice to terminate its participation in the System Agreement. Each notice of termination is effective ninety-six (96) months from the date of notice (December 2013 for Entergy Arkansas and November 2015 for Entergy Mississippi) or such earlier date as authorized by the FERC. The FERC accepted the notices in November 2009; the LPSC and City Council have requested rehearing of that order. In February 2011, the FERC denied the request for rehearing. The LPSC has appealed the FERC’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and oral argument was held January 13, 2012. The Utility operating companies have concluded that joining the MISO RTO is in the best interest of all stakeholders and are seeking regulatory approvals to accomplish the transfer of functional control of their transmission assets to the MISO RTO by December 2013. However, Entergy cannot predict when or whether it will obtain the approvals necessary to join the MISO RTO, when the Utility operating companies’ generation and transmission systems can be fully integrated into the MISO RTO, or whether alternative arrangements will need to be implemented to allow Entergy Arkansas, and eventually Entergy Mississippi, to operate independent of the System Agreement, and the effect such arrangements (or the absence thereof) will have on Entergy or the Utility operating companies. For further information regarding the FERC and APSC proceedings relating to the System Agreement, see “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation – Federal Regulation – System Agreement” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries. 239 Table of Contents Part I Item 1A & 1B Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy The arrangement for the operation of the Utility operating companies’ transmission system faces regulatory and operating challenges and uncertainty in connection with the Utility operating companies’ proposal to move to the MISO RTO and the scheduled expiration of the current Independent Coordinator of Transmission arrangement in November 2012. In 2000, the FERC issued an order encouraging utilities to voluntarily place their transmission facilities under the control of an independent RTO. In November 2006, the Utility operating companies installed the Southwest Power Pool (SPP), a regional transmission organization, as their Independent Coordinator of Transmission (ICT) with responsibility for certain transmission tariff functions, including granting or denying transmission service, administering OASIS, evaluating all transmission requests, and serving as the reliability coordinator. The initial term of the ICT was for four years and in November 2010 the FERC approved an extension of the ICT arrangement for two years, or until November 2012. In its order issued in March 2009 pertaining to a requested modification regarding the weekly procurement process (WPP) through the ICT arrangement, the FERC imposed conditions related to the ICT arrangement and indicated it wanted an evaluation of the success of the ICT arrangement and transmission access on the Entergy transmission system. In compliance with the FERC’s March 2009 order, the Utility operating companies filed with the FERC a process for evaluating the modification or replacement of the current ICT arrangement. An Entergy Regional State Committee (E-RSC), comprised of one representative from each of the Utility operating companies’ retail regulators has been formed and, in concert with the FERC, retained an independent entity to conduct a cost/benefit analysis of comparing the ICT arrangement to a proposal under which Entergy would join the SPP RTO. The scope of the study was expanded to consider Entergy joining the MISO RTO as another alternative. On April 25, 2011, Entergy announced that each of the Utility operating companies propose joining the MISO RTO. In May 2011, the Utility operating companies submitted to each of their respective retail regulators the cost-benefit analysis comparing the ICT arrangement to joining the SPP RTO or the MISO RTO. The Utility operating companies either have filed or expect to file in 2012 applications with their local regulators seeking to join the MISO RTO and transfer control of the companies’ transmission assets to the MISO RTO. The target implementation date for joining the MISO RTO is December 2013. For further information regarding the FERC and proceedings related to the ICT and MISO, see “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation - Federal Regulation - Independent Coordinator of Transmission” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries. There is uncertainty as to whether the Utility operating companies’ proposal to join the MISO RTO by December 2013 will receive all required regulatory approvals in a timely manner and, if the proposal is approved, the nature and effect of any operational challenges the Utility operating companies might face in connection with integration into the MISO RTO. For the period of time prior to integration of all of the Utility operating companies into the MISO RTO or in the event all necessary approvals to participate in the MISO RTO are not obtained in a timely manner, an extension of the current ICT arrangement or the establishment of a similar arrangement with another qualified entity may be required. The outcome of any effort to negotiate an extension of the current arrangement or to make alternative arrangements cannot be predicted at this time. (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred as a result of severe weather could have material effects on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather. Entergy's and its Utility operating companies' results of operations, liquidity and financial condition can be materially affected by the destructive effects of severe weather. Severe weather can also result in significant outages for the customers of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, reduced revenues for the Utility operating companies during the period of the outages. A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred or revenues lost as a result of severe weather could have a material effect on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather. 240 Table of Contents Part I Item 1A & 1B Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Nuclear Operating and Regulatory Risks (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy) Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities must consistently operate their nuclear power plants at high capacity factors in order to be successful, and lower capacity factors could materially affect Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Nuclear capacity factors significantly affect the results of operations of certain Utility operating companies, System Energy and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. Nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs. Consequently, to be successful, a plant owner must consistently operate its nuclear power plants at high capacity factors. For the Utility operating companies that own nuclear plants, lower capacity factors can increase production costs by requiring the affected companies to generate additional energy, sometimes at higher costs, from their fossil facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy their supply needs. For the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants, lower capacity factors directly affect revenues and cash flow from operations. Although most of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear forward sales are on a pure unit-contingent basis, which depends on the availability of the asset, some of the unit-contingent contracts guarantee a specified minimum capacity factor. In the event these plants were operating below the guaranteed capacity factors, Entergy would be subject to price risk for the undelivered power. Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear forward sales contracts can also be on a firm LD basis, which subjects Entergy to increasing price risk if capacity factors decrease. Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear plant owners periodically shut down their nuclear power plants to replenish fuel. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such refueling outages. If refueling outages last longer than anticipated or if unplanned outages arise, Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially affected. Outages at nuclear power plants to replenish fuel require the plant to be “turned off.” Refueling outages generally are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months and average approximately 30 days in duration. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such planned outages. When refueling outages last longer than anticipated or a plant experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease and maintenance costs may increase. Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear plants may face lower margins due to higher costs and lower energy sales for unit-contingent power supply contracts or potentially higher energy replacement costs for unit-contingent contracts with capacity guarantees that are not met due to extended or unplanned outages. Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities face risks related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its conversion, enrichment and fabrication), and the risk of being unable to effectively manage these risks by purchasing from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries could materially affect Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Based upon currently planned fuel cycles, Entergy's nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what Entergy believes are reasonably predictable prices through most of 2012, and with substantial additional amounts after that time. Entergy's ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners. There are a number of possible alternate suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, although the pricing of any such alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time. Entergy also may draw upon its own inventory intended for later generation periods, depending upon its risk management strategy at that time. Entergy 241 Table of Contents Part I Item 1A & 1B Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S. Market prices for nuclear fuel have been extremely volatile from time to time in the past. Although Entergy’s nuclear fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against market risks for several years, costs for nuclear fuel in the future cannot be predicted with certainty due to normal inherent market uncertainties, and price increases could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business face the risk that the NRC will change or modify its regulations or suspend or revoke their licenses, which could materially affect Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Under the Atomic Energy Act and Energy Reorganization Act, the NRC regulates the operation of nuclear power plants. The NRC may modify, suspend or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, related regulations or the terms of the licenses for nuclear facilities. A change in the Atomic Energy Act, other applicable statutes, or the applicable regulations or licenses may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and could materially affect the results of operations, liquidity or financial condition of Entergy (through Entergy Wholesale Commodities), its Utility operating companies or System Energy. Events at nuclear plants owned by others, as well as those owned by one of these companies, may cause the NRC to initiate such actions. As a result, if an incident were to occur at any nuclear generating unit, whether an Entergy nuclear generating unit or not, it could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy or Entergy Wholesale Commodities. For example, the earthquake of March 11, 2011 that affected the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plants in Japan is expected to result in regulatory changes in the U.S. that may impose additional costs on all U.S. nuclear plants, some of which could be material. Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities are exposed to risks and costs related to operating and maintaining their nuclear power plants, and their failure to maintain operational efficiency at their nuclear power plants could materially affect Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The nuclear generating units owned by certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business began commercial operations in the 1970s-1980s. Older equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating efficiently. This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in reduced profitability. Operations at any of the nuclear generating units owned and operated by Entergy's subsidiaries could degrade to the point where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. If this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. A decision may be made to close a unit rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the unit to full capacity. For Entergy Wholesale Commodities, this could result in lost revenue and increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments and penalties for failure to perform under their contracts with customers. Moreover, Entergy is becoming more dependent on fewer suppliers for key parts of Entergy's nuclear power plants that may need to be replaced or refurbished. This dependence on a reduced number of suppliers could result in delays in obtaining qualified replacement parts and, therefore, greater expense for Entergy. The costs associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, as well as the costs of and their ability to fully decommission their nuclear power plants, could be significantly affected by the timing of the opening of a spent nuclear fuel storage facility, as well as interim storage and transportation requirements. Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants incur costs on a periodic basis for the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. The approval of a license for a national repository for the storage of spent nuclear fuel, such as the one proposed for Yucca Mountain, Nevada, or any interim storage facility, and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs 242 Table of Contents Part I Item 1A & 1B Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy associated with storage of spent nuclear fuel. For example, while the DOE is required by law to proceed with the licensing of Yucca Mountain and, after the license is granted by the NRC, to construct the repository and commence the receipt of spent fuel, the Obama administration has expressed its intention and taken specific steps to discontinue the Yucca Mountain project and study a new spent fuel strategy. These actions may prolong the time before spent fuel is removed from Entergy’s plant sites. Because the DOE has not accomplished its objectives, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts, and Entergy has sued the DOE for such breach. Furthermore, Entergy is uncertain as to when the DOE plans to commence acceptance of spent fuel from its facilities for storage or disposal. As a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at the companies’ nuclear sites. The costs of on-site storage are also affected by regulatory requirements for such storage. In addition, the availability of a repository or other off-site storage facility for spent nuclear fuel may affect the ability to fully decommission the nuclear units and the costs relating to decommissioning. For further information regarding spent fuel storage, see the "Critical Accounting Estimates – Nuclear Decommissioning Costs – Spent Fuel Disposal” section of Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy. Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to pay substantial retrospective premiums imposed under the Price-Anderson Act in the event of a nuclear incident, and losses not covered by insurance could have a material effect on Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Accidents and other unforeseen problems at nuclear power plants have occurred both in the United States and elsewhere. The Price-Anderson Act limits each reactor owner's public liability (off-site) for a single nuclear incident to the payment of retrospective premiums into a secondary insurance pool of up to approximately $117.5 million per reactor. With 104 reactors currently participating, this translates to a total public liability cap of approximately $12.2 billion per incident. The limit is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation, a change in the primary limit of insurance coverage, and changes in the number of licensed reactors. As required by the Price-Anderson Act, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities carry the maximum available amount of primary nuclear off-site liability insurance with American Nuclear Insurers (currently $375 million for each operating site). Claims for any nuclear incident exceeding that amount are covered under the retrospective premiums paid into the secondary insurance pool. As a result, in the event of a nuclear incident that causes damages (off-site) in excess of the $375 million in primary insurance coverage, each owner of a nuclear plant reactor, including Entergy's Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident, will be required to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the $375 million primary level, up to a maximum of $117.5 million per reactor per incident (Entergy's maximum total contingent obligation per incident is $1.3 billion). The retrospective premium payment is currently limited to $17.5 million per year per incident per reactor until the aggregate public liability for each licensee is paid up to the $117.5 million cap. NEIL is a utility industry mutual insurance company, owned by its members. All member plants could be subject to assessments (retrospective premium of up to 10 times current annual premium for all policies) should the surplus (reserve) be significantly depleted due to insured losses. As of April 1, 2011, the maximum assessment amounts total $72.7 million for the Utility plants and $89.3 million for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants. Retrospective Premium Insurance available through NEIL’s reinsurance treaty can cover the potential assessments. The Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants currently maintain the Retrospective Premium Insurance to cover this potential assessment. As an owner of nuclear power plants, Entergy participates in industry self-insurance programs and could be liable to fund claims should a plant owned by a different company experience a major event. Any resulting liability from a nuclear accident may exceed the applicable primary insurance coverage and require contribution of additional funds through the industry-wide program that could significantly affect the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries. 243 Table of Contents Part I Item 1A & 1B Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of assets in the decommissioning trusts, which then could require significant additional funding. Owners of nuclear generating plants have an obligation to decommission those plants. Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy and owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants maintain decommissioning trust funds for this purpose. Certain of the Utility operating companies collect funds from their customers, which are deposited into the trusts covering the units operated for or on behalf of those companies. Those rate collections are based upon operating license lives as well as estimated trust fund earnings and decommissioning costs. In connection with the acquisition of certain nuclear plants, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners also acquired decommissioning trust funds that are funded in accordance with NRC regulations. Assets in these trust funds are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns that may fall below projected return rates, and may result in losses resulting from the recognition of impairments of the value of certain securities held in these trust funds. As part of the Pilgrim, Indian Point 1 and 2, Vermont Yankee, and Palisades/Big Rock Point purchases, the former owners transferred decommissioning trust funds, along with the liability to decommission the plants, to the respective Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant owners. In addition, the former owner of Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick retained the decommissioning trusts and related liability to decommission these plants, but has the right to require the respective Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners to assume the decommissioning liability provided that it assigns the funds in the corresponding decommissioning trust, up to a specified level, to such owners. Alternatively, the former owner may contract with Entergy Nuclear, Inc. for the decommissioning work at a price equal to the transferred funds mentioned above. As part of the Indian Point 1 and 2 purchase, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant owner also funded an additional $25 million to a supplemental decommissioning trust fund. As part of the Palisades transaction, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business assumed responsibility for spent fuel at the decommissioned Big Rock Point nuclear plant, which is located near Charlevoix, Michigan. Once the spent fuel is removed from the site, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business will dismantle the spent fuel storage facility and complete site decommissioning. The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business expects to fund this activity from operating revenue, and Entergy is providing $5 million in credit support to provide financial assurance to the NRC for this obligation. In 2008, Entergy experienced declines in the market value of assets held in the trust funds for meeting its decommissioning funding assurance obligations for its plants. This decline adversely affected Entergy’s ability to demonstrate compliance with the NRC’s requirements for providing financial assurance for decommissioning funding for some of its plants, which deficiencies have now been corrected. An early plant shutdown, poor investment results or higher than anticipated decommissioning costs could cause trust fund assets to be insufficient to meet the decommissioning obligations, with the result that the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. For further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, see the "Critical Accounting Estimates – Nuclear Decommissioning Costs" section of Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 9 to the financial statements. New or existing safety concerns regarding operating nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel could lead to restrictions upon the operation of Entergy’s nuclear power plants. New and existing concerns are being expressed in public forums about the safety of nuclear generating units and nuclear fuel, in particular in the northeastern United States, which is where five of the six units in the current fleet of Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are located. These concerns have led to, and are expected to continue to lead to, various proposals to Federal regulators and governing bodies in some localities where Entergy's subsidiaries own nuclear generating units for legislative and regulatory changes that could lead to the shutdown of nuclear units, denial of license renewal applications, municipalization of nuclear units, restrictions on nuclear units as a result of unavailability of sites for spent nuclear fuel storage and disposal, or other adverse effects on owning and operating nuclear generating units. Entergy vigorously responds to these concerns and proposals. If any of the existing proposals, or any proposals that may arise in the future with respect to legislative and regulatory changes, become effective, they could have a material effect on Entergy's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 244 Table of Contents Part I Item 1A & 1B Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy (Entergy Corporation) A failure to obtain renewed licenses for the continued operation of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants could have a material effect on Entergy's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and could lead to an increase in depreciation rates or an acceleration of the timing for the funding of decommissioning obligations. The license renewal and related processes for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants have been and may continue to be the subject of significant public debate and regulatory and legislative review and scrutiny at the federal and, in certain cases, state level. The operating licenses for Pilgrim, Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 expire in June 2012, September 2013 and December 2015, respectively. Because these plants filed timely license renewal applications, the NRC’s rules provide that these plants may continue to operate under their existing operating licenses until their renewal applications have been finally determined. Various parties have expressed opposition to renewal of these licenses. Renewal of the Indian Point licenses is the subject of ongoing proceedings before the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) of the NRC. Initial hearings on certain of the contentions admitted by the ASLB currently are expected to begin by the end of 2012. In the Pilgrim license renewal proceeding, the ASLB has denied the last pending proposed contention and has terminated proceedings before it. Appeals of ASLB decisions remain pending before the NRC. Also pending before the NRC is a motion by Entergy affiliates requesting specific authorization to NRC staff to issue the Pilgrim license. In responding to that motion, NRC staff stated the position that whether to issue a license where no admitted contentions are pending is a matter of staff discretion. There is no schedule for NRC action on the pending appeals or motion. In relation to Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has taken the position that these plant owners must obtain a new state-issued Clean Water Act Section 401 water quality certification as part of the license renewal process. For the Indian Point plants, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners also must ensure that requirements of the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered in New York State primarily by the New York Department of State, are satisfied prior to getting the renewed licenses. For further information regarding these environmental regulations see “Environmental Regulation, Clean Water Act” in Part I, Item 1. The NRC operating license for Vermont Yankee was to expire in March 2012. In March 2011 the NRC renewed Vermont Yankee’s operating license for an additional 20 years, as a result of which the license now expires in 2032. Vermont Yankee also is operating under a Certificate of Public Good from the State of Vermont that expires in March 2012, but has an application pending before the Vermont Public Service Board for a new Certificate of Public Good for operation until March 2032. For additional discussion regarding the continued operation of the Vermont Yankee plant, see “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets” in Note 1 to the financial statements. If the NRC finally denies the applications for the renewal of operating licenses for one or more of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, or a state in which any such nuclear power plant is located is able to prevent the continued operation of such plant, Entergy’s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected by loss of revenue and cash flow associated with the plant or plants, potential impairments of the carrying value of the plants, increased depreciation rates, and an accelerated need for decommissioning funds, which could require additional funding. In addition, Entergy may incur increased operating costs depending on any conditions that may be imposed in connection with license renewal. For further discussion regarding the license renewal processes for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear power plants, see “ENTERGY’S BUSINESS – Entergy Wholesale Commodities – Property – Nuclear Generating Stations” in Part I, Item 1 for Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries. 245 Table of Contents Part I Item 1A & 1B Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy The decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants owned by Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear plant owners may not be adequate to meet decommissioning obligations if one or more of their nuclear power plants is retired earlier than the anticipated shutdown date or if current regulatory requirements change which then could require additional funding. Under NRC regulations, Entergy’s nuclear subsidiaries are permitted to project the NRC-required decommissioning amount based on an NRC formula or a site-specific estimate, and the amount in each of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant's decommissioning trusts combined with other decommissioning financial assurances in place. The projections are made based on the operating license expiration date and the mid-point of the subsequent decommissioning process for each of these nuclear power plants. As a result, if the projected amount of our decommissioning trusts exceeds the NRC-required decommissioning amount, then its decommissioning obligations are considered to be funded in accordance with NRC regulations. In the event the projected costs do not sufficiently reflect the actual costs the applicable Entergy subsidiaries would be required to incur to decommission these nuclear power plants, and funding is otherwise inadequate, or if the formula or site-specific estimate is changed to require increased funding, additional resources would be required. Furthermore, depending upon the level of funding available in the trust funds, the NRC may not permit the trust funds to be used to pay for related costs such as the management of spent nuclear fuel that are not included in the formula. The NRC may also require a plan for the provision of separate funding for spent fuel management costs. In addition to NRC requirements, there are other decommissioning-related obligations for certain of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, which management believes it will be able to satisfy. With respect to the decommissioning trusts for Indian Point 2 and Palisades, the total amount in each of those trusts as of December 31, 2011 would not have been sufficient to initiate and complete the immediate near-term radiological decommissioning of the respective unit as of the license termination date of each respective plant, but rather the funds would have been sufficient to place the unit in a condition of safe storage status pending future completion of decommissioning. For example, if an Entergy subsidiary decides to shut down and immediately begin decommissioning one of those nuclear power plants on its license expiration date, its trust funds for the plant as of December 31, 2011 would have been insufficient and the applicable Entergy subsidiary would have been required to rely on other capital resources to fund the remainder of the radiological decommissioning obligations unless the completion of decommissioning could be deferred during some number of years of safe storage status (as is permitted by NRC regulations). If any Entergy subsidiary decides to shut down one of its nuclear power plants earlier than the scheduled shutdown date and conduct a prompt decommissioning, the applicable Entergy subsidiary may be unable to rely upon only the decommissioning trust to fund the entire decommissioning obligations, which would require it to obtain funding from other sources. Further, federal or state regulatory changes, including mandated increases in decommissioning funding or changes in the methods or standards for decommissioning operations, may also increase the funding requirements of, or accelerate the timing for funding of, the obligations related to the decommissioning of Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear power plants. As a result, under any of these circumstances, Entergy's results of operations, liquidity and financial condition could be materially affected. Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear power plants are exposed to price risk through either advance sale of energy and capacity into forward markets or accepting spot prices primarily in day-ahead markets. Entergy and its subsidiaries are not guaranteed any rate of return on their capital investments in non-utility businesses. In particular, the sale of capacity and energy from the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, unless otherwise contracted, is subject to the fluctuation of market power prices. As of December 31, 2011, Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power generation plants had sold forward 88%, 81%, 39%, 25% and 25% of its generation portfolio's planned energy output for 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. In order to hedge future price risk to desired levels, Entergy Wholesale Commodities utilizes contracts that are unit-contingent and Firm LD and various products such as forward sales, options, and collars. Market conditions such as product cost, market liquidity and other portfolio considerations influence the product and contractual mix. The obligations under unit-contingent agreements depend on a generating asset that is operating; if the generation asset is not operating, the seller generally is not liable for damages. For some unit-contingent obligations, however, there is also a guarantee of availability that provides for the payment to the power 246 Table of Contents Part I Item 1A & 1B Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy purchaser of contract damages, if incurred, in the event the unit owner fails to deliver power as a result of the failure of the specified generation unit to generate power at or above a specified availability threshold. Firm LD sales transactions may be exposed to substantial operational price risk to the extent that the plants do not run as expected and market prices exceed contract prices. Market prices may fluctuate substantially, sometimes over relatively short periods of time, and at other times experience sustained increases or decreases. Demand for electricity and its fuel stock can fluctuate dramatically, creating periods of substantial under- or over-supply. During periods of over-supply, prices might be depressed. Also, from time to time there may be political pressure, or pressure from regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over wholesale and retail energy commodity and transportation rates, to impose price limitations, credit requirements, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address volatility and other issues in these markets. The price that different counterparties offer for forward sales is influenced both by market conditions as well as the contract terms such as damage provisions, credit support requirements and the number of available counterparties interested in contracting for the desired forward period. Depending on differences between market factors at the time of contracting versus current conditions, Entergy Wholesale Commodities' contract portfolio may have average contract prices above or below current market prices, including at the expiration of the contracts, which may significantly affect Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. The recent economic downturn and negative trends in the energy commodity markets have resulted in lower natural gas prices, and current prevailing market prices for electricity in the New York and New England power regions are therefore generally below the prices of Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ existing contracts in those regions. To the extent these market conditions persist, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ realized price per MWh can be expected to continue to decline. See “Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries, Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis, Results of Operations, Realized Revenue per MWh for Entergy Wholesale Commodities Nuclear Plants.” With operating licenses for Pilgrim, Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 expiring between 2012 and 2015, and as a consequence of any delays in obtaining extension of the operating licenses and any other approvals required for continued operation of the plants, Entergy Wholesale Commodities may enter into fewer unit-contingent forward sales contracts for output from such plants for periods beyond the license expiration. Among the factors that could affect market prices for electricity and fuel, all of which are beyond Entergy's control to a significant degree, are: · prevailing market prices for natural gas, uranium (and its conversion, enrichment and fabrication), coal, oil, and other fuels used in electric generation plants, including associated transportation costs, and supplies of such commodities; · seasonality; · availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources and the requirements of a renewable portfolio standard; · changes in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal and crude oil and refined products; · liquidity in the general wholesale electricity market, including the number of creditworthy counterparties available and interested in entering into forward sales agreements for Entergy’s full hedging term; · the actions of external parties, such as the FERC and local independent system operators and other state or Federal energy regulatory bodies, that may impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in the energy markets; · electricity transmission, competing generation or fuel transportation constraints, inoperability or inefficiencies; · the general demand for electricity, which may be significantly affected by national and regional economic conditions; · weather conditions affecting demand for electricity or availability of hydroelectric power or fuel supplies; · the rate of growth in demand for electricity as a result of population changes, regional economic conditions and the implementation of conservation programs; 247 Table of Contents Part I Item 1A & 1B Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy · regulatory policies of state agencies that affect the willingness of Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear customers to enter into long-term contracts generally, and contracts for energy in particular; · increases in supplies due to actions of current Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear competitors or new market entrants, including the development of new generation facilities, expansion of existing generation facilities, the disaggregation of vertically integrated utilities and improvements in transmission that allow additional supply to reach Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear markets; · union and labor relations; · changes in Federal and state energy and environmental laws and regulations and other initiatives, including but not limited to, the price impacts of proposed emission controls such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI); · changes in law resulting from federal or state energy legislation or legislation subjecting energy derivatives used in hedging and risk management transactions to governmental regulation; and · natural disasters, terrorist actions, wars, embargoes and other catastrophic events. The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative, regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulation. Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause the Wholesale Commodities business to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability. Public utilities under the Federal Power Act are required to obtain FERC acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity. Each of the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, as well as Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing, LLC, is a "public utility" under the Federal Power Act by virtue of making wholesale sales of electric energy. The FERC has granted these generating and power marketing companies the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. The FERC’s orders that grant the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ generating and power marketing companies market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if the FERC subsequently determines that the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if any of its generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority and potential penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation. If the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ generating or power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain the FERC’s acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, record-keeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have an adverse effect on the rates the Entergy Wholesale Commodities charges for power from its facilities. The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations and bidding rules imposed by the existing Independent System Operators. The Independent System Operators that oversee most of the wholesale power markets impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps and other mechanisms, to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets. These types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on the profitability of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business' generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets. For further information regarding federal, state and local laws and regulation applicable to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see “Entergy’s Business - Regulation of Entergy’s Business” in Part I, Item 1 for Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries. 248 Table of Contents Part I Item 1A & 1B Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy The regulatory environment applicable to the electric power industry has undergone substantial changes over the past several years as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. These changes are ongoing and Entergy cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. In addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism and have raised claims that the competitive marketplace is not working because energy prices in wholesale markets exceed the marginal cost of operating nuclear power plants, as well as proposals to re-regulate the markets, impose a generation tax or require divestitures by generating companies to reduce their market share. Other proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process, which could require material changes to business planning models. If competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, modified, discontinued or delayed, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business' results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially affected. The nuclear power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to impairment charges in certain circumstances, which could have a material effect on Entergy's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Entergy periodically reviews long-lived assets held in all of its business segments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of these assets is uncertain. Generally, the determination of recoverability is based on the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from such operations and assets. Projected net cash flows depend on the future operating costs associated with the assets, the efficiency and availability of the assets and generating units, and the future market and price for energy over the remaining life of the assets. In particular, the assets of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, including the nuclear power plants, are subject to impairment if adverse market conditions arise and continue (such as declines in market prices for electricity), if adverse regulatory events occur (including with respect to environmental regulation), if a unit ceases operation or if a unit's operating license is not renewed. Moreover, the failure of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows, an unfavorable change in forecasted operating results or cash flows or a decline in observable industry market multiples could all result in potential impairment charges for the affected assets. As discussed in Part I, Item 1, Entergy Wholesale Commodities, Property, in this Form 10-K, the operating licenses for Pilgrim, Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 expire between 2012 and 2015 and are currently the subject of license renewal processes at the NRC and the states in which the plants operate and the Vermont Yankee plant is the subject of certain state and federal proceedings and federal litigation relating to continued operation of that plant. If Entergy concludes that any of these nuclear power plants is unlikely to operate significantly beyond its current license expiration date, which conclusion would be based on a variety of factors, such a conclusion could result in an impairment of part or all of the carrying value of the plant. Any impairment charge taken by Entergy with respect to its long-lived assets, including the nuclear power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, would likely be material in the quarter that the charge is taken and could otherwise have a material effect on Entergy's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. General Business (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) Entergy and the Utility operating companies depend on access to the capital markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could make it more difficult to handle future contingencies such as natural disasters or substantial increases in gas and fuel prices. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect Entergy and its subsidiaries' ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and the cost of capital. 249 Table of Contents Part I Item 1A & 1B Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Entergy's business is capital intensive and dependent upon its ability to access capital at reasonable rates and other terms. At times there are also spikes in the price for natural gas and other commodities that increase the liquidity requirements of the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. In addition, Entergy's and the Utility operating companies' liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather-related or unforeseen disaster similar to that experienced in Entergy's service territory with Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in 2005 and Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike in 2008. The occurrence of one or more contingencies, including a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel or purchased power costs or storm restoration costs, higher than expected pension contributions, an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines, less cash flow from operations than expected or other unknown events, such as future storms, could cause the financing needs of Entergy and its subsidiaries to increase. In addition, accessing the debt capital markets more frequently in these situations may result in an increase in leverage. Material leverage increases could negatively affect the credit ratings of Entergy and the Utility operating companies, which in turn could negatively affect access to the capital markets. The global capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in the fourth quarter of 2008 and much of 2009. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively affect Entergy and its subsidiaries' ability to maintain and to expand their businesses. Events beyond Entergy's control, such as the volatility and disruption in global capital and credit markets in 2008 and 2009, may create uncertainty that could increase its cost of capital or impair its ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on its bank credit facilities. Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their credit facilities as they come up for renewal, including the Entergy Corporation $3.5 billion revolving credit facility that expires in August 2012. Moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. If Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could impact their ability to grow their businesses, decrease earnings, significantly reduce financial flexibility and/or limit Entergy Corporation's ability to sustain its current common stock dividend level. (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) A downgrade in Entergy Corporation's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings could negatively affect Entergy Corporation's and its subsidiaries' ability to access capital and/or could require Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries to post collateral, accelerate certain payments or repay certain indebtedness. There are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for each of Entergy Corporation and the Registrant Subsidiaries, including each Registrant’s regulatory framework, ability to recover costs and earn returns, diversification and financial strength and liquidity. If one or more rating agencies downgrade Entergy Corporation's, any of the Utility operating companies', or System Energy's ratings, particularly below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and cash or letter of credit collateral demands may be triggered by the terms of a number of commodity contracts, leases and other agreements. Most of Entergy Corporation's and its subsidiaries' large customers, suppliers and counterparties require sufficient creditworthiness to enter into transactions. If Entergy Corporation's or its subsidiaries' ratings decline, particularly below investment grade, or if certain counterparties believe Entergy Corporation or the Utility operating companies are losing creditworthiness and demand adequate assurance under fuel, gas and purchased power contracts, the counterparties may require posting of collateral in cash or letters of credit, prepayment for fuel, gas or purchased power or accelerated payment, or counterparties may decline business with Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2011, based on power prices at that time, Entergy had liquidity exposure for Entergy Wholesale Commodities business transactions of $133 million under guarantees, $20 million of guarantees that 250 Table of Contents Part I Item 1A & 1B Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy support letters of credit, and $6 million of posted cash collateral to the ISOs. As of December 31, 2011 the liquidity exposure associated with Entergy Wholesale Commodities assurance requirements could increase by $132 million for a $1 per MMBtu increase in gas prices in both the short- and long-term markets. In the event of a decrease in Entergy Corporation's credit rating to below investment grade, based on power prices as of December 31, 2011, Entergy would have been required to provide approximately $44 million of additional cash or letters of credit under some of the agreements. The construction of, and capital improvements to, power generation facilities involve substantial risks. Should construction or capital improvement efforts be unsuccessful, the financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies could be materially affected. Entergy's and the Utility operating companies' ability to complete construction of power generation facilities in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. These variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise and escalating costs for materials, labor and environmental compliance. Delays in obtaining permits, shortages in materials and qualified labor, suppliers and contractors not performing as required under their contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, poor quality initial cost estimates from contractors, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel costs, or materials costs, downward changes in the economy, changes in law or regulation, including environmental compliance requirements, and other events beyond the control of the Utility operating companies or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost and performance of these projects. If these projects are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, Entergy and the Utility operating companies could incur additional costs and termination payments, or face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project. For further information regarding capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital in connection with the potential construction of additional generation supply sources within the Utility operating companies' service territory, and as to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see the "Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital" section of Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of the Registrant Subsidiaries. The Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters. The businesses in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation by local, state and Federal authorities. These laws and regulations affect the manner in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business conduct their operations and make capital expenditures. These laws and regulations also affect how the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business manage air emissions, discharges to water, solid and hazardous waste storage and disposal, cooling and service water intake, the protection of threatened and endangered species, hazardous materials transportation, and similar matters. Federal, state, and local authorities continually revise these laws and regulations, and the laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and to the permitting and enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. Developing and implementing plans for facility compliance with these requirements can lead to capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures. Violations of these requirements can subject the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties' claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. In addition, the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to liability under these laws for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned or operated by the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. The Utility operating companies are currently involved in proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been released and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. The Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance. 251 Table of Contents Part I Item 1A & 1B Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury, particulates, and other regulated air contaminants from generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulation, controls and mitigation expenses. In addition, existing air regulations and programs promulgated by the EPA often are challenged legally, sometimes resulting in large-scale changes to anticipated regulatory regimes and the resulting need to shift course, both operationally and economically, depending on the nature of the changes. Risks relating to global climate change and initiatives to compel CO2 emission reductions are discussed below. Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if Entergy and its subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, the operation of its facilities could be stopped or become subject to additional costs. For further information regarding environmental regulation and environmental matters, see the "Regulation of Entergy's Business – Environmental Regulation" section of Part I, Item 1. The Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs related to reliability standards. Entergy's business is subject to extensive and mandatory reliability standards. Such standards, which are established by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and the SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC), are approved by the FERC and frequently are reviewed, amended and supplemented. Failure to comply with such standards could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of such standards. The standards, as well as the laws and regulations that govern them, are subject to judicial interpretation and to the enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. In addition to exposure to civil penalties and fines, the Utility operating companies have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to compliance with new and existing reliability standards, including costs associated with the Utility operating companies’ transmission system. The changes to the reliability standards applicable to the electric power industry are ongoing, and Entergy cannot predict the ultimate effect that the reliability standards will have on its Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. Entergy has notified the SERC of potential violations of certain NERC reliability standards, including certain Critical Infrastructure Protection, Facilities Design, Connection and Maintenance, and System Protection and Control standards. Entergy is working with the SERC to provide information concerning these potential violations. In addition, FERC’s Division of Investigations is conducting an investigation of certain issues relating to the Utility operating companies compliance with certain Reliability Standards related to protective system maintenance, facility ratings and modeling, training, and communications. (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) The effects of weather and economic conditions and the related impact on electricity and gas usage, may materially affect the Utility operating companies' results of operations. Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenues, and temperatures below moderate levels in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenues. As a corollary, moderate temperatures tend to decrease usage of energy and resulting revenues. Seasonal pricing differentials, coupled with higher consumption levels, typically cause the Utility operating companies to report higher revenues in the third quarter of the fiscal year than in the other quarters. Extreme weather conditions or storms, however, may stress the Utility operating companies' generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on their ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. These extreme conditions could have a material effect on the Utility operating companies' financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Industrial sales volume was depressed in the latter part of 2008 and through most of 2009, in part because the overall economy declined, with lower usage across the industrial sector affecting both the large customer industrial segment as well as small and mid-sized industrial customers. It is possible that continued or recurrent poor economic conditions could result in slower or declining sales growth and increased bad debt expense, which could materially affect Entergy's and the Utility operating companies' results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 252 Table of Contents Part I Item 1A & 1B Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy The effects of climate change and environmental and regulatory obligations intended to compel CO2 emission reductions could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies. In an effort to address climate change concerns, Federal, state, and local authorities are calling for additional laws and regulations aimed at known or suspected causes of climate change. For example, in response to the United States Supreme Court's 2007 decision holding that the EPA has authority to regulate emissions of CO2 and other "greenhouse gases" under the Clean Air Act, the EPA, various environmental interest groups and other organizations are focusing considerable attention on CO2 emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. In 2010, EPA promulgated its first regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from certain vehicles and from new and significantly modified stationary sources of emissions, including electric generating units, and additional new source performance standards are expected to be proposed in 2012. Developing and implementing plans for compliance with CO2 emissions reduction requirements can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing facilities and proposed projects; moreover, long term planning to meet environmental requirements can be negatively impacted and costs may increase to the extent laws and regulations change prior to full implementation. Violations of such requirements may subject Entergy and the Utility operating companies to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties' claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. To the extent Entergy believes any of these costs are recoverable in rates, however, additional material rate increases for customers could be resisted by Entergy's regulators and, in extreme cases, Entergy's regulators might deny or defer timely recovery of these costs. Future changes in environmental regulation governing the emission of CO2 and other "greenhouse gases" could make some of Entergy's electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the difficulty that Entergy and its subsidiaries have with obtaining or maintaining required environmental regulatory approvals, which could also materially affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies. In addition, multiple lawsuits currently are pending against emitters of greenhouse gases alleging that these companies are liable for personal injuries and property damage caused by climate change. These lawsuits seek injunctive relief, monetary compensation, and punitive damages. In addition to the regulatory and financial risks associated with climate change discussed above, physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level, wetland and barrier island erosion, risks of flooding and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation, average temperatures and potential increased impacts of extreme weather conditions or storms. Entergy subsidiaries own assets in, and serve, communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, storms and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands. A significant portion of the nation’s oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by wetland and barrier island erosion, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes. These and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on the Entergy System's ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. Also, to the extent that climate change adversely impacts the economic health of a region or results in energy conservation or demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and revenues. Such physical or operational risks could have a material effect on Entergy's and the Utility operating companies' financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 253 Table of Contents Part I Item 1A & 1B Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity prices, which could materially affect Entergy's and its subsidiaries' results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. To manage their near-term financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, Entergy and its subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, may enter into contracts to hedge portions of their purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements and inventories of natural gas, uranium (and its conversion), coal, refined products, and other commodities, within established risk management guidelines. As part of this strategy, Entergy and its subsidiaries may utilize fixed- and variable-price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. However, Entergy and its subsidiaries normally cover only a portion of the exposure of their assets and positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. In addition, Entergy also elects to leave certain volumes during certain years unhedged. To the extent Entergy and its subsidiaries have unhedged positions, fluctuating commodity prices can materially affect Entergy's and its subsidiaries' results of operations and financial position. Although Entergy and its subsidiaries devote a considerable effort to these risk management strategies, they cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these activities. As a result of these and other factors, Entergy and its subsidiaries cannot predict with precision the impact that risk management decisions may have on their business, results of operations or financial position. Entergy has guaranteed or indemnified the performance of a portion of the obligations relating to hedging and risk management activities. Reductions in Entergy's or its subsidiaries' credit quality or changes in the market prices of energy commodities could increase the cash or letter of credit collateral required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management activities, which could materially affect Entergy's or its subsidiaries' liquidity and financial position. The Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations, which may materially affect the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. The hedging and risk management practices of the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe Entergy and its subsidiaries money, energy, or other commodities will not perform their obligations. Currently, some hedging agreements contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure their obligations to Entergy or its subsidiaries. If the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, Entergy or its subsidiaries may enforce and recover the proceeds from the credit support provided and acquire alternative hedging arrangements or draw on the credit support provided by the counterparties, which credit support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. In such event, Entergy and its subsidiaries might incur losses in addition to amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. In addition, the credit commitments of Entergy's lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such lenders, which could materially affect the adequacy of its liquidity sources. The Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010 and rules and regulations promulgated under the act may adversely affect the ability of the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to utilize certain commodity derivatives for hedging and mitigating commercial risk. The Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, which was enacted on July 21, 2010 as part of the Dodd-Frank Act Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the rules and regulations to be promulgated under the act will impose governmental regulation on the over-the-counter derivative market, including the commodity swaps used by the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to hedge and mitigate commercial risk. Under the act, certain swaps will be subject to mandatory clearing and exchange trading requirements. Swap dealers and major participants in the swap market will be subject to capital, margin, registration, reporting, recordkeeping and business conduct requirements with respect to their swap activities. Position limits will also apply to certain swaps activities. The act requires the applicable regulators, which in the case of commodity swaps will be the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to engage in substantial rulemaking in order to implement the provisions of the act and such rulemaking is not yet final. Both the Utility operating companies 254 Table of Contents Part I Item 1A & 1B Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business currently utilize commodity swaps to hedge and mitigate commodity price risk. It is not known whether the act and regulations promulgated under the act will have an adverse effect upon the market for the commodity swaps used by the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. However, to the extent that the act and regulations promulgated under the act have the effect of increasing the price of such commodity swaps or limiting or reducing the availability of such commodity swaps, whether through the imposition of additional capital, margin or compliance costs upon market participants or otherwise, the financial performance of the Utility operating companies and/or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may be adversely affected. To the extent that the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business would be required to post margin in connection with existing or future commodity swaps in addition to any margin currently posted by such entities, such entities may need to secure additional sources of capital to meet such liquidity needs or cease utilizing such commodity swaps. Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require additional funding. The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under Entergy's pension and postretirement benefit plans. A decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements relating to Entergy's benefit plan liabilities. The recent recession and volatility in the capital markets have affected the market value of these assets, which may affect Entergy's planned levels of contributions in the future. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Entergy's pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. The funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans can also increase as a result of changes in, among other factors, retirement rates, life expectancy assumptions, or Federal regulations. Guidance pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical corrections bills and discussed within the industry and by congressional lawmakers. Any changes to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 as a result of these discussions and efforts may affect the level of Entergy's pension contributions in the future. For further information regarding Entergy's pension and other postretirement benefit plans, reference is made to the "Critical Accounting Estimates – Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits" section of Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of its Registrant Subsidiaries and Note 11 to the financial statements. The litigation environment in the states in which certain Entergy subsidiaries operate poses a significant risk to those businesses. Entergy and its subsidiaries are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, asbestos, hazardous material and ratepayer matters, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters. The states in which the Utility operating companies operate, in particular Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, have proven to be unusually litigious environments. Judges and juries in these states have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort cases. Entergy and its subsidiaries use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against them, but the litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk. Terrorist attacks, including cyber attacks, and failures or breaches of Entergy’s and its subsidiaries’ technology systems may adversely affect Entergy’s results of operations. As power generators and distributors, Entergy and its subsidiaries face heightened risk of an act or threat of terrorism, including physical and cyber attacks, either as a direct act against one of Entergy's generation facilities, an act against the transmission and distribution infrastructure used to transport power that affects its ability to operate, or an act against the information technology systems and network infrastructure of Entergy and its subsidiaries. 255 Table of Contents Part I Item 1A & 1B Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy Entergy and its subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite the implementation of security measures by Entergy and its subsidiaries, all technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures, or unauthorized access due to such activities. If Entergy’s or its subsidiaries’ technology systems were to fail or be breached and be unable to recover in a timely way, Entergy or its subsidiaries may be unable to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and other data could be compromised. If any such attacks, failures or breaches were to occur, Entergy's and the Utility operating companies’ business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially affected. The risk of such attacks, failures, or breaches also may cause Entergy and the Utility operating companies to incur increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for its nuclear power plants and other facilities, such as additional physical facility security and additional security personnel, and for systems to protect its information technology and network infrastructure systems. Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact Entergy’s, the Utility operating companies’ and System Energy’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Entergy and its subsidiaries make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use and employment-related taxes. These judgments include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. Entergy and its subsidiaries also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. Changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by Entergy and its subsidiaries could negatively affect Entergy's, the Utility operating companies' and System Energy's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. For further information regarding Entergy's accounting for tax obligations, reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements. Entergy and the Utility operating companies may be unable to satisfy the conditions or obtain the approvals to complete the transaction with ITC or such approvals may contain material restrictions or conditions. See “Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business” in Entergy Corporation’s Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of the agreements that Entergy entered in December 2011 to spin off its transmission business and merge it with a newly-formed subsidiary of ITC Holdings Corp. The consummation of the ITC transaction is subject to numerous conditions, including (i) consummation of certain transactions and financings contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Separation Agreement (such as the separation of the Transmission Business conducted by the Utility operating companies, (ii) obtaining the required ITC shareholder approvals, and (iii) the receipt of certain regulatory approvals from governmental agencies necessary to consummate the ITC transaction, and that no such regulatory approvals impose a burdensome condition on ITC or Entergy as described in the Merger Agreement. Entergy can make no assurances that the ITC transaction will be consummated on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all. Governmental agencies may not approve the ITC transaction or may impose conditions to the approval of the ITC transaction or require changes to the terms of the ITC transaction. Any such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the ITC transaction, imposing costs on or limiting the revenues of Entergy or the Utility operating companies or otherwise reducing the anticipated benefits of the ITC transaction. Any condition or change could result in a burdensome condition on the Transmission Business or ITC under the Merger Agreement and might cause Entergy or ITC to abandon the ITC transaction. In addition, Entergy must pay its costs related to the ITC transaction including, legal, accounting, advisory, financing and filing fees and printing costs, whether the ITC transaction is completed or not. Any failure to consummate the ITC transaction as currently contemplated, or at all, could have a material effect on the business and results of operations of Entergy and the Utility operating companies and the trading price of Entergy Corporation’s common stock could be adversely affected. 256 Table of Contents Part I Item 1A & 1B Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy (Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans) The effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers may adversely affect Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's and Entergy New Orleans' results of operations and liquidity. Gas rates charged to retail gas customers are comprised primarily of purchased gas cost charges, which provide no return or profit to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans, and distribution charges, which provide a return or profit to the utility. Distribution charges are affected by the amount of gas sold to customers. Purchased gas cost charges, which comprise most of a customer's bill and may be adjusted quarterly, represent gas commodity costs that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans recovers from its customers. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's or Entergy New Orleans' cash flows can be affected by differences between the time period when gas is purchased and the time when ultimate recovery from customers occurs. When purchased gas cost charges increase substantially reflecting higher gas procurement costs incurred by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans, customer usage may decrease, especially in weaker economic times, resulting in lower distribution charges for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans which could adversely affect results of operations. (System Energy) System Energy owns and operates a single nuclear generating facility, and it is dependent on affiliated companies for all of its revenues. System Energy's operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% ownership/leasehold interest in Grand Gulf. Charges under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are paid by the Utility operating companies as consideration for their respective entitlements to receive capacity and energy. The useful economic life of Grand Gulf is finite and is limited by the terms of its operating license, which is currently due to expire on November 1, 2024. System Energy filed in October 2011 an application with the NRC for an extension of Grand Gulf’s operating license to 2045. The NRC accepted the filing in December 2011 and there is an expected NRC review period of 22 months before an order would be issued. System Energy's financial condition depends both on the receipt of payments from the Utility operating companies under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and on the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf. For information regarding the Unit Power Sales Agreement and certain other agreements relating to the Entergy System companies' support of System Energy (including the Capital Funds Agreement), see the "Grand Gulf - Related Agreements" section of Note 8 to the financial statements and the "Utility - System Energy and Related Agreements" section of Part I, Item 1. (Entergy Corporation) Entergy Corporation's holding company structure could limit its ability to pay dividends. Entergy Corporation is a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, all of its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. Entergy Corporation's ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the payment to it of dividends or distributions by its subsidiaries. The payments of dividends or distributions to Entergy Corporation by its subsidiaries in turn depend on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings, and on any applicable legal, regulatory, or contractual limitations on subsidiaries’ ability to pay such dividends or distributions. Provisions in the organizational documents, indentures for debt issuances, and other agreements of certain of Entergy Corporation's subsidiaries restrict the payment of cash dividends to Entergy Corporation. For further information regarding dividend or distribution restrictions to Entergy Corporation, reference is made to the "COMMON EQUITY – Retained Earnings and Dividend Restrictions" section of Note 7 to the financial statements. 257 Table of Contents Part I Item 1A & 1B Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy If completed, the transaction with ITC may not achieve its anticipated results. Entergy entered into the ITC transaction with the expectation that it would result in various benefits, including the receipt by Entergy’s shareholders of shares of ITC common stock as a result of the transaction. If the ITC transaction is consummated, it is possible that the full strategic, financial, operational and regulatory benefits to Entergy and its shareholders that Entergy expected would result from the ITC transaction may not be achieved or that such benefits may be delayed or not occur due to unforeseen changes in market, economic or regulatory conditions or other events. As a result, the aggregate market price of the common stock of Entergy Corporation and the shares of ITC common stock that shareholders of Entergy Corporation would receive in the ITC transaction could be less than the market price of Entergy Corporation’s common stock if the ITC transaction had not occurred. 258 Table of Contents ENTERGY ARKANSAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business See the “Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of this matter, including the planned retirement of debt and preferred securities. Results of Operations Net Income 2011 Compared to 2010 Net income decreased $7.7 million primarily due to a higher effective income tax rate, lower other income, and higher other operation and maintenance expenses, substantially offset by higher net revenue, lower depreciation and amortization expenses, and lower interest expense. 2010 Compared to 2009 Net income increased $105.7 million primarily due to higher net revenue, a lower effective income tax rate, higher other income, and lower depreciation and amortization expenses, partially offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses. Net Revenue 2011 Compared to 2010 Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2011 to 2010. Amount (In Millions) 2010 net revenue $1,216.7 Retail electric price 31.0 ANO decommissioning trust 26.4 Transmission revenue 13.1 Volume/weather (15.9) Net wholesale revenue (11.9) Capacity acquisition recovery (10.3) Other 3.2 2011 net revenue $1,252.3 The retail electric price variance is primarily due to a base rate increase effective July 2010. See Note 2 to the financial statements for more discussion of the rate case settlement. The ANO decommissioning trust variance is primarily related to the deferral of investment gains from the ANO 1 and 2 decommissioning trust in 2010 in accordance with regulatory treatment. The gains resulted in an increase in 2010 in interest and investment income and a corresponding increase in regulatory charges with no effect on net income. 259 Table of Contents Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis The transmission revenue variance is primarily due to a revision to transmission investment equalization billings under the Entergy System Agreement among the Utility operating companies (for the approximate period of 1996 – 2011) recorded in the fourth quarter 2011. The volume/weather variance is primarily due to the effect of less favorable weather on residential and commercial sales, partially offset by more favorable weather-adjusted usage in the residential sector. The net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to lower margins on co-owner contracts and lower wholesale billings to affiliate companies due to lower expenses. The capacity acquisition recovery variance is primarily due to the cessation of the capacity acquisition rider to recover expenses incurred because those costs are recovered in base rates effective July 2010. Net Revenue 2010 Compared to 2009 Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2010 to 2009. Amount (In Millions) 2009 net revenue $1,102.4 Volume/weather 84.2 Provision for regulatory proceedings 26.1 Retail electric price 16.1 2009 capitalization of Ouachita Plant service charges 12.5 ANO decommissioning trust (24.4) Net wholesale revenue (12.2) Other 12.0 2010 net revenue $1,216.7 The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 2,078 GWh, or 10%, in billed electricity usage. Usage in the industrial sector increased primarily in the small industrial customers segment, as well as in the petroleum refining, chemicals, industrial inorganic, and pulp and paper industries, reflecting strong sales growth on continuing signs of economic recovery. The effect of more favorable weather was the primary driver of the increase in residential and commercial sales. The provision for regulatory proceedings variance is primarily due to provisions recorded in 2009. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of regulatory proceedings affecting Entergy Arkansas. The retail electric price variance is primarily due to a base rate increase effective July 2010, partially offset by the recovery in 2009 of 2008 extraordinary storm costs, as approved by the APSC, which ceased in January 2010. The recovery of storm costs is offset in other operation and maintenance expenses. See Note 2 to the financial statements for more discussion of the rate case settlement and the 2008 extraordinary storm costs. In 2009, Entergy Arkansas capitalized $12.5 million of Ouachita Plant service charges that were previously expensed. The result of the capitalization in 2009 was a decrease in net revenues with an offsetting decrease in other operation and maintenance expenses. The ANO decommissioning trust variance is primarily related to the deferral of investment gains from the ANO 1 and 2 decommissioning trust. The gains resulted in an increase in interest and investment income and a corresponding increase in regulatory charges with no effect on net income in accordance with regulatory treatment. 260 Table of Contents Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis The net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to reduced margin on wholesale contracts including lower capacity billings to an affiliate for the Ouachita unit that was later purchased by the affiliate in November 2009, and lower margins on co-owner contracts, somewhat offset by lower wholesale energy costs. Gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses Gross operating revenues decreased primarily due to: · a decrease of $98.6 million in rider revenues primarily due to lower System Agreement payments in 2010; · a decrease of $95.6 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to a change in the energy cost recovery rider rate change effective April 2010; and · a decrease of $72.5 million in gross wholesale revenue due to decreased sales to affiliated customers and the expiration of a wholesale customer contract in 2009. The decrease was offset by volume/weather, as discussed above. Fuel and purchased power expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in the average market price of purchased power. Other Income Statement Variances 2011 Compared to 2010 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: · an increase of $6.1 million in fossil-fueled generation costs due to higher fossil plant outage costs due to a greater scope of work in 2011; · an increase of $3.9 million in transmission and distribution maintenance work in 2011; · $3.5 million in contract costs due to the transition and implementation of joining the MISO RTO; and · an increase of $3 million in nuclear expenses primarily due to higher labor and contract costs caused by several factors. The increase was offset by a $7.5 million decrease in compensation and benefits costs primarily resulting from an increase in the accrual for incentive-based compensation in 2010 and a decrease in stock option expense. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in depreciation rates as a result of the rate case settlement agreement approved by the APSC in June 2010. Other income decreased primarily due to the investment gains on the ANO 1 and 2 decommissioning trust in 2010, as discussed above in net revenue, and the carrying charges on storm restoration costs recorded in 2010 related to the January 2009 ice storm. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the 2009 ice storm costs and Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of the August 2010 issuance of securitization bonds to finance these costs. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates. 2010 Compared to 2009 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: · an increase of $21.7 million in compensation and benefits costs, resulting from decreasing discount rates, the amortization of benefit trust asset losses, and an increase in the accrual for incentive-based compensation. See Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs; · an increase of $6.2 million in vegetation and maintenance expenses; and 261 Table of Contents Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis · an increase of $5.4 million in nuclear expenses primarily due to higher labor costs, higher materials costs, and additional projects. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $19.4 million due to 2008 storm costs which were deferred per an APSC order and were recovered through revenues in 2009. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in depreciation rates as a result of the rate case settlement agreement approved by the APSC in June 2010. Other income increased primarily due to the investment gains on the ANO 1 and 2 decommissioning trust discussed above in net revenue. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates for 2011, 2010, and 2009 were 44.6%, 39.6%, and 55.0%, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to the effective income tax rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources In April 2011, several thunderstorms with either tornados or straight-line winds caused damage to Entergy Arkansas’s transmission and distribution lines, equipment poles, and other facilities. The incurred cost of repairing that damage is $70 million, of which $19 million is operating and maintenance costs that are charged against the storm cost provision, and the remainder is capital investment. Cash Flow Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were as follows: 2011 2010 2009 (In Thousands) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period $106,102 $86,233 $39,568 Cash flow provided by (used in): Operating activities 564,124 512,260 384,192 Investing activities (503,524) (413,180) (281,512) Financing activities (144,103) (79,211) (56,015) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (83,503) 19,869 46,665 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $22,599 $106,102 $86,233 Operating Activities Cash flow from operations increased $51.9 million in 2011 primarily due to: · income tax refunds of $90 million in 2011 compared to income tax payments of $66.4 million in 2010. In 2011, Entergy Arkansas received tax cash refunds in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The refunds result from a decrease in 2010 taxable income from what was previously estimated because of the recognition of additional repair expenses for tax purposes associated with a tax accounting change filed in 2010 and from the reversal of temporary differences for which Entergy Arkansas previously made cash tax payments; and · a decrease of $16.6 million in pension contributions. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding. 262 Table of Contents Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis The increase was offset by under-recovery of fuel costs and spending resulting from the April 2011 storms discussed above. Cash flow from operations increased $128.1 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in net revenue as discussed above, ice storm spending in 2009, and the collection of previously under-recovered fuel costs through the normal operation of the energy cost recovery rider. The increase was offset by an increase of $112 million in pension contributions, and an increase of $65 million in income tax payments. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding. In 2010 Entergy Arkansas made tax payments in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The payments resulted from the reversal of temporary differences for which Entergy Arkansas previously received cash tax benefits and from estimated federal income tax payments for tax year 2010. Investing Activities Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $90.3 million in 2011 primarily due to an increase of $66.3 million in nuclear fuel purchases primarily due to the purchase of nuclear fuel inventory from System Fuels because the Utility companies will now purchase nuclear fuel throughout the nuclear fuel procurement cycle, rather than purchasing it from System Fuels at the time of refueling. The increase is also due to $51 million in storm restoration spending resulting from the April storms as discussed above, and $30 million in transmission substation reliability work in 2011. The increase was partially offset by money pool activity. Decreases in Entergy Arkansas’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Arkansas’s receivable from the money pool decreased by $24.1 million in 2011 compared to increasing by $12.6 million in 2010. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings. Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $131.7 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to: · the sale to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana of one-third of the Ouachita plant for $75 million in 2009; · proceeds from the sale/leaseback of nuclear fuel of $118.6 million in 2009. See Note 18 to the financial statements for a discussion of the consolidation of the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity effective January 1, 2010; and · increases in nuclear construction expenditures primarily due to the ANO 1 reactor coolant pump upgrade project and security upgrades. The increase was offset by a decrease in distribution construction expenditures as a result of an ice storm hitting Entergy Arkansas’s service territory in the first quarter 2009. Financing Activities Net cash flow used in financing activities increased $64.9 million in 2011 primarily due to: · the issuance of $575 million of first mortgage bonds by Entergy Arkansas and $124.1 million of storm cost recovery bonds by Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding, LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy Arkansas, in 2010 compared to the issuance of the $55 million Series J note by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity in 2011; and · a decrease in borrowings on the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity’s credit facility. The increase was offset by: · the retirement of $450 million of first mortgage bonds and $139.5 million of pollution control revenue bonds in 2010 compared to the retirement of the $35 million Series G note by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity in 2011; and · a decrease of $55.6 million in common stock dividends in 2011. 263 Table of Contents Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Net cash flow used in financing activities increased $23.2 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to: · retirements of $450 million of first mortgage bonds in 2010; · retirements of $139.5 million of pollution control bonds in 2010; and · an increase of $125.1 million in common stock dividends paid in 2010. The increase was offset by: · issuances of $575 million of first mortgage bonds in 2010; and · the issuance in August 2010 of $124.1 million of storm cost recovery bonds by Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding, LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy Arkansas. See Note 5 to the financial statements for details of long-term debt. Capital Structure Entergy Arkansas’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 Debt to capital 55.0% 55.9% Effect of excluding the securitization bonds (1.5)% (1.6)% Debt to capital, excluding securitization bonds (1) 53.5% 54.3% Effect of subtracting cash (0.3)% (1.5)% Net debt to net capital, excluding securitization bonds (1) 53.2% 52.8% (1) Calculation excludes the securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy Arkansas. Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of notes payable, capital lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt, preferred stock without sinking fund, and common equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Arkansas uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Arkansas’s financial condition. Uses of Capital Entergy Arkansas requires capital resources for: · construction and other capital investments; · debt and preferred stock maturities or retirements; · working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and · dividend and interest payments. 264 Table of Contents Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Following are the amounts of Entergy Arkansas’s planned construction and other capital investments, existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments), and other purchase obligations: 2012 2013-2014 2015-2016 after 2016 Total (In Millions) Planned construction and capital investment (1): Generation $359 $207 N/A N/A $566 Transmission 117 242 N/A N/A 359 Distribution 122 254 N/A N/A 376 Other 26 37 N/A N/A 63 Total $624 $740 N/A N/A $1,364 Long-term debt (2) $84 $538 $175 $2,070 $2,867 Capital lease payments $0.2 $0.5 $0.2 $- $0.9 Operating leases $23 $42 $29 $5 $99 Purchase obligations (3) $646 $1,201 $618 $1,792 $4,257 (1) Includes approximately $234 million annually for maintenance capital, which is planned spending on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of service, equipment or systems and to support normal customer growth. (2) Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements. (3) Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy Arkansas, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which is discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements. In addition, Entergy Arkansas currently expects to contribute approximately $31.9 million to its pension plans and approximately $26.7 million to other postretirement plans in 2012 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Arkansas has $113.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. The planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Arkansas reflects capital required to support existing business and customer growth. Entergy’s Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, the ability to access capital, and the outcome of Entergy Arkansas’s exit from the Entergy System Agreement (which is discussed in “System Agreement” in the “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis). Management provides more information on long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements. As a wholly-owned subsidiary, Entergy Arkansas pays dividends to Entergy Corporation from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly. Entergy Arkansas’s long-term debt indentures restrict the amount of retained earnings available for the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on its common and preferred stock. As of December 31, 2011, Entergy Arkansas had restricted retained earnings unavailable for distribution to Entergy Corporation of $394.9 million. 265 Table of Contents Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Hot Spring Energy Facility Purchase Agreement In April 2011, Entergy Arkansas announced that it signed an asset purchase agreement to acquire the Hot Spring Energy Facility, a 620 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle turbine plant located in Hot Spring County, Arkansas, from a subsidiary of KGen Power Corporation. The purchase price is expected to be approximately $253 million. Entergy Arkansas also expects to invest in various plant upgrades at the facility after closing and expects the total cost of the acquisition, including plant upgrades, transaction costs, and contingencies, to be approximately $277 million. A new transmission service request has been submitted to the ICT to determine if investments for supplemental upgrades in the Entergy transmission system are needed to make energy from the Hot Spring Energy Facility deliverable to Entergy Arkansas for the period after Entergy Arkansas exits the System Agreement. The initial results of the service request were received in January 2012 and indicate that available transfer capability does not exist with existing transmission facilities and that upgrades are required. The studies do not provide a final and definitive indication of what those upgrades would be. Entergy Arkansas has submitted transmission service requests for facilities studies which, when performed by the ICT, will provide more detailed estimates of the transmission upgrades and the associated costs required to obtain network service for the Hot Spring plant. Accordingly there are still uncertainties that must be resolved. The purchase is contingent upon, among other things, obtaining necessary approvals, including full cost recovery, from various federal and state regulatory and permitting agencies. These include regulatory approvals from the APSC and the FERC, as well as clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust law. In February 2012 the FERC issued an order approving the acquisition. Closing is expected to occur in mid-2012. In July 2011, Entergy Arkansas filed its application with the APSC requesting approval of the acquisition and full cost recovery. In January 2012, Entergy Arkansas, the APSC General Staff, and the Arkansas Attorney General filed a Motion to Suspend the Procedural Schedule and Joint Stipulation and Settlement for consideration by the APSC. Under the settlement, the parties agreed that the acquisition costs may be recovered through a capacity acquisition rider and agreed that the level of the return on equity reflected in the rider would be submitted to the APSC for resolution. Because the transmission upgrade costs remain uncertain, the parties requested that the APSC suspend the procedural schedule and cancel the hearing scheduled for January 24, 2012, pending resolution of the transmission costs. The APSC issued an order accepting the settlement as part of the record and directing Entergy Arkansas to file the transmission studies when available and directing the parties to propose a procedural schedule to address the results of those studies. Sources of Capital Entergy Arkansas’s sources to meet its capital requirements include: · internally generated funds; · cash on hand; · debt or preferred stock issuances; and · bank financing under new or existing facilities. Entergy Arkansas may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt and preferred stock prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable. All debt and common and preferred stock issuances by Entergy Arkansas require prior regulatory approval. Preferred stock and debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in Entergy Arkansas’s corporate charters, bond indentures, and other agreements. Entergy Arkansas has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs. 266 Table of Contents Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Entergy Arkansas’s receivables from the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 2011 2010 2009 2008 (In Thousands) $17,362 $41,463 $28,859 $15,991 In April 2011, Entergy Arkansas entered into a new $78 million credit facility that expires in April 2012. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Entergy Arkansas credit facility as of December 31, 2011. Entergy Arkansas has obtained short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow through October 2013, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $250 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Arkansas’s short-term borrowing limits. Entergy Arkansas has also obtained an order from the APSC authorizing long-term securities issuances through December 2012. State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery Retail Rates 2009 Base Rate Filing In September 2009, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC for a general change in rates, charges, and tariffs. In June 2010 the APSC approved a settlement and subsequent compliance tariffs that provide for a $63.7 million rate increase, effective for bills rendered for the first billing cycle of July 2010. The settlement provides for a 10.2% return on common equity. Production Cost Allocation Rider The APSC approved a production cost allocation rider for recovery from customers of the retail portion of the costs allocated to Entergy Arkansas as a result of the System Agreement proceedings. These costs cause an increase in Entergy Arkansas’s deferred fuel cost balance, because Entergy Arkansas pays the costs over seven months but collects them from customers over twelve months. See Note 2 to the financial statements and Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - System Agreement” for discussions of the System Agreement proceedings. Energy Cost Recovery Rider Entergy Arkansas’s retail rates include an energy cost recovery rider to recover fuel and purchased energy costs in monthly bills. The rider utilizes prior calendar year energy costs and projected energy sales for the twelve-month period commencing on April 1 of each year to develop an energy cost rate, which is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over-recovery or under-recovery, including carrying charges, of the energy cost for the prior calendar year. The energy cost recovery rider tariff also allows an interim rate request depending upon the level of over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs. In early October 2005, the APSC initiated an investigation into Entergy Arkansas's interim energy cost recovery rate. The investigation focused on Entergy Arkansas's 1) gas contracting, portfolio, and hedging practices; 2) wholesale purchases during the period; 3) management of the coal inventory at its coal generation plants; and 4) response to the contractual failure of the railroads to provide coal deliveries. In March 2006, the APSC extended its investigation to cover the costs included in Entergy Arkansas's March 2006 annual energy cost rate filing, and a hearing was held in the APSC energy cost recovery investigation in October 2006. 267 Table of Contents Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis In January 2007 the APSC issued an order in its review of the energy cost rate. The APSC found that Entergy Arkansas failed to maintain an adequate coal inventory level going into the summer of 2005 and that Entergy Arkansas should be responsible for any incremental energy costs resulting from two outages caused by employee and contractor error. The coal plant generation curtailments were caused by railroad delivery problems and Entergy Arkansas has since resolved litigation with the railroad regarding the delivery problems. The APSC staff was directed to perform an analysis with Entergy Arkansas’s assistance to determine the additional fuel and purchased energy costs associated with these findings and file the analysis within 60 days of the order. After a final determination of the costs is made by the APSC, Entergy Arkansas would be directed to refund that amount with interest to its customers as a credit on the energy cost recovery rider. Entergy Arkansas requested rehearing of the order. In March 2007, in order to allow further consideration by the APSC, the APSC granted Entergy Arkansas’s petition for rehearing and for stay of the APSC order. In October 2008 Entergy Arkansas filed a motion to lift the stay and to rescind the APSC's January 2007 order in light of the arguments advanced in Entergy Arkansas’s rehearing petition and because the value for Entergy Arkansas’s customers obtained through the resolved railroad litigation is significantly greater than the incremental cost of actions identified by the APSC as imprudent. In December 2008, the APSC denied the motion to lift the stay pending resolution of Entergy Arkansas’s rehearing request and the unresolved issues in the proceeding. The APSC ordered the parties to submit their unresolved issues list in the pending proceeding, which the parties did. In February 2010 the APSC denied Entergy Arkansas’s request for rehearing, and held a hearing in September 2010 to determine the amount of damages, if any, that should be assessed against Entergy Arkansas. A decision is pending. Entergy Arkansas expects the amount of damages, if any, to have an immaterial effect on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. The APSC also established a separate docket to consider the resolved railroad litigation, and in February 2010 it established a procedural schedule that concluded with testimony through September 2010. Testimony has been filed and the APSC will decide the case based on the record in the proceeding, including the prefiled testimony. Storm Cost Recovery Entergy Arkansas January 2009 Ice Storm In January 2009, a severe ice storm caused significant damage to Entergy Arkansas’s transmission and distribution lines, equipment, poles, and other facilities. A law was enacted in April 2009 in Arkansas that authorizes securitization of storm damage restoration costs. In June 2010, the APSC issued a financing order authorizing the issuance of storm cost recovery bonds, including carrying costs of $11.5 million and $4.6 million of up-front financing costs. In August 2010, Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding, LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy Arkansas, issued $124.1 million of storm cost recovery bonds. See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the issuance of the storm cost recovery bonds. Federal Regulation See “Independent Coordinator of Transmission”, “System Agreement”, “Entergy’s Proposal to Join the MISO RTO”, “Notice to SERC Reliability Corporation Regarding Reliability Standards and FERC Investigation”, and “U.S. Department of Justice Investigation” in the “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation – Federal Regulation” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of these topics. Nuclear Matters Entergy Arkansas owns and operates, through an affiliate, the ANO 1 and ANO 2 nuclear power plants. Entergy Arkansas is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating nuclear plants. These include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of either ANO 1 or ANO 2, Entergy Arkansas may be required to file with the APSC a rate mechanism to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. 268 Table of Contents Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis The nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials associated with components within the reactor coolant system. The issue is applicable to ANO and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines and includes in-service examinations, replacement and mitigation strategy. Several major modifications to the ANO units have been implemented to mitigate the susceptibility of large bore dissimilar metal welds. In addition, a replacement reactor vessel head has been fabricated for ANO 2 and is onsite. Routine inspections of the existing ANO 2 reactor vessel head have identified no significant material degradation issues for that component. These inspections will continue at planned refueling outages. Timing for installation of the new reactor vessel head will be based on the results of future inspection efforts. After the nuclear incident in Japan resulting from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the NRC established a task force to conduct a review of processes and regulations relating to nuclear facilities in the United States. The task force issued a near term (90-day) report in July 2011 that has made recommendations, which are currently being evaluated by the NRC. It is anticipated that the NRC will issue certain orders and requests for information to nuclear plant licensees by the end of the first quarter 2012 that will begin to implement the task force’s recommendations. These orders may require U.S. nuclear operators, including Entergy, to undertake plant modifications or perform additional analyses that could, among other things, result in increased costs and capital requirements associated with operating Entergy’s nuclear plants. Environmental Risks Entergy Arkansas’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Arkansas is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of Entergy Arkansas’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Arkansas’s financial position or results of operations. Nuclear Decommissioning Costs See “Nuclear Decommissioning Costs” in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs. Unbilled Revenue As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Arkansas records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation. 269 Table of Contents Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Entergy sponsors qualified, defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age and meet certain eligibility requirements while still working for Entergy. Entergy’s reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate. Cost Sensitivity The following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost and qualified projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands): Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2011 Qualified Pension Cost Impact on Qualified Projected Benefit Obligation Increase/(Decrease) Discount rate (0.25%) $2,964 $37,338 Rate of return on plan assets (0.25%) $1,837 - Rate of increase in compensation 0.25% $1,218 $6,706 The following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands): Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2011 Postretirement Benefit Cost Impact on Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation Increase/(Decrease) Health care cost trend 0.25% $1,378 $8,340 Discount rate (0.25%) $972 $10,175 Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant. Costs and Funding Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Arkansas in 2011 was $33.7 million. Entergy Arkansas anticipates 2012 qualified pension cost to be approximately $53 million. Entergy Arkansas’s contributions to the pension trust were $120.4 million in 2011 and are currently estimated to be approximately $31.9 million in 2012 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Arkansas in 2011 were $17 million, including $6.3 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Arkansas expects 2012 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $18.1 million, including $5.8 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Arkansas expects to contribute approximately $26.7 million to other postretirement plans in 2012. 270 Table of Contents Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Federal Healthcare Legislation See the “Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits - Federal Healthcare Legislation” in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of Federal Healthcare Legislation.

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business See the “Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of this matter, including the planned retirement of debt and preferred securities. Results of Operations Net Income 2011 Compared to 2010 Net income increased $12.3 million primarily due to lower interest expense and lower other operation and maintenance expenses, offset by higher depreciation and amortization expenses and a higher effective income tax rate. 2010 Compared to 2009 Net income increased $37.7 million primarily due to higher net revenue, a lower effective income tax rate, and lower interest expense, offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses, lower other income, and higher taxes other than income taxes. Net Revenue 2011 Compared to 2010 Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory credits. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2011 to 2010. Amount (In Millions) 2010 net revenue $933.6 Retail electric price (20.1) Volume/weather (5.2) Fuel recovery 14.8 Transmission revenue 12.4 Other (2.1) 2011 net revenue $933.4 The retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in credits passed on to customers as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financing. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike” and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing. The volume/weather variance is primarily due to less favorable weather on the residential sector as well as the unbilled sales period. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of 62 GWh, or 0.3%, in billed electricity usage, primarily due to increased consumption by an industrial customer as a result of the customer’s cogeneration outage and the addition of a new production unit by the industrial customer. The fuel recovery variance resulted primarily from an adjustment to deferred fuel costs in 2010. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of fuel recovery. 280 Table of Contents Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis The transmission revenue variance is primarily due to a revision to transmission investment equalization billings under the Entergy System Agreement among the Utility operating companies (for the approximate period of 1996 – 2011) recorded in the fourth quarter 2011. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the revision. Fuel and purchased power expenses Fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to: · an increase in deferred fuel expense due to the timing of receipt of System Agreement payments and credits to customers; · an increase in natural gas fuel expense primarily due to increased generation; and · an increase in deferred fuel expense due to fuel and purchased power expense decreases in excess of lower fuel cost recovery revenues. The increase was offset by a decrease in the average market price of purchased power and decreased net area demand. 2010 Compared to 2009 Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory credits. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2010 to 2009. Amount (In Millions) 2009 net revenue $861.3 Retail electric price 66.7 Volume/weather 32.7 Fuel recovery (28.7) Other 1.6 2010 net revenue $933.6 The retail electric price variance is primarily due to formula rate plan increases effective November 2009, January 2010, and September 2010. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the formula rate plan increases. The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 1,861 GWh, or 10%, in billed electricity usage, primarily in the industrial sector as a result of increased consumption in the chemicals industry, and also the effect of more favorable weather on the residential and commercial sectors. The fuel recovery variance resulted primarily from an adjustment to deferred fuel costs in the fourth quarter 2009 relating to unrecovered nuclear fuel costs incurred since January 2008 that will now be recovered after a revision to the fuel adjustment clause methodology. Gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses Gross operating revenues increased primarily due to: · an increase of $100.9 million in rider revenues due to lower System Agreement credits in 2010; · formula rate plan increases effective November 2009, January 2010, and September 2010, as noted above; · an increase of $64.5 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to increased usage primarily in the industrial sector; and · the increase related to volume/weather, as discussed above. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in gross wholesale revenues primarily due to the transfer of several wholesale customers to Entergy Texas in 2009 and decreased system agreement remedy receipts. 281 Table of Contents Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to an increase in the average market price of purchased power. Other Income Statement Variances 2011 Compared to 2010 Nuclear refueling outage expenses decreased primarily due to the amortization of lower expenses associated with the planned maintenance and refueling outage at River Bend in the first quarter 2011. Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to: · a decrease of $6 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses primarily due to fewer outages and a reduced scope of work compared to 2010; and · a decrease of $4.2 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily resulting from an increase in the accrual for incentive-based compensation in 2010 and a decrease in stock option expense. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $2.9 million in costs due to the transition and implementation of joining the MISO RTO, as well as several individually insignificant items. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to a revision in the second quarter 2010 related to depreciation on storm cost-related assets and an increase in plant in service. Recovery of the storm cost-related assets will now be through the Act 55 financing of storm costs as approved by the LPSC in June 2010. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike” and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing. Interest expense decreased primarily due to: · redemptions of first mortgage bonds of $68 million in June 2010 and $304 million in November 2010, partially offset by the issuance of first mortgage bonds of $250 million in October 2010. See Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of long-term debt; and · interest expense accrued in 2010 related to the expected result of the LPSC Staff audit of the fuel adjustment clause for the period 1995 through 2004. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of fuel recovery. 2010 Compared to 2009 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $12.4 million in fossil expenses due to higher plant maintenance costs and plant outages and a $12.1 million increase in compensation and benefits costs resulting from decreasing discount rates, the amortization of benefit trust asset losses, and an increase in the accrual for incentive-based compensation. See Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefit costs. Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in local franchise taxes as a result of higher revenues primarily in the residential and commercial sectors and an increase in ad valorem taxes as a result of higher millage rates, a higher 2010 assessment, and a reduction in capitalized property taxes as compared to 2009. Other income decreased primarily due to a decrease of $30.1 million in interest and investment income related to the debt assumption agreement with Entergy Texas. In June 2010, Entergy Texas repaid the outstanding assumed debt and the debt assumption agreement was terminated. Interest expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in long-term debt outstanding as a result of redemptions of first mortgage bonds of $292 million in December 2009, $68 million in June 2010, and $304 million in November 2010, partially offset by issuances of first mortgage bonds of $300 million in October 2009 and $250 million in October 2010. See Note 5 to the financial statements for further discussion of the decrease in long-term debt. 282 Table of Contents Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 30.3%, 28.5%, and 36.8% for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were as follows: 2011 2010 2009 (In Thousands) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period $155,173 $144,460 $49,303 Cash flow provided by (used in): Operating activities 482,115 726,130 234,930 Investing activities (267,262) (541,583) (286,486) Financing activities (345,181) (173,834) 146,713 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (130,328) 10,713 95,157 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $24,845 $155,173 $144,460 Operating Activities Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $244 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to: · proceeds of $240.3 million received from the LURC as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financings in 2010. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing; and · higher nuclear refueling outage spending at River Bend. River Bend had a refueling outage in 2011 and did not have one in 2010. The decrease was partially offset by income tax refunds of $56.3 million in 2011 compared to income tax refunds of $16.8 million in 2010. In 2011, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana received tax cash refunds in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The refunds resulted from the reversal of temporary differences for which Entergy Gulf States Louisiana previously made cash tax payments. Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $491.2 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to: · storm cost proceeds of $240.3 million received from the LURC as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financings; · the absence in 2010 of the storm restoration spending that occurred in 2009. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing; and · income tax refunds of $16.8 million in 2010 compared to income tax payments of $60.6 million in 2009. In 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana received tax cash refunds in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The refunds resulted from the reversal of temporary differences for which Entergy Gulf States Louisiana previously made cash tax payments. 283 Table of Contents Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Investing Activities Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $274.3 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to: · the investment in 2010 of $150.3 million in affiliate securities and the investment of $90.1 million in the storm reserve escrow account as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financings. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing; and · money pool activity. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in nuclear fuel purchases because River Bend had a refueling outage in 2011 and did not have one in 2010. Decreases in Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool decreased by $39.4 million in 2011 compared to increasing by $12.9 million in 2010. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings. Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $255.1 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to: · the investment of $150.3 million in affiliate securities and the investment of $90.1 million in the storm reserve escrow account as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financings. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing; · proceeds from the sale/leaseback of nuclear fuel of $72.8 million in 2009. See Note 18 to the financial statements for discussion of the consolidation of nuclear fuel company variable interest entities effective January 1, 2010; and · an increase in construction expenditures primarily due to $24.9 million in costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at River Bend. See “New Nuclear Development” below. The increase was partially offset by the purchase of one-third (Unit 3) of the three-unit, 789 MW Ouachita Power Plant for $75 million in November 2009 from Entergy Arkansas and money pool activity. Increases in Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool increased by $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to increasing by $38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Financing Activities Net cash flow used in financing activities increased $171.3 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase of $177.7 million in common equity distributions. Financing activities used cash of $173.8 million in 2010 compared to providing cash of $146.7 million in 2009 primarily due to: · net cash issuances of $178.2 million of long-term debt in 2009; · net cash redemptions of $38.6 million of long-term debt in 2010; and · an increase of $93.6 million in common equity distributions. 284 Table of Contents Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Capital Structure Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. The increase in the debt to capital ratio for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana as of December 31, 2011 is primarily due to a decrease in member’s equity as a result of an increase of $177.6 million in common equity distributions. December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 Debt to capital 52.2% 51.2% Effect of subtracting cash (0.4)% (2.6)% Net debt to net capital 51.8% 48.6% Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of notes payable and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and members’ equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s financial condition. Uses of Capital Entergy Gulf States Louisiana requires capital resources for: · construction and other capital investments; · debt and preferred equity maturities or retirements; · working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and · distribution and interest payments. Following are the amounts of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s planned construction and other capital investments, existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments), and other purchase obligations: 2012 2013-2014 2015-2016 after 2016 Total (In Millions) Planned construction and capital investment (1): Generation $67 $102 N/A N/A $169 Transmission 95 139 N/A N/A 234 Distribution 59 132 N/A N/A 191 Other 18 34 N/A N/A 52 Total $239 $407 N/A N/A $646 Long-term debt (2) $141 $262 $203 $1,924 $2,530 Operating leases $11 $29 $16 $66 $122 Purchase obligations (3) $154 $237 $209 $54 $654 (1) Includes approximately $152 million annually for maintenance capital, which is planned spending on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of service, equipment or systems and to support normal customer growth. (2) Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements. (3) Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, it primarily includes unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations. In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana expects to contribute $10.8 million to its pension plans and $8.3 million to other postretirement plans in 2012 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. 285 Table of Contents Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Also, in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has $318.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. The planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana reflects capital required to support existing business and customer growth. Entergy’s Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. Management provides more information on long-term debt maturities in Note 5 to the financial statements. As an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Corporation, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana pays distributions from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s long-term debt indentures contain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on its common and preferred membership interests. New Nuclear Development Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana provided public notice to the LPSC of their intention to make a filing pursuant to the LPSC’s general order that governs the development of new nuclear generation in Louisiana. The project option being developed by the companies is for new nuclear generation at River Bend. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, together with Entergy Mississippi, have been engaged in the development of options to construct new nuclear generation at the River Bend and Grand Gulf sites. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana are leading the development at River Bend, and Entergy Mississippi is leading the development at Grand Gulf. This project is in the early stages, and several issues remain to be addressed over time before significant additional capital would be committed to this project. In the first quarter 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana each paid for and recognized on its books $24.9 million in costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at the River Bend site; these costs previously had been recorded on the books of Entergy New Nuclear Utility Development, LLC, a System Energy subsidiary. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana will share costs going forward on a 50/50 basis, which reflects each company’s current participation level in the project. In March 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC seeking approval to continue the development activities. The testimony and legal briefs of the LPSC staff generally support the request of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, although other parties filed briefs, without supporting testimony, in opposition to the request. An evidentiary hearing was held in October 2011 and the ALJ’s decision is pending. Sources of Capital Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s sources to meet its capital requirements include: · internally generated funds; · cash on hand; · debt or preferred membership interest issuances; and · bank financing under new or existing facilities. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt and preferred equity/membership interests prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable. 286 Table of Contents Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis All debt and common and preferred equity/membership interest issuances by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana require prior regulatory approval. Preferred equity/membership interest and debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indentures and other agreements. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s receivables from the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 2011 2010 2009 2008 (In Thousands) $23,596 $63,003 $50,131 $11,589 See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has a credit facility in the amount of $100 million scheduled to expire in August 2012. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2011. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana obtained short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow through October 2013, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $200 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s short-term borrowing limits. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has also obtained an order from the FERC authorizing long-term securities issuances through July 2013. Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike In September 2008, Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike caused catastrophic damage to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s service territory. The storms resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage to distribution, transmission, and generation infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages. In October 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana drew all of its $85 million funded storm reserve. On October 15, 2008, the LPSC approved Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s request to defer and accrue carrying cost on unrecovered storm expenditures during the period the company seeks regulatory recovery. The approval was without prejudice to the ultimate resolution of the total amount of prudently incurred storm cost or final carrying cost rate. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana filed their Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike storm cost recovery case with the LPSC in May 2009. In September 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana and the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation (LURC), an instrumentality of the State of Louisiana, filed with the LPSC an application requesting that the LPSC grant financing orders authorizing the financing of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana’s storm costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to Act 55 of the Louisiana Regular Session of 2007 (Act 55 financings). Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana’s Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita storm costs were financed primarily by Act 55 financings, as discussed below. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana also filed an application requesting LPSC approval for ancillary issues including the mechanism to flow charges and Act 55 financing savings to customers via a Storm Cost Offset rider. In December 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana entered into a stipulation agreement with the LPSC Staff that provides for total recoverable costs of approximately $234 million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and $394 million for Entergy Louisiana, including carrying costs. Under this stipulation, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana agrees not to recover $4.4 million and Entergy Louisiana agrees not to recover $7.2 million of their storm restoration spending. The stipulation also permits replenishing Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's storm reserve in the amount of $90 million and Entergy Louisiana's storm reserve in the amount of $200 million when the Act 55 financings are accomplished. In March and April 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and other parties to the proceeding filed with the LPSC an uncontested stipulated settlement that includes these terms and also includes Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana's proposals under the Act 55 financings, which includes a commitment to pass on to customers a minimum of $15.5 million and $27.75 million of customer benefits, respectively, through prospective annual rate reductions of $3.1 million and $5.55 million for five years. A stipulation hearing was held before the ALJ on April 13, 2010. On April 21, 2010, the LPSC approved the settlement and subsequently issued two financing orders and one ratemaking order intended to facilitate the implementation of the Act 55 financings. In June 2010 the Louisiana State Bond Commission approved the Act 55 financings. 287 Table of Contents Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis In July 2010 the Louisiana Local Government Environmental Facilities and Community Development Authority (LCDA) issued $244.1 million in bonds under Act 55. From the $240.3 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LCDA to the LURC, the LURC deposited $90 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and transferred $150.3 million directly to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. From the bond proceeds received by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana from the LURC, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana used $150.3 million to acquire 1,502,643.04 Class B preferred, non-voting, membership interest units of Entergy Holdings Company LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy, that carry a 9% annual distribution rate. Distributions are payable quarterly commencing on September 15, 2010, and the membership interests have a liquidation price of $100 per unit. The preferred membership interests are callable at the option of Entergy Holdings Company LLC after ten years under the terms of the LLC agreement. The terms of the membership interests include certain financial covenants to which Entergy Holdings Company LLC is subject, including the requirement to maintain a net worth of at least $1 billion. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana does not report the bonds on its balance sheet because the bonds are the obligation of the LCDA, and there is no recourse against Entergy Gulf States Louisiana in the event of a bond default. To service the bonds, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana collects a system restoration charge on behalf of the LURC, and remits the collections to the bond indenture trustee. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana does not report the collections as revenue because it is merely acting as the billing and collection agent for the state. Entergy Louisiana’s Ninemile Point Unit 6 Self-Build Project In June 2011, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC an application seeking certification that the public necessity and convenience would be served by Entergy Louisiana’s construction of a combined-cycle gas turbine generating facility (Ninemile 6) at its existing Ninemile Point electric generating station. Ninemile 6 will be a nominally-sized 550 MW unit that is estimated to cost approximately $721 million to construct, excluding interconnection and transmission upgrades. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana joined in the application, seeking certification of its purchase under a life-of-unit power purchase agreement of up to 35% of the capacity and energy generated by Ninemile 6. The Ninemile 6 capacity and energy is proposed to be allocated 55% to Entergy Louisiana, 25% to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, and 20% to Entergy New Orleans. In February 2012 the City Council passed a resolution authorizing Entergy New Orleans to purchase 20% of the Ninemile 6 energy and capacity. If approvals are obtained from the LPSC and other permitting agencies, Ninemile 6 construction is expected to begin in 2012, and the unit is expected to commence commercial operation by mid-2015. The ALJ has established a schedule for the LPSC proceeding that includes February 27 - March 7, 2012 hearing dates. State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery The rates that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the LPSC is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. Retail Rates – Electric In March 2005, the LPSC approved a settlement proposal to resolve various dockets covering a range of issues for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana. The settlement included the establishment of a three-year formula rate plan for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana that, among other provisions, establishes a return on common equity mid-point of 10.65% for the initial three-year term of the plan and permits Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to recover incremental capacity costs outside of a traditional base rate proceeding. Under the formula rate plan, over- and under-earnings outside an allowed range of 9.9% to 11.4% are allocated 60% to customers and 40% to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made its initial formula rate plan filing in June 2005. The formula rate plan was subsequently extended one year. As discussed below the formula rate plan has been extended, with return on common equity provisions consistent with previously approved provisions, to cover the 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 test years. 288 Table of Contents Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis In October 2009 the LPSC approved a settlement that resolved Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s 2007 test year filing and provided for a formula rate plan for the 2008, 2009, and 2010 test years. 10.65% is the target midpoint return on equity for the formula rate plan, with an earnings bandwidth of +/- 75 basis points (9.90% - 11.40%). Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, effective with the November 2009 billing cycle, reset its rates to achieve a 10.65% return on equity for the 2008 test year. The rate reset, a $44.3 million increase that includes a $36.9 million cost of service adjustment, plus $7.4 million net for increased capacity costs and a base rate reclassification, was implemented for the November 2009 billing cycle, and the rate reset was subject to refund pending review of the 2008 test year filing that was made in October 2009. In January 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana implemented an additional $23.9 million rate increase pursuant to a special rate implementation filing made in December 2009, primarily for incremental capacity costs approved by the LPSC. In May 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC staff submitted a joint report on the 2008 test year filing and requested that the LPSC accept the report, which resulted in a $0.8 million reduction in rates effective in the June 2010 billing cycle and a $0.5 million refund. At its May 19, 2010 meeting, the LPSC accepted the joint report. In May 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2009 test year. The filing reflected a 10.25% return on common equity, which is within the allowed earnings bandwidth, indicating no cost of service rate change is necessary under the formula rate plan. The filing does reflect, however, a revenue requirement increase to provide supplemental funding for the decommissioning trust maintained for the LPSC-regulated 70% share of River Bend, in response to a NRC notification of a projected shortfall of decommissioning funding assurance. The filing also reflected a rate increase for incremental capacity costs. In July 2010 the LPSC approved a $7.8 million increase in the revenue requirement for decommissioning, effective September 2010. In August 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made a revised 2009 test year filing. The revised filing reflected a 10.12% earned return on common equity, which is within the allowed earnings bandwidth resulting in no cost of service adjustment. The revised filing also reflected two increases outside of the formula rate plan sharing mechanism: (1) the previously approved decommissioning revenue requirement, and (2) $25.2 million for capacity costs. The rates reflected in the revised filing became effective, beginning with the first billing cycle of September 2010. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC staff subsequently submitted a joint report on the 2009 test year filing consistent with these terms and the LPSC approved the joint report in January 2011. In May 2011, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made a special formula rate plan rate implementation filing with the LPSC that implements effective with the May 2011 billing cycle a $5.1 million rate decrease to reflect adjustments in accordance with a previous LPSC order relating to the acquisition of Unit 2 of the Acadia Energy Center by Entergy Louisiana. As a result of the closing of the acquisition and termination of the pre-acquisition power purchase agreement with Acadia, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s allocation of capacity related to this unit ended, resulting in a reduction in the additional capacity revenue requirement. In May 2011, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2010 test year. The filing reflects an 11.11% earned return on common equity, which is within the allowed earnings bandwidth, indicating no cost of service rate change is necessary under the formula rate plan. The filing also reflects a $22.8 million rate decrease for incremental capacity costs. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC Staff subsequently filed a joint report that also stated that no cost of service rate change is necessary under the formula rate plan, and the LPSC approved it in October 2011. In November 2011 the LPSC approved a one-year extension of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s formula rate plan. In addition, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is required to file a full rate case by January 2013, if the LPSC has not acted to deny the requested transmission change-of-control to the MISO RTO. If the LPSC has denied this request, then the rate case must be filed by September 30, 2012. 289 Table of Contents Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Retail Rates – Gas In January 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ending September 30, 2008. The filing showed a revenue deficiency of $529 thousand based on a return on common equity mid-point of 10.5%. In April 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana implemented a $255 thousand rate increase pursuant to an uncontested settlement with the LPSC staff. In January 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2009. The filing showed an earned return on common equity of 10.87%, which is within the earnings bandwidth of 10.5% plus or minus fifty basis points, resulting in no rate change. In April 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed a revised evaluation report reflecting changes agreed upon with the LPSC Staff. The revised evaluation report also resulted in no rate change. In January 2011, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2010. The filing showed an earned return on common equity of 8.84% and a revenue deficiency of $0.3 million. In March 2011, the LPSC Staff filed its findings, suggesting an adjustment that will produce an 11.76% earned return on common equity for the test year and a $0.2 million rate reduction. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana implemented the $0.2 million rate reduction effective with the May 2011 billing cycle. The LPSC docket is now closed. In January 2012, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2011. The filing showed an earned return on common equity of 10.48%, which is within the earnings bandwidth of 10.5%, plus or minus fifty basis points. The sixty-day review and comment period for this filing remains open. Fuel and purchased power cost recovery In January 2003 the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate a proceeding to audit the fuel adjustment clause filings of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and its affiliates. The audit included a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana through its fuel adjustment clause for the period 1995 through 2004. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC Staff reached a settlement to resolve the audit that requires Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to refund $18 million to customers, including the realignment to base rates of $2 million of SO2 costs. The ALJ held a stipulation hearing and in November 2011 the LPSC issued an order approving the settlement. The refund was made in the November 2011 billing cycle. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana had previously recorded provisions for the estimated outcome of this proceeding. In December 2011 the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate another proceeding to audit the fuel adjustment clause filings of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and its affiliates. The audit includes a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana through its fuel adjustment clause for the period 2005 through 2009. In April 2010 the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate an audit of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s purchased gas adjustment clause filings for its gas distribution operations. The audit includes a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed through by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana for the period from 2003 through 2008. Discovery was completed and, in June 2011, the LPSC Staff filed an audit report generally supporting the appropriateness of charges flowed through the purchased gas adjustment clause filings. The LPSC approved the staff audit report in October 2011. Industrial and Commercial Customers Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s large industrial and commercial customers continually explore ways to reduce their energy costs. In particular, cogeneration is an option available to a portion of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s industrial customer base. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and negotiating electric service contracts to provide competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load profiles. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana actively participates in economic development, customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase industrial and commercial demand, from both new and existing customers. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana does not currently expect additional significant losses to cogeneration because of the current economics of the electricity markets and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s marketing efforts in retaining industrial customers. 290 Table of Contents Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C.

Nuclear Matters Entergy Gulf States Louisiana owns and, through an affiliate, operates the River Bend nuclear power plant. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear plant. These include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of River Bend, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. After the nuclear incident in Japan resulting from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the NRC established a task force to conduct a review of processes and regulations relating to nuclear facilities in the United States. The task force issued a near term (90-day) report in July 2011 that has made recommendations, which are currently being evaluated by the NRC. It is anticipated that the NRC will issue certain orders and requests for information to nuclear plant licensees by the end of the first quarter 2012 that will begin to implement the task force’s recommendations. These orders may require U.S. nuclear operators, including Entergy, to undertake plant modifications or perform additional analyses that could, among other things, result in increased costs and capital requirements associated with operating Entergy’s nuclear plants. Environmental Risks Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy’s financial position or results of operations. 291 Table of Contents Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Nuclear Decommissioning Costs See “Nuclear Decommissioning Costs” in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries’ Management’s Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs. Unbilled Revenue As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation. Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Entergy sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age and meet certain eligibility requirements while still working for Entergy. Entergy’s reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate. Cost Sensitivity The following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost and qualified projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands): Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2011 Qualified Pension Cost Impact on Qualified Projected Benefit Obligation Increase/(Decrease) Discount rate (0.25%) $1,542 $18,452 Rate of return on plan assets (0.25%) $981 - Rate of increase in compensation 0.25% $625 $3,439 The following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands): Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2011 Postretirement Benefit Cost Impact on Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation Increase/(Decrease) Health care cost trend 0.25% $990 $6,253 Discount rate (0.25%) $697 $7,114 Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant. 292 Table of Contents Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Costs and Funding Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana in 2011 was $9.4 million. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana anticipates 2012 qualified pension cost to be $19.8 million. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana contributed $27.3 million to its pension plans in 2011 and estimates 2012 pension contributions to be approximately $10.8 million; although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana in 2011 were $16.8 million, including $3.9 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana expects 2012 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $21.3 million, including $3.7 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana expects to contribute approximately $8.3 million to its other postretirement plans in 2012.

Results of Operations Net Income 2011 Compared to 2010 Net income increased $242.5 million primarily due to a settlement with the IRS related to the mark-to-market income tax treatment of power purchase contracts, which resulted in a $422 million income tax benefit. The net income effect was partially offset by a $199 million regulatory charge, which reduced net revenue, because a portion of the benefit will be shared with customers. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the settlement and benefit sharing. 2010 Compared to 2009 Net income decreased slightly by $1.4 million primarily due to higher other operation and maintenance expenses, a higher effective income tax rate, and higher interest expense, almost entirely offset by higher net revenue. Net Revenue 2011 Compared to 2010 Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2011 to 2010. Amount (In Millions) 2010 net revenue $1,043.7 Mark-to-market tax settlement sharing (195.9) Retail electric price 32.5 Volume/weather 11.6 Other (5.7) 2011 net revenue $886.2 The mark-to-market tax settlement sharing variance results from a regulatory charge because a portion of the benefits of a settlement with the IRS related to the mark-to-market income tax treatment of power purchase contracts will be shared with customers, slightly offset by the amortization of a portion of that charge beginning in October 2011. See Notes 3 and 8 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the settlement and benefit sharing. The retail electric price variance is primarily due to a formula rate plan increase effective May 2011. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the formula rate plan increase. 302 Table of Contents Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 1,095 GWh, or 4%, in billed electricity usage. Usage in the industrial sector increased primarily as a result of increased consumption by a large customer in the chemical industry as the result of a plant expansion. The increase was partially offset by the effect of less favorable weather on residential sales. Other regulatory charges (credits) Other regulatory charges increased primarily due to a settlement with the IRS related to the mark-to-market income tax treatment of power purchase contracts because a portion of the settlement will be shared with customers. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the settlement and benefit sharing. 2010 Compared to 2009 Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2010 to 2009. Amount (In Millions) 2009 net revenue $980.0 Volume/weather 52.9 Retail electric price 17.5 Other (6.7) 2010 net revenue $1,043.7 The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 2,253 GWh, or 8%, in billed electricity usage. Usage in the industrial sector increased primarily as a result of increased consumption by a large customer in the petroleum refining industry, as well as increases in the chemical industry. The effect of more favorable weather was the primary driver of the increase in the residential and commercial sales. The retail electric price variance is primarily due to a net increase in the formula rate plan effective November 2009 which allowed Entergy Louisiana to reset its rates to achieve a 10.25% return on equity for the 2008 test year. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of settlement and the formula rate plan reset. Gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses Gross operating revenues increased primarily due to: · an increase of $200.7 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to higher fuel rates and increased usage; · an increase of $114.9 million in rider revenues primarily due to lower System Agreement credits in 2010; and · the increase related to volume/weather, as discussed above. Fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to an increase in the average market price of purchased power, an increase in demand, and an increase in the recovery from customers of deferred fuel costs, partially offset by a decrease in the average market price of natural gas. 303 Table of Contents Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Other Income Statement Variances 2011 Compared to 2010 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $17.1 million in transmission investment equalization expenses as a result of a billing adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter 2011 related to prior transmission costs (for the approximate period of 1996-2011) allocable to Entergy Louisiana under the Entergy System Agreement and an increase of $17.5 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses due to an overall higher scope of outages compared to prior year and the addition of Acadia Unit 2 in April 2011. Other income increased primarily due to an increase of $10.8 million in distributions earned on preferred membership interests purchased from Entergy Holdings Company with the proceeds received from the Act 55 storm cost financing and an increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to more construction work in progress in 2011. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike” and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing. 2010 Compared to 2009 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: · an increase of $16.2 million in compensation and benefits costs, resulting from decreasing discount rates, the amortization of benefit trust asset losses, and an increase in the accrual for incentive-based compensation. See Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs; · an increase of $6.4 million in fossil expenses due to higher outage expenses compared to prior year; and · an increase of $5.9 million in nuclear expenses due to higher nuclear labor costs. Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $400 million of 5.40% Series first mortgage bonds in November 2009. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates for 2011, 2010, and 2009 were (357)%, 22.3%, and 16.2%, respectively. The decline in the rate for 2011 is primarily due to the reversal in the third quarter 2011 for uncertain tax positions resulting from a settlement with the IRS related to the mark-to-market income tax treatment of power purchase contracts. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to the effective income tax rates for 2009, 2010, and 2011 and for a discussion of the IRS settlement and audits. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were as follows: 2011 2010 2009 (In Thousands) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period $123,254 $151,849 $138,918 Cash flow provided by (used in): Operating activities 479,342 932,334 87,879 Investing activities (811,203) (861,329) (436,251) Financing activities 209,485 (99,600) 361,303 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (122,376) (28,595) 12,931 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $878 $123,254 $151,849 304 Table of Contents Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Operating Activities Cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $453 million in 2011 primarily due to proceeds of $462 million received in 2010 from the LURC as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financings. The decrease was partially offset by income tax refunds of $39.6 million in 2011 compared to income tax payments of $28.3 million in 2010. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike” and Note 2 to the financial statements herein for a discussion of the storm cost financings. In 2011, Entergy Louisiana received tax cash refunds in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The refunds primarily result from a decrease in 2010 taxable income from what was previously estimated because of the recognition of additional repair expenses for tax purposes associated with a tax accounting change filed in 2010. Cash flow provided by operating activities increased $844.5 million in 2010 primarily due to proceeds of $462.4 million received from the LURC as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financings, the absence in 2010 of the storm restoration spending that occurred in 2009, a decrease of $195.3 million in income tax payments, and increased recovery of fuel costs due to a higher fuel rate for the period, offset by an increase of $58.5 million in pension contributions. See “Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike” below and Note 2 to the financial statements herein for a discussion of the storm cost financings. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Critical Accounting Estimates” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits. In 2010, Entergy Louisiana made tax payments in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The payments resulted from the reversal of temporary differences for which Entergy Louisiana previously received cash tax benefits and from estimated federal income tax payments for tax year 2010. Investing Activities Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $50.1 million in 2011 primarily due to: · the investment in 2010 of $262.4 million in affiliate securities and the investment of $200 million in the storm reserve escrow account as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financings. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike” and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing; and · money pool activity. The increase was partially offset by: · the purchase of the Acadia Power Plant for approximately $300 million in April 2011; and · an increase in nuclear fuel purchases because of the timing of refueling outages and the purchase of nuclear fuel inventory from System Fuels because the Utility companies will now purchase nuclear fuel throughout the nuclear fuel procurement cycle, rather than purchasing it from System Fuels at the time of refueling. Decreases in Entergy Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool decreased by $49.9 million in 2011 compared to decreasing by $2.9 million in 2010. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings. Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $425.1 million in 2010 primarily due to the investment in 2010 of $262.4 million in affiliate securities and the investment of $200 million in the storm reserve escrow account as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financings, partially offset by decreased construction expenditures as a result of higher distribution construction expenditures in 2009 due to Hurricane Gustav and decreased fossil construction expenditures due to the suspension of the Little Gypsy repowering project in 2009. The decrease in construction expenditures was partially offset by an increase of $24.9 million in costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at River Bend, as discussed below, increased nuclear construction expenditures primarily due to the Waterford 3 steam generator replacement project and the dry fuel storage project, and increased transmission construction expenditures primarily due to additional reliability work. See “Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike” below and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the storm cost financings. See MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - “Little Gypsy Repowering Project” for a discussion of the suspension and subsequent cancellation of the Little Gypsy repowering project. 305 Table of Contents Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Financing Activities Entergy Louisiana’s financing activities provided cash of $209.5 million in 2011 compared to using cash of $99.6 million in 2010 primarily due to the following cash flow activity: · the issuance by Entergy Louisiana Investment Recovery Funding, L.L.C., a wholly owned subsidiary of Entergy Louisiana, of $207.2 million of senior secured investment recovery bonds with a coupon of 2.04% in September 2011; · net cash issuances of $200 million of first mortgage bonds in 2011 compared to net cash redemptions of $120 million of first mortgage bonds in 2010; · an increase in borrowings on the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity’s credit facility; · borrowings of $50 million on its credit facility in 2011; · the retirement of the $30 million Series D note by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity in January 2010; · the issuance of the $20 million Series F note by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity in March 2011; and · money pool activity. The increases were offset by the following: · common equity dividends of $358.2 million paid in 2011; · the issuance in October 2010 of $115 million of 5% Revenue Bonds Series 2010; and · a principal payment of $35.5 million in 2011 for the Waterford 3 sale-leaseback obligation compared to a principal payment of $17.3 million in 2010. Increases in Entergy Louisiana’s payable to the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Louisiana’s payable to the money pool increased by $118.4 million in 2011. Entergy Louisiana’s financing activities used $99.6 million in 2010 compared to providing $361.3 million in 2009. The following cash flow activity occurred: · net cash redemptions of $120 million of first mortgage bonds in 2010; · the retirement in January 2010 of the $30 million Series D note by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity; · the issuance in October 2010 of $115 million of 5% Revenue Bonds Series 2010; · the payment on credit borrowings of $24.1 million by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity; · $20.6 million in common equity distributions in 2009; and · a principal payment of $17.3 million in 2010 for the Waterford 3 sale-leaseback obligation compared to a principal payment of $6.6 million in 2009. See Note 5 to the financial statements for details of long-term debt. 306 Table of Contents Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Capital Structure Entergy Louisiana’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 Debt to capital 47.1% 46.1% Effect of excluding securitization bonds (2.4)% 0.0% Debt to capital, excluding securitization bonds (1) 44.7% 46.1% Effect of subtracting cash 0.0% (1.7)% Net debt to net capital, excluding securitization bonds (1) 44.7% 44.4% (1) Calculation excludes the securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy Louisiana. Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of notes payable, capital lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and members’ equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Louisiana uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Louisiana’s financial condition. Uses of Capital Entergy Louisiana requires capital resources for: · construction and other capital investments; · debt and preferred equity maturities or retirements; · working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and · distribution and interest payments. Following are the amounts of Entergy Louisiana’s planned construction and other capital investments, existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments), and other purchase obligations: 2012 2013-2014 2015-2016 After 2016 Total (In Millions) Planned construction and capital investment (1): Generation $487 $659 N/A N/A $1,146 Transmission 108 185 N/A N/A 293 Distribution 105 265 N/A N/A 370 Other 12 31 N/A N/A 43 Total $712 $1,140 N/A N/A $1,852 Long-term debt (2) $193 $314 $268 $3,084 $3,859 Operating leases $9 $14 $8 $2 $33 Purchase obligations (3) $609 $720 $705 $3,820 $5,854 (1) Includes approximately $217 million annually for maintenance capital, which is planned spending on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of service, equipment or systems and to support normal customer growth. (2) Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements. (3) Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy Louisiana, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Vidalia purchased power agreement and the Unit Power Sales Agreement, both of which are discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements. 307 Table of Contents Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Louisiana currently expects to contribute approximately $23.8 million to its pension plans and approximately $10 million to other postretirement plans in 2012 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Louisiana has $229.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. The planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Louisiana reflects capital required to support existing business and customer growth, including the replacement of the Waterford 3 steam generators and the Ninemile 6 self-build project, both of which are discussed below. Entergy’s Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. Management provides more information on long-term debt maturities in Note 5 to the financial statements. As an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Corporation, Entergy Louisiana pays distributions from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly. Entergy Louisiana’s long-term debt indentures contain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on its common and preferred membership interests. Waterford 3 Steam Generator Replacement Project Entergy Louisiana planned to replace the Waterford 3 steam generators, along with the reactor vessel closure head and control element drive mechanisms, in the spring 2011. Replacement of these components is common to pressurized water reactors throughout the nuclear industry. In December 2010, Entergy Louisiana advised the LPSC that the replacement generators would not be completed and delivered by the manufacturer in time to install them during the spring 2011 refueling outage. During the final steps in the manufacturing process, the manufacturer discovered separation of stainless steel cladding from the carbon steel base metal in the channel head of both replacement steam generators (RSGs), in areas beneath and adjacent to the divider plate. As a result of this damage, the manufacturer was unable to meet the contractual delivery deadlines, and the RSGs were not installed in the spring 2011. Entergy Louisiana worked with the manufacturer to fully develop and evaluate repair options, and expects the replacement steam generators to be delivered in time for the Fall 2012 refueling outage. Extensive inspections of the existing steam generators at Waterford 3 in cooperation with the manufacturer were completed in April 2011. The review of data obtained during these inspections supports the conclusion that Waterford 3 can operate safely for another full cycle before the replacement of the existing steam generators. Entergy Louisiana has formally reported its findings to the NRC. At this time, a requirement to perform a mid-cycle outage for further inspections in order to allow the plant to continue operation until its Fall 2012 refueling outage is not anticipated. Entergy Louisiana currently expects the cost of the project, including carrying costs, to be approximately $687 million, assuming the replacement occurs during the Fall 2012 refueling outage. In June 2008, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC for approval of the replacement project, including full cost recovery. Following discovery and the filing of testimony by the LPSC staff and an intervenor, the parties entered into a stipulated settlement of the proceeding. The LPSC unanimously approved the settlement in November 2008. The settlement resolved the following issues: 1) the accelerated degradation of the steam generators is not the result of any imprudence on the part of Entergy Louisiana; 2) the decision to undertake the replacement project at the then-estimated cost of $511 million is in the public interest, is prudent, and would serve the public convenience and necessity; 3) the scope of the replacement project is in the public interest; 4) undertaking the replacement project at the target installation date during the 2011 refueling outage is in the public interest; and 5) the jurisdictional costs determined to be prudent in a future prudence review are eligible for cost recovery, either in an extension or renewal of the formula rate plan or in a full base rate case including necessary pro forma adjustments. Upon completion of the replacement project, the LPSC will undertake a prudence review with regard to the following aspects of the replacement project: 1) project management; 2) cost controls; 3) success in achieving stated objectives; 4) the costs of the replacement project; and 5) the outage length and replacement power costs. 308 Table of Contents Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis See State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery below for a discussion of the renewal of Entergy Louisiana’s formula rate plan for the 2011 test year and its provisions addressing the Waterford 3 steam generator replacement project. Ninemile Point Unit 6 Self-Build Project In June 2011, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC an application seeking certification that the public necessity and convenience would be served by Entergy Louisiana’s construction of a combined-cycle gas turbine generating facility (Ninemile 6) at its existing Ninemile Point electric generating station. Ninemile 6 will be a nominally-sized 550 MW unit that is estimated to cost approximately $721 million to construct, excluding interconnection and transmission upgrades. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana joined in the application, seeking certification of its purchase under a life-of-unit power purchase agreement of up to 35% of the capacity and energy generated by Ninemile 6. The Ninemile 6 capacity and energy is proposed to be allocated 55% to Entergy Louisiana, 25% to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, and 20% to Entergy New Orleans. In February 2012 the City Council passed a resolution authorizing Entergy New Orleans to purchase 20% of the Ninemile 6 energy and capacity. If approvals are obtained from the LPSC and other permitting agencies, Ninemile 6 construction is expected to begin in 2012, and the unit is expected to commence commercial operation by mid-2015. The ALJ has established a schedule for the LPSC proceeding that includes February 27 - March 7, 2012 hearing dates. New Nuclear Development Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana provided public notice to the LPSC of their intention to make a filing pursuant to the LPSC’s general order that governs the development of new nuclear generation in Louisiana. The project option being developed by the companies is for new nuclear generation at River Bend. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, together with Entergy Mississippi, have been engaged in the development of options to construct new nuclear generation at the River Bend and Grand Gulf sites. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana are leading the development at River Bend, and Entergy Mississippi is leading the development at Grand Gulf. This project is in the early stages, and several issues remain to be addressed over time before significant additional capital would be committed to this project. In the first quarter 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana each paid for and recognized on its books $24.9 million in costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at the River Bend site; these costs previously had been recorded on the books of Entergy New Nuclear Utility Development, LLC, a System Energy subsidiary. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana will share costs going forward on a 50/50 basis, which reflects each company’s current participation level in the project. In March 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC seeking approval to continue the development activities. The testimony and legal briefs of the LPSC staff generally support the request of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, although other parties filed briefs, without supporting testimony, in opposition to the request. An evidentiary hearing was held in October 2011 and the ALJ’s decision is pending. Sources of Capital Entergy Louisiana’s sources to meet its capital requirements include: · internally generated funds; · cash on hand; · debt or preferred membership interest issuances; and · bank financing under new and existing facilities. Entergy Louisiana may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt and preferred membership interests prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and distribution rates are favorable. 309 Table of Contents Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis All debt and common and preferred membership interest issuances by Entergy Louisiana require prior regulatory approval. Preferred membership interest and debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indentures and other agreements. Entergy Louisiana has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs. Entergy Louisiana’s receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 2011 2010 2009 2008 (In Thousands) ($118,415) $49,887 $52,807 $61,236 See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. Entergy Louisiana has a credit facility in the amount of $200 million scheduled to expire in August 2012. As of December 31, 2011, $50 million was outstanding on the credit facility. Entergy Louisiana obtained short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow through October 2013, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $250 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Louisiana’s short-term borrowing limits. Entergy Louisiana has also obtained an order from the FERC authorizing long-term securities issuances through July 2013. In January 2012, Entergy Louisiana issued $250 million of 1.875% Series first mortgage bonds due December 2014. Entergy Louisiana used the proceeds to repay short-term borrowings under the Entergy System money pool. Little Gypsy Repowering Project In April 2007, Entergy Louisiana announced that it intended to pursue the solid fuel repowering of a 538 MW unit at its Little Gypsy plant. In March 2009 the LPSC voted in favor of a motion directing Entergy Louisiana to temporarily suspend the repowering project and, based upon an analysis of the project’s economic viability, to make a recommendation regarding whether to proceed with the project. This action was based upon a number of factors including the recent decline in natural gas prices, as well as environmental concerns, the unknown costs of carbon legislation and changes in the capital/financial markets. In April 2009, Entergy Louisiana complied with the LPSC’s directive and recommended that the project be suspended for an extended period of time of three years or more. In May 2009 the LPSC issued an order declaring that Entergy Louisiana’s decision to place the Little Gypsy project into a longer-term suspension of three years or more is in the public interest and prudent. In October 2009, Entergy Louisiana made a filing with the LPSC seeking permission to cancel the Little Gypsy repowering project and seeking project cost recovery over a five-year period. In June 2010 and August 2010, the LPSC Staff and Intervenors filed testimony. The LPSC Staff (1) agreed that it was prudent to move the project from long-term suspension to cancellation and that the timing of the decision to suspend on a longer-term basis was not imprudent; (2) indicated that, except for $0.8 million in compensation-related costs, the costs incurred should be deemed prudent; (3) recommended recovery from customers over ten years but stated that the LPSC may want to consider 15 years; (4) allowed for recovery of carrying costs and earning a return on project costs, but at a reduced rate approximating the cost of debt, while also acknowledging that the LPSC may consider ordering no return; and (5) 310 Table of Contents Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis indicated that Entergy Louisiana should be directed to securitize project costs, if legally feasible and in the public interest. In the third quarter 2010, in accordance with accounting standards, Entergy Louisiana determined that it was probable that the Little Gypsy repowering project would be abandoned and accordingly reclassified $199.8 million of project costs from construction work in progress to a regulatory asset. A hearing on the issues, except for cost allocation among customer classes, was held before the ALJ in November 2010. In January 2011 all parties participated in a mediation on the disputed issues, resulting in a settlement of all disputed issues, including cost recovery and cost allocation. The settlement provides for Entergy Louisiana to recover $200 million as of March 31, 2011, and carrying costs on that amount on specified terms thereafter. The settlement also provides for Entergy Louisiana to recover the approved project costs by securitization. In April 2011, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC to authorize the securitization of the investment recovery costs associated with the project and to issue a financing order by which Entergy Louisiana could accomplish such securitization. In August 2011 the LPSC issued an order approving the settlement and also issued a financing order for the securitization. See Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of the September 2011 issuance of the securitization bonds. Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike In September 2008, Hurricane Gustav (and, to a much lesser extent, Hurricane Ike) caused catastrophic damage to Entergy Louisiana’s service territory. The storms resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage to distribution, transmission, and generation infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages. On October 9, 2008, Entergy Louisiana drew all of its $134 million funded storm reserve. On October 15, 2008, the LPSC approved Entergy Louisiana’s request to defer and accrue carrying costs on unrecovered storm expenditures during the period the company seeks regulatory recovery. The approval was without prejudice to the ultimate resolution of the total amount of prudently incurred storm costs or final carrying costs rate. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana filed their Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike storm cost recovery case with the LPSC in May 2009. In September 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana and the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation (LURC), an instrumentality of the State of Louisiana, filed with the LPSC an application requesting that the LPSC grant financing orders authorizing the financing of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana’s storm costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to Act 55 of the Louisiana Regular Session of 2007 (Act 55 financings). Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana’s Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita storm costs were financed primarily by Act 55 financings, as discussed below. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana also filed an application requesting LPSC approval for ancillary issues including the mechanism to flow charges and Act 55 financing savings to customers via a Storm Cost Offset rider. In December 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana entered into a stipulation agreement with the LPSC Staff that provides for total recoverable costs of approximately $234 million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and $394 million for Entergy Louisiana, including carrying costs. Under this stipulation, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana agrees not to recover $4.4 million and Entergy Louisiana agrees not to recover $7.2 million of their storm restoration spending. The stipulation also permits replenishing Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's storm reserve in the amount of $90 million and Entergy Louisiana's storm reserve in the amount of $200 million when the Act 55 financings are accomplished. In March and April 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and other parties to the proceeding filed with the LPSC an uncontested stipulated settlement that includes these terms and also includes Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana's proposals under the Act 55 financings, which includes a commitment to pass on to customers a minimum of $15.5 million and $27.75 million of customer benefits, respectively, through prospective annual rate reductions of $3.1 million and $5.55 million for five years. A stipulation hearing was held before the ALJ on April 13, 2010. On April 21, 2010, the LPSC approved the settlement and subsequently issued two financing orders and one ratemaking order intended to facilitate the implementation of the Act 55 financings. In June 2010 the Louisiana State Bond Commission approved the Act 55 financings. In July 2010 the Louisiana Local Government Environmental Facilities and Community Development Authority (LCDA) issued $468.9 million in bonds under Act 55. From the $462.4 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LCDA to the LURC, the LURC deposited $200 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve for Entergy Louisiana and transferred $262.4 million directly to Entergy Louisiana. From the bond proceeds received by Entergy Louisiana from the LURC, Entergy Louisiana used $262.4 million to acquire 2,624,297.11 Class B preferred, non-voting, membership interest units of Entergy Holdings Company LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy, that carry a 9% annual distribution rate. Distributions are payable quarterly commencing on September 15, 2010, and the membership interests have a liquidation price of $100 per unit. The preferred membership interests are callable at the option of Entergy Holdings Company LLC after ten years under the terms of the LLC agreement. The terms of the membership interests include certain financial covenants to which Entergy Holdings Company LLC is subject, including the requirement to maintain a net worth of at least $1 billion. 311 Table of Contents Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Entergy Louisiana does not report the bonds on its balance sheet because the bonds are the obligation of the LCDA and there is no recourse against Entergy or Entergy Louisiana in the event of a bond default. To service the bonds, Entergy Louisiana collects a system restoration charge on behalf of the LURC, and remits the collections to the bond indenture trustee. Entergy Louisiana does not report the collections as revenue because it is merely acting as the billing and collection agent for the state. State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery The rates that Entergy Louisiana charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Louisiana is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the LPSC, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. In May 2005 the LPSC approved a rate filing settlement that included the adoption of a three-year formula rate plan, the terms of which included an ROE mid-point of 10.25% for the initial three-year term of the plan and permit Entergy Louisiana to recover incremental capacity costs outside of a traditional base rate proceeding. Under the formula rate plan, over- and under-earnings outside an allowed regulatory range of 9.45% to 11.05% will be allocated 60% to customers and 40% to Entergy Louisiana. The initial formula rate plan filing was made in May 2006. As discussed below the formula rate plan has been extended, with return on common equity provisions consistent with previously approved provisions, to cover the 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 test years. In October 2009 the LPSC approved a settlement that resolved Entergy Louisiana’s 2006 and 2007 test year filings provided for a new formula rate plan for the 2008, 2009, and 2010 test years. 10.25% is the target midpoint return on equity for the new formula rate plan, with an earnings bandwidth of +/- 80 basis points (9.45% - 11.05%). Entergy Louisiana was permitted, effective with the November 2009 billing cycle, to reset its rates to achieve a 10.25% return on equity for the 2008 test year. The rate reset, a $2.5 million increase that included a $16.3 million cost of service adjustment less a $13.8 million net reduction for decreased capacity costs and a base rate reclassification, was implemented for the November 2009 billing cycle, and the rate reset was subject to refund pending review of the 2008 test year filing that was made in October 2009. In April 2010, Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff submitted a joint report on the 2008 test year filing and requested that the LPSC accept the report, which resulted in a $0.1 million reduction in rates effective in the May 2010 billing cycle and a $0.1 million refund. In addition, Entergy Louisiana moved the recovery of approximately $12.5 million of capacity costs from fuel adjustment clause recovery to base rate recovery. At its April 21, 2010 meeting, the LPSC accepted the joint report. In May 2010, Entergy Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2009 test year. The filing reflected a 10.82% return on common equity, which is within the allowed earnings bandwidth, indicating no cost of service rate change is necessary under the formula rate plan. The filing does reflect, however, a revenue requirement increase to provide supplemental funding for the decommissioning trust maintained for Waterford 3, in response to a NRC notification of a projected shortfall of decommissioning funding assurance. The filing also reflected a rate change for incremental capacity costs. In July 2010 the LPSC approved a $3.5 million increase in the retail revenue requirement for decommissioning, effective September 2010. In August 2010, Entergy Louisiana made a revised 2009 test year formula rate plan filing. The revised filing reflected a 10.82% earned return on common equity, which is within the allowed earnings bandwidth resulting in no cost of service adjustment. The filing also reflected two increases outside of the formula rate plan sharing mechanism: (1) the previously approved decommissioning revenue requirement, and (2) $2.2 million for capacity costs. The rates reflected in the revised filing became effective beginning with the first billing cycle of September 2010. Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff subsequently submitted a joint report on the 2009 test year filing consistent with these terms and the LPSC approved the joint report in December 2010. In May 2011, Entergy Louisiana made a special formula rate plan rate implementation filing with the LPSC that implements effective with the May 2011 billing cycle a $43.1 million net rate increase to reflect adjustments in accordance with a previous LPSC order relating to the acquisition of Unit 2 of the Acadia Energy Center. The net rate increase represents the decrease in the additional capacity revenue requirement resulting from the termination of the power purchase agreement with Acadia and the increase in the revenue requirement resulting from the ownership of the Acadia facility. In August 2011, Entergy Louisiana made a filing to correct the May 2011 filing and decrease the rate by $1.1 million. 312 Table of Contents Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis In May 2011, Entergy Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2010 test year. The filing reflects an 11.07% earned return on common equity, which is just outside of the allowed earnings bandwidth and results in no cost of service rate change under the formula rate plan. The filing also reflects a very slight ($9 thousand) rate increase for incremental capacity costs. Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC Staff subsequently filed a joint report that reflects an 11.07% earned return and results in no cost of service rate change under the formula rate plan, and the LPSC approved the joint report in October 2011. In November 2011 the LPSC approved a one-year extension of Entergy Louisiana’s current formula rate plan. The next formula rate plan filing, for the 2011 test year, will be made in May 2012 and will include a separate identification of any operating and maintenance expense savings that are expected to occur once the Waterford 3 steam generator replacement project is complete. Pursuant to the LPSC decision, from September 2012 through December 2012 earnings above an 11.05% return on common equity (based on the 2011 test year) would be accrued and used to offset the Waterford 3 replacement steam generator revenue requirement for the first twelve months that the unit is in rates. If the project is not in service by January 1, 2013, earnings above a 10.25% return on common equity (based on the 2011 test year) for the period January 1, 2013 through the date that the project is placed in service will be accrued and used to offset the incremental revenue requirement for the first twelve months that the unit is in rates. Upon the in-service date of the replacement steam generators, rates will increase, subject to refund following any prudence review, by the full revenue requirement associated with the replacement steam generators, less (i) the previously accrued excess earnings from September 2012 until the in-service date and (ii) any earnings above a 10.25% return on common equity (based on the 2011 test year) for the period following the in-service date, provided that the excess earnings accrued prior to the in-service date shall only offset the revenue requirement for the first year of operation of the replacement steam generators. These rates are anticipated to remain in effect until Entergy Louisiana’s next full rate case is resolved. Entergy Louisiana is required to file a full rate case by January 2013, if the LPSC has not acted to deny the requested transmission change-of-control to the MISO RTO. If the LPSC has denied this request, then the rate case must be filed by September 30, 2012. In April 2010, the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate an audit of Entergy Louisiana's fuel adjustment clause filings. The audit includes a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed through the fuel adjustment clause by Entergy Louisiana for the period from 2005 through 2009. Discovery is in progress, but a procedural schedule has not been established. In August 2000, the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate a proceeding to audit the fuel adjustment clause filings of Entergy Louisiana. The time period that is the subject of the audit was January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2001. The scope of this docket was expanded to include a review of annual reports on fuel and purchased power transactions with affiliates and a prudence review of transmission planning issues and to include the years 2002 through 2004. Hearings were held and in May 2008 the ALJ issued a final recommendation that found in Entergy Louisiana’s favor on the issues, except for the disallowance of hypothetical SO2 allowance costs included in affiliate purchases. The ALJ recommended a refund of the SO2 allowance costs collected to date and a realignment of these costs into base rates prospectively with an amortization of the refunded amount through base rates over a five-year period. The LPSC issued an order in December 2008 affirming the ALJ’s recommendation. Entergy Louisiana recorded a provision for the disallowance, including interest, and refunded approximately $7 million to customers in 2009. Industrial and Commercial Customers Entergy Louisiana’s large industrial and commercial customers continually explore ways to reduce their energy costs. In particular, cogeneration is an option available to a portion of Entergy Louisiana’s industrial customer base. Entergy Louisiana responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and negotiating electric service contracts to provide competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load profiles. Entergy Louisiana actively participates in economic development, customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase industrial and commercial demand, from both new and existing customers. Entergy Louisiana does not currently expect additional significant losses to cogeneration because of the current economics of the electricity markets and Entergy Louisiana’s marketing efforts in retaining industrial customers. 313 Table of Contents Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Federal Regulation See “Independent Coordinator of Transmission”, “System Agreement”, “Entergy’s Proposal to Join the MISO RTO”, “Notice to SERC Reliability Corporation Regarding Reliability Standards and FERC Investigation”, and “U.S. Department of Justice Investigation” in the “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation – Federal Regulation” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of these topics. Nuclear Matters Entergy Louisiana owns and, through an affiliate, operates the Waterford 3 nuclear power plant. Entergy Louisiana is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear plant. These include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of Waterford 3, Entergy Louisiana may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. The nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials associated with components within the reactor coolant system. The issue is applicable to Waterford 3 and is managed in accordance with standard industry practices and guidelines. As discussed above in more detail, Entergy Louisiana plans to replace the Waterford 3 steam generators, along with the reactor vessel closure head and control element drive mechanisms. After the nuclear incident in Japan resulting from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the NRC established a task force to conduct a review of processes and regulations relating to nuclear facilities in the United States. The task force issued a near term (90-day) report in July 2011 that has made recommendations, which are currently being evaluated by the NRC. It is anticipated that the NRC will issue certain orders and requests for information to nuclear plant licensees by the end of the first quarter 2012 that will begin to implement the task force’s recommendations. These orders may require U.S. nuclear operators, including Entergy, to undertake plant modifications or perform additional analyses that could, among other things, result in increased costs and capital requirements associated with operating Entergy’s nuclear plants. Environmental Risks Entergy Louisiana’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Louisiana is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of Entergy Louisiana’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Louisiana’s financial position or results of operations. 314 Table of Contents Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Nuclear Decommissioning Costs See “Nuclear Decommissioning Costs” in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs. Unbilled Revenue As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Louisiana records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation. Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Entergy sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age and meet certain eligibility requirements while still working for Entergy. Entergy’s reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate. Cost Sensitivity The following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost and qualified projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands): Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2011 Qualified Pension Cost Impact on Projected Qualified Benefit Obligation Increase/(Decrease) Discount rate (0.25%) $1,989 $24,591 Rate of return on plan assets (0.25%) $1,143 - Rate of increase in compensation 0.25% $848 $4,931 The following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands): Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2011 Postretirement Benefit Cost Impact on Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation Increase/(Decrease) Health care cost trend 0.25% $984 $5,801 Discount rate (0.25%) $720 $6,995 Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant. 315 Table of Contents Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Costs and Funding Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Louisiana in 2011 was $23.6 million. Entergy Louisiana anticipates 2012 qualified pension cost to be $37.4 million. Entergy Louisiana contributed $60.6 million to its pension plans in 2011 and anticipates funding approximately $23.8 million in 2012 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Louisiana in 2011 were $18.2 million, including $3.9 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Louisiana expects 2012 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $22.1 million, including $3.6 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Louisiana expects to contribute approximately $10 million to its other postretirement plans in 2012.

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business See the “Plan to Spin Off the Utility’s Transmission Business” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of this matter, including the planned retirement of debt and preferred securities. Results of Operations Net Income 2011 Compared to 2010 Net income increased $23.4 million primarily due to a lower effective income tax rate. 2010 Compared to 2009 Net income increased $6.0 million primarily due to higher net revenue and higher other income, partially offset by higher taxes other than income taxes, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, and higher interest expense. Net Revenue 2011 Compared to 2010 Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2011 to 2010. Amount (In Millions) 2010 net revenue $555.3 Volume/weather (4.5) Transmission equalization 4.5 Other (0.4) 2011 net revenue $554.9 The volume/weather variance is primarily due to a decrease of 97 GWh in weather-adjusted usage in the residential and commercial sectors and a decrease in sales volume in the unbilled sales period. The transmission equalization variance is primarily due to the addition in 2011 of transmission investments that are subject to equalization. Gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses Gross operating revenues increased primarily due to an increase of $57.5 million in gross wholesale revenues due to an increase in sales to affiliated customers, partially offset by a decrease of $26.9 million in power management rider revenue. Fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to an increase in deferred fuel expense as a result of higher fuel revenues due to higher fuel rates, partially offset by a decrease in the average market prices of natural gas and purchased power. 326 Table of Contents Entergy Mississippi, Inc. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 2010 Compared to 2009 Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2010 to 2009. Amount (In Millions) 2009 net revenue $536.7 Volume/weather 18.9 Other (0.3) 2010 net revenue $555.3 The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 1,046 GWh, or 8%, in billed electricity usage in all sectors, primarily due to the effect of more favorable weather on the residential sector. Gross operating revenues, fuel and purchased power expenses, and other regulatory charges (credits) Gross operating revenues increased primarily due to an increase of $22 million in power management rider revenue as the result of higher rates, the volume/weather variance discussed above, and an increase in Grand Gulf rider revenue as a result of higher rates and increased usage, offset by a decrease of $23.5 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to lower fuel rates. Fuel and purchased power expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in deferred fuel expense as a result of prior over-collections, offset by an increase in the average market price of purchased power coupled with increased net area demand. Other regulatory charges increased primarily due to increased recovery of costs associated with the power management recovery rider. Other Income Statement Variances 2011 Compared to 2010 Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to: · a $5.4 million decrease in compensation and benefits costs primarily resulting from an increase in the accrual for incentive-based compensation in 2010 and a decrease in stock option expense; and · the sale of $4.9 million of surplus oil inventory. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $3.9 million in legal expenses due to the deferral in 2010 of certain litigation expenses in accordance with regulatory treatment. Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in ad valorem taxes due to a higher 2011 assessment as compared to 2010, partially offset by higher capitalized property taxes as compared with prior year. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service. Interest expense decreased primarily due to a revision caused by FERC’s acceptance of a change in the treatment of funds received from independent power producers for transmission interconnection projects. 327 Table of Contents Entergy Mississippi, Inc. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 2010 Compared to 2009 Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in ad valorem taxes as a result of higher millage rates and a higher 2010 assessment as compared to 2009 and an increase in local franchise taxes as a result of higher revenues primarily in the residential and commercial sectors. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service. Other income increased primarily due to an increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to more construction work in progress in 2010, including the new nuclear development project that is discussed below. Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $150 million of 6.64% Series first mortgage bonds in June 2009. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates for 2011, 2010, and 2009 were 20.9%, 37.0%, and 35.3%, respectively. The decline in the rate for 2011 is primarily due to an intercompany settle up for federal income taxes for years prior to 2008 which include an allocation of the tax benefit of Entergy Corporation’s expenses to the subsidiaries generating taxable income for the respective years. Entergy Mississippi received benefits for the effects of various tax positions settled with the IRS pertaining to the 2006/2007 audit. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to the effective income tax rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were as follows: 2011 2010 2009 (In Thousands) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period $1,216 $91,451 $1,082 Cash flow provided by (used in): Operating activities 99,596 120,107 222,018 Investing activities (151,830) (174,096) (159,473) Financing activities 51,034 (36,246) 27,824 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (1,200) (90,235) 90,369 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $16 $1,216 $91,451 Operating Activities Cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $20.5 million in 2011 primarily due to the purchase of $42.6 million of fuel oil inventory from System Fuels because System Fuels will no longer procure fuel oil for the Utility companies. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in the recovery of fuel costs. Cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $101.9 million in 2010 primarily due to decreased recovery of fuel costs primarily as a result of prior period over-collections and an increase of $27.7 million in pension contributions, offset by a decrease of $7.1 million in income tax payments. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of Entergy Mississippi’s fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below for further discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding. In 2010, Entergy Mississippi received federal tax cash refunds and made state tax cash payments in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The federal refunds resulted from the 2009 tax return filed in 2010 and the associated true up adjustment which relates primarily to the acceleration of deductions for plant-related expenditures. The state payments result from the allocation of the combined Mississippi tax reflected on the 2009 tax return filed in 2010 and for amended Mississippi returns for 2006-2008 filed in 2010. 328 Table of Contents Entergy Mississippi, Inc. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Investing Activities Cash flow used in investing activities decreased $22.3 million in 2011 primarily due to a decrease in construction expenditures because of a $49 million payment in 2010 to a System Energy subsidiary for costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf and the repayment by System Fuels of Entergy Mississippi’s $5.5 million investment in System Fuels. The decrease was offset by money pool activity. Decreases in Entergy Mississippi’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi’s receivable from the money pool decreased $31.4 million in 2010. Entergy Mississippi did not have a receivable from the money pool in 2011. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce Entergy’s subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings. Cash flow used in investing activities increased $14.6 million in 2010 primarily due to increased construction expenditures resulting from a $49 million payment to a System Energy subsidiary for costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf, as discussed below, and increased transmission construction expenditures resulting from additional transmission reliability work in 2010, offset by money pool activity. Decreases in Entergy Mississippi’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi’s receivable from the money pool decreased $31.4 million in 2010 compared to increasing by $31.4 million in 2009. Financing Activities Entergy Mississippi’s financing activities provided $51.0 million of cash in 2011 compared to using $36.2 million of cash in 2010 primarily due to: · the issuance of $275 million of first mortgage bonds in 2011 compared to the issuance of $80 million of first mortgage bonds in 2010; and · a decrease of $40.1 million in common stock dividends. The cash provided was partially offset by the redemption of $180 million of first mortgage bonds in 2011 compared to the redemption of $100 million of first mortgage bonds in 2010 and money pool activity. Decreases in Entergy Mississippi’s payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi’s payable to the money pool decreased by $31.3 million in 2011 compared to increasing by $33.3 million in 2010. Entergy Mississippi’s financing activities used $36.2 million of cash in 2010 compared to providing $27.8 million of cash in 2009 primarily due to: · the redemption, prior to maturity, of $100 million of 7.25% Series first mortgage bonds in April 2010; · the issuance of $150 million of 6.64% Series first mortgage bonds in June 2009; and · the issuance of $80 million of 6.20% Series first mortgage bonds in April 2010; offset by · money pool activity. 329 Table of Contents Entergy Mississippi, Inc. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Increases in Entergy Mississippi’s payable to the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi’s payable to the money pool increased by $33.3 million in 2010 compared to decreasing by $66 million in 2009. See Note 5 to the financial statements for details on long-term debt. Capital Structure Entergy Mississippi’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 Debt to capital 51.2% 51.9% Effect of subtracting cash 0.0% 0.0% Net debt to net capital 51.2% 51.9% Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of capital lease obligations and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Mississippi uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Mississippi’s financial condition. Uses of Capital Entergy Mississippi requires capital resources for: · construction and other capital investments; · debt and preferred stock maturities or retirements; · working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and · dividend and interest payments. Following are the amounts of Entergy Mississippi’s planned construction and other capital investments, and existing debt obligations and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments): 2012 2013-2014 2015-2016 After 2016 Total (In Millions) Planned construction and capital investment (1): Generation $233 $31 N/A N/A $264 Transmission 74 125 N/A N/A 199 Distribution 72 159 N/A N/A 231 Other 7 13 N/A N/A 20 Total $386 $328 N/A N/A $714 Long-term debt (2) $51 $192 $214 $1,343 $1,800 Capital lease payments $3 $5 $3 $2 $13 Operating leases $6 $10 $5 $6 $27 Purchase obligations (3) $221 $404 $400 $1,570 $2,595 (1) Includes approximately $129 million annually for maintenance capital, which is planned spending on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of service, equipment or systems, and to support normal customer growth. (2) Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements. (3) Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy Mississippi, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which is discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements. 330 Table of Contents Entergy Mississippi, Inc. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Mississippi currently expects to contribute approximately $8.4 million to its pension plans and approximately $5.5 million to other postretirement plans in 2012 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. The planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Mississippi reflects capital required to support existing business and customer growth. Entergy’s Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic trends, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. Management provides more information on long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements. As a wholly-owned subsidiary, Entergy Mississippi dividends its earnings to Entergy Corporation at a percentage determined monthly. Entergy Mississippi’s long-term debt indentures restrict the amount of retained earnings available for the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on its common and preferred stock. As of December 31, 2011, Entergy Mississippi had restricted retained earnings unavailable for distribution to Entergy Corporation of $68.5 million. Hinds Energy Facility Purchase Agreement In April 2011, Entergy Mississippi announced that it has signed an asset purchase agreement to acquire the Hinds Energy Facility, a 450 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle turbine plant located in Jackson, Mississippi, from a subsidiary of KGen Power Corporation. The purchase price is expected to be approximately $206 million. Entergy Mississippi also expects to invest in various plant upgrades at the facility after closing and expects the total cost of the acquisition to be approximately $246 million. A new transmission service request has been submitted to determine if investments for supplemental upgrades in the Entergy transmission system are needed to make the Hinds Energy Facility deliverable to Entergy Mississippi for the period after Entergy Mississippi exits the System Agreement. Facilities studies are ongoing to determine transmission upgrades costs associated with the plant, with results expected by early March 2012. The purchase is contingent upon, among other things, obtaining necessary approvals, including full cost recovery, from various federal and state regulatory and permitting agencies. These include regulatory approvals from the MPSC and the FERC, as well as clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust law. In February 2012 the FERC issued an order approving the acquisition. Closing is expected to occur in mid-2012. In July 2011, Entergy Mississippi filed with the MPSC requesting approval of the acquisition and full cost recovery. A hearing on the request for a certificate of public convenience and necessity is scheduled for February 28, 2012. A hearing on Entergy Mississippi’s proposed cost recovery has not been scheduled. New Nuclear Generation Development Costs Pursuant to the Mississippi Baseload Act and the Mississippi Public Utilities Act, Entergy Mississippi is developing a project option for new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf Nuclear Station. This project is in the early stages, and several issues remain to be addressed over time before significant additional capital would be committed to this project. In 2010, Entergy Mississippi paid for and has recognized on its books $49 million in costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf; these costs previously had been recorded on the books of Entergy New Nuclear Utility Development, LLC, a System Energy subsidiary. In October 2010, Entergy Mississippi filed an application with the MPSC requesting that the MPSC determine that it is in the public interest to preserve the option to construct new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf and that the MPSC approve the deferral of Entergy Mississippi’s costs incurred to date and in the future related to this project, including the accrual of AFUDC or similar carrying charges. In October 2011, Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff filed with the MPSC a joint stipulation. The stipulation states that there should be a deferral of the $57 million of costs incurred through September 2011 in connection with planning, evaluation, monitoring, and other and related 331 Table of Contents Entergy Mississippi, Inc. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis generation resource development activities for new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf. The costs shall be treated as a regulatory asset until the proceeding is resolved. The Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and Entergy Mississippi also agree that the MPSC should conduct a hearing during 2012 to consider the relief requested by Entergy Mississippi in its application, including evidence regarding whether costs incurred in connection with planning, evaluation, monitoring, and other and related generation resource development activities for new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf were prudently incurred and are otherwise allowable. The Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and Entergy Mississippi further agree that such prudently incurred costs shall be recoverable in a manner to be determined by the MPSC. In the Stipulation, the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and Entergy Mississippi agree that the development of a nuclear unit project option is consistent with the Mississippi Baseload Act. The Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and Entergy Mississippi further agree that the deferral of costs incurred in connection with planning, evaluation, monitoring, and other and related generation resource development activities for new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf also is consistent with the Mississippi Baseload Act. Entergy Mississippi will not accrue carrying charges or continue to accrue AFUDC on the costs, pending the outcome of the proceeding. The MPSC approved the stipulation in November 2011. Sources of Capital Entergy Mississippi’s sources to meet its capital requirements include: · internally generated funds; · cash on hand; · debt or preferred stock issuances; and · bank financing under new or existing facilities. Entergy Mississippi may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt and preferred stock prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable. All debt and common and preferred stock issuances by Entergy Mississippi require prior regulatory approval. Preferred stock and debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its corporate charter, bond indenture, and other agreements. Entergy Mississippi has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs. In May 2011, Entergy Mississippi renewed its three separate credit facilities through May 2012 in the aggregate amount of $70 million. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2011. Entergy Mississippi’s receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 2011 2010 2009 2008 (In Thousands) ($1,999) ($33,255) $31,435 ($66,044) Entergy Mississippi has obtained short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow through October 2013, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $175 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Mississippi’s short-term borrowing limits. Entergy Mississippi has also obtained an order from the FERC authorizing long-term securities issuances through July 2013. State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery The rates that Entergy Mississippi charges for electricity significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Mississippi is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the MPSC, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. 332 Table of Contents Entergy Mississippi, Inc. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Formula Rate Plan In September 2009, Entergy Mississippi filed with the MPSC proposed modifications to its formula rate plan rider. In March 2010 the MPSC issued an order: (1) providing the opportunity for a reset of Entergy Mississippi's return on common equity to a point within the formula rate plan bandwidth and eliminating the 50/50 sharing that had been in the plan, (2) modifying the performance measurement process, and (3) replacing the revenue change limit of two percent of revenues, which was subject to a $14.5 million revenue adjustment cap, with a limit of four percent of revenues, although any adjustment above two percent requires a hearing before the MPSC. The MPSC did not approve Entergy Mississippi's request to use a projected test year for its annual scheduled formula rate plan filing and, therefore, Entergy Mississippi will continue to use a historical test year for its annual evaluation reports under the plan. In March 2009, Entergy Mississippi made with the MPSC its annual scheduled formula rate plan filing for the 2008 test year. The filing reported a $27.0 million revenue deficiency and an earned return on common equity of 7.41%. Entergy Mississippi requested a $14.5 million increase in annual electric revenues, which is the maximum increase allowed under the terms of the formula rate plan. The MPSC issued an order on June 30, 2009, finding that Entergy Mississippi’s earned return was sufficiently below the lower bandwidth limit set by the formula rate plan to require a $14.5 million increase in annual revenues, effective for bills rendered on or after June 30, 2009. In March 2010, Entergy Mississippi submitted its 2009 test year filing, its first annual filing under the new formula rate plan rider. In June 2010 the MPSC approved a joint stipulation between Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff that provides for no change in rates, but does provide for the deferral as a regulatory asset of $3.9 million of legal expenses associated with certain litigation involving the Mississippi Attorney General, as well as ongoing legal expenses in that litigation until the litigation is resolved. In March 2011, Entergy Mississippi submitted its formula rate plan 2010 test year filing. The filing shows an earned return on common equity of 10.65% for the test year, which is within the earnings bandwidth and results in no change in rates. In November 2011 the MPSC approved a joint stipulation between Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff that provides for no change in rates. Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery Entergy Mississippi’s rate schedules include an energy cost recovery rider that is adjusted quarterly to reflect accumulated over- or under-recoveries from the second prior quarter. Entergy Mississippi’s fuel cost recoveries are subject to annual audits conducted pursuant to the authority of the MPSC. In July 2008 the MPSC began a proceeding to investigate the fuel procurement practices and fuel adjustment schedules of the Mississippi utility companies, including Entergy Mississippi. The MPSC stated that the goal of the proceeding is fact-finding so that the MPSC may decide whether to amend the current fuel cost recovery process. Hearings were held in July and August 2008. Further proceedings have not been scheduled. Mississippi Attorney General Complaint The Mississippi attorney general filed a complaint in state court in December 2008 against Entergy Corporation, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Services, and Entergy Power alleging, among other things, violations of Mississippi statutes, fraud, and breach of good faith and fair dealing, and requesting an accounting and restitution. The litigation is wide ranging and relates to tariffs and procedures under which Entergy Mississippi purchases power not generated in Mississippi to meet electricity demand. Entergy believes the complaint is unfounded. On December 29, 2008, the defendant Entergy companies filed to remove the attorney general’s suit to U.S. District Court (the forum that Entergy believes is appropriate to resolve the types of federal issues raised in the suit), where it is currently pending, and additionally answered the complaint and filed a counter-claim for relief based upon the Mississippi Public Utilities Act and the Federal Power Act. The Mississippi attorney general has filed a pleading seeking to remand the matter to state court. In May 2009, the defendant Entergy companies filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings asserting grounds of federal preemption, the exclusive jurisdiction of the MPSC, and factual errors in the attorney general’s complaint. 333 Table of Contents Entergy Mississippi, Inc. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis In July 2011, the attorney general requested a status conference regarding its motion to remand. The court granted the attorney general’s request for a status conference, which was held in September 2011. Consistent with the court’s instructions, both parties submitted letters to the court in September 2011 providing updates on the facts of the case and the law, and the court has now taken the parties’ arguments under advisement. Federal Regulation See “Independent Coordinator of Transmission”, “System Agreement”, “Entergy’s Proposal to Join the MISO RTO”, “Notice to SERC Reliability Corporation Regarding Reliability Standards and FERC Investigation”, and “U.S. Department of Justice Investigation” in the “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation – Federal Regulation” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of these topics. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of Entergy Mississippi’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of Entergy Mississippi’s financial position or results of operations. Unbilled Revenue As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Mississippi records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation. Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Entergy sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age and meet certain eligibility requirements while still working for Entergy. Entergy’s reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate. 334 Table of Contents Entergy Mississippi, Inc. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Cost Sensitivity The following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost and qualified projected qualified benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands): Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2011 Qualified Pension Cost Impact on Projected Qualified Benefit Obligation Increase/(Decrease) Discount rate (0.25%) $829 $10,541 Rate of return on plan assets (0.25%) $593 - Rate of increase in compensation 0.25% $346 $1,929 The following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands): Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2011 Postretirement Benefit Cost Impact on Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation Increase/(Decrease) Health care cost trend 0.25% $447 $2,776 Discount rate (0.25%) $318 $3,342 Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant. Costs and Funding Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Mississippi in 2011 was $7.7 million. Entergy Mississippi anticipates 2012 qualified pension cost to be $12.3 million. Entergy Mississippi contributed $29.2 million to its qualified pension plans in 2011 and anticipates that it will contribute approximately $8.4 million in 2012 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Mississippi in 2011 were $5.5 million, including $2 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Mississippi expects 2012 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $6.4 million, including $1.8 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Mississippi expects to contribute approximately $5.5 million to its other postretirement plans in 2012.

Results of Operations Net Income 2011 Compared to 2010 Net income increased $4.9 million primarily due to lower other operation and maintenance expenses, lower taxes other than income taxes, a lower effective income tax rate, and lower interest expense, partially offset by lower net revenue. 2010 Compared to 2009 Net income remained relatively unchanged, increasing $0.6 million, primarily due to higher net revenue and lower interest expense, almost entirely offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses, higher taxes other than income taxes, lower other income, and higher depreciation and amortization expenses. Net Revenue 2011 Compared to 2010 Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2011 to 2010. Amount (In Millions) 2010 net revenue $272.9 Retail electric price (16.9) Net gas revenue (9.1) Gas cost recovery asset (3.0) Volume/weather 5.4 Other (2.3) 2011 net revenue $247.0 The retail electric price variance is primarily due to formula rate plan decreases effective October 2010 and October 2011. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the formula rate plan filing. The net gas revenue variance is primarily due to milder weather in 2011 compared to 2010. The gas cost recovery asset variance is primarily due to the recognition in 2010 of a $3 million gas operations regulatory asset associated with the settlement of Entergy New Orleans’s electric and gas formula rate plan case and the amortization of that asset. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the formula rate plan settlement. 344 Table of Contents Entergy New Orleans, Inc. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase in electricity usage in the residential and commercial sectors due in part to a 4% increase in the average number of residential customers and a 3% increase in the average number of commercial customers, partially offset by the effect of less favorable weather on residential sales. Gross operating revenues Gross operating revenues decreased primarily due to: · a decrease of $16.2 million in electric fuel cost recovery revenues due to lower fuel rates; · a decrease of $15.4 million in gross gas revenues primarily due to lower fuel cost recovery revenues as a result of lower fuel rates and the effect of milder weather; and · formula rate plan decreases effective October 2010 and October 2011, as discussed above. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in gross wholesale revenue due to increased sales to affiliated customers and more favorable volume/weather, as discussed above. 2010 Compared to 2009 Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2010 to 2009. Amount (In Millions) 2009 net revenue $243.0 Volume/weather 17.0 Net gas revenue 14.2 Effect of 2009 rate case settlement (6.6) Other 5.3 2010 net revenue $272.9 The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 348 GWh, or 7%, in billed retail electricity usage primarily due to more favorable weather compared to last year. The net gas revenue variance is primarily due to more favorable weather compared to last year, along with the recognition of a gas regulatory asset associated with the settlement of Entergy New Orleans’s electric and gas formula rate plans. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the formula rate plan settlement. The effect of 2009 rate case settlement variance results from the April 2009 settlement of Entergy New Orleans’s rate case, and includes the effects of realigning non-fuel costs associated with the operation of Grand Gulf from the fuel adjustment clause to electric base rates effective June 2009. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case settlement. Other Income Statement Variances 2011 Compared to 2010 Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to the deferral in 2011 of $13.4 million of 2010 Michoud plant maintenance costs pursuant to the settlement of Entergy New Orleans’s 2010 test year formula rate plan filing approved by the City Council in September 2011 and a decrease of $8.0 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses due to higher plant outage costs in 2010 due to a greater scope of work at the Michoud plant. See Note 2 to the financial statements for more discussion of the 2010 test year formula rate plan filing. 345 Table of Contents Entergy New Orleans, Inc. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Taxes other than income taxes decreased primarily due to a decrease in local franchise taxes resulting from lower electric and gas retail revenues as compared with the same period in 2010. Interest expense decreased primarily due to the repayment in May 2010 of the notes payable issued to affiliates as part of Entergy New Orleans’s plan of reorganization and the repayment, at maturity, of $30 million of 4.98% Series first mortgage bonds in July 2010. 2010 Compared to 2009 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: · an increase of $15.1 million in fossil expenses due to higher outage expenses compared to prior year; · an increase of $2.2 million in distribution expenses primarily due to increases in vegetation maintenance, overhead and underground inspections, and substation maintenance and repairs; and · an increase of $1.9 million in compensation and benefits costs, resulting from decreasing discount rates, the amortization of benefit trust asset losses, and an increase in the accrual for incentive-based compensation. See Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs. Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in ad valorem taxes as a result of higher millage rates and an increase in local franchise taxes resulting from higher electric and gas retail revenues as compared with the same period in 2009. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service. Other income decreased primarily due to carrying costs on Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike storm restoration costs recorded in 2009. Interest expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in the interest rate on notes payable issued to affiliates as part of Entergy New Orleans’s plan of reorganization, in addition to the repayment of those notes in May 2010 and the repayment, at maturity, of $30 million of 4.98% Series first mortgage bonds in July 2010. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates for 2011, 2010, and 2009 were 30.6%, 34.8%, and 33.5%, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rates. Hurricane Katrina In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused catastrophic damage to Entergy New Orleans’s service territory. Entergy pursued a broad range of initiatives to recover storm restoration and business continuity costs, including obtaining assistance through federal legislation for damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) In December 2005, the U.S. Congress passed the Katrina Relief Bill, a hurricane aid package that included CDBG funding that allowed state and local leaders to fund individual recovery priorities. In March 2007, the City Council certified that Entergy New Orleans incurred $205 million in storm-related costs through December 2006 that are eligible for CDBG funding under the state action plan, and certified Entergy New Orleans’s estimated costs of $465 million for its gas system rebuild (which is discussed below). Entergy New Orleans received $180.8 million of CDBG funds in 2007 and $19.2 million in 2010. Gas System Rebuild In addition to the Hurricane Katrina storm restoration costs that Entergy New Orleans incurred, Entergy New Orleans expects that over a longer term rebuilding of the gas system in New Orleans will be necessary due to the massive salt water intrusion into the system caused by the flooding in New Orleans. The salt water intrusion is expected to shorten the life of the gas system, making it necessary to rebuild portions of that system over time, earlier 346 Table of Contents Entergy New Orleans, Inc. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis than otherwise would be expected, with the project extending many years into the future. Entergy New Orleans received insurance proceeds for a portion of the estimated future construction expenditures associated with rebuilding its gas system, and the October 2006 City Council resolution approving the settlement of Entergy New Orleans’s rate and storm-cost recovery filings requires Entergy New Orleans to record those proceeds in a designated sub-account of other deferred credits until the proceeds are spent on the rebuild project. This other deferred credit is shown as “Gas system rebuild insurance proceeds” on Entergy New Orleans’s balance sheet. Bankruptcy Proceedings As a result of the effects of Hurricane Katrina and the effect of extensive flooding that resulted from levee breaks in and around the New Orleans area, on September 23, 2005, Entergy New Orleans filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy court seeking reorganization relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On May 7, 2007, the bankruptcy judge entered an order confirming Entergy New Orleans’s plan of reorganization. With the receipt of CDBG funds, and the agreement on insurance recovery with one of its excess insurers, Entergy New Orleans waived the conditions precedent in its plan of reorganization, and the plan became effective on May 8, 2007. Included in the terms in the plan of reorganization Entergy New Orleans issued notes to affiliates. Entergy New Orleans repaid, at maturity in May 2010, these notes that represented affiliate prepetition accounts payable (approximately $74 million, including interest), including its indebtedness to the Entergy System money pool. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were as follows: 2011 2010 2009 (In Thousands) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period $54,986 $191,191 $137,444 Cash flow provided by (used in): Operating activities 44,927 48,965 148,556 Investing activities (46,019) (31,561) (59,848) Financing activities (44,060) (153,609) (34,961) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (45,152) (136,205) 53,747 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $9,834 $54,986 $191,191 Operating Activities Net cash flow provided by operating activities was relatively flat in 2011 as the receipt of $19.2 million of Community Development Block Grant funds in 2010 related to Hurricane Katrina costs was offset by a decrease of $28.8 million in income tax payments in 2011. The decrease in income tax payments is in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The decrease results from lower 2010 taxable income from what was estimated due to revised bonus depreciation deduction and additional repair expenses for tax purposes associated with the tax accounting method change filed in 2010. Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $99.6 million in 2010 primarily due to income tax payments of $68.2 million made in 2010 compared to refunds of $22.1 million received in 2009 and an increase in pension contributions of $11.9 million. In 2010, Entergy New Orleans made tax payments in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The payments resulted from the reversal of temporary differences for which Entergy New Orleans previously received cash tax benefits and from estimated federal income tax payments for tax year 2010. See “MANAGEMENT’S 347 Table of Contents Entergy New Orleans, Inc. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Critical Accounting Estimates” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits. The decrease was partially offset by the receipt of $19.2 million of Community Development Block Grant funds, as discussed above. Investing Activities Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $14.5 million in 2011 primarily due to money pool activity and a withdrawal in 2010 from the storm escrow account related to Hurricane Gustav costs. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in construction expenditures due to decreased spending on the gas system rebuild project and System Fuels repayment of Entergy New Orleans’s $3.3 million investment in System Fuels. Decreases in Entergy New Orleans’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy New Orleans’s receivable from the money pool decreased $12.7 million in 2011 compared to decreasing $44.3 million in 2010. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings. Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $28.3 million in 2010 primarily due to money pool activity and a withdrawal from the storm escrow account that was related to Hurricane Gustav costs, partially offset by: · higher fossil construction expenses primarily due to current year outages and the Michoud 3 generator rewind project; · higher distribution construction expenditures primarily due to increased reliability work; and · a decrease in Hurricane Katrina insurance proceeds received in 2010 as compared to 2009. Decreases in Entergy New Orleans’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy New Orleans’s receivable from the money pool decreased $44.3 million in 2010 compared to increasing $6.1 million in 2009. Financing Activities Net cash flow used in financing activities decreased $109.5 million in 2011 primarily due to the repayment in 2010 of $74.3 million of affiliate notes payable that were issued to affiliates as part of Entergy New Orleans’s plan of reorganization, the repayment, at maturity, of $30 million of 4.98% Series first mortgage bonds in July 2010, and the repayment of $25 million of 6.75% Series first mortgage bonds in December 2010, offset by the issuance of $25 million of 5.10% Series first mortgage bonds in November 2010. Net cash flow used in financing activities increased $118.6 million in 2010 primarily due to: · the repayment of $74.3 million of affiliate notes payable in May 2010; · the repayment, at maturity, of $30 million of 4.98% Series first mortgage bonds in July 2010; · the repayment of $25 million of 6.75% Series first mortgage bonds in December 2010; and · an increase of $14.1 million in dividends paid on common stock. The increase was partially offset by the issuance of $25 million of 5.10% Series first mortgage bonds in November 2010. See Note 5 to the financial statements for details on long-term debt. 348 Table of Contents Entergy New Orleans, Inc. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Capital Structure Entergy New Orleans’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt as shown in the following table. December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 Debt to capital 45.3% 44.6% Effect of subtracting cash (1.5)% (9.5)% Net debt to net capital 43.8% 35.1% Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of notes payable and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy New Orleans uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy New Orleans’s financial condition. Uses of Capital Entergy New Orleans requires capital resources for: · construction and other capital investments; · working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; · debt and preferred stock maturities or retirements; and · dividend payments. Following are the amounts of Entergy New Orleans’s planned construction and other capital investments and existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments): 2012 2013-2014 2015-2016 After 2016 Total (In Millions) Planned construction and capital investment (1): Generation $8 $33 N/A N/A $41 Transmission 7 10 N/A N/A 17 Distribution 28 52 N/A N/A 80 Other 21 45 N/A N/A 66 Total $64 $140 N/A N/A $204 Long-term debt (2) $9 $83 $11 $143 $246 Operating leases $2 $3 $2 $- $7 Purchase obligations (3) $179 $329 $319 $1,627 $2,454 (1) Includes approximately $43 million annually for maintenance capital, which is planned spending on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of service, equipment or systems and to support normal customer growth. Also includes spending for the long-term gas rebuild project. (2) Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements. (3) Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy New Orleans, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which is discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements. Entergy New Orleans expects to contribute approximately $4.8 million to its pension plan and approximately $3.7 million to its other postretirement plans in 2012 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. 349 Table of Contents Entergy New Orleans, Inc. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy New Orleans has $53.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. The planned capital investment estimate for Entergy New Orleans reflects capital required to support existing business. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic trends, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. Management provides more information on long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 and to the financial statements. As an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Corporation, Entergy New Orleans pays dividends from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly. Entergy New Orleans’s long-term debt indentures contain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on its common and preferred stock. Sources of Capital Entergy New Orleans’s sources to meet its capital requirements include: · internally generated funds; · cash on hand; and · debt and preferred stock issuances. Entergy New Orleans may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt and preferred stock prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable. Entergy New Orleans’s receivables from the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 2011 2010 2009 2008 (In Thousands) $9,074 $21,820 $66,149 $60,093 See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. Entergy New Orleans has obtained short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow through October 2013, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $100 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy New Orleans’s short-term borrowing limits. The long-term securities issuances of Entergy New Orleans are limited to amounts authorized by the City Council, and the current authorization extends through July 2012. Entergy Louisiana’s Ninemile Point Unit 6 Self-Build Project In June 2011, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC an application seeking certification that the public necessity and convenience would be served by Entergy Louisiana’s construction of a combined-cycle gas turbine generating facility (Ninemile 6) at its existing Ninemile Point electric generating station. Ninemile 6 will be a nominally-sized 550 MW unit that is estimated to cost approximately $721 million to construct, excluding interconnection and transmission upgrades. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana joined in the application, seeking certification of its purchase under a life-of-unit power purchase agreement of up to 35% of the capacity and energy generated by Ninemile 6. The Ninemile 6 capacity and energy is proposed to be allocated 55% to Entergy Louisiana, 25% to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, and 20% to Entergy New Orleans. In February 2012 the City Council passed a resolution authorizing Entergy New Orleans to purchase 20% of the Ninemile 6 energy and capacity. If approvals are obtained from the LPSC and other permitting agencies, Ninemile 6 construction is expected to begin in 2012, and the unit is expected to commence commercial operation by mid-2015. The ALJ has established a schedule for the LPSC proceeding that includes February 27 - March 7, 2012 hearing dates. 350 Table of Contents Entergy New Orleans, Inc. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis State and Local Rate Regulation The rates that Entergy New Orleans charges for electricity and natural gas significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy New Orleans is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the City Council, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. Rate Cases, Formula Rate Plans and Storm-related Riders On July 31, 2008, Entergy New Orleans filed an electric and gas base rate case with the City Council. On April 2, 2009, the City Council approved a comprehensive settlement. The settlement provided for a net $35.3 million reduction in combined fuel and non-fuel electric revenue requirement, including conversion of a $10.6 million voluntary recovery credit, implemented in January 2008, to a permanent reduction and substantial realignment of Grand Gulf cost recovery from fuel to electric base rates, and a $4.95 million gas base rate increase, both effective June 1, 2009, with adjustment of the customer charges for all rate classes. A new three-year formula rate plan was also adopted, with terms including an 11.1% benchmark electric return on common equity (ROE) with a +/- 40 basis point bandwidth and a 10.75% benchmark gas ROE with a +/- 50 basis point bandwidth. Earnings outside the bandwidth reset to the midpoint benchmark ROE, with rates changing on a prospective basis depending on whether Entergy New Orleans is over- or under-earning. The formula rate plan also includes a recovery mechanism for City Council-approved capacity additions, plus provisions for extraordinary cost changes and force majeure events. In May 2010, Entergy New Orleans filed its electric and gas formula rate plan evaluation reports. The filings requested a $12.8 million electric base revenue decrease and a $2.4 million gas base revenue increase. Entergy New Orleans and the City Council's Advisors reached a settlement that resulted in an $18.0 million electric base revenue decrease and zero gas base revenue change effective with the October 2010 billing cycle. The City Council approved the settlement in November 2010. In May 2011, Entergy New Orleans filed its electric and gas formula rate plan evaluation reports for the 2010 test year. The filings requested a $6.5 million electric rate decrease and a $1.1 million gas rate decrease. Entergy New Orleans and the City Council’s Advisors reached a settlement that results in an $8.5 million incremental electric rate decrease and a $1.6 million gas rate decrease. The settlement also provides for the deferral of $13.4 million of Michoud plant maintenance expenses incurred in 2010 and the establishment of a regulatory asset that will be amortized over the period October 2011 through September 2018. The City Council approved the settlement in September 2011. The new rates were effective with the first billing cycle of October 2011. The 2008 rate case settlement also included $3.1 million per year in electric rates to fund the Energy Smart energy efficiency programs. In September 2009 the City Council approved the energy efficiency programs filed by Entergy New Orleans. The rate settlement provides an incentive for Entergy New Orleans to meet or exceed energy savings targets set by the City Council and provides a mechanism for Entergy New Orleans to recover lost contribution to fixed costs associated with the energy savings generated from the energy efficiency programs. In October 2006, the City Council approved a rate filing settlement agreement that, among other things, authorized a $75 million storm reserve for damage from future storms, which will be created over a ten-year period through a storm reserve rider that began in March 2007. These storm reserve funds will be held in a restricted escrow account. 351 Table of Contents Entergy New Orleans, Inc. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Federal Regulation See “Independent Coordinator of Transmission”, “System Agreement”, “Entergy’s Proposal to Join the MISO RTO”, “Notice to SERC Reliability Corporation Regarding Reliability Standards and FERC Investigation”, and “U.S. Department of Justice Investigation” in the “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation – Federal Regulation” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of these topics. Environmental Risks Entergy New Orleans’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy New Orleans is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of Entergy New Orleans’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of Entergy New Orleans’s financial position or results of operations. Unbilled Revenue As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy New Orleans records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month, including fuel price. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period and fuel price fluctuations, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation. Effective June 2009, Entergy New Orleans reclassified the fuel component of unbilled accounts receivable to deferred fuel and will no longer include the fuel component in the unbilled calculation, which is in accordance with regulatory treatment. Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Entergy sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age and meet certain eligibility requirements while still working for Entergy. Entergy’s reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate. 352 Table of Contents Entergy New Orleans, Inc. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Cost Sensitivity The following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost and qualified projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands): Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2011 Qualified Pension Cost Impact on Projected Qualified Benefit Obligation Increase/(Decrease) Discount rate (0.25%) $408 $5,283 Rate of return on plan assets (0.25%) $249 - Rate of increase in compensation 0.25% $170 $1,027 The following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands): Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2011 Postretirement Benefit Cost Impact on Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation Increase/(Decrease) Health care cost trend 0.25% $269 $1,675 Discount rate (0.25%) $163 $2,057 Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant. Costs and Funding Total qualified pension cost for Entergy New Orleans in 2011 was $5.5 million. Entergy New Orleans anticipates 2012 qualified pension cost to be $8.5 million. Entergy New Orleans contributed $12.2 million in qualified pension contributions in 2011 and anticipates approximately a $4.8 million pension contribution in 2012 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy New Orleans in 2011 were $3.7 million, including $1.2 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy New Orleans expects 2012 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $4.2 million, including $1 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy New Orleans expects to contribute approximately $3.7 million to its other postretirement plans in 2012.

Results of Operations Net Income 2011 Compared to 2010 Net income increased by $14.6 million primarily due to higher net revenue, partially offset by higher taxes other than income taxes, higher other operation and maintenance expenses, and higher depreciation and amortization expenses. 2010 Compared to 2009 Net income increased by $2.4 million primarily due to higher net revenue and lower interest expense, partially offset by lower other income, higher taxes other than income taxes, and higher other operation and maintenance expenses. Net Revenue 2011 Compared to 2010 Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2011 to 2010. Amount (In Millions) 2010 net revenue $540.2 Retail electric price 36.0 Volume/weather 21.3 Purchased power capacity (24.6) Other 4.9 2011 net revenue $577.8 The retail electric price variance is primarily due to rate actions, including an annual base rate increase of $59 million beginning August 2010, with an additional increase of $9 million beginning May 2011, as a result of the settlement of the December 2009 rate case. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case settlement. The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 721 GWh, or 4.5%, in billed electricity usage, including the effect of more favorable weather on residential and commercial sales compared to last year. Usage in the industrial sector increased 8.2% primarily in the chemicals and refining industries. The purchased power capacity variance is primarily due to price increases for ongoing purchased power capacity and additional capacity purchases. 362 Table of Contents Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Gross operating revenues, fuel and purchased power expenses, and other regulatory charges Gross operating revenues increased primarily due to the base rate increases and the volume/weather effect, as discussed above. Fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to an increase in demand coupled with an increase in deferred fuel expense as a result of lower fuel refunds in 2011 versus 2010, partially offset by a decrease in the average market price of natural gas. Other regulatory charges decreased primarily due to the distribution in the first quarter 2011 of $17.4 million to customers of the 2007 rough production cost equalization remedy receipts. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rough production cost equalization proceedings. 2010 Compared to 2009 Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2010 to 2009. Amount (In Millions) 2009 net revenue $485.1 Net wholesale revenue 27.7 Volume/weather 27.2 Rough production cost equalization 18.6 Retail electric price 16.3 Securitization transition charge 15.3 Purchased power capacity (44.3) Other (5.7) 2010 net revenue $540.2 The net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to increased sales to municipal and co-op customers due to the addition of new contracts. The volume/weather variance is primarily due to increased electricity usage primarily in the residential and commercial sectors, resulting from a 1.5% increase in customers, coupled with the effect of more favorable weather on residential sales. Billed electricity usage increased a total of 777 GWh, or 5%. The rough production cost equalization variance is due to an additional $18.6 million allocation recorded in the second quarter of 2009 for 2007 rough production cost equalization receipts ordered by the PUCT to Texas retail customers over what was originally allocated to Entergy Texas prior to the jurisdictional separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, effective December 2007, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements. The retail electric price variance is primarily due to rate actions, including an annual base rate increase of $59 million beginning August 2010 as a result of the settlement of the December 2009 rate case. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case settlement. The securitization transition charge variance is due to the issuance of securitization bonds. In November 2009, Entergy Texas Restoration Funding, LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy Texas, issued securitization bonds and with the proceeds purchased from Entergy Texas the transition property, which is the right to recover from customers through a transition charge amounts sufficient to service the securitization bonds. The securitization transition charge is offset with a corresponding increase in interest on long-term debt with no impact on net income. See Note 5 to the financial statements for further discussion of the securitization bond issuance. 363 Table of Contents Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis The purchased power capacity variance is primarily due to price increases in ongoing purchased power capacity expense and additional capacity purchases. Gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses Gross operating revenues increased primarily due to an increase of $145.6 million in gross wholesale revenues as a result of the addition of new customer contracts and the increase related to volume/weather, as discussed above. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $59.9 million in fuel cost recovery revenues primarily attributable to lower fuel rates and interim fuel refunds in the first quarter 2010 and the third and fourth quarters 2010. The interim fuel refunds and the PUCT approvals are discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements. Fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to increases in the average market prices of purchased power and natural gas, substantially offset by a decrease in deferred fuel expenses as the result of lower fuel revenues, as discussed above. Other Income Statement Variances 2011 Compared to 2010 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: · an increase of $8.5 million in transmission expenses due to a billing adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter 2011 related to prior transmission investment equalization costs (for the approximate period of 1996 - 2011) allocable to Entergy Texas under the Entergy System Agreement; · an increase of $2.4 million in the over-recovery of energy efficiency revenues; and · several individually insignificant items. The increase was partially offset by the amortization of $11 million of rate case expenses in 2010 and a decrease of $3.9 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to a decrease in stock option expense. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case settlement. Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in local franchise taxes as a result of higher city franchise and gross receipts taxes and an increase in ad valorem taxes due to a higher 2011 assessment as compared to 2010, partially offset by lower street rentals. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service. 2010 Compared to 2009 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to the amortization of $11 million of rate case expenses. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case settlement. The increase was partially offset by a charge of $6.8 million in June 2009 resulting from the Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav storm cost recovery settlement with the PUCT. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of this settlement. Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to a provision recorded for sales and use taxes, an increase in local franchise taxes, and an increase in ad valorem taxes as a result of a higher 2010 assessment as compared to 2009, partially offset by lower millage rates. Other income decreased primarily due to carrying costs recorded in 2009 on storm restoration costs as approved by Texas legislation. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of Hurricane Ike storm cost recovery filings. 364 Table of Contents Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Interest expense decreased primarily due to lower interest on deferred fuel costs and the pay-down of the debt assumption agreement liability. The decrease was partially offset by the issuance of $546 million in securitization bonds in November 2009. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 38.0%, 39.0%, and 36.6% for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were as follows: 2011 2010 2009 (In Thousands) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period $35,342 $200,703 $2,239 Cash flow provided by (used in): Operating activities 238,837 43,095 287,533 Investing activities (219,783) (121,439) (216,649) Financing activities 10,893 (87,017) 127,580 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 29,947 (165,361) 198,464 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $65,289 $35,342 $200,703 Operating Activities Cash flow provided by operating activities increased $195.7 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to: · $73.4 million of fuel cost refunds in 2011 versus $179.5 million of fuel cost refunds in 2010. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the fuel cost refunds; and · income tax refunds of $13.5 million in 2011 compared to income tax payments of $48.7 million in 2010. Cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $244.4 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to: · the timing of collection of receivables from customers; · income tax payments of $48.7 million in 2010 compared to income tax refunds of $72.3 million in 2009. In 2010, Entergy Texas made tax payments in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The tax payments resulted from differences between Entergy Texas’s estimated utilization of net operating losses and actual utilization on the 2009 tax return filed in 2010; · an $87.8 million fuel cost refund made in the first quarter 2010 and an $77 million fuel cost refund made in the third and fourth quarters 2010; and · an increase of $14.7 million in pension contributions. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below for further discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding. The decrease was partially offset by the absence in 2010 of Hurricane Ike restoration spending that occurred in 2009. 365 Table of Contents Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Investing Activities Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $98.3 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to money pool activity. Increases in Entergy Texas’s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Texas’s receivable from the money pool increased by $49.5 million in 2011 compared to decreasing by $55.6 million in 2010. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce Entergy’s subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings. Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $95.2 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to money pool activity and a decrease in construction expenditures due to Hurricane Ike spending in 2009, offset by a decrease of $31.5 million in insurance proceeds and increased remittances to the securitization trust account as a result of the issuance of $546 million in securitization bonds in November 2009. See Note 5 to the financial statements for further discussion of the issuance of the securitization bonds. Decreases in Entergy Texas’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Texas’s receivable from the money pool decreased by $55.6 million in 2010 compared to increasing by $69.3 million in 2009. Financing Activities Entergy Texas’s financing activities provided $10.9 million of cash in 2011 compared to using $87.0 million of cash in 2010 primarily due to: · the retirement of $199 million of debt assumption liabilities and securitization bonds in 2010 compared to the retirement of $57.4 million of securitization bonds in 2011; and · a decrease of $80.6 million in common equity distributions. The cash provided was partially offset by the issuance of $200 million of 3.60% Series mortgage bonds in May 2010 compared to the issuance of $75 million of 4.10% Series first mortgage bonds in September 2011. Entergy Texas’s financing activities used $87 million of cash in 2010 compared to providing $127.6 million of cash in 2009 primarily due to: · the issuance of $545.9 million of securitization bonds in November 2009. See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional information regarding the securitization bonds; · the issuance of $500 million of 7.125% Series mortgage bonds in January 2009; · the issuance of $150 million of 7.875% Series mortgage bonds in May 2009; · the issuance of $200 million of 3.60% Series mortgage bonds in May 2010; and · the retirement of $199 million of debt assumption liabilities and securitization bonds in 2010 compared to $620 million in 2009. The use of cash was partially offset by: · the repayment of Entergy Texas’s $160 million note payable to Entergy Corporation in January 2009; · the repayment of $100 million outstanding on Entergy Texas’s credit facility in February 2009; · money pool activity; and · a decrease of $33.1 million in common equity distributions. Decreases in Entergy Texas’s payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Texas’s payable to the money pool decreased by $50.8 million in 2009. 366 Table of Contents Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Capital Structure Entergy Texas’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 Debt to capital 65.1% 66.8% Effect of excluding the securitization bonds (14.3)% (16.0)% Debt to capital, excluding securitization bonds (1) 50.8% 50.8% Effect of subtracting cash (1.9)% (1.0)% Net debt to net capital, excluding securitization bonds (1) 48.9% 49.8% (1) Calculation excludes the securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy Texas. Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of notes payable and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion and also including the debt assumption liability. Capital consists of debt and common equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Texas uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Texas’s financial condition. Uses of Capital Entergy Texas requires capital resources for: · construction and other capital investments; · debt maturities or retirements; · working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and · dividend and interest payments. Following are the amounts of Entergy Texas’s planned construction and other capital investments, existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments), and other purchase obligations: 2012 2013-2014 2015-2016 After 2016 Total (In Millions) Planned construction and capital investment (1): Generation $84 $92 N/A N/A $176 Transmission 45 213 N/A N/A 258 Distribution 64 141 N/A N/A 205 Other 9 16 N/A N/A 25 Total $202 $462 N/A N/A $664 Long-term debt (2) $90 $198 $496 $1,811 $2,595 Operating leases $6 $9 $3 $1 $19 Purchase obligations (3) $92 $118 $101 $160 $471 (1) Includes approximately $131 million annually for maintenance capital, which is planned spending on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of service, equipment or systems and to support normal customer growth. (2) Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements. (3) Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy Texas, it primarily includes unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations. In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Texas expects to contribute approximately $7.7 million to its pension plans and approximately $5.2 million to other postretirement plans in 2012 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. 367 Table of Contents Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Texas has $7.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. Entergy’s Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. Management provides more information on long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements. As a wholly-owned subsidiary, Entergy Texas pays dividends to Entergy Corporation from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly. Sources of Capital Entergy Texas’s sources to meet its capital requirements include: · internally generated funds; · cash on hand; · debt or preferred stock issuances; and · bank financing under new or existing facilities. Entergy Texas may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable. All debt and common and preferred stock issuances by Entergy Texas require prior regulatory approval. Debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indentures and other agreements. Entergy Texas has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs. Entergy Texas’s receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 2011 2010 2009 2008 (In Thousands) $63,191 $13,672 $69,317 ($50,794) See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. Entergy Texas has a credit facility in the amount of $100 million scheduled to expire in August 2012. No borrowings were outstanding under the facility as of December 31, 2011. Entergy Texas has obtained short-term borrowing authorization through October 2013 from the FERC under which it may borrow at any one time outstanding, $200 million in the aggregate. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Texas’s short-term borrowing limits. Entergy Texas has also obtained an order from the FERC authorizing long-term securities issuances through July 2013. Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav In September 2008, Hurricane Ike caused catastrophic damage to Entergy Texas’s service territory. The storm resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage to distribution, transmission, and generation infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages. Entergy Texas filed an application in April 2009 seeking a determination that $577.5 million of Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav restoration costs are recoverable, 368 Table of Contents Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis including estimated costs for work to be completed. On August 5, 2009, Entergy Texas submitted to the ALJ an unopposed settlement agreement intended to resolve all issues in the storm cost recovery case. Under the terms of the agreement $566.4 million, plus carrying costs, are eligible for recovery. Insurance proceeds will be credited as an offset to the securitized amount. Of the $11.1 million difference between Entergy Texas’s request and the amount agreed to, which is part of the black box agreement and not directly attributable to any specific individual issues raised, $6.8 million is operation and maintenance expense for which Entergy Texas recorded a charge in the second quarter 2009. The remaining $4.3 million was recorded as utility plant. The PUCT approved the settlement in August 2009, and in September 2009 the PUCT approved recovery of the costs, plus carrying costs, by securitization. See Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of the November 2009 issuance of the securitization bonds. In the third quarter 2009, Entergy settled with its insurer on its Hurricane Ike claim and Entergy Texas received $75.5 million in proceeds (Entergy received a total of $76.5 million). State and Local Rate Regulation and Fuel-Cost Recovery The rates that Entergy Texas charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Texas is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. The PUCT, a governmental agency, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. Filings with the PUCT 2009 Rate Case In December 2009, Entergy Texas filed a rate case requesting a $198.7 million increase reflecting an 11.5% return on common equity based on an adjusted June 2009 test year. The rate case also includes a $2.8 million revenue requirement to provide supplemental funding for the decommissioning trust maintained for the 70% share of River Bend for which Entergy Texas retail customers are partially responsible, in response to an NRC notification of a projected shortfall of decommissioning funding assurance. Beginning in May 2010, Entergy Texas implemented a $17.5 million interim rate increase, subject to refund. Intervenors and PUCT Staff filed testimony recommending adjustments that would result in a maximum rate increase, based on the PUCT Staff’s testimony, of $58 million. The parties filed a settlement in August 2010 intended to resolve the rate case proceeding. The settlement provides for a $59 million base rate increase for electricity usage beginning August 15, 2010, with an additional increase of $9 million for bills rendered beginning May 2, 2011. The settlement stipulates an authorized return on equity of 10.125%. The settlement states that Entergy Texas's fuel costs for the period April 2007 through June 2009 are reconciled, with $3.25 million of disallowed costs, which were included in an interim fuel refund. The settlement also sets River Bend decommissioning costs at $2.0 million annually. Consistent with the settlement, in the third quarter 2010, Entergy Texas amortized $11 million of rate case costs. The PUCT approved the settlement in December 2010. 2011 Rate Case In November 2011, Entergy Texas filed a rate case requesting a $112 million base rate increase reflecting a 10.6% return on common equity based on an adjusted June 2011 test year. The rate case also proposed a purchased power recovery rider. The parties have agreed to a procedural schedule that contemplates a final decision by July 30, 2012, with rates relating back to June 30, 2012. On January 12, 2012, the PUCT voted not to address the purchased power recovery rider in the current rate case, but the PUCT voted to set a baseline in the rate case proceeding that would be applicable if a purchased power capacity rider is approved in a separate proceeding. 369 Table of Contents Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery Entergy Texas’s rate schedules include a fixed fuel factor to recover fuel and purchased power costs, including carrying charges, not recovered in base rates. Semi-annual revisions of the fixed fuel factor are made in March and September based on the market price of natural gas and changes in fuel mix. The amounts collected under Entergy Texas’s fixed fuel factor and any interim surcharge or refund are subject to fuel reconciliation proceedings before the PUCT. In January 2008, Entergy Texas made a compliance filing with the PUCT describing how its 2007 rough production cost equalization receipts under the System Agreement were allocated between Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s Texas and Louisiana jurisdictions. In December 2008 the PUCT adopted an ALJ proposal for decision recommending an additional $18.6 million allocation to Texas retail customers. Because the PUCT allocation to Texas retail customers is inconsistent with the LPSC allocation to Louisiana retail customers, the PUCT's decision results in trapped costs between the Texas and Louisiana jurisdictions with no mechanism for recovery. Entergy Texas filed with the FERC a proposed amendment to the System Agreement bandwidth formula to specifically calculate the payments to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas of Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s rough production cost equalization receipts for 2007. In May 2009 the FERC issued an order rejecting the proposed amendment. Because of the FERC's order, Entergy Texas recorded the effects of the PUCT's allocation of the additional $18.6 million to Texas retail customers in the second quarter 2009. On an after-tax basis, the charge to earnings was approximately $13.0 million (including interest). The PUCT and FERC decisions are now final. In May 2009, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund $46.1 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through February 2009. Entergy Texas requested that the proposed refund be made over a four-month period beginning June 2009. Pursuant to a stipulation among the various parties, in June 2009 the PUCT issued an order approving a refund of $59.2 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery overcollections through March 2009. The refund was made for most customers over a three-month period beginning July 2009. In October 2009, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund approximately $71 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through September 2009. Entergy Texas requested that the proposed refund be made over a six-month period beginning January 2010. Pursuant to a stipulation among the various parties, the PUCT issued an order approving a refund of $87.8 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery overcollections through October 2009. The refund was made for most customers over a three-month period beginning January 2010. In June 2010, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund approximately $66 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through May 2010. In September 2010 the PUCT issued an order providing for a $77 million refund, including interest, for fuel cost recovery over-collections through June 2010. The refund was made for most customers over a three-month period beginning with the September 2010 billing cycle. In December 2010, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund fuel cost recovery over-collections through October 2010. Pursuant to a stipulation among the parties that was approved by the PUCT in March 2011, Entergy Texas refunded over-collections through November 2010 of approximately $73 million, including interest through the refund period. The refund was made for most customers over a three-month period that began with the February 2011 billing cycle. In December 2011, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund approximately $43 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through October 2011. Entergy Texas and the parties to the proceeding reached an agreement that Entergy Texas will refund $67 million, including interest, over a three-month period, which refund includes additional over-recoveries through December 2011. Entergy Texas and the parties requested that interim rates consistent with the settlement be approved effective with the March 2012 billing month, and this request was granted by the presiding ALJ on February 16, 2012. Entergy Texas’s November 2011 rate case filing, which is discussed above, also includes a request to reconcile $1.3 billion of fuel and purchased power costs covering the period July 2009 through June 2011. 370 Table of Contents Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Federal Regulation See “Independent Coordinator of Transmission”, “System Agreement”, “Entergy’s Proposal to Join the MISO RTO”, “Notice to SERC Reliability Corporation Regarding Reliability Standards and FERC Investigation”, and “U.S. Department of Justice Investigation” in the “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation – Federal Regulation” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of these topics. Industrial and Commercial Customers Entergy Texas’s large industrial and commercial customers continually explore ways to reduce their energy costs. In particular, cogeneration is an option available to a portion of Entergy Texas’s industrial customer base. Entergy Texas responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and negotiating electric service contracts to provide, under existing rate schedules, competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load profiles. Entergy Texas actively participates in economic development, customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase industrial and commercial demand, from both new and existing customers. Entergy Texas does not currently expect additional significant losses to cogeneration because of the current economics of the electricity markets and Entergy Texas’s marketing efforts in retaining industrial customers. Environmental Risks Entergy Texas’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Texas is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of Entergy Texas’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Texas’s financial position or results of operations. Unbilled Revenue As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Texas records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period and fuel price fluctuations, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation. Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Entergy sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age and meet certain eligibility requirements while still working for Entergy. Entergy’s reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by 371 Table of Contents Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries’ Management’s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate. Cost Sensitivity The following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension and qualified projected benefit obligation cost to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands): Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2011 Qualified Pension Cost Impact on Qualified Projected Benefit Obligation Increase/(Decrease) Discount rate (0.25%) $808 $10,726 Rate of return on plan assets (0.25%) $647 - Rate of increase in compensation 0.25% $334 $1,830 The following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands): Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2011 Postretirement Benefit Cost Impact on Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation Increase/(Decrease) Health care cost trend 0.25% $596 $3,969 Discount rate (0.25%) $376 $4,520 Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant. Costs and Funding Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Texas in 2011 was $4.4 million. Entergy Texas anticipates 2012 qualified pension cost to be $10.4 million. Entergy Texas contributed $18.2 million to its qualified pension plans in 2011. Entergy Texas’s contributions to the pension trust are currently estimated to be approximately $7.7 million in 2012 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Texas in 2011 were $4.1 million, including $1.5 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Texas expects 2012 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $6 million, including $1.3 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Texas expects to contribute approximately $5.2 million to its other postretirement plans in 2012.

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS System Energy’s principal asset currently consists of a 78.5% ownership interest and 11.5% leasehold interest in Grand Gulf. The capacity and energy from its 90% interest is sold under the Unit Power Sales Agreement to its only four customers, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans. System Energy’s operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% interest in Grand Gulf pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. Payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are System Energy’s only source of operating revenues. Results of Operations Net Income 2011 Compared to 2010 Net income decreased $18.4 million primarily due to an increase in the effective income tax rate. A decrease in operating income was offset by an increase in other income and a decrease in interest expense, which led to a slight increase in income before income taxes. Operating income was lower because of lower rate base compared to 2010. Other income was higher and interest expense was lower primarily because of AFUDC accrued on the Grand Gulf uprate project. 2010 Compared to 2009 Net income increased $33.7 million primarily due to a decrease in the effective income tax rate. Income Taxes The effective income tax rates for 2011, 2010, and 2009 were 53.9%, 40.4%, and 66.5%, respectively. The increase in the rate for 2011 is primarily due to an intercompany settle up for federal income taxes for years prior to 2008 which include an allocation of the tax benefit of Entergy Corporation’s expenses to the subsidiaries generating taxable income for the respective years. The effects of various tax positions settled with the IRS pertaining to the 2006/2007 audit require System Energy to pay back prior benefits of the Entergy Corporation’s expenses it received when the benefits were originally allocated based upon the tax return as filed. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to the effective income tax rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were as follows: 2011 2010 2009 (In Thousands) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period $263,772 $264,482 $102,788 Cash flow provided by (used in): Operating activities 430,681 250,405 417,877 Investing activities (311,397) (184,588) (149,344) Financing activities (197,899) (66,527) (106,839) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (78,615) (710) 161,694 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $185,157 $263,772 $264,482 380 Table of Contents System Energy Resources, Inc. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Operating Activities Cash flow provided by operating activities increased $180.3 million in 2011 primarily due to income tax refunds of $100.9 million in 2011 compared to income tax payments of $56 million in 2010. In 2011 System Energy received cash refunds in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The refunds result from a decrease in 2010 taxable income from what was previously estimated because of the recognition of additional repair expenses for tax purposes associated with a tax accounting change filed in 2010 and from the reversal of temporary differences for which System Energy previously made cash tax payments. Cash flow provided by operations decreased $167.5 million in 2010 primarily due to income tax payments of $56 million in 2010 compared to income tax refunds of $120.4 in 2009, and an increase of $26.6 million in pension contributions. In 2010 System Energy made tax payments in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The payments resulted from the reversal of temporary differences for which System Energy previously received cash tax benefits and from estimated federal income tax payments for tax year 2010. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased $126.8 million in 2011 primarily due to: · The proceeds from the transfer, in the first quarter 2010, of $100.3 million in development costs related to Entergy New Nuclear Development, LLC; · An increase in construction expenditures resulting primarily from spending on the power uprate project at Grand Gulf; · The repayment in 2010 of $25.6 million by Entergy New Orleans of a note issued in resolution of its bankruptcy proceedings; and · money pool activity. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in nuclear fuel purchases due to the timing of refueling outages. Increases in System Energy’s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and System Energy’s receivable from the money pool increased by $22.5 million in 2011 compared to increasing by $7.4 million in 2010. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings. Net cash used in investing activities increased $35.2 million in 2010 primarily due to an increase of $129.5 million in nuclear fuel purchases due to the timing of refueling outages, and an increase in construction expenditures primarily due to the Grand Gulf power uprate project. The increase was partially offset by: · the proceeds from the transfer of $100.3 million in development costs related to Entergy New Nuclear Development, LLC discussed below; · money pool activity; and · the repayment by Entergy New Orleans of a $25.6 million note issued in resolution of its bankruptcy proceedings. Increases in System Energy’s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and System Energy’s receivable from the money pool increased by $7.4 million in 2010 compared to increasing by $47.6 million in 2009. 381 Table of Contents System Energy Resources, Inc. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities increased $131.4 million in 2011 primarily due to the issuance of $60 million of 5.33% Series G notes by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity in 2010, the repayment of $38.3 million in commercial paper in 2011 as compared to the issuance of $20.3 million in commercial paper in 2010, and the partial retirement of $40 million of 6.2% pollution control bonds in 2011. The increase was slightly offset by a $24 million decrease in dividend paid on common stock. Net cash flow used in financing activities decreased $40.3 million in 2010 primarily due to: · the issuance in April 2010 of $60 million of 5.33% Series G notes by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity to finance its fuel procurement activities; and · commercial paper issuances by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity to finance its fuel procurement activities. The decrease was partially offset by: · an increase of $24.9 million in dividends paid on common stock; and · an increase of $13.3 million in the January 2010 principal payment made on the Grand Gulf sale-leaseback compared to the January 2009 principal payment. See Note 5 to the financial statements for details of long-term debt. Capital Structure System Energy’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 Debt to capital 48.3% 51.7% Effect of subtracting cash (7.1)% (9.0)% Net debt to net capital 41.2% 42.7% Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of capital lease obligations and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and common shareholder’s equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. System Energy uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating System Energy’s financial condition. Uses of Capital System Energy requires capital resources for: · construction and other capital investments; · debt maturities or retirements; · working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel costs; and · dividend and interest payments. 382 Table of Contents System Energy Resources, Inc. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Following are the amounts of System Energy’s planned construction and other capital investments, existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments), and other purchase obligations: 2012 2013-2014 2015-2016 After 2016 Total (In Millions) Planned construction and capital investment (1): Generation $316 $74 N/A N/A $390 Other 2 4 N/A N/A 6 Total $318 $78 N/A N/A $396 Long-term debt (2) $153 $225 $157 $496 $1,031 Purchase obligations (3) $21 $23 $23 $51 $118 (1) Includes approximately $19 million annually for maintenance capital, which is planned spending on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of service, equipment, or systems. (2) Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements. (3) Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For System Energy, it includes nuclear fuel purchase obligations. In addition to the contractual obligations given above, System Energy expects to contribute approximately $8.9 million to its pension plans and approximately $4.1 million to its other postretirement plans in 2012 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. Also in addition to the contractual obligations, System Energy has $228.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. The planned capital investment estimate for System Energy reflects capital required to support the existing business of System Energy. The estimate also includes the costs of System Energy’s planned approximate 178 MW uprate of the Grand Gulf nuclear plant. On November 30, 2009, the MPSC issued a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for implementation of the uprate. A license amendment application was submitted to the NRC in September 2010. After performing more detailed project design, engineering, analysis and major materials purchases, System Energy’s current estimate of the total capital investment to be made in the course of the implementation of the Grand Gulf uprate project is approximately $754 million, including SMEPA’s share. The estimate includes spending on certain major equipment refurbishment and replacement that would have been required over the normal course of the plant’s life even if the uprate were not done. The purpose of performing this major equipment refurbishment and replacement in connection with the uprate is to avoid additional plant outages and construction costs in the future while improving plant reliability. The investment estimate may be revised in the future as System Energy evaluates the progress of the project, including the costs required to install instrumentation in the steam dryer in response to recent guidance from the NRC staff obtained during the review process for certain Requests for Additional Information (RAIs) issued by the NRC in December 2011. The NRC’s review of the project is ongoing. System Energy is responding to the recent RAIs and will seek to minimize potential cost effects or delay, if any, to the Grand Gulf uprate implementation schedule. System Energy also invested, through its subsidiary Entergy New Nuclear Development, LLC, in initial development costs for potential new nuclear development at the Grand Gulf and River Bend sites, including licensing and design activities. This project is in the early stages, and several issues remain to be addressed over time before significant additional capital would be committed to this project. In addition, Entergy temporarily suspended reviews of the two license applications for the sites and will explore alternative nuclear technologies for this project. In the first quarter 2010 the $100 million in construction work in progress incurred by Entergy New Nuclear Development was transferred to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy Mississippi. As a wholly-owned subsidiary, System Energy dividends its earnings to Entergy Corporation at a percentage determined monthly. Currently, all of System Energy’s retained earnings are available for distribution. 383 Table of Contents System Energy Resources, Inc. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Sources of Capital System Energy’s sources to meet its capital requirements include: · internally generated funds; · cash on hand; · debt issuances; and · bank financing under new or existing facilities. System Energy may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable. All debt and common stock issuances by System Energy require prior regulatory approval. Debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indentures and other agreements. System Energy has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs. In February 2012, System Energy VIE issued $50 million of 4.02% Series H notes due February 2017. System Energy used the proceeds to purchase additional nuclear fuel. System Energy has obtained a short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow, through October 2013, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $200 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of System Energy’s short-term borrowing limits. System Energy has also obtained an order from the FERC authorizing long-term securities issuances. The current long-term authorization extends through July 2013. System Energy’s receivables from the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 2011 2010 2009 2008 (In Thousands) $120,424 $97,948 $90,507 $42,915 See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. Nuclear Matters System Energy owns and operates Grand Gulf. System Energy is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear plant. These include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of Grand Gulf, System Energy may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. After the nuclear incident in Japan resulting from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the NRC established a task force to conduct a review of processes and regulations relating to nuclear facilities in the United States. The task force issued a near term (90-day) report in July 2011 that has made recommendations, which are currently being evaluated by the NRC. It is anticipated that the NRC will issue certain orders and requests for information to nuclear plant licensees by the end of the first quarter 2012 that will begin to implement the task force’s recommendations. These orders may require U.S. nuclear operators, including Entergy, to undertake plant modifications or perform additional analyses that could, among other things, result in increased costs and capital requirements associated with operating Entergy’s nuclear plants. 384 Table of Contents System Energy Resources, Inc. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis Environmental Risks System Energy’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that System Energy is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of System Energy’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of System Energy’s financial position or results of operations. Nuclear Decommissioning Costs See “Nuclear Decommissioning Costs” in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs. In the first quarter 2011, System Energy recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liability for Grand Gulf as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study. The revised estimate resulted in a $38.9 million reduction in its decommissioning liability, along with a corresponding reduction in the related regulatory asset. Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Entergy sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age and meet certain eligibility requirements while still working for Entergy. Entergy’s reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate. Cost Sensitivity The following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost and qualified projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands): Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2011 Qualified Pension Cost Impact on Projected Qualified Benefit Obligation Increase/(Decrease) Discount rate (0.25%) $795 $9,826 Rate of return on plan assets (0.25%) $446 - Rate of increase in compensation 0.25% $330 $2,031 385 Table of Contents System Energy Resources, Inc. Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis The following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands): Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Impact on 2011 Postretirement Benefit Cost Impact on Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation Increase/(Decrease) Health care cost trend 0.25% $368 $2,141 Discount rate (0.25%) $287 $2,441 Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant. Costs and Funding Total qualified pension cost for System Energy in 2011was $6.9 million. System Energy anticipates 2012 qualified pension cost to be $11.5 million. System Energy contributed $28.4 million to its qualified pension plans in 2011and expects to contribute approximately $8.9 million in 2012 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2012 valuations are completed by April 1, 2012. Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for System Energy in 2011 were $4.1 million, including $1.4 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. System Energy expects 2012 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $5.6 million, including $1.4 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. System Energy anticipates contributions for postretirement health care and life insurance benefits costs to be $4.1 million in 2012.
