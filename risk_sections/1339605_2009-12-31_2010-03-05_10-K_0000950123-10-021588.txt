Item 1A. Risk Factors Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risk factors and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making any investment decisions regarding our securities. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose part or all of your investment. Our business has been adversely affected by the economic downturn and a decline in construction and industrial activities, and continued decreased demand for equipment or depressed equipment rental rates and sales prices could result in additional declines in our revenues and operating results. Our equipment is principally used in connection with construction and industrial activities. Consequently, the economic downturn, and particularly the weakness in the construction industry and the decrease in industrial activity, has led to a significant decrease in the demand for our new and used equipment and has depressed equipment rental rates and the sales prices for the equipment we sell. Our business may also be negatively impacted, either temporarily or long-term, by:  a reduction in spending levels by customers;  unfavorable credit markets affecting end-user access to capital;  adverse changes in federal and local government infrastructure spending;  an increase in the cost of construction materials;  adverse weather conditions which may affect a particular region;  an increase in interest rates; or  terrorism or hostilities involving the United States. The economic downturn and the decline in construction and industrial related activity has adversely affected our revenues and our operating results, as reflected in declining revenues and lower gross margins realized on our equipment rentals and on the sale of new and used inventory. Continued weakness or further deterioration in the non-residential construction and industrial sectors caused by these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the future and may also have a material adverse effect on residual values realized on the disposition of our rental fleet. The economic downturn makes it difficult for us to forecast trends, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition. The economic downturn  which has included, among other things, significant reductions in available capital and liquidity from banks and other providers of credit, substantial reductions and/or fluctuations in equity and currency values worldwide and concerns that the worldwide economy may enter into a prolonged recessionary period  make it increasingly difficult for us, our customers and our suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause us to maintain excess equipment inventory and increase our equipment inventory carrying costs. Alternatively, this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortage of equipment for sale or rental that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for our products and a loss of market share when the economy improves. Current unfavorable conditions or further disruptions in the capital and credit markets may continue to adversely impact business conditions and the availability of credit. Disruptions in the global capital and credit markets as a result of the current economic downturn, continuing economic uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our customers ability to access capital and could adversely affect our access to 12 Table of Contents liquidity needed for business in the future. Additionally, unfavorable market conditions could continue and impede the rate of economic recovery, which may continue to depress demand for our products and services or make it more difficult for our customers to obtain financing and credit on reasonable terms. Also more of our customers may be unable to meet their payment obligations to us, increasing delinquencies and credit losses. Moreover, our suppliers may be adversely impacted, causing disruption or delay of product availability. These events could negatively impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if the financial institution that has extended line of credit commitments to us is adversely affected by the conditions of the capital and credit markets, it may become unable to fund borrowings under those credit commitments, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and our ability to borrow funds, if needed, for working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. We have, and may incur, significant indebtedness and may be unable to service our debt. This indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position, limit our available cash and our access to additional capital and prevent us from growing our business. We have a significant amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness. As of December 31, 2009, our total indebtedness was $254.1 million, consisting of the aggregate amounts outstanding under our senior unsecured notes ($250.0 million), notes payable ($1.9 million) and a capital lease obligation ($2.2 million). Although we currently have no amounts outstanding under our senior secured credit facility, we have borrowing availability under the senior secured credit facility of $312.2 million, and may be able to incur additional other indebtedness. Although the indenture for our senior unsecured notes contains a fixed charge coverage ratio test that limits our ability to incur indebtedness, this limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions and qualifications. Moreover, the indenture does not impose any limitation on our incurrence of certain liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness under the indenture (such as operating leases), nor does it impose any limitation on the amount of liabilities incurred by our subsidiaries, if any, that might be designated as Unrestricted Securities under the indenture. All borrowings under the senior secured credit facility as well as letters of credit outstanding under the senior secured credit facility ($7.8 million at December 31, 2009) are first-priority secured debt and effectively senior to our senior unsecured notes. Additionally, our senior unsecured notes are effectively subordinated to our notes payable obligations, capital lease obligation and our obligations under $92.9 million of first-priority secured manufacturer floor plan financings (to the extent of the value of their collateral). The level of our indebtedness could have important consequences, including:  a portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to debt service and may not be available for other purposes;  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;  limiting our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, and may impede our ability to secure favorable lease terms;  making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and possibly limiting our ability to withstand competitive pressures; and  placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness. To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. An inability to service our indebtedness could lead to a default under our senior secured credit facility and the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes, which may result in an acceleration of our indebtedness. To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to pay interest and principal in the future on our indebtedness and to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend upon 13 Table of Contents our future operating performance and the availability of refinancing indebtedness, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, the availability of capital, as well as financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. For example, the current economic downturn and decline in construction and industrial activities have adversely affected our business and our revenues. Our future cash flow may not be sufficient to meet our obligations and commitments. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our indebtedness and to meet our other commitments, we will be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital. These actions may not be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all, and these actions may not enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements. In addition, our existing or future debt agreements, including the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes and the senior secured credit facility agreement may contain restrictive covenants prohibiting us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. See also Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources. Our senior secured credit facility and the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes contain covenants that limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, or to engage in other business activities. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements, including the senior secured credit facility, and the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes, may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. Our senior secured credit facility requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined therein) in the event that our excess borrowing availability is below $25 million. Our borrowing availability under the senior secured credit facility as of December 31, 2009 was $312.2 million, net of $7.8 million of letters of credit outstanding. The imposition of the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio may require that we limit our permitted capital expenditures, take action to reduce debt or act in a manner contrary to our business objectives. In addition, the senior secured credit facility and the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants that, among other things, restrict our and our restricted subsidiaries ability to:  incur additional indebtedness, assume a guarantee or issue preferred stock;  pay dividends or make other equity distributions or payments to or affecting our subsidiaries;  make certain investments;  create liens;  sell or dispose of assets or engage in mergers or consolidations;  engage in certain transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates;  enter into sale leaseback transactions; and  engage in certain business activities. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make strategic acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand economic downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise. A failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the senior secured credit facility could lead to an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness. Such an acceleration would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes. A failure to comply with the restrictions in the senior unsecured notes indenture could result in an event of default under the indenture. Our future operating results may not be sufficient to enable compliance with the covenants in the senior secured credit facility, the indenture or other indebtedness or to remedy any such default. In addition, in the event of an acceleration, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to refinance our indebtedness or make any accelerated payments, including those 14 Table of Contents under the senior unsecured notes. Also, we may not be able to obtain new financing. Even if we were able to obtain new financing, we cannot guarantee that the new financing will be on commercially reasonable terms or terms that are acceptable to us. If we default on our indebtedness, our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We are currently in compliance with the applicable covenants under our senior secured credit facility and our senior unsecured notes. Our business could be hurt if we are unable to obtain additional capital as required, resulting in a decrease in our revenues and profitability. The cash that we generate from our business, together with cash that we may borrow under our senior secured credit facility, may not be sufficient to fund our capital requirements. In addition, our senior secured credit facility matures in August 2011. We may require additional financing to obtain capital for, among other purposes, purchasing equipment, completing acquisitions, establishing new locations and refinancing existing indebtedness. We may not be able to replace or refinance our senior secured credit facility on favorable terms or at all. Any additional indebtedness that we incur will make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional financing in the future, our business could be adversely affected by reducing our ability to increase revenues and profitability. Our revenue and operating results may fluctuate, which could result in a decline in our profitability and make it more difficult for us to grow our business. Our revenue and operating results have historically varied from quarter to quarter. Periods of decline could result in an overall decline in profitability and make it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness and grow our business. We expect our quarterly results to continue to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors, including:  general economic conditions in the markets where we operate;  the cyclical nature of our customers business, particularly our construction customers;  seasonal sales and rental patterns of our construction customers, with sales and rental activity tending to be lower in the winter months;  severe weather and seismic conditions temporarily affecting the regions where we operate;  changes in corporate spending for plants and facilities or changes in government spending for infrastructure projects;  the effectiveness of integrating acquired businesses and new start-up locations; and  timing of acquisitions and new location openings and related costs. In addition, we incur various costs when integrating newly acquired businesses or opening new start-up locations, and the profitability of a new location is generally expected to be lower in the initial months of operation. Fluctuations in the stock market, as well as general economic and market conditions, may impact the market price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in response to general economic changes and other factors including, but not limited to:  variations in our quarterly operating results or results that vary from investor expectations;  changes in the strategy and actions taken by our competitors, including pricing changes;  securities analysts elections to discontinue coverage of our common stock, changes in financial estimates by analysts or a downgrade of our common stock or of our sector by analysts; 15 Table of Contents  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;  loss of a large supplier;  investor perceptions of us and the equipment rental and distribution industry;  our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and consolidations; and  national or regional catastrophes or circumstances and natural disasters, hostilities and acts of terrorism. Broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, including to those listed above and others, may harm the market price of our common stock. We are subject to competition, which may have a material adverse effect on our business by reducing our ability to increase or maintain revenues or profitability. The equipment rental and retail distribution industries are highly competitive and the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented. Many of the markets in which we operate are served by numerous competitors, ranging from national and multi-regional equipment rental companies to small, independent businesses with a limited number of locations. We generally compete on the basis of availability, quality, reliability, delivery and price. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do, and may be able to reduce rental rates or sales prices. The market downturn and increased competitive pressures have caused us to significantly reduce our rates to maintain market share, resulting in lower operating margins and profitability. We may encounter increased competition from existing competitors or new market entrants in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We purchase a significant amount of our equipment from a limited number of manufacturers. Termination of one or more of our relationships with any of those manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business, as we may be unable to obtain adequate or timely rental and sales equipment. We purchase most of our rental and sales equipment from leading, nationally-known original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). For the year ended December 31, 2009, we purchased approximately 79% of our rental and sales equipment from three manufacturers. Although we believe that we have alternative sources of supply for the rental and sales equipment we purchase in each of our core product categories, termination of one or more of our relationships with any of these major suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations if we were unable to obtain adequate or timely rental and sales equipment. Our suppliers of new equipment may appoint additional distributors, sell directly or unilaterally terminate our distribution agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business due to a reduction of, or inability to increase, our revenues. We are a distributor of new equipment and parts supplied by leading, nationally-known OEMs. Under our distribution agreements with these OEMs, manufacturers retain the right to appoint additional dealers and sell directly to national accounts and government agencies. In most instances, they may unilaterally terminate their distribution agreements with us at any time without cause. We have both written and oral distribution agreements with our new equipment suppliers. Under our oral agreements with the OEMs, we operate under our established course of dealing with the supplier and are subject to the applicable state law regarding such relationship. Any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations due to a reduction of, or an inability to increase, our revenues. 16 Table of Contents The cost of new equipment that we sell or purchase for use in our rental fleet may increase and therefore we may spend more for such equipment, and in some cases, we may not be able to procure equipment on a timely basis due to supplier constraints. The cost of new equipment from manufacturers that we sell or purchase for use in our rental fleet may increase as a result of increased raw material costs, including increases in the cost of steel, which is a primary material used in most of the equipment we use. These increases could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations in future periods if we were not able to pass such cost increases through to our customers. Our rental fleet is subject to residual value risk upon disposition. The market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold. The market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors, including:  the market price for new equipment of a like kind;  wear and tear on the equipment relative to its age;  the time of year that it is sold (prices are generally higher during the construction season);  worldwide and domestic demands for used equipment;  the supply of used equipment on the market; and  general economic conditions. We include in operating income the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold. Although for the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold used equipment from our rental fleet at an average selling price of approximately 128.4% of net book value, we cannot assure you that used equipment selling prices will not decline. Any significant decline in the selling prices for used equipment could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We incur maintenance and repair costs associated with our rental fleet equipment that could have a material adverse effect on our business in the event these costs are greater than anticipated. As our fleet of rental equipment ages, the cost of maintaining such equipment, if not replaced within a certain period of time, generally increases. Determining the optimal age for our rental fleet equipment is subjective and requires considerable estimates by management. We have made estimates regarding the relationship between the age of our rental fleet equipment, and the maintenance and repair costs, and the market value of used equipment. Our future operating results could be adversely affected because our maintenance and repair costs may be higher than estimated and market values of used equipment may fluctuate. Fluctuations in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel could harm our business. We could be adversely affected by limitations on fuel supplies or significant increases in fuel prices that result in higher costs to us of transporting equipment from one branch to another branch or one region to another region. A significant or protracted disruption of fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to facilitate our growth strategy by identifying or completing transactions with attractive acquisition candidates, which could impede our revenues and profitability. An important element of our growth strategy is to selectively pursue on an opportunistic basis acquisitions of additional businesses in order to add new customers within our existing markets. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition candidates or complete the acquisition of any identified candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions, including financing alternatives. Competition for attractive acquisition candidates may limit the number of acquisition candidates or increase the overall costs of 17 Table of Contents making acquisitions. Furthermore, general economic conditions or unfavorable global capital and credit markets could affect the timing and extent to which we implement our strategy and limit our ability to successfully acquire new businesses. The difficulties we may face in identifying or completing acquisitions could impede our revenues and profitability. We may be unsuccessful in integrating any future acquisitions, which may decrease our profitability and make it more difficult for us to grow our business. We may not have sufficient management, financial and other resources to integrate and consolidate any future acquisitions and we may be unable to operate profitably as a consolidated company. Any significant diversion of managements attention or any major difficulties encountered in the integration of the businesses we acquire in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, which could decrease our profitability and make it more difficult for us to grow our business. We may experience integration and consolidation risks associated with our growth strategy. Future acquisitions may also result in significant transaction expenses and risks associated with entering new markets and we may be unable to profitably operate our consolidated company. We periodically engage in evaluations of potential acquisitions and start-up facilities. The success of our growth strategy depends, in part, on selecting strategic acquisition candidates at attractive prices and identifying strategic start-up locations. We expect to face competition for acquisition candidates, which may limit the number of acquisition opportunities and lead to higher acquisition costs. We may not have the financial resources necessary to consummate any acquisitions or to successfully open any new facilities in the future or the ability to obtain the necessary funds on satisfactory terms. Any future acquisitions or the opening of new facilities may result in significant transaction expenses and risks associated with entering new markets in addition to the integration and consolidation risks described above. We may also be subject to claims by third parties related to the operations of these businesses prior to our acquisition and by sellers under the terms of our acquisition agreements. We may not have sufficient management, financial and other resources to integrate any such future acquisitions or to successfully operate new locations and we may be unable to profitably operate our consolidated company. We are dependent on key personnel. A loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, which could result in a decline in our revenues and profitability. We are dependent on the experience and continued services of our senior management team, including Mr. Engquist. Mr. Engquist has approximately 35 years of industry experience and has served as an officer of Head and Engquist since 1990, a director of Gulf Wide since 1995, an officer and director of H&E LLC since its formation in June 2002 and an officer and director of H&E Equipment Services, Inc. since its inception. If we lose the services of any member of our senior management team, particularly Mr. Engquist, and are unable to find a suitable replacement, we may not have the depth of senior management resources required to efficiently manage our business and execute our strategy. Disruptions in our information technology systems, including our customer relationship management system, could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations. Our information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions. Any disruption in any of these systems, including our customer management system, or the failure of any of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions. 18 Table of Contents Issues arising from the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system could adversely affect our operating results and ability to manage our business effectively. In 2008 we began the initial design implementation phases of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to further enhance operating efficiencies and provide more effective management of our business operations. The new ERP system will be deployed for use throughout the Company in a number of go live phases, the first of which was completed February 1, 2010, with company-wide deployment expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2010. Implementing a new ERP system is costly and involves risks inherent in the conversion to a new computer system, including loss of information, disruption to our normal operations, changes in accounting procedures and internal control over financial reporting, as well as problems achieving accuracy in the conversion of electronic data. Failure to properly or adequately address these issues could result in increased costs, the diversion of managements and employees attention and resources and could materially adversely affect our operating results, internal controls over financial reporting and ability to manage our business effectively. While the ERP system is intended to further improve and enhance our information systems, large scale implementation of a new information system exposes us to the risks of starting up the new system and integrating that system with our existing systems and processes, including possible disruption of our financial reporting, which could lead to a failure to make required filings under the federal securities laws on a timely basis. If the Company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, the Company may not be able to accurately report financial results or prevent fraud. Effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and to assist in the effective prevention of fraud. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud could harm our business. We must annually evaluate our internal procedures to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires management and auditors to assess the effectiveness of our internal controls. If we fail to remedy or maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties or shareholder litigation. In addition, failure to maintain effective internal controls could result in financial statements that do not accurately reflect our financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain a system of internal controls that fully complies with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or that our management and independent registered public accounting firm will continue to conclude that our internal controls are effective. The nature of our business exposes us to various liability claims, which may exceed the level of our insurance coverage and thereby not fully protect us. Our business exposes us to claims for personal injury, death or property damage resulting from the use of the equipment we rent or sell and from injuries caused in motor vehicle accidents in which our delivery and service personnel are involved. We carry comprehensive insurance, subject to deductibles, at levels we believe are sufficient to cover existing and future claims made during the respective policy periods. However, we may be exposed to multiple claims that do not exceed our deductibles, and, as a result, we could incur significant out-of-pocket costs that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the cost of such insurance policies may increase significantly upon renewal of those policies as a result of general rate increases for the type of insurance we carry as well as our historical experience and experience in our industry. Although we have not experienced any material losses that were not covered by insurance, our existing or future claims may exceed the coverage level of our insurance, and such insurance may not continue to be available on economically reasonable terms, or at all. If we are required to pay significantly higher premiums for insurance, are not able to maintain insurance coverage at affordable rates or if we must pay amounts in excess of claims covered by our insurance, we could experience higher costs that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 19 Table of Contents Our future operating results and financial position could be negatively affected by impairment charges to our goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived assets. When we acquire a business, we record goodwill equal to the excess of the amount we pay for the business, including liabilities assumed, over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets of the business we acquire. At December 31, 2009, we had goodwill of approximately $34.0 million. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 350, IntangiblesGoodwill & Other, we test goodwill for impairment on October 1 of each year, and on an interim date if factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test. In connection with our annual impairment test as of October 1, 2009 and 2008, and as further discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included herein, we recorded non-cash goodwill impairments of $9.0 million and $15.9 million, respectively. If the current economic conditions continue or further deteriorate resulting in significant declines in the Companys stock price, or if there are significant downward revisions in the present value of our estimated future cash flows, additional impairments to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods, and such impairments could be material. A downward revision in the present value of estimated future cash flows could be caused by a number of factors, including, among others, adverse changes in the business climate, negative industry or economic trends, decline in performance in our industry sector, or a decline in market multiples for competitors. Our estimates regarding future cash flows are inherently uncertain and changes in our underlying assumptions and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment. Future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions as to revenues, costs or other factors that may result in changes in our estimates of future cash flows. We can provide no assurance that a material impairment charge will not occur in a future period. Such a charge could negatively affect our results of operations and financial position. We will continue to monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and other long-lived assets (see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Part II, Item 7). Labor disputes could disrupt our ability to serve our customers and/or lead to higher labor costs. We currently have approximately 60 employees in Utah, a significant territory in our geographic footprint, who are covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 1,510 employees who are not represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. Various unions periodically seek to organize certain of our nonunion employees. Union organizing efforts or collective bargaining negotiations could potentially lead to work stoppages and/or slowdowns or strikes by certain of our employees, which could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers. Further, settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can have unknown effects on our labor costs, productivity and flexibility. In addition, proposed federal legislation would make it easier for unions to organize by requiring employers to recognize unions based on card check authorization rather than by secret ballot election, and would impose arbitration to settle first-time collective bargaining agreements if the parties have not reached agreement within 120 days of recognition. The enactment of such legislation could significantly increase labor costs in ways that are difficult to predict. We have operations throughout the United States, which exposes us to multiple state and local regulations. Changes in applicable law, regulations or requirements, or our material failure to comply with any of them, can increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business. Our over 60 branch locations in the United States are located in 24 different states, which exposes us to a host of different state and local regulations. These laws and requirements address multiple aspects of our operations, such as worker safety, consumer rights, privacy, employee benefits and more, and can often have different requirements in different jurisdictions. Changes in these requirements, or any material failure by our branches to comply with them, can increase our costs, affect our reputation, limit our business, drain management time and attention and generally otherwise impact our operations in adverse ways. 20 Table of Contents We could be adversely affected by environmental and safety requirements, which could force us to increase significant capital and other operational costs and may subject us to unanticipated liabilities. Our operations, like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses, require the handling, use, storage and disposal of certain regulated materials. As a result, we are subject to the requirements of federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. We may not be in complete compliance with all such requirements at all times. We are subject to potentially significant civil or criminal fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements. We have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures in order to comply with these laws and regulations. However, the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and could become more stringent in the future. It is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Environmental laws also impose obligations and liability for the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substance spills or releases. These liabilities can be imposed on the parties generating or disposing of such substances or operator of the affected property, often without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous substances. Accordingly, we may become liable, either contractually or by operation of law, for remediation costs even if a contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by us, or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to our ownership or operation of the property. Given the nature of our operations (which involve the use of petroleum products, solvents and other hazardous substances for fueling and maintaining our equipment and vehicles), there can be no assurance that prior site assessments or investigations have identified all potential instances of soil or groundwater contamination. Future events, such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement, or the discovery of currently unknown contamination, may give rise to additional remediation liabilities which may be material. Hurricanes or other adverse weather events could negatively affect our local economies or disrupt our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Our market areas in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States are susceptible to hurricanes. Such weather events can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate. Future hurricanes could result in damage to certain of our facilities and the equipment located at such facilities, or equipment on rent with customers in those areas. In addition, climate change could lead to an increase in intensity or occurrence of hurricanes or other adverse weather events. Our business or results of operations may be adversely affected by these and other negative effects of future hurricanes or other adverse weather events. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
