Item 1A. Risk Factors. Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements including statements concerning the future of our industry, business strategy, continued acceptance of our services, market growth, and dependence on significant customers. These statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may, expect, anticipate, estimate, continue, or other similar words. When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this Form 10-K. We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Regulation S-K and, as such, we are not required to provide the information contained in this Item pursuant to Regulation S-K. Accordingly, the risks described in this Form 10-K are not intended to be all-inclusive and are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, not currently known to us or that do not currently appear to be material, may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results in the future. The risk factors noted below and other factors noted throughout this Form 10-K could cause our actual financial condition or results to differ significantly from those contained in any forward-looking statement. We may not be able to comply with all applicable government regulations. Legislation has been introduced in the New York State Senate to amend the New York Education Law in relation to the practice of licensed professionals by EI companies and their employees and to repeal certain provisions of such related law thereto which currently prohibit corporate practice of certain licensed professions. Currently, most EI providers in New York State, including our Company, are not in compliance with the existing laws governing the practice of these licensed professions. This pending legislation attempts to reconcile conflicting provisions of the New York Education Law and New York Public Health Law which contemplates that EI companies be organized to provide a full range of EI program services. We cannot assure that such pending legislation will be enacted into law and that we will be in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations. We also cannot assure that we will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations. To the extent that new regulations are adopted, we will be required to conform our activities in order to comply with such regulations. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, as well as potential criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, operations and finances. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. Increased competition could result in margin erosion and loss of market share. Our competitors include professional firms, privately held companies, schools and not-for-profit organizations and associations. Many of our existing competitors have greater financial resources, larger market share, broader and more diverse professional staffs and/or lower cost structures than we do - 5 which may enable them to establish a stronger competitive position than we have. If we fail to address competitive developments quickly and effectively, it may affect our ability to maintain our current market share and/or to expand our business. We are dependent on our professional staff and we need to hire and retain skilled personnel to sustain and grow our business. Our success in recruiting and hiring large numbers of highly-skilled, licensed or otherwise authorized individuals to offer the multi-disciplinary services required is critical to providing high quality services. We cannot assure you we will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the continuing growth of our business. Our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could materially adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow our business significantly. Our growth strategy assumes that we will make targeted strategic acquisitions. A key feature of our growth strategy is strategic acquisitions. We may not be able to maintain our current rate of growth. If we fail to execute on this strategy, our revenues may not increase and our ability to achieve and sustain profitability will be impaired. An acquisition strategy is inherently risky. Some of the risks we may face in connection with acquisitions include: identifying appropriate targets; obtaining necessary financing in an efficient and timely fashion; negotiating terms that we believe are reasonable; integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired entities; and maintaining our focus on our existing business. We may not be able to identify any appropriate targets or acquire them on reasonable terms. Even if we make strategic acquisitions, we cannot assure investors that our future acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. We may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability. We have incurred continuing operating losses and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our ability to achieve or maintain profitability depends on a number of factors, including our ability to: grow our business through new contracts and market penetration, attract and hire additional licensed professionals, improve our operating margins and consummate one or more additional acquisitions. Our business is subject to the risk of customer concentration. Our revenue is concentrated within a limited number of clients throughout New York State; municipalities within New York State provide substantial and significant revenue. The continuation and renewal of our contracts are, among other things, contingent upon the availability of adequate Federal pass-through funding from the U.S. government. The loss or significant reduction in government funding as a result of current constraints on the U.S. budget could result in a material decrease in our revenues, earnings and cash flows. This concentration of customers may also impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that our customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions in New York State. Additionally, since most of our revenue is generated under our contracts with municipalities within New York State, the non-renewal of any contracts or non-payment or significant delay in payment of invoices by any or all of such clients would likely have a material adverse effect upon our business. The Company had four customers that represented 19%, 15%, 14% and 11% of revenues for the year ended March 31, 2009. 6 Our operating results are materially impacted by the seasonality of our business. Our business is impacted by seasonality with respect to the school year. We anticipate that our revenue will be at its lowest in the second quarter of our fiscal year (which include the months of July and August) when schools are traditionally not in session. During this period, we are faced with paying salaries for full time staff that will be under-utilized. In addition, the timing of family vacations during the summer months also complicates the scheduling of services for EI services and for preschool children. As such, we recognize that the results of operations for the second quarterly period of our fiscal year may not be indicative of the results for any other quarter or for the full year. Our investment in recorded goodwill resulting from our acquisition could be impaired as a result of future business conditions, requiring us to record substantial write-downs that would reduce our operating income. We have goodwill and intangible assets of $750,000 recorded on our balance sheet as of March 31, 2009. We will evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Changes in our operating performance or business conditions, in general, could result in an impairment of goodwill which could be material to our results of operations. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and the trading price of our shares. As of March 31, 2009, based on current requirements and our public float, we were not required to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX (SOX 404) which require our independent auditors to opine on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Under current law, and our current public float, we expect to be subject to this requirement for our fiscal year ending March 31, 2010. If we fail to correct any deficiencies in the design or operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting or fail to prevent fraud, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock. Our common stock could be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market. Recently, the price of our common stock, par value $.01 (the Shares), has been trading below $1.00 per share. If the price of our Shares declines below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, we may fail to meet NASDAQs maintenance criteria, which may result in the delisting of our Shares from the NASDAQ Capital Market. NASDAQ has recently announced that it is suspending its $1.00 minimum closing bid price rule until July 20, 2009. In the event of such delisting, trading, if any, in our Shares may then continue to be conducted in the non-NASDAQ over-the-counter market in what are commonly referred to as the electronic bulletin board and the ''pink sheets. As a result, an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our Shares. In addition, we would be subject to a rule promulgated by the SEC that, if we fail to meet criteria set forth in such rule, imposes various requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities governed by the rule to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For these types of transactions, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchasers written consent to the transactions prior to the sale. Consequently, the rule may have a material adverse effect on the ability of broker-dealers to 7 sell our securities, which may materially affect the ability of shareholders to sell our securities in the secondary market. A delisting from the NASDAQ Capital Market will also make us ineligible to use Form S-3 to register a future sale of our Shares or to register the resale of our securities with the SEC, thereby making it more difficult and expensive for us to register our Shares or other securities and raise additional capital. The price of our Shares has reflected a great deal of volatility, including a significant decrease over the past few years. The volatility may mean that, at times, our stockholders may be unable to resell their Shares at or above the price at which they acquired them. From April 1, 2007 to March 31, 2009, the price per share of our Shares has ranged from a high of $2.23 to a low of $0.23. The price of our Shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. The market value of our Shares has declined in the past, in part, due to our operating performance. In the future, broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our Shares, regardless of our actual operating performance. Recent declines in the market price of our Shares and in broad capital markets could affect our access to capital. As a result of any such declines, many shareholders have been or may become unable to resell their Shares at or above the price at which they acquired them. Changes to financial accounting standards may affect our reported results of operations. We prepare our financial statements to conform to United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). GAAP is subject to interpretation by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. A change in those policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions that were completed before a change is announced. Accounting rules affecting many aspects of our business, including rules relating to accounting for acquisitions, asset impairments, revenue recognition, and stock option grants, have recently been revised or are currently under review. Changes to those rules or current interpretation of those rules may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct our business. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. Not applicable. Item 2. Properties. Our executive offices are located in Jericho, New York where we lease office space under a seven-year non-cancelable operating sublease with American Para Professional Systems, Inc. (APPS), an entity under the control of our Companys Chairman of the Board, which expires on November 30, 2011. Basic rent under the sublease has been established as a pass-through with our cost being fixed at a cost equal to the pro-rated rent payable for the subleased space by APPS to the buildings landlord. ITG leases regional operating offices in the following cities in New York: East Syracuse, New York City, Rochester and Amherst. The terms of these leases range from two to five years. We believe that, in general, our existing facilities are adequate to meet our present needs. We believe that if we were unable to renew a lease on any of our facilities, we could find alternative space at competitive market rates and relocate our operations to such new location without any disruption to our business. 8 Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We are not engaged in any litigation. Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders. No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the year ended March 31, 2009. PART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Our Shares trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol AMCE. The following table sets forth the range of high and low sales prices for our Shares for each quarter during the period April 1, 2007 through March 31, 2009: High Low Fiscal 2008: Quarter ended June 30, 2007 $ 2.23 $ 1.63 Quarter ended September 30, 2007 $ 1.94 $ 0.85 Quarter ended December 31, 2007 $ 1.64 $ 0.76 Quarter ended March 31, 2008 $ 0.93 $ 0.62 Fiscal 2009: Quarter ended June 30, 2008 $ 1.69 $ 0.77 Quarter ended September 30, 2008 $ 1.35 $ 0.65 Quarter ended December 31, 2008 $ 1.00 $ 0.29 Quarter ended March 31, 2009 $ 1.00 $ 0.23 The number of holders of our Shares was approximately 426 on June 24, 2009, computed by the number of record holders, inclusive of holders for whom Shares are being held in the name of brokerage houses and clearing agencies. Dividends We have never paid a cash dividend and do not presently anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future, but expect to retain earnings, if any, for use in our business. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities None. Use of Proceeds Not applicable. Company Purchases of its Equity Securities During the year ended March 31, 2009, we purchased 6,900 Shares for an aggregate price of for an aggregate purchase price of $5,432 in private transactions. 9 Item 6. Selected Financial Data. We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Regulation S-K and, as such, we are not required to provide the information contained in this item pursuant to Regulation S-K. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. (See Forward-Looking Statements in Item 1A). We consider the following accounting policies to be the most critical due to the estimation process involved in each. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We monitor collections and payments and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our understanding of ITGs historical experience and any specific collection issues that we have identified. While such credit losses have been within our expectations and the allowances established, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that were experienced in the past. Measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience, including the need to adjust for current conditions, and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data, including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and the financial health of various governmental entities. Changes to the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts could be material to our results of operations and financial condition. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation We have used and expect to continue to use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to compute the estimated fair value of stock-based awards. The Black-Scholes option pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected option term and risk-free interest rates. The assumptions used in computing the fair value of stock-based awards reflect our best estimates, but involve uncertainties relating to market and other conditions, many of which are outside of our control. We estimate expected volatility by considering the historical volatility of our stock and our expectations of volatility for the expected term of stock-based compensation awards. As a result, if other assumptions or estimates had been used for options granted, stock-based compensation expense that was recorded could have been materially different. Furthermore, if different assumptions are used in future periods, stock-based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the future. Impairment of Goodwill As of March 31, 2009, our goodwill totaled $750,000. We will perform an assessment of goodwill at least annually for impairment and any such impairment will be recognized in the period identified. In assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles, we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods. Any such resulting impairment charges could be material to our results of operations. 10 Results of Operations During the year ended March 31, 2008, we entered into a non-binding letter of intent to sell all of the outstanding shares of stock of RPM. Accordingly, the results of operations of RPM were classified as discontinued operations and except where specific discussions of RPM are made, all financial information presented in this Annual Report excludes RPM for all periods presented. On September 12, 2008, we closed on the sale of RPM for a sales price of $150,000 in cash, plus additional proceeds up to $150,000 in cash contingent upon the future net earnings of RPM calculated over the five-year period after the closing of the transaction. Through March 31, 2009, no additional consideration has been earned. As a result of the sale of RPM, the Company recorded a gain of $90,513 during the year ended March 31, 2009. On September 12, 2008, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of ITG for $570,000 in cash on the closing date of the transaction. As a result of subsequent purchase price adjustments and the return of funds from escrow, the resulting net purchase price was $174,632. ITG provides a comprehensive range of services to children with developmental delays and disabilities. We had been seeking an acquisition to transition into a new line of business. ITG possesses an opportunity to grow organically in its industry and through the potential for add-on acquisitions. During the period from September 13, 2008 to March 31, 2009, we recognized revenues of $3,320,926 generated by ITG. Costs of services for this period were $2,321,431, approximately 69.9% of revenue, consisting of payroll and payroll related costs paid to our staff of salaried and per diem clinicians. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2009 (Fiscal 2009) increased to $1,804,312 from $990,113 for the year ended March 31, 2008 (Fiscal 2008) as a result of expenses incurred by ITGs operations. Excluding ITGs expenses, corporate selling, general and administrative expenses for Fiscal 2009 decreased approximately $233,104 from Fiscal 2008. During Fiscal 2009, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $21,100 in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) Statement No. 123R (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R) for stock options granted during the period. By comparison, stock-based compensation expense of $285,000 was recorded during Fiscal 2008. Interest income was $115,296 and $331,027 during Fiscal 2009 and Fiscal 2008, respectively. Interest income declined dramatically in Fiscal 2009 as a result of the decrease in cash due to the acquisition of ITG and the payment of ITGs outstanding bank debt subsequent to the acquisition as well as declining interest rates. We acquired ITG for $570,000 in cash on September 12, 2008. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the purchase price was subject to adjustment based on the final determination of the tangible net worth of ITG on the closing date of the acquisition (the Final Calculation). Based on the Final Calculation, the purchase price was reduced by $374,785. Of this amount, $170,715 was repaid by the former ITG shareholders subsequent to March 31, 2009. Since the collectability of the remaining balance is in question, we recorded a reserve of $204,070 for this uncollectible balance in Other Income/(Expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009. We will continually monitor the collectability of this receivable. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly. We believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of March 31, 2009, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $3,289,000 which will be available to reduce future taxable income which expire in various years ending through March 31, 2029. 11 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled $4,143,445 at March 31, 2009. On September 12, 2008, we purchased ITG using a portion of our existing cash and cash equivalents for a purchase price of $570,000. Subsequent to the acquisition date, we paid off ITGs line of credit and a term note payable totaling approximately $1,105,000, including interest. Our primary source of cash is existing cash resources. At March 31, 2009, we had working capital of $4,559,015 as compared to working capital of $6,226,063 at March 31, 2008. We believe that we have sufficient cash resources and working capital to meet our present cash requirements. During Fiscal 2009, net cash used in operating activities of continuing operations was $566,716, primarily due to our operating loss from continuing operations of $895,617, offset by a provision for an uncollectible receivable of $204,070 and depreciation and amortization of $73,923. During Fiscal 2009, we used $432,229 in our investing activities, which consisted primarily of $570,000 of cash used to acquire ITG offset by $149,391 representing the proceeds from the sale of RPM. Our financing activities in Fiscal 2009 used a total of $1,122,039 which was comprised of $1,105,000 to pay down ITGs bank debt and $11,251 for payments of our capital lease obligations. We also used $5,432 in Fiscal 2009 to repurchase 6,900 Shares in private transactions. On September 13, 2008, the President of ITG, entered into a two-year employment agreement with ITG. He is entitled to receive an annual base salary of $200,000 and is entitled to certain other benefits. The employment agreement contains non-competition, non-solicitation and confidentiality provisions. We are currently exploring alternatives to ITGs corporate structure concerning non-compliance issues regarding the practice of certain licensed professions in the State of New York. If a change in professional practice structure is deemed necessary, we will take all appropriate measures to assure compliance on a timely basis. Revenues derived from services performed by these licensed professionals approximate 23% of total revenues during Fiscal 2009. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable capital and operating leases and subleases, exclusive of future escalation charges, are as follows: Capital Operating Leases Leases 2010 $ 21,523 $ 202,000 2011 21,523 135,000 2012 8,004 84,000 2013  55,000 2014  5,000 Total minimum lease payments 51,050 $ 481,000 Less: Amounts representing interest (5,453 ) Present value of minimum lease payments 45,597 Less: Current portion (18,051 ) Long-term portion of capital leases $ 27,546 While we have not experienced any significant impact from the general slowdown of the economy or current global credit crisis, continuing economic deterioration could have a negative impact on our net revenues and operating results in future periods. 12 We continue to review strategic alternatives for maximizing shareholder value. Potential acquisitions will be evaluated based on their respective merits. We believe that we have sufficient cash resources and working capital to meet our capital resource requirements for the foreseeable future. Credit Risk Service revenue is concentrated within a limited number of clients throughout New York State; municipalities within New York State provide substantial and significant revenue to our Company. This concentration of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that our customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions in New York State. Seasonality Our business is moderately seasonal in nature based on the timing of the school year. Accordingly, our second fiscal quarter, which includes two full months during which schools are not in session (July and August), is the quarter in which we will achieve our lowest volume of revenues. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk represents the potential loss from adverse changes in market interest rates. As we may hold U.S. Treasury securities or money market funds, we may be exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level and volatility of interest rates and in the shape of the yield curve. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), which changes how business acquisitions are accounted. SFAS 141R requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Certain provisions of this standard will, among other things, impact the determination of acquisition-date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination (including contingent consideration); exclude transaction costs from acquisition accounting; and change accounting practices for acquired contingencies, acquisition-related restructuring costs, in-process research and development, indemnification assets, and tax benefits. SFAS 141R is effective for business combinations occurring after December 15, 2008. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS 160), which requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and noncontrolling interest. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 13 In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active (FSP FAS 157-3) with an immediate effective date, including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued. FSP FAS 157-3 clarifies the application of fair value in inactive markets and allows for the use of managements internal assumptions about future cash flows with appropriately risk-adjusted discount rates when relevant observable market data does not exist. The objective of FSP FAS 157-3 has not changed and continues to be the determination of the price that would be received in an orderly transaction that is not a forced liquidation or distressed sale at the measurement date. The adoption of FSP FAS 157-3 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Regulation S-K and, as such, are not required to provide the information contained in this item pursuant to Regulation S-K. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The financial statements required by this Item are set forth at the pages indicated in Item 13 on page 22 of this Annual Report. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. None. Item 9A(T). Controls and Procedures. a). Disclosure Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) that are designed to assure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date. b). Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, and effected by the board of directors and management to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP including those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures 14 are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2009. Management is aware, however, that there is a lack of segregation of duties due to the small number of employees dealing with general administrative and financial matters. However, management has concluded that considering the employees involved and the control procedures in place, the risks associated with such lack of segregation are insignificant and the potential benefits of adding employees to clearly segregate duties do not justify the expenses associated with such increases. This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our current independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. c). Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting. We have excluded from this assessment the internal control over financial reporting of ITG, which we acquired in September 2008. The total net assets and net revenue of ITG represented $1.4 million and $3.3 million, respectively, of the total consolidated total assets and net revenues for the year ended March 31, 2009.

The Code of Ethics was filed as an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form 10-KSB for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004.

Compensation Plans The following describes plans adopted by our Company pursuant to which cash or non-cash compensation was paid or distributed during the years ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 or pursuant to which such compensation may be distributed in the future to the Named Executive Officers: 401(k) Profit Sharing Plans We currently maintain two 401(k) plans which cover all employees having reached the age of 21 with one or more years of service. Under the terms of these plans, there are vesting requirements with respect to our contributions, but employees are fully vested in their own salary deferral contributions. We do not provide for any other retirement benefit for any of our employees, including executive officers. Stock Option Plans In July 1985, our Companys Board adopted the 1985 Stock Option Plan (the 1985 Plan). The 1985 Plan had previously expired, except as to options outstanding. During the year ended March 31, 2009, these options expired on their respective expiration dates. On May 7, 1997, the Board adopted the 1997 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan) covering 750,000 Shares. Our shareholders ratified and approved the 1997 Plan in September 1997. There are no remaining options available for grant under the 1997 Plan. The 1997 Plan has expired, except as to options outstanding (consisting of options to purchase 395,000 Shares at March 31, 2009). On August 25, 2000, the Board adopted the 2000 Incentive Stock Plan (the 2000 Plan). Our shareholders ratified and approved the 2000 Plan in October 2000. The 2000 Plan permits the granting of options to purchase 750,000 Shares. At March 31, 2009, options to purchase 141,000 Shares were outstanding under the 2000 Plan. On June 14, 2005, the Board adopted the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2005 Plan) covering 1,000,000 Shares. Our Companys shareholders ratified and approved the 2005 Plan in October 2005.

Under the 2000 Plan, 2005 Plan and the 2007 Plan, either incentive stock options or nonstatutory options may be granted as an incentive to key employees (including directors and officers who are key 18 employees), non-employee directors, independent contractors and consultants of our Company and to offer an additional inducement in obtaining the services of such individuals. The exercise price of the Shares under each option is determined by a committee appointed by the Board (the Committee); provided, however, that the exercise price shall not be less than the fair market value of the Shares on the date of the grant plus 10% for a more than 10% shareholder. The term of each option granted is established by the Committee, in its sole discretion, provided that the term shall not exceed ten years from the date of the grant. All of our Plans provide that the number of Shares subject thereto and the outstanding options and their exercise prices are to be appropriately adjusted for mergers, consolidations, recapitalizations, stock dividends, stock splits or combinations of shares. The current Committee appointed by the Board to administer our stock option plans consists of Messrs. Gutmann, Elkin and Looney, all independent directors within the meaning of the Qualitative Listing Rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market. The Board may at any time terminate or from time to time amend or alter any of the existing Plans.
