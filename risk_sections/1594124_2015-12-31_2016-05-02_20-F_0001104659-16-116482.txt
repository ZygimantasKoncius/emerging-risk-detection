D. Risk FactorsRisks Related to our Business and Industry Disputes with our historical project affiliates other equity owners may adversely affect our business. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our shareholders and any debt financing may require restrictive covenants. Additional funds may not be available on terms commercially acceptable to us. Failure to manage discretionary spending and raise additional capital or debt financing as required may adversely impact our ability to achieve our intended business objectives. The delay between making significant upfront investments in our solar parks and receiving revenue could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, business and results of operations. There are generally many months or even years between our initial significant upfront investments in developing permits to build solar parks we expect to own and operate and when we commence to receive revenue from the sale of electricity generated by such solar parks after grid connection. Such investments include, without limitation, legal, accounting and other third-party fees, costs associated with feasibility study, payments for land rights, government permits, large transmission and PPA deposits or other payments, which may be non-refundable. Furthermore, we have historically relied on our own equity contribution and bank loans to pay for costs and expenses incurred during project development, especially to third parties for PV modules and balance-of-system components and EPC and O&M services. Solar parks typically generate revenue only after becoming commercially operational and starting to sell electricity to the power grid. There may be an especially long delay from initial land and interconnection assessments to projects becoming shovel-ready, especially when we obtain permits directly from regulators and site control rights directly from prior rights holders under our primary permit development model. Between our initial investments in the development of permits for solar parks and their connection to the transmission grid, there may be adverse developments to such solar parks. We consider parks shovel-ready even if we have not obtained non-discretionary permits, that is, such permits which we expect to be granted if we comply with the relevant administrative procedures and criteria. In certain jurisdictions, such as Chile, maintaining our permits and operating our plants involve meeting ongoing compliance and other legal obligations. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain all of the permits as anticipated, permits that were obtained may expire or become ineffective or we may not be able to obtain debt financing as anticipated. In addition, the timing gap between our upfront investments and actual generation of revenue, or any added delay in between due to unforeseen events, could put strains on our liquidity and resources, and materially and adversely affect our profitability and results of operations. We intend to expand our business into China, which may expose our business to new risks that may materially and adversely affect our future prospects and results of operations. On December 23, 2014, we announced our intention to expand our business into the Chinese solar market, and although we expected to make our first investments in China during 2015, we delayed entry for various market condition. However, we continue to evaluate attractive opportunities for entering the Chinese solar market and over the next few quarters we expect to make investments in China. Nonetheless, our ability to successfully implement our business expansion strategy into China is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including: 11 Table of Contents · access to project financing and other sources of capital to finance our China investments, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all given the fact that Chinese capital and foreign exchange markets are less developed relative to the countries where we have worked in the past; · curtailment of power purchase amounts promised by utilities due to lack of sufficient transmission grid infrastructure; · regulations creating significant burdens or limiting entirely the ability of Chinese residents to repatriate capital into China, which affects our ability to finance Chinese investment through funds we have obtained or we will obtain from abroad; · our short operational history as a downstream solar park developer in China; · delays in obtaining land rights and related permits and other required governmental permits and approvals; · potential difficulties in collecting payments from large state-owned enterprises or utilities related to the Chinese legal system; · potential challenges from local residents, government organizations, and others who may not support our projects; and · potential conflict with our module and other equipment suppliers as a result of our direct competition with certain of their downstream ventures. If we are unable to effectively manage these risks, we may not be able to successfully execute our expansion plan in China and face a loss of the time, effort and capital invested there. We may not be able to manage our business growth strategy as planned and our results of operations may be adversely affected. We have entered into a deed of non-competition and right of first refusal with our chairman and chief executive officer Mr. Su with respect to his businesses in China, which may result in a transaction that is not on an arms length basis. We have entered into a deed of non-competition and right of first refusal with Mr. Su whereby he promises that he and any company he controls will not engage in any business that competes with us and grants us the right of first refusal to purchase shares in his businesses in China in which he owns more than 50% of the voting shares in the event that Mr. Su receives from or otherwise negotiate with a third party a bona fide offer to purchase Mr. Sus shares in any of the business and the sale of such shares will result in Mr. Su ceasing control of that business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to enforce the agreement or exercise the right of first refusal when Mr. Su wishes to sell his business interests in China. Moreover, the non-competition clause will terminate at the earlier of (i) the delisting of our ADSs and ordinary shares from the NASDAQ Capital Market, (ii) the time when Mr. Su ceases to be our largest shareholder and (iii) upon the mutual agreement of Mr. Su and our company to terminate the non-competition clause. We will have the right of first refusal to purchase Mr. Sus shares in his business in China when the sale of the shares will result in Mr. Su ceasing control of that business and the right will terminate at the earlier of (i) the delisting of our ADSs and ordinary shares from the NASDAQ Capital Market, and (ii) upon the mutual agreement to terminate by Mr. Su and our company. The right of first refusal does not extend to the sale of individual solar assets. Control is defined as the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting shares, by contract, or otherwise. Additionally, under the laws and practice of the Cayman Islands, shareholders may not be afforded the same level of protection from an affiliate transaction that would typically be the case for a Delaware corporation, such as fairness opinions and an independent due diligence process. We cannot assure you that the deed of non-competition and the right of first refusal, or the subsequent sale of Mr. Sus businesses to us, if any, will be negotiated or administered on an arms length basis. In addition, we cannot assure you that Mr. Su will ever wish to sell his business in China, or that our right of first refusal will ever be exercised or that any purchase by us of any of Mr. Sus businesses in China would be on terms equivalent to an arms length transaction. 12 Table of Contents Our limited operating history, especially with large-scale IPP solar parks, may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations. We began our business in 2009 and have a limited operating history. We started to develop our first solar park in 2009, and first began to operate solar parks in 2012 as an IPP. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, we derived 58.9%, 21.1% and 19.9% of our total revenue from selling solar energy systems. In 2013, in order to internalize more value from project development and generate recurring revenue and cash flow, we began to focus on owning and operating solar parks as an IPP. As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of 128.6 MW of IPP solar parks in operation with a carrying value of US$259.4 million. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, we derived 22.0%, 67.5% and 75.2% respectively, of our total revenue from electricity sales from our IPP solar parks. Our historic track record of selling solar energy systems may not be a reliable indicator of our performance as an IPP. Our rapidly evolving business and, in particular, our relatively limited operating history as an IPP, may not be an adequate basis for evaluating our business prospects and financial performance, and makes it difficult to predict the future results of operations. Our past success occurred in an environment where capital was readily accessible to our clients and economic incentives were more favorable for PV power in certain markets, such as Greece and Bulgaria. Therefore, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results and our results of operations for any period should not be relied upon as an indication of our performance for any future period. In particular, our results of operations, financial condition, and future success depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to continue to identify suitable sites, obtain required regulatory approvals, arrange financing from various sources, construct solar parks in a cost-effective and timely manner, expand our project pipeline and manage and operate solar parks that we develop. If we cannot do so, we may not be able to expand our business at a profit or at all, maintain our competitive position, satisfy our contractual obligations, or sustain growth and profitability. We may not be able to develop or acquire additional attractive IPP solar parks to grow our project portfolio. Our current business strategy includes plans to further grow our IPP assets, and own and operate substantially all the solar parks we develop. As part of our growth plan, we may acquire solar parks in various development stages through a competitive bidding process. We compete for project awards based on, among other things, pricing, technical and engineering expertise, financing capabilities, past experience and track record. It is difficult to predict whether and when we will be awarded a new solar park. The bidding and selection process is also affected by a number of factors, including factors which may be beyond our control, such as market conditions or government incentive programs. Our competitors may have greater financial resources, a more effective or established localized business presence or a greater willingness or ability to operate with little or no operating margins for sustained periods of time. Any increase in competition during the bidding process or reduction in our competitive capabilities could have a significant adverse impact on our market share and on the margins we generate from our solar parks. Other difficulties executing this growth strategy, particularly in new jurisdictions we may enter, include: · accurately prioritizing geographic markets for entry, including estimates on addressable market demand; · obtaining construction, environmental and other permits and approvals; · securing land, rooftop or other site control; · managing local operational, capital investment or components sourcing regulatory requirements; · connecting to the power grid on schedule and within budget; · connecting to the power grid if there is insufficient grid capacity; · identifying, attracting and retaining qualified development specialists, technical engineering specialists and other personnel; · managing any acquired assets or assets held under affiliates; · securing cost-competitive financing on attractive terms; · operating and maintaining solar parks to maintain the power output and system performance; and · collecting FIT payments and other economic incentives as expected. 13 Table of Contents We may not be able to find suitable sites for the development of IPP solar parks. Solar parks require solar and geological conditions that can only be found in a limited number of geographic areas. Further, large, utility-scale solar parks must be interconnected to the power grid in order to deliver electricity, which requires us to find suitable sites with capacity on the power grid available. Our competitors may impede our development efforts by acquiring control of all or a portion of a PV site we seek to develop. In addition, we acquire land with the understanding that such land may be rezoned for solar park development. However, rezoning has, at times, taken longer than expected or has not been possible. For example, we encounter difficulties registering certain leasehold interests due to other land owners opposition to the rezoning process from time to time. Although our operations were not materially affected by this delay, or the costs involved, future rezoning efforts may materially and adversely impact our business and results of operation. Even when we have identified a desirable site for a solar park, our ability to obtain site control with respect to the site is subject to our ability to finance the transaction and manage growing competition from other solar power producers that may have better access to local government support, financial or other resources. If we were unable to find or obtain site control for suitable PV sites on commercially acceptable terms, our ability to develop new solar parks on a timely basis or at all might be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our legal rights to certain real properties used for our solar parks are subject to third party rights and may be challenged by property owners or third parties. Our rights to the properties used for our solar parks may be challenged by property owners and other third parties. For example, in Chile we have had to negotiate and clarify with other mining concession holders about the priority of our mining concession rights over certain areas where we intend to construct a solar park, which may delay our timetable for construction. An adverse decision from a court or the absence of an agreement with such third-parties may result in additional costs and delays in the construction and operating phases of any solar park so situated. In addition, certain real properties used for our solar parks in Spain and Uruguay were mortgaged to third parties by the relevant landlords to secure other debts before we obtained our rights with respect to such properties and, as a result, our rights are subject to the mortgages. In the event of failure by the relevant debtor to comply with its payment obligations, the mortgagee will be entitled to sell the properties and the mortgagee or the purchaser of such properties will have no obligation to respect our rights to the properties and will be entitled to terminate our rights without any compensation. In such case, we may lose our rights to the affected solar parks. While we may ask the debtor or the property owner to compensate us, we cannot assure you that they will agree or have the financial resources to do so or that the compensation will be sufficient to cover all of our losses. In addition, some properties used for our solar parks are subject to other third-party rights such as right of passage and right to place cables and other equipment on the properties, which may result in certain interferences with our use of the properties. Our rights to the properties used for our solar parks may be challenged by property owners and other third parties for various other reasons as well. For example, we do not always have the exclusive right to use a given site. Any such challenge, if successful, could impair the development or operations of our solar parks on such properties. We are also subject to the risk of potential disputes with property owners or third parties who otherwise have rights to or interests in the properties used for our solar parks. Such disputes, whether resolved in our favor or not, may divert managements attention, harm our reputation or otherwise disrupt our business. Failure to manage our growing and changing business could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. We intend to expand our business significantly within selected existing markets and in a number of new locations in the future. For example, we entered the US market in 2015, with the formation of Sky Capital America Inc. and have targeted the U.S. market as a market with high growth potential. We also intend to significantly increase the proportion of solar parks we develop as IPP solar parks in the future. As we grow, we expect to encounter additional challenges to our internal processes, external construction management, capital commitment process, project funding infrastructure, financing capabilities and regulatory compliance. Our existing operations, personnel, systems and internal control may not be adequate to support our growth and expansion and may require us to make additional unanticipated investments in our infrastructure. In addition, our experience developing, building and selling solar energy systems may not be applicable to our IPP solar parks, since IPP solar parks require enhanced financing and O&M capabilities. To manage the future growth of our operations, we will be required to improve our administrative, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, and maintain, expand, train and manage our growing employee base. We will need to hire and train project development personnel to expand and manage our project development efforts. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, execute our business strategies successfully or respond to competitive pressures. As a result, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 14 Table of Contents Our future success depends significantly on the continued service of our senior management team and our ability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel. The industry experience, expertise and contributions of our chairman and chief executive officer, Mr. Weili Su, are essential to our continuing success. We will continue to rely on the contributions of our senior management, regional management and other key employees to implement our growth plans. If we were to lose the services of any of our senior and regional management members and were unable to train or recruit and retain personnel with comparable qualifications, the management and growth of our business could be adversely affected. Our success is largely attributable to the qualified and experienced project development teams that we have been able to train, attract and retain in the past. We may not be able to continue to train, attract and retain high quality personnel, including executive officers, project development personnel, project management personnel and other key qualified personnel who have the necessary and required experience and expertise. In particular, as we enter new markets in different jurisdictions, we always face challenges to find and retain qualified local personnel who are familiar with local regulatory regimes and adequately experienced in project development and operations. There is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the downstream PV industry. Our competitors may be able to offer more competitive packages, or otherwise attract our personnel. Our costs to retain qualified personnel may also increase in response to competition. If we fail to attract and retain personnel with suitable managerial, technical or marketing expertise or maintain an adequate labor force on a continuous basis, our business operations could be adversely affected and our future growth and expansions may be inhibited. Our international operations require significant management resources and present legal, compliance and execution risks in multiple jurisdictions. We have adopted a global business model under which we maintain significant operations and facilities through our subsidiaries located in Europe, South America, North America and Asia, while our corporate management team and directors are primarily based in Hong Kong and Shanghai. Although we have appointed managing directors who oversee Europe, Latin America, East Asia and North America, the global nature of our business may stretch our management resources as well as make it difficult for our corporate management to effectively monitor local execution teams. The global nature of our operations and limited resources of our management may create risks and uncertainties when executing our strategy and conducting operations in multiple jurisdictions, which could affect our costs and results of operations. We have been, and in the future may be, the target of lawsuits, harassment or other hostile conduct by third parties, including malicious allegations, which could generate adverse publicity and harm our reputation and could adversely affect our business and the trading price of our ADSs. We have been, and in the future may be, the target of lawsuits, harassment, or other hostile conduct by third parties. Such conduct has in the past included, and may in the future include, malicious allegations, anonymous or otherwise, regarding our personnel, business, operations, accounting, corporate history, prospects or business ethics. For example, in October 2014, counsel representing certain former employees of Sky Solar Holdings Co., Ltd., a former shareholder of Sky Solar Power Ltd., have sent letters threatening litigation, and certain of these claimants have sent harassing emails, short messages and letters to certain of our shareholders, directors and professional advisors alleging that they were deprived of the economic benefits of their holdings in Sky Solar Holdings Co., Ltd. as a result of (i) our failure to provide sufficient advance notice of the restructuring of Sky Solar Holdings Co., Ltd. and the transfer of assets from Sky Solar Holdings Co., Ltd. to us, and (ii) Mr. Sus improper use of the proxy that such shareholders had granted him to attend shareholder meetings and vote shares on their behalf. In March 2015, a group of former employees and shareholders of Sky Solar Holdings Co., Ltd commenced an arbitration with the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre, or HKIAC, against our chairman and certain other shareholders in connection with the restructuring of Sky Solar Holdings Co., Ltd. Sky Solar Holdings Co., Ltd is not a party to the arbitration. In March 24, 2016, the claimants submitted a letter withdrawing their claims and applying for an order dismissing this case on the grounds that paying 100% of the costs of this arbitration in the interim would be a great burden upon them and they cannot assume that an award providing for recovery of these costs would be enforceable. We requested the tribunal to terminate the arbitration proceedings with immediate effect and order that the claimants claims be withdrawn with prejudice. As of the date of this annual report, this arbitration remains pending. We believe that these claims are without merit, and that these claimants may be attempting to extort economic benefits from us and our chairman. Nevertheless, these allegations could become a significant distraction for our management. It is also possible that any such allegations against us or our chairman or other executives will be publicly disseminated through various media, including, without limitation, internet chat rooms, blogs, social networks or other websites. Despite our belief that such claims are without merit, if any of these claimants were to prevail in any claim brought against us or against our chairman or were to publicly disseminate any of these allegations, our reputation, business and the trading price of our ADSs could be adversely affected. 15 Table of Contents Decreases in the spot market price of electricity could harm our IPP revenue and reduce the competitiveness of solar parks in grid-parity markets. The electricity prices for solar parks are either fixed through long-term PPAs or are variable and determined by the spot market. Although the price of electricity as of December 31, 2015 was fixed through PPAs for 99.0% of our solar parks in operation, in countries where the price of electricity is sufficiently high that solar parks can be profitably developed without the need for government price supports, a condition known as grid-parity, solar parks may choose not to enter into PPAs and sell based on the spot market price of electricity. We intend to build IPP solar parks in Chile, a market that reached grid parity in 2011, and we expect that the price of electricity purchased by such solar parks will fluctuate with Chiles spot electricity prices. Revenue for solar parks in other markets will also fluctuate with the electricity spot market after the expiration of any PPA, unless renewed. The market price of electricity can be subject to significant fluctuations and can be affected by drivers such as the cost of traditional fossil fuels used for electricity generation, the discovery of new fossil fuel sources, additional electricity generation capacity, additional electric transmission and distribution lines, technological or regulatory changes, increased energy conservation or for a number of other reasons. Decreases in the spot price of electricity in such countries would render PV energy less competitive compared to other forms of electricity. For example, PV may no longer be in grid parity if the price of fossil fuels used for electricity generation decreased sufficiently. In this situation, our solar parks may no longer be profitable in that market and we may not be able to recoup the time and effort invested in applying for permits or developing solar parks. A reduction in electricity prices would render our solar parks less economically attractive. If the retail price of energy were to decrease due to any of these reasons, or others, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. If sufficient demand for solar parks does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. The PV market is at a relatively early stage of development in many of the markets that we have entered or intend to enter. The PV industry continues to experience lower costs, improved efficiency and higher electricity output. However, trends in the PV industry are based only on limited data and may not be reliable. Many factors may affect the demand for solar parks, including: 16 Table of Contents · the cost and availability of credit, loans and other forms of financing for solar parks; · fluctuations in economic and market conditions that affect the viability of conventional and non-solar renewable energy sources; · the cost-effectiveness of solar parks compared to conventional and other non-solar energy sources; · the performance and reliability of solar parks compared to conventional and other non-solar energy sources; · the availability of grid capacity to dispatch power generated from solar parks; · environmental concerns related to solar parks and other local permit issues; · the availability of government subsidies and incentives to support the development of the PV industry; · public perceptions of the direct and indirect benefits of adopting renewable energy technology; · the success of other alternative energy generation technologies, such as fuel cells, wind power and biomass; · regulations and policies governing the electric utility industry that may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar energy; and · the deregulation of the electric power industry and the broader energy industry. If market demand for solar parks fails to develop sufficiently, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. We face significant competition in certain markets in which we operate. We face significant competition in certain markets in which we operate. Our primary competitors are local and international developers and operators of solar parks, many of which are integrated with upstream PV manufacturers. We also compete with utilities generating power from conventional fossil fuels and other sources of renewable energy in regions that have achieved grid parity, such as Chile. As we further expand into downstream markets, we will face increasing competition from these companies. Some of our competitors may have advantages over us in terms of greater operational, financial, technical, management or other resources in particular markets or in general. Our market position depends on our financing, development and operation capabilities, reputation, experience and track record. Our competitors may also enter into strategic alliances or form affiliates with other competitors to our detriment. Suppliers or contractors may merge with our competitors which may limit our choices of contractors and hence the flexibility of our overall project execution capabilities. There can be no assurance that our current or potential competitors will not offer solar parks or services comparable or superior to those that we offer at the same or lower prices or adapt more quickly than we do. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and loss of market share. We are subject to risks associated with fluctuations in the prices of PV modules and balance-of-system components or in the costs of design, construction and labor. We procure supplies for solar parks construction, such as PV modules and balance-of-system components, from third-party suppliers. We typically enter into contracts with our suppliers and contractors on a project-by-project basis or a project portfolio basis. We generally do not maintain long-term contracts with our suppliers. Although some of our EPC contracts allow us to reclaim additional costs incurred as a result of unexpected increases in procurement costs, we are still exposed to fluctuations in prices for our PV modules and balance-of-system components. Increases in the prices of PV products or balance-of-system components or fluctuations in design, construction, labor and installation costs may increase the cost of procuring equipment and engaging contractors and hence materially and adversely affect our results of operations. 17 Table of Contents Solar park development is challenging and may ultimately not be successful, which can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The development and construction of solar parks involve numerous risks and uncertainties and requires extensive research, planning and due diligence. We may be required to incur significant amounts of capital expenditure for land and interconnection rights, preliminary engineering, permitting, legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a solar park is economically, technologically or otherwise feasible. Success in developing a particular solar park is contingent upon, among other things: · securing suitable project sites, necessary rights of way, and satisfactory land rights in the appropriate locations with capacity on the transmission grid; · rezoning land, as necessary, to support a solar park; · negotiating satisfactory engineering, procurement and construction agreements and land use and access rights; · negotiating and receiving required permits and approvals for project development from government authorities on schedule; · completing all required regulatory and administrative procedures needed to obtain permits and agreements; · procuring rights to interconnect the solar park to the electric grid or to transmit energy; · paying interconnection and other deposits, some of which are non-refundable; · negotiating favorable payment terms with suppliers; · signing PPAs or other arrangements that are commercially acceptable, including adequate for providing financing; · obtaining construction financing, including debt financing and own equity contribution; and · satisfactorily completing construction on schedule. Successful completion of a particular solar park may be adversely affected by numerous factors, including without limitation: · unanticipated changes in project plans or defective or late execution; · difficulties in obtaining and maintaining governmental permits, licenses and approvals required by existing laws and regulations or additional regulatory requirements not previously anticipated; · the inability to procure adequate financing with acceptable terms, especially for engineering, procurement and construction; · unforeseeable engineering problems, construction or other unexpected delays and contractor performance shortfalls; · labor, equipment and materials supply delays, shortages or disruptions, or work stoppages; · adverse weather, environmental and geological conditions, force majeure and other events out of our control; and · cost over-runs, due to any one or more of the foregoing factors. 18 Table of Contents Accordingly, some of the solar parks in our pipeline may not be completed or even proceed to construction. If a number of solar parks are not completed, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our construction activities may be subject to cost overruns or delays. Construction of our solar parks may be adversely affected by circumstances outside of our control, including inclement weather, a failure to receive regulatory approvals on schedule or third-party delays in providing PV modules, inverters or other materials. Obtaining full permits for our solar parks is time consuming and we may not be able to meet our expected timetable for obtaining full permits for our solar parks in the pipeline. We may not be able to negotiate satisfactory engineering, procurement and construction agreements with third parties. Changes in project plans or designs, or defective or late execution may increase our costs and cause delays. Increases in the prices of PV products and balance-of-system components may increase procurement costs. Labor shortages, work stoppages or labor disputes could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase our costs. In addition, delays in obtaining or our inability to obtain required construction permits could also delay or hinder the construction of our solar parks. A lack of proper construction permits or post-construction approvals could delay or prevent us from commencing operation and connecting to the relevant grid. Moreover, we rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers for certain components and equipment used in the construction of our solar parks, such as PV modules. The failure of a supplier to supply components and equipment in a timely manner, or at all, or to supply components and equipment that meet our quality, quantity and cost requirements, could impair our ability to install solar parks or may increase our costs. To the extent the processes that our suppliers use to manufacture components are proprietary, we may be unable to obtain comparable components from alternative suppliers. In addition, we typically utilize and rely on third-party contractors to construct and install our solar parks. If our contractors do not satisfy their obligations or do not perform work that meets our quality standards or if there is a shortage of third-party contractors or if there are labor strikes that interfere with the ability of our employees or contractors to complete their work on time or within budget, we could experience significant delays or cost overruns. We may not be able to recover any of these losses in connection with construction cost overruns or delays. In addition, if we are unable to connect a solar park to the power grid on schedule, we may experience lower FIT, as FIT regimes generally ratchet down the FIT awarded to solar parks that connect later to the power grid. In addition, in certain cases of delay, we might not be able to obtain any FIT or PPA at all, as certain PPAs require that we connect to the transmission grid by a certain date. If the solar park is significantly delayed, we may forfeit the PPA and we may only be able to obtain reduced FIT payments or may even become ineligible for FIT payments at all. A reduction or forfeiture of FIT payments or would materially and adversely affect the financial results and results of operations for that solar park, even to the point of rendering the project no longer profitable. In Chile, a country where FIT payments are not necessarily required for solar power to be economically competitive, failure to meet certain deadlines may result in the cancellation of key permits and jeopardize the viability of a project. Any of the contingencies discussed above could lead us to fail to generate our expected return from our solar parks and result in unanticipated and significant revenue and earnings losses. We may be subject to unforeseen costs, liabilities or obligations when operating and maintaining solar parks. We operate and maintain the solar parks in our IPP portfolio. In addition, we have entered into separate contractual agreements to operate and maintain substantially all of the solar parks built by us. Pursuant to these agreements, we generally perform scheduled and unscheduled maintenance and operating and other asset management services. We subcontract certain on-the-ground O&M services, including security and repair, to third-parties, who may not perform their services adequately. If we or our third-party contractors fail to properly operate and maintain the solar parks, the solar parks may experience decreased performance, reduced useful life or shut downs. Through changes in our own operation or in local conditions, the costs of operating the project may increase, including costs related to labor, equipment, insurance and taxes. If they are careless or negligent, resulting in damage to third parties, we may become liable for the consequences of any resulting damage. We may also experience equipment malfunction or failure, leading to unexpected maintenance needs, unplanned outages or other operational issues. In addition, inconsistencies in the quality of solar panels, PV modules, balance-of-system components or maintenance services for our solar parks may affect the system efficiency of our solar parks. We may also encounter difficulties selling electricity to the power grid due to failures in infrastructure or transmission systems. To the extent that any of the foregoing affects our ability to sell electricity to the power grid, or we incur increased costs in relation to operating and maintaining solar parks, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially and adversely affected. 19 Table of Contents Our project operations may be adversely affected by weather and climate conditions, natural disasters and adverse work environments. Solar parks depend on the amount and intensity of sunlight, which is affected by weather and climate conditions. Any change of such conditions in the areas we operate that reduces solar radiation will adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, we may operate in areas that are under the threat of floods, earthquakes, landslides, mudslides, sandstorms, drought, or other inclement weather and climate conditions or natural disasters. If inclement weather or climatic conditions or natural disasters occur in areas where our solar parks and project teams are located, project development, connectivity to the power grid and the provision of O&M services may be adversely affected. In particular, materials may not be delivered as scheduled and labor may not be available. As many of our solar parks are located in the same region, such solar parks may be simultaneously affected by weather and climate conditions, natural disasters and adverse work environments. During periods of curtailed activity, we may continue to incur operating expenses. We may bear some or all of the losses associated with such unforeseen events. Moreover, natural disasters which are beyond our control may adversely affect the economy, infrastructure and communities in the countries and regions where we conduct our business operations. Such conditions may result in personal injuries or fatalities or have an adverse effect on our work performance, progress and efficiency or even result in personal injuries or fatalities. We are subject to counterparty risks under our FIT price support schemes and PPAs. As an IPP, we generate electricity income primarily pursuant to FIT price support schemes or PPAs, which subjects us to counterparty risks with respect to electric utilities and regulatory regimes. Our FIT price support schemes and PPAs in one region or country are generally signed with a limited number of electric utilities. We rely on these electric utilities to fulfill their responsibilities for the full and timely payment of our tariffs. In addition, the relevant regulatory authorities may retroactively alter their FIT price support regimes in light of changing economic circumstances, changing industry conditions or for any number of other reasons. For example, the Greek government passed a law in April 2014 reducing FIT currently in effect in existing contracts by roughly 30%, while imposing a discount on electricity already sold in 2013. In December 2015, following a ministerial decision, a levy of 3.6% was imposed on the electricity sold by PV stations in Greece from January 1, 2016 onwards. In December 2013, the Bulgarian government imposed a 20% fee on revenue generated from PV and wind energy installations. Subsequently, the Constitutional Court of Bulgaria determined the fee to be unconstitutional, and renewable energy producers are no longer required to pay this fee. Furthermore, starting on July 24, 2015, all energy producers in Bulgaria shall pay monthly contributions in favor of the Electric Power Grid Security Fund amounting to 5% of their monthly revenues generated from electricity sold, VAT excluded. If the relevant government authorities, the local power grid companies or other counterparties or responsible parties do not perform their obligations under the FIT price support schemes and PPAs and we are unable to enforce our contractual rights, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, each of the PPAs we entered into in Uruguay includes a clause of Revision of Conditions, which provides that in case a change of circumstance not attributable to any of the parties, which are extraordinary, unforeseen and insuperable, regarding economic conditions or any other condition which results in an excessive onerosity in order to comply with the obligations set forth therein and that materially alter the commercial terms and conditions that were considered to enter into the PPA and that imply real persistent difficulties in its compliance for one or both parties, with the agreement both of the parties and the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mining, the terms and conditions of the PPA shall be revised. 20 Table of Contents Disputes with our historical project affiliates other equity owners may adversely affect our business. We do not have control over the management and strategy with respect to solar parks held by the historical project affiliates in which we hold less than 50% equity interests. See Item 4. Information on the CompanyB. Business OverviewOur Historical Project Affiliates. Our ability to direct the actions of or influence the decisions in relation to these affiliates or the solar parks held by them is dependent on a number of factors, including reaching agreement with other stakeholders with respect to certain decisions, our rights and obligations under the relevant stakeholders agreements and the decision-making process by the board of directors or other governing bodies. We may not successfully engage business partners that are reliable and capable. In addition, in the course of cooperation, our business partners may: · have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours; · take actions contrary to our instructions or make requests contrary to our policies or objectives; · be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the relevant cooperative arrangements, including their obligation to make the required capital contribution; or · experience financial difficulties. In particular, under the current contractual arrangements, if our affiliates other equity owners decide to secure permits, EPC or O&M services from other parties or otherwise take any action that may not be in our best interest or fail to perform their respective obligations or otherwise breach the terms and conditions of the governing agreements, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a dispute may arise with our current or future affiliates other equity owners and cause the loss of business opportunities or disruption to or termination of the relevant solar parks. Such dispute may also give rise to litigation or other legal proceedings, which will divert our managements attention and other resources. In the event that we encounter any of the foregoing problems, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Our result of operations may be subject to fluctuations. Historically, we primarily generated revenue from selling permits, providing EPC services and selling commercially operational solar parks. In a given period, our revenue was affected by the limited number of solar parks that are under development and sold to third parties, and therefore subject to significant fluctuations. Although we focus on developing IPP solar parks, we will continue to develop, build and sell solar energy systems from time to time to take advantage of attractive market opportunities. As a result, we may generate more of our revenues from the one-time sale of solar parks for certain periods. Moreover, certain aspects of our IPP business are also subject to seasonal variations. For example, certain economic incentive programs, such as FIT regimes, generally include mechanisms that ratcheted down the incentives over time in line with the general trend of decreasing system costs of solar parks. As a result, we may schedule significant construction activities to connect solar parks to the power grids prior to scheduled decreases in FIT rates, which vary from country to country, in order to qualify for more favorable FIT policies. To the extent that we continue to develop, build and sell solar energy systems, we may be exposed to similar risks going forward. 21 Table of Contents We may incur warranty expenses in connection with the solar energy systems we have sold. We provide two to five year warranties to the clients of our EPC services and purchasers of our solar parks. Although we generally obtain warranties from our equipment suppliers, we may be responsible for claims during the warranty period with respect to defects in our EPC services and solar parks sold. We are required to remove such defects generally within 48 hours after the defects occur, and to bear all the costs associated with our repair work. Our expenses for repairs have historically not been material. If significant defects arise from our EPC services or solar parks sold to clients, we may suffer adverse impacts on our financial condition and business. We may fail to comply with laws and regulations in the countries where we develop, construct and operate solar parks. The development, construction and operation of solar parks are highly regulated activities. We conduct our operations in many countries and jurisdictions and are governed by different laws and regulations, including national and local regulations relating to building codes, taxes, safety, environmental protection, utility interconnection and metering and other matters. We also set up subsidiaries in these countries and jurisdictions which are required to comply with various local laws and regulations. While we strive to work with our local counsel and other advisers to comply with the laws and regulations of each jurisdiction in which we have operations, there have been, and continue to be, instances of noncompliance such as late filings of annual accounts with the appropriate governmental authorities, failure to notify governmental authorities of certain transactions, failure to hold annual meetings as required, failure to register directors or office changes or other local requirements, which may result in fines, sanctions and other penalties against the non-complying subsidiaries and its directors and officers. While we do not believe our past and continuing non-compliances, singularly or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation, we cannot assure you that similar or other non-compliances will not occur in the future which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operation. In order to develop solar parks we must obtain a variety of approvals, permits and licenses from various authorities. The procedures for obtaining such approvals, permits and licenses vary from country to country, making it onerous and costly to track the requirements of individual localities and comply with the varying standards. Failure to obtain the required approvals, permits or licenses or to comply with the conditions associated therewith could result in fines, sanctions, suspension, revocation or non-renewal of approvals, permits or licenses, or even criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any new government regulations pertaining to our business or solar parks may result in significant additional expenses. We cannot assure you that we will be able to promptly and adequately respond to changes of laws and regulations in various jurisdictions, or that our employees and contractors will act in accordance with such laws. Failure to comply with laws and regulations where we develop, construct and operate solar parks may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may become regulated as a utility company in certain jurisdictions in the future. We currently are not subject to regulation as a utility company in any jurisdiction. Our business strategy includes significant expansion into downstream markets as an IPP. Operation of these solar parks and sales of electricity from such solar parks could change our regulatory position in certain jurisdictions in the future. Utility companies are typically subject to complex regulations at the local, state or national level in various jurisdictions, and these regulations could place significant restrictions on our ability to operate our business and execute our business plan by prohibiting or otherwise restricting our sale of electricity. If we were subject to regulation as a utility company, our operating costs could materially increase. If we fail to comply with financial and other covenants under our loan agreements, our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects may be materially and adversely affected. We enter into loan agreements containing financial and other covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios or impose certain restrictions on disposition of our assets or the conduct of our business. While we are currently in compliance with all financial and other covenants, we may not be able to comply with some of those financial and other covenants from time to time. In addition, we typically pledge over our solar park assets or account or trade receivables to raise debt financing, and we are restricted from creating additional security over our assets. Such account or trade receivables will include all income generated from the sale of electricity in the solar parks. If we are in breach of one or more financial or other covenants or negative pledges clause under any of our loan agreements and are not able to obtain waivers from the lenders or prepay such loan, such breach would constitute an event of default under the loan agreement. As a result, repayment of the indebtedness under the relevant loan agreement may be accelerated, which may in turn require us to repay the entire principal amount including interest accrued, if any, of certain of our other existing indebtedness prior to their maturity under cross-default provisions of other loan agreements. If we are required to repay a significant portion or all of our existing indebtedness prior to their maturity, we may lack sufficient financial resources to do so. In that case, the pledgees may auction or sell the assets or interest of our solar parks to enforce their rights under the pledge contracts and loan agreements. Furthermore, a breach of those financial and other covenants will also restrict our ability to pay dividends. Any of those events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. 22 Table of Contents Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We require a significant amount of cash to meet our capital requirements and fund our operations, including payments to suppliers for PV modules and balance-of-system components and to contractors for design, engineering, procurement and construction services. We believe our substantial indebtedness will increase as we continue to develop our IPP business. As of December 31, 2015, we had US$13.4 million in outstanding short-term borrowings (including the current portion of long-term bank borrowings) and US$84.7 million in outstanding long-term bank borrowings (excluding the current portion). Our debt could have significant consequences on our operations, including: · reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes as a result of our debt service obligations; · limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; · limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to economic downturns; · increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and · potentially increasing the cost of any additional financing. Any of these factors and other consequences that may result from our substantial indebtedness could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations as well as our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt. Our ability to meet our payment obligations under our outstanding debt depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. Our IPP business requires significant financial resources. If we do not successfully execute our financing plan, we may have to sell certain of our IPP solar parks or risk not being able to continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2013 and 2014, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by US$7.8 million and US$5.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by US$6.8 million. In addition, in 2013, we incurred negative cash flow from operations of US$28.6 million and incurred net loss of US$53.9 million. In 2014, we had positive cash flow from operations of US$38.8 million, but incurred a net loss of US$73.7 million. In 2015, we had positive cash flow from operations of US$3.8 million, and incurred a net loss of US$1.6 million. Our principal sources of liquidity to date have been cash from our operations, borrowings from banks and our shareholders, financing from our partners, and proceeds from our initial public offering. We leverage bank facilities in certain countries in order to meet working capital requirements for construction activities. Our principal uses of cash have been for pipeline development, working capital and general corporate purposes. 23 Table of Contents In light of our net current assets and cash flow conditions, and our capital expenditure commitment of US$20.1 million in the next twelve months, we may risk not being able to continue as a going concern. Our management reviews our forecasted cash flows on an on-going basis to ensure that we will have sufficient capital from a combination of internally generated cash flows and proceeds from financing activities, if required, in order to fund our working capital and capital expenditures. We have historically been able to effectively manage our business with a working capital deficit based on our arrangements with suppliers who typically do not require payment until such time as IPP solar parks are completed, at which point we are able to either sell the parks, or obtain collateralized financing. In addition, we have taken actions in order to increase our working capital. For example, we entered into strategic partnership with Hudson in September 2015, pursuant to which Hudson committed to invest US$50 million by way of convertible notes to fund our construction of certain solar projects. Based on the above factors, we believe that adequate sources of liquidity will exist to fund our working capital and capital expenditures, and to meet our short term debt obligations, other liabilities and commitments as they become due. We cannot assure you that we will successfully execute our financing plan. If we do not successfully execute this plan, we may not be able to continue as a going concern. Such failure could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. If we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may be unable to accurately report our results of operations or prevent fraud or fail to meet our reporting obligations and investor confidence and the market price of our ADSs may be materially and adversely affected. As a public company in the United States, we are subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires that we include a report of management on our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on Form 20-F beginning with our annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015. See Item 15. Controls and Procedures. In connection with the preparation and external audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, we and our independent public accounting firm identified two material weaknesses and other control deficiencies, each as defined in Standard AU Section 325, or AU325, as published by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB, in our internal control over financial reporting. As defined in AU325, a material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses identified related to, among other deficiencies, (i) insufficient accounting resources and process including implementation of policies and procedures necessary to comply with reporting and compliance requirements of IFRS and the SEC, and (ii) lack of sufficient written policies and proper procedures in relation to certain internal control over financial reporting as well as the financial closing and reporting procedures at certain overseas components. Our independent registered public accounting firm did not undertake a comprehensive assessment of our internal control for purposes of identifying and reporting material weaknesses and other control deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. In light of the material weaknesses and other control deficiencies, we believe it is possible that, had our independent registered public accounting firm performed an audit of our internal control over financial reporting, additional control deficiencies may have been identified. We have begun and plan to continue to take various measures to remediate the material weaknesses and other deficiencies identified. However, these measures may not fully address the material weaknesses and other control deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that we have identified or may identify in the future. In addition, once we cease to be an emerging growth company as such term is defined in the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will need to attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our management may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. Moreover, even if our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm, after conducting its own independent testing, may issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied with our internal controls or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us. In addition, our reporting obligations may place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future. We may be unable to timely complete our evaluation testing and any required remediation. 24 Table of Contents Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and our failure to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could in turn limit our access to capital markets, harm our results of operations and lead to a decline in the trading price of our ADSs. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from the stock exchange on which we list, regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanctions. We may also be required to restate our financial statements from prior periods. We may become involved in costly and time-consuming litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which require significant attention from our management. Although we are not involved in any significant litigation, administrative or arbitral proceedings, we may, in the ordinary course of our business, become involved in such proceedings. Claims may be brought against or by us from time to time regarding, for example, defective or incomplete work, defective products, personal injuries or deaths, damage to or destruction of property, breach of warranty, late completion of work, delayed payments, intellectual property rights or regulatory compliance, and may subject us to litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings, which may be expensive, lengthy, disruptive to normal business operations and require significant attention from our management. If we were found to be liable on any of claims made against us, we would incur a charge against earnings to the extent that a reserve had not been established for coverage. If amounts ultimately realized from the claims by us were materially lower than the balances included in our financial statements, we would incur a charge against earnings to the extent profit had already been accrued. Charges and write-downs associated with such legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Moreover, legal proceedings, particularly those resulting in judgments or findings against us, may harm our reputation and competitiveness in the market. We face uncertainties with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises by their non-PRC holding companies. The State Administration of Taxation has promulgated several rules and notices to tighten the scrutiny over acquisition transactions in recent years, including the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Enterprise Income Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises in 2009 with retroactive effect from January 1, 2008, or SAT Circular 698, the Notice on Several Issues Regarding the Income Tax of Non-PRC Resident Enterprises in 2011, or SAT Circular 24, and the Notice on Certain Corporate Income Tax Matters on Indirect Transfer of Properties by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises in February 2015, or SAT Circular 7. Pursuant to these rules and notices, if a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers its equity interests in a PRC tax resident enterprise, such non-PRC resident transferor must report to the tax authorities at the place where the PRC tax resident enterprise is located and is subject to a PRC withholding tax of up to 10%. In addition, if a non-PRC resident enterprise indirectly transfers so-called PRC Taxable Properties, referring to properties of an establishment or a place of business in China, real estate properties in China and equity investments in a PRC tax resident enterprise, by disposition of the equity interests in an overseas non-public holding company without a reasonable commercial purpose and resulting in the avoidance of PRC enterprise income tax, the transfer will be re-characterized as a direct transfer of the PRC Taxable Properties and gains derived from the transfer may be subject to a PRC withholding tax of up to 10%. SAT Circular 7 has listed several factors to be taken into consideration by the tax authorities in determining if an indirect transfer has a reasonable commercial purpose. However, regardless of these factors, an indirect transfer satisfying all the following criteria will be deemed to lack a reasonable commercial purpose and be taxable in the PRC: (i) 75% or more of the equity value of the intermediary enterprise being transferred is derived directly or indirectly from PRC Taxable Properties; (ii) at any time during the one year period before the indirect transfer, 90% or more of the asset value of the intermediary enterprise (excluding cash) is comprised directly or indirectly of investments in the PRC, or 90% or more of its income is derived directly or indirectly from the PRC; (iii) the functions performed and risks assumed by the intermediary enterprise and any of its subsidiaries that directly or indirectly hold the PRC Taxable Properties are limited and are insufficient to prove their economic substance; and (iv) the foreign tax payable on the gain derived from the indirect transfer of the PRC Taxable Properties is lower than the potential PRC tax on the direct transfer of those assets. On the other hand, indirect transfers falling into the scope of the safe harbors under SAT Circular 7 may not be subject to PRC tax. The safe harbors include qualified group restructurings, public market trades and exemptions under tax treaties. 25 Table of Contents Under SAT Circular 7 and other PRC tax regulations, in the case of an indirect transfer, entities or individuals obligated to pay the transfer price to the transferor must act as withholding agents and are required to withhold the PRC tax from the transfer price. If they fail to do so, the seller is required to report and pay the PRC tax to the PRC tax authorities. If neither party complies with the tax payment or withholding obligations under SAT Circular 7, the tax authority may impose penalties such as late payment interest on the seller. In addition, the tax authority may also hold the withholding agents liable and impose a penalty of 50% to 300% of the unpaid tax on them. The penalty imposed on the purchasers may be reduced or waived if the withholding agents have submitted the relevant materials in connection with the indirect transfer to the PRC tax authorities in accordance with SAT Circular 7. Accordingly, one of our affiliates established in the PRC, Tany International (Baoding) Solar Electric Co., Ltd., or Tany Baoding, is a PRC resident enterprise and one of our subsidiaries established in Hong Kong, Sky International Enterprise Group Limited, or Sky International Enterprise, may be deemed as a non-PRC resident enterprise under SAT Circular 7 and other PRC tax regulations. Sky International Enterprise disposed of 100% of the equity interests in Tany International (Hong Kong) Co Limited, or Tany Hong Kong, which holds 100% of the equity interests in Tany Baoding, to Sky Solar (Hong Kong) International Co. Limited on May 28, 2013. This disposal may be categorized as an Indirect Transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise by a non-PRC resident enterprise as defined under SAT Circular 7 and other PRC tax regulations. Therefore, Tany Baoding may be liable to assist tax authorities in collecting such tax from Sky International Enterprise if the transfer of equity interests in Tany Hong Kong is subject to SAT Circular 7 and other PRC tax regulations, in which case, Sky International Enterprise would incur tax obligations when the relevant equity transfer contract took effect and the transfer was completed. However, it currently unclear how the relevant PRC tax authority will implement or enforce SAT Circular 7 and other PRC tax regulations and whether the enterprise income tax on capital gains will be subject to any further change resulting in any adverse impact on us. Our global income may become subject to PRC income tax if we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes and our non-PRC shareholders may be subject to PRC tax on dividends and gain realized on our shares. In connection with the EIT Law which came into effect on January 1, 2008, the Implementing Rules of the EIT Law, or the Implementing Rules, were enacted on December 6, 2007 and became effective on January 1, 2008. Under the EIT Law and the Implementing Rules, an enterprise established outside the PRC may be considered a PRC resident enterprise and be subject to PRC enterprise income tax on its global income at the rate of 25%, if its de facto management body is located within the PRC. The Implementing Rules define the term de facto management body as the body that exercises full and substantial control and overall management over the business, production processes, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise incorporated outside the PRC. At present, it is unclear how the foregoing factors will be applied by the PRC tax authorities to determine whether we have a de facto management body in the PRC. Since some of our management personnel currently reside in the PRC but the majority of our turnover arises from our operations outside the PRC, there is a possibility that the PRC tax authorities could determine that we are a PRC resident enterprise, which would make us subject to PRC tax on our worldwide income at a rate of 25%. Moreover, the risk that we will be found to be a PRC resident enterprise will increase as we execute our strategic entry into the Chinese market. This may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. However, our PRC legal counsel does not believe that we or any of our subsidiaries outside of China meet all of the conditions necessary to be considered a PRC resident enterprise based on their review of surrounding facts and circumstances. In addition, if we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise under PRC law, dividends we pay on our ADSs to non-PRC ADS holders or on our ordinary shares to non-PRC shareholders, and capital gains realized by such ADS holders or shareholders on the sale or other disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares, may be treated as PRC-source income. Accordingly, we may be required to withhold PRC income tax from dividends paid to non-PRC resident ADS holders or shareholders, and the transfer of ADSs or ordinary shares by such ADS holders or shareholders, as the case may be, may be subject to PRC income tax. Such tax on the income of non-PRC resident enterprise ADS holders or shareholders may be imposed at a rate of 10% (and may be imposed at a rate of 20% in the case of non-PRC resident individual ADS holders or shareholders), subject to the provisions of any applicable tax treaty. If we are required to withhold PRC income tax on dividends payable to our non-PRC resident ADS holders or shareholders, or if you are required to pay PRC income tax on the transfer of the ADSs, or ordinary shares, the value of your investment in our ADSs, or ordinary shares, may be materially and adversely affected. 26 Table of Contents We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, including trademarks and know-how, which could harm our competitiveness. We rely on a combination of trademarks and know-how to protect our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2015, we have two licenses granting us the right to use 30 trademarks in 23 jurisdictions, including the brand name Sky Solar, which we believe have been vital to our competitiveness and success and for us to attract and retain our clients and business partners. We license the brand name Sky Solar from our chairman and chief executive officer, Mr. Su. See We rely on licensing arrangements with entities controlled by our chairman and chief executive officer, Mr. Weili Su, to use the trademark Sky Solar. Any improper use of these trademarks by our licensor or any other third parties could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken will be sufficient to prevent any misappropriation of our intellectual property. Intellectual property laws and means of enforcement of intellectual property laws vary by jurisdiction. Enforcement of our intellectual property rights could be time-consuming and costly. We may not be able to immediately detect and remediate unauthorized use of our intellectual property. In the event that the measures taken by us or the protection afforded by law do not adequately safeguard our intellectual property rights, we could suffer losses in revenue and profit due to competing offerings of services that exploit our intellectual properties. Furthermore, we cannot assure that any of our intellectual property rights will not be challenged by third parties. Adverse rulings in any litigation or proceedings could result in the loss of our proprietary rights and subject us to substantial liabilities, or even disrupt our business operations. We rely on licensing arrangements with entities controlled by our chairman and chief executive officer, Mr. Weili Su, to use the trademark Sky Solar. Any improper use of these trademarks by our licensor or any other third parties could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our rights to our trade names and trademarks are among the most important factor in marketing our services and operating our business. The trademark Sky Solar, or 天华阳光 in Chinese, is owned by an entity controlled by Mr. Su, our founder, chairman of our board of directors and chief executive officer, and we have obtained, under a license agreement, the non-exclusive right to use this trademark so long as the trademark is valid. Our license authorizes the use of the trademark in jurisdictions such as the United States, Chile, Japan, Greece, Bulgaria, South Africa, and Hong Kong, but we are not licensed to use the trademark in China. Under the trademark license agreement, we are required to pay 0.05% of our revenue, not exceeding HK$10 million, to this entity for the trademark license starting from 2014 at the end of each year. The trademark Sky Solar, or 天华阳光 is also used by the entity, its subsidiaries and affiliated entities, which are controlled by Mr. Su. If the entity, any of its subsidiaries or affiliated entities, or any third party uses the trade name Sky Solar, 天华阳光 or trademarks we use to develop our services and operations in ways that adversely affect such trade name or trademark, our reputation could suffer damage, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if for any reason we are no longer able to use the Sky Solar and 天华阳光 trademarks due to a dispute with the entity, or otherwise, our reputation, marketing ability, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively affect our revenue, cost of sales and gross margins and could result in exchange losses. Our subsidiaries trade in their functional currencies in the course of their business operations. Our investment holding companies transact in functional currencies of their subsidiaries. Our investment holding companies have foreign financing and investing activities, which expose them to foreign currency risk. As a result, we are subject to significant risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. For example, in 2013, 2014 and 2015, we recorded net foreign exchange losses of US$4.1 million and US$7.4 million, respectively, primarily due to the increase in depreciation of the Euro against the U.S. dollar. We recorded net foreign exchange gain of US$0.4 million in 2015. Changes in the value of local currencies could increase our U.S. dollar costs or reduce our U.S. dollar revenue. Any increased costs or reduced revenue as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our profit margins. The fluctuation of foreign exchange rates also affects the value of our monetary and other assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies, primarily the Euro, JPY and CAD. Generally, an appreciation of the U.S. dollar against relevant local currencies could result in a foreign exchange loss for assets denominated in such local currencies and a foreign exchange gain for liabilities denominated in such local currencies. Conversely, a devaluation of the U.S. dollar against relevant local currencies could result in a foreign exchange gain for assets denominated in such local currencies and a foreign exchange loss for liabilities denominated in such local currencies. 27 Table of Contents We could also expand our business into emerging markets, some of which may have an uncertain regulatory environment relating to currency policy. Conducting business in such emerging markets could cause our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuation risks to increase. Although we access a variety of financing solutions that are tailored to the geographic location of our projects and to local regulations, we have not entered into any hedging transactions to reduce the foreign exchange rate fluctuation risks, but may do so in the future when we deem it appropriate in light of the significance of such risks. However, if we decide to hedge our foreign exchange exposure in the future, we cannot assure you that we will be able to reduce our foreign currency risk exposure in an effective manner, at reasonable costs, or at all. Our auditor, like other independent registered public accounting firms operating in China, is not permitted to be subject to inspection by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and as such, investors may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection. Our independent registered public accounting firm issued the audit report included in this annual report and will issue audit reports filed with the SEC in the future. Generally, an auditor of companies that are traded publicly in the United States is registered with the PCAOB and is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by PCAOB to assess its compliance with the laws of the United States and professional standards. However, as our auditor is located in China, a jurisdiction where PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the PRC authorities, our auditor, like other independent registered public accounting firms operating in China, is currently not inspected by PCAOB. Inspections of other firms outside of China conducted by PCAOB have identified deficiencies in those firms audit procedures and quality control procedures. The inability of PCAOB to conduct inspections of independent registered public accounting firms operating in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditors audit procedures or quality control procedures. As a result, investors may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB inspections. If the SEC imposes additional remedial measures on the Big Four PRC-based accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm, in administrative proceedings brought by the SEC alleging the firms failure to meet specific criteria set by the SEC with respect to questions for the production of documents we may not be able to file future financial statements promptly in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act. Starting in 2011 the Chinese affiliates of the big four accounting firms, (including our independent registered public accounting firm) were affected by a conflict between US and Chinese law. Specifically, for certain US-listed companies operating and audited in mainland China, the SEC and the PCAOB sought to obtain from the Chinese firms access to their audit work papers and related documents. The firms were, however, advised and directed that under China law they could not respond directly to the US regulators on those requests, and that requests by foreign regulators for access to such papers in China had to be channeled through the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC. In late 2012, this impasse led the SEC to commence administrative proceedings under Rule 102(e) of its Rules of Practice and also under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act against the Chinese accounting firms, (including our independent registered public accounting firm). A first instance trial of the proceedings in July 2013 in the SECs internal administrative court resulted in an adverse judgment against the firms. The administrative law judge proposed penalties on the firms including a temporary suspension of their right to practice before the SEC, although that proposed penalty was subject to the pending review of the SEC Commissioner. On February 6, 2015, prior to the SEC Commissioners scheduled review, the firms reached a settlement with the SEC. Under the settlement, the SEC agreed that its future requests for the production of documents would normally be made to the CSRC. The firms would receive matching requests under Section 106 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and are required to abide by a detailed set of procedures with respect to such requests, which in substance required them to facilitate production via the CSRC. If they fail to meet the specified criteria, the SEC retains the authority to impose a variety of additional remedial measures on the firms depending on the nature of the failure. Remedies for any future noncompliance could include, as appropriate, an automatic six-month bar on a single firms performance of certain audit work, commencement of a new proceeding against the firm, or in extreme cases, the resumption of the current proceeding against all four big four accounting firms. 28 Table of Contents In the event that the SEC restarts the administrative proceedings, depending upon the final outcome, listed companies in the United States with major PRC operations may find it difficult or impossible to retain auditors with respect to their operations in the PRC, which could result in financial statements being found noncompliant with the requirements of the Exchange Act, possibly resulting in delisting. Moreover, any negative news about any such future proceedings against these audit firms may create investor uncertainty about China-based, US-listed companies and the market price of our ADSs may be adversely affected. If our independent registered public accounting firm were denied, even temporarily, the ability to practice before the SEC and we were unable to find another registered public accounting firm to audit and issue an opinion on our financial statements in a timely manner, our financial statements could be determined not to be in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act. Such a determination could ultimately lead to the delisting of our ordinary shares from the NASDAQ Capital Market or deregistration from the SEC, or both, which would substantially reduce or effectively terminate the trading of our ADSs in the United States. Our senior management, directors, principal shareholders and affiliated entities have substantial control and influence over our corporate actions and business, and their interests may not be aligned with our other shareholders. Our senior management, directors, principal shareholders and their affiliated entities beneficially own approximately 66.4% of our outstanding shares as of April 1, 2016. Our executive officers and certain shareholders have granted our chairman and chief executive officer, Mr. Weili Su, an irrevocable proxy, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, to vote on their behalf in our elections. Mr. Su has the ability to vote or the proxy to vote an aggregate of 40.3% of our outstanding shares. As a result, Mr. Su exerts substantial influence over matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including electing directors and approving mergers or other business combination transactions and he may not act in the best interests of other shareholders. Mr. Su also controls the Sky Solar and 天华阳光 trademarks licensed to us, and holds solar parks in Greece and China under the Sky Solar and 天华阳光 brand that are not part of our company. This concentration of ownership may also discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and reduce the price of our ADSs. These actions may be taken even if they are opposed by our other shareholders, including you. Without Mr. Sus and other managements consents, we could be prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us. Although Mr. Su has fiduciary obligations to our company as a director, his interests may not always be aligned with the interests of our other shareholders. Mr. Su may also take actions to prevent us from continuing to use the trademarks. We relied on our historical project affiliates to generate a portion of our revenue and we obtained financing from our affiliated entities controlled by Mr. Su. A portion of our total revenue was derived from our historical project affiliates, which we formed for solar park co-investment. For example, our largest client during 2013, ChaoriSky Solar, our then-affiliate which we formed with a module manufacturer and in which we had held a 30% equity interest until November 2013, accounted for 9.2% of our total revenue in 2013. OKY Solar Holdings and its subsidiaries, in which we hold 30% through Sky Solar Japan accounted for 8.7% of our total revenue in 2015. In addition, we obtained financing from our affiliated entities controlled by our chairman and chief executive officer, Mr. Su, for corporate and working capital purposes. See Item 4. Information on the CompanyB. Business OverviewOur Historical Project Affiliates and Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party TransactionsB. Related Party Transactions. 29 Table of Contents As of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, we had amounts due from related parties of US$37.8 million, US$15.2 million and US$17.8 million respectively. While we have become less dependent on our affiliates, as we continue to transition to more of an IPP business model we may continue to leverage the financial resources and/or project development expertise of our affiliates and/or their other equity owners. The financial health, creditworthiness and business performance of our affiliates may therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our transactions with our historical project affiliates may not be on an arms length basis. We have historically leveraged our historical project affiliates as vehicles to expand our business overseas through delivering our permit development capabilities, EPC services and O&M services to them. We have entered, and expect to continue to enter, into various transactions including sale of primary development rights and provision of EPC services with these affiliates, which have contributed to a significant portion of our revenue. See Item 4. Information on the CompanyB. Business OverviewOur Historical Project Affiliates. These affiliates were formed with the intention that our affiliates other equity owners who are module manufacturers, such as Chaori and Risen, provide their modules to such affiliates and that we provide our permits and EPC services to the affiliate. In these transactions going forward, there can be no assurance that independent parties negotiating at arms length would have arrived at the same terms. Since we hold substantial interest in these affiliates and therefore have significant influence over these affiliates, there is a risk that any decisions or actions taken by either our affiliates or us in these transactions (including with respect to pricing, amendments, disputes or enforcement proceedings) may not be the same if we operated on an arms length basis. We have limited business insurance coverage internationally. The insurance industry in many parts of the world is still in an early stage of development. Insurance companies in many countries offer only limited business insurance options. As a result, we have not maintained, and generally do not maintain, full liability, hazard or other insurance covering our services, business, operations, errors, acts or omissions, personnel or properties. To the extent that we are unable to recover from others for any uninsured losses, such losses could result in a loss of capital and significant harm to our business. If any action, suit, or proceeding is brought against us and we are unable to pay a judgment rendered against us or defend ourselves against such action, suit, or proceeding, our business, financial condition and operations could be negatively affected. Risks Related to Our ADSs and Our Trading Markets The trading prices of our ADSs may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to investors. The market price for our ADSs has fluctuated significantly since we first listed our ADSs in November 13, 2014 with closing prices ranging from US$14.00 to US$1.12 per ADS as of April 29, 2016. The price and trading volume of our ADSs may become highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations due to factors beyond our control. This may happen because of broad market and industry factors. For example, the prices of some foreign companies securities, including companies in the solar industry, have experienced significant volatility in recent years. Furthermore, as a result of the narrow band of ADS shares publicly available for trading, small trades can cause significant percentage changes in valuation in a short time period. Such volatility may affect the attitude of investors towards our securities, which consequently may impact the trading performance of our ADSs, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, any negative news or perceptions about inadequate corporate governance practices or fraudulent accounting or other practices at other foreign companies may also negatively affect the attitudes of investors towards foreign companies in general, including us, regardless of whether we have engaged in such practices. In addition, securities markets may from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to our operating performance, such as the recent global economic crisis or other macroeconomic events, which may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our ADSs. In addition to market factors, the price and trading volume for our ADSs may be highly volatile for factors specific to our own operations and the solar industry, including the following: 30 Table of Contents · actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial results and operating metrics; · changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts; · announcements of new investments, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or affiliates; · announcements of new services and expansions by us or our competitors; · additions or departures of key personnel; · release of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding equity securities, which could result in downward price pressure on our ADSs and increase the number of ADSs traded in the market; · sales of additional securities; · changes in policies and developments relating to the solar industry; · the valuation of publicly traded companies that are engaged in business activities similar to ours; · news regarding recruitment or loss of key personnel by us or our competitors; and · potential litigation or regulatory investigations. Any of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and price at which our ADSs trade. Furthermore, the securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also have a material adverse effect on the market price of our ADSs. Because we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, you must rely on price appreciation of our ADSs for return on your investment. We currently intend to retain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Therefore, you should not rely on an investment in our ADSs as a source for any future dividend income. Our board of directors has complete discretion as to whether to distribute dividends. Even if our board of directors decides to declare and pay dividends, the timing, amount and form of future dividends, if any, will depend on, among other things, our future results of operations and cash flow, our capital requirements and surplus, the amount of distributions, if any, received by us from our subsidiary, our financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Accordingly, the return on your investment in our ADSs will likely depend entirely upon any future price appreciation of our ADSs. There is no guarantee that our ADSs will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which you purchased the ADSs. You may not realize a return on your investment in our ADSs and you may even lose your entire investment in our ADSs. You may not receive dividends or other distributions on our ordinary shares and you may not receive any value for them, if it is illegal or impractical to make them available to you. The depositary of our ADSs has agreed to pay to you the cash dividends or other distributions it or the custodian receives on ordinary shares or other deposited securities underlying our ADSs, after deducting its fees and expenses. You will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of ordinary shares your ADSs represent. However, the depositary is not responsible if it decides that it is unlawful or impractical to make a distribution available to any holders of ADSs. For example, it would be unlawful to make a distribution to a holder of ADSs if it consists of securities that require registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, but that are not properly registered or distributed under an applicable exemption from registration. The depositary may also determine that it is not feasible to distribute certain property through the mail. Additionally, the value of certain distributions may be less than the cost of mailing them. In these cases, the depositary may determine not to distribute such property. We have no obligation to register under U.S. securities laws any ADSs, ordinary shares, rights or other securities in connection with such distributions. We also have no obligation to take any other action to permit the distribution of ADSs, ordinary shares, rights or anything else to holders of ADSs. This means that you may not receive distributions we make on our ordinary shares or any value for them if it is illegal or impractical for us to make them available to you. These restrictions may cause a material decline in the value of our ADSs. 31 Table of Contents Substantial future sales or perceived sales of our ADSs in the public market could cause the price of our ADSs to decline. Sales of substantial amount of our ADSs or ordinary shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our ADSs to decline. We currently have 390,026,670 ordinary shares outstanding, of which 6,353,750 were sold as ADSs in our initial public offering. All of our ADSs sold in the offering are freely transferable without restriction or additional registration under the Securities Act. The remaining ordinary shares outstanding are available for sale subject to volume and other restrictions as applicable under Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act. As of April 1, 2016, 157,688,960 of these remaining ordinary shares had been converted into ADSs. In addition, we may also issue additional options in the future which may be exercised for additional ordinary shares. We cannot predict what effect, if any, market sales of securities held by our significant shareholders or any other shareholder or the availability of these securities for future sale will have on the market price of our ADSs. Our articles of association contain anti-takeover provisions that could have a material and adverse effect on the rights of holders of our ordinary shares and ADSs. Our articles of association limit the ability of others to acquire control of our company or cause us to engage in change-of-control transactions. These provisions could have the effect of depriving our shareholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices by discouraging third parties from seeking to obtain control of our company in a tender offer or similar transaction. For example, our board of directors has the authority, without further action by our shareholders, to issue preferred shares in one or more series and to fix their designations, powers, preferences, privileges and relative participating, optional or special rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption and liquidation preferences, any or all of which may be greater than the rights associated with our ordinary shares, in the form of ADS or otherwise. Preferred shares could be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult. If our board of directors decides to issue preferred shares, the price of our ADSs may fall and the voting and other rights of the holders of our ordinary shares and ADSs may be materially and adversely affected. Holders of ADSs have fewer rights than shareholders and must act through the depositary to exercise those rights. Holders of ADSs do not have the same rights as our shareholders and may only exercise the voting rights with respect to the underlying ordinary shares in accordance with the provisions of the deposit agreement. Under our amended and restated articles of association, the minimum notice period required to convene a general meeting is ten days. When a general meeting is convened, you may not receive sufficient notice of a shareholders meeting to permit you to withdraw your ordinary shares to allow you to cast your vote with respect to any specific matter. In addition, the depositary and its agents may not be able to send voting instructions to you or carry out your voting instructions in a timely manner. We will make all reasonable efforts to cause the depositary to extend voting rights to you in a timely manner, but you may not receive the voting materials in time to ensure that you can instruct the depositary to vote the ordinary underlying your ADSs. Furthermore, the depositary and its agents will not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instructions to vote, for the manner in which any vote is cast or for the effect of any such vote. As a result, you may not be able to exercise your right to vote and you may lack recourse if the underlying ordinary shares of your ADSs are not voted as you requested. In addition, in your capacity as an ADS holder, you will not be able to call a shareholders meeting. 32 Table of Contents The depositary for our ADSs may give us a discretionary proxy to vote the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs if you do not vote at shareholders meetings, which could adversely affect your interests. Under the deposit agreement for our ADSs, if we asked for your voting instructions but the depositary does not receive your instructions by the cut-off date specified in the related notice, the depositary will give us a discretionary proxy to vote the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs as to all matters at the shareholders meeting unless: · we have failed to timely provide the depositary with notice of meeting and related voting materials; · we have instructed the depositary that we do not wish a discretionary proxy to be given; · we have informed the depositary that there is substantial opposition as to a matter to be voted on at the meeting; · a matter to be voted on at the meeting would have a material adverse impact on shareholders; or · the voting at the meeting is to be made on a show of hands. The effect of this discretionary proxy is that if you do not vote at shareholders meetings, you cannot prevent the ordinary shares underlying your ADSs from being voted, except under the circumstances described above. This may make it more difficult for shareholders to influence the management of our company. Holders of our ordinary shares are not subject to this discretionary proxy. You may be subject to limitations on transfers of your ADSs. Your ADSs are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary may close its transfer books at any time or from time to time when it deems expedient in connection with the performance of its duties. In addition, the depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of ADSs generally when our books or the books of the depositary are closed, or at any time if we or the depositary deem it advisable to do so because of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body, or under any provision of the deposit agreement, or for any other reason. You may face difficulties in protecting your interests and your ability to protect your rights through the U.S. federal courts may be limited. We are an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Most of our business operations are located outside the United States. A substantial majority of our directors and a substantial majority of our senior management team are residing outside of the United States, and a substantial portion of their assets are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an original action against us or against these individuals in a U.S. court in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under the U.S. federal securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the Cayman Islands, China and many other jurisdictions where we have operations may render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers located in those jurisdictions. There is no statutory recognition in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, and there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the Cayman Islands would (1) recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States, or (2) entertain original actions brought in the Cayman Islands against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States. The uncertainty with regard to Cayman Islands law relates to whether a judgment obtained from the U.S. courts under civil liability provisions of the securities law will be determined by the courts of the Cayman Islands as penal or punitive in nature. The courts of the Cayman Islands may not recognize or enforce such judgments against a Cayman company, and because such a determination has not yet been made by a court of the Cayman Islands, it is uncertain whether such civil liability judgments from U.S. courts would be enforceable in the Cayman Islands. Further, the courts of the Cayman Islands would recognize a final and conclusive judgment in the federal or state courts of the United States under which a sum of money is payable (other than a sum of money payable in respect of multiple damages, taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty) or, in certain circumstances, an in personam judgment for non-monetary relief, and would give a judgment based thereon provided that and would give a judgment based thereon provided that (a) such courts had proper jurisdiction over the parties subject to such judgment; (b) such courts did not contravene the rules of natural justice of the Cayman Islands; (c) such judgment was not obtained by fraud; (d) the enforcement of the judgment would not be contrary to the public policy of the Cayman Islands; (e) no new admissible evidence relevant to the action is submitted prior to the rendering of the judgment by the courts of the Cayman Islands; and (f) there is due compliance with the correct procedures under the laws of the Cayman Islands. 33 Table of Contents In addition, China does not have any treaties or other agreements that provide for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments with the United States Our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association and by the Companies Law (2013 Revision) and common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take legal action against our directors and us, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands have a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and provide significantly less protection to investors. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action before the federal courts of the United States. As a result, your ability to protect your interests if you are harmed in a manner that would otherwise enable you to sue in a United States federal court may be limited to direct shareholder lawsuits. Shareholders of Cayman Islands exempted companies such as ourselves have no general rights under Cayman Islands law to inspect corporate records and accounts or to obtain copies of lists of shareholders of these companies. Our directors have discretion under our amended and restated articles of association to determine whether or not, and under what conditions, our corporate records may be inspected by our shareholders, but are not obliged to make them available to our shareholders. This may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest. As a result of all of the above, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management, directors or major shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States. We rely on the foreign private issuer exemption from most of the corporate governance requirements under the NASDAQ Stock Market Rules. We are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ by virtue of being a foreign private issuer. We are required to provide a brief description of the significant differences between our corporate governance practices and the corporate governance practices required to be followed by U.S. domestic companies under the NASDAQ Stock Market Rules. The standards applicable to us are considerably different than the standards applied to U.S. domestic issuers. The significantly different standards applicable to us do not require us to: · have a majority of the board be independent; · have independent directors involved in the selection of director nominees, by having a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors or by having director nominees selected or recommended by a majority of independent directors meeting in executive session; · have independent directors involved in the determination of executive compensation, by having a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors or by submitting such matters for approval or recommendation by a majority of independent directors meeting in executive session; · have a minimum of two members on our compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; and · have a minimum of three members on our audit committee that is composed entirely of independent directors. 34 Table of Contents We are not required to and will not voluntarily meet these requirements. As a result of our use of the foreign private issuer exemptions, you will not have the same protection afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of NASDAQs corporate governance requirements. For a description of the material corporate governance differences between NASDAQ requirements and Cayman Islands law, see Item 16G. Corporate Governance. We have incurred increased costs as a result of becoming a public company, and our compliance costs may continue to increase in the future, particularly when we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company. As a public company, we have incurred significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not have as a private company prior to our initial public offering. When we cease to be an emerging growth company upon, at the latest, the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, we expect to incur additional significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act and the other rules and regulations of the SEC. In addition, new rules and regulations relating to information disclosure, financial reporting and control and corporate governance, which could be adopted by the SEC, NASDAQ and other regulatory bodies and exchange entities from time to time, could result in a significant increase in legal, accounting and other compliance costs and to make certain corporate activities more time-consuming and costly, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are a foreign private issuer, and our disclosure obligations differ from those of U.S. domestic reporting companies. As a result, we may not provide you the same information as U.S. domestic reporting companies or we may provide information at different times, which may make it more difficult for you to evaluate our performance and prospects. We are a foreign private issuer and, as a result, we are not subject to the same requirements as U.S. domestic issuers. Under the Exchange Act, we are subject to reporting obligations that, to some extent, are more lenient and less frequent than those of U.S. domestic reporting companies. For example, we are not required to issue proxy statements. We are not required to disclose detailed individual executive compensation information. Furthermore, our directors and executive officers are not required to report equity holdings under Section 16 of the Exchange Act and are not subject to the insider short-swing profit disclosure and recovery regime. Although we are not required to issue quarterly reports, we furnish our interim financial information on Form 6-K and publish our results on a quarterly basis as press releases, distributed pursuant to the rules and regulations of NASDAQ. As a foreign private issuer, we are also exempt from the requirements of Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure) which, generally, are meant to ensure that select groups of investors are not privy to specific information about an issuer before other investors. However, we are still subject to the anti-fraud and anti-manipulation rules of the SEC, such as Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act. Since many of the disclosure obligations imposed on us as a foreign private issuer differ from those imposed on U.S. domestic reporting companies, you should not expect to receive the same information about us and at the same time as the information provided by U.S. domestic reporting companies. We are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies make our ADSs less attractive to investors. We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for up to five fiscal years after the date of our initial public offering. Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to and report on the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. 35 Table of Contents We will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which we have gross revenues of $1 billion or more, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the previous three-year period, or (iv) when we become a large accelerated filer, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. We may issue additional ordinary shares, other equity or equity-linked or debt securities, which may materially and adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares or ADSs. Hedging activities may depress the trading price of our ordinary shares. We may issue additional equity, equity-linked or debt securities for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy (including in connection with acquisitions, strategic collaborations or other transactions), to satisfy our obligations for the repayment of existing indebtedness, to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options or for other reasons. Any future issuances of equity securities or equity-linked securities could substantially dilute your interests and may materially and adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares or ADSs. We cannot predict the timing or size of any future issuances or sales of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, or the effect, if any, that such issuances or sales may have on the market price of our ordinary shares or ADSs. Market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future. Your right to participate in any future rights offerings may be limited, which may cause dilution to your holdings. We may from time to time distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire our securities. However, we cannot make these rights available in the United States unless we register the rights and the securities to which the rights relate under the Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements is available. We are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or securities or to endeavor to cause a registration statement to be declared effective. Moreover, we may not be able to establish an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Accordingly, you may be unable to participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution in your holdings. We may be or become a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. investors in our ADSs or ordinary shares. A non-U.S. corporation will be a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for any taxable year in which (1) at least 75% of its gross income is passive income or (2) at least 50% of the value (based on an average of quarterly values) of its assets is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income. If we are classified as a PFIC, our ADSs or ordinary shares will continue to be treated as shares in a PFIC for all succeeding years during which a U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or ordinary shares, unless we cease to be a PFIC and the U.S. Holder makes certain elections with respect to the ADSs or ordinary shares. We believe that we were not a passive foreign investment company, or a PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes for our taxable year ended December 31, 2015. Based on the current and projected composition of our income and valuation of our assets, including goodwill, we do not currently anticipate becoming a PFIC for our current taxable year. However, our PFIC status will depend upon the composition of our income and assets from time to time, including the value of our ADSs at any such time. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will not be a PFIC for our current taxable year or any future taxable year. If we were treated as a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder (as defined in Item 10. Additional InformationE. TaxationUnited States Federal Income Taxation) holds our ADSs or ordinary shares, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences and additional reporting requirements could apply to that U.S. Holder. You are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding our possible status as a PFIC. See Item 10. Additional InformationE. TaxationUnited States Federal Income TaxationPassive Foreign Investment Company. 36 Table of Contents
