ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following are risks related to our business: OUR OPERATING RESULTS HAVE VARIED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO VARY. WE RECOGNIZED LOSSES FOR THE PAST THREE FISCAL YEARS. We incurred losses of approximately $2.2 million for fiscal 2008, $1.5 million for fiscal 2007, and approximately $1 million for fiscal 2006. Our net losses may continue and our ability to sustain profitability will be impacted by: o the short-term nature of client's commitments because of shorter-term projects rather than long-term contracts o patterns of capital spending by clients, as the industry continues to experience a sluggish IT spending environment o general economic conditions o pricing changes in response to competitive factors, often driving prices and profit margins down o our revenues may not increase or remain at current levels o our ability to access sufficient working capital and/or vendor credit to fund sales and operating activities o timing and customer acceptance of new product and service offerings o trends in IT outsourcing, as clients reduce the number of vendors o the availability and related costs of attracting and retaining qualified sales and technical personnel FAILURE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN THE MARKETPLACE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATION AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. We operate in an intensely competitive industry. We compete with small boutique IT firms as well as large, global companies, including manufacturers who now compete against us to sell directly to the customer. Although we feel we offer our clients a wide range of highly sophisticated professional services in conjunction with a select product line, increased competition may create greater pressure to further reduce prices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. WE REQUIRE ACCESS TO WORKING CAPITAL AND VENDOR CREDIT TO FUND OUR DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS. We require access to working capital to fund our day-to-day operations, particularly at the end of our fiscal quarters when demand for our products and services increase. Our lines of credit contain a number of covenants regarding payments, amount and quality of our accounts receivables, and inventory levels. A breach of these covenants, unless waived, may result in termination of the arrangements or acceleration of payment due under these arrangements, which would have an adverse impact upon our financial condition. WE MUST ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED SALES AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL. We rely upon our ability to find, attract, and retain qualified sales and technical personnel. At present, there is a shortage of qualified personnel and we are in direct competition for these applicants with larger businesses to hire from this limited pool of qualified applicants. WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR REVENUE FROM A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF CLIENTS. IF WE WERE TO LOSE ONE OR MORE OF THESE CLIENTS, AND THE BUSINESS WERE NOT REPLACED, IT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. While no customer currently accounts for 10% or more of our revenues, our top ten clients account for a significant amount of our business. Although we anticipate our business to continue with 7 these clients, the loss of any large client could have an adverse impact on our Corporation's results of operations if that revenue stream was not replaced from alternative sources. WE MUST MAINTAIN AUTHORIZATIONS FROM MAJOR MANUFACTURERS TO OPERATE AS AN AUTHORIZED RESELLER AND/OR SERVICE PROVIDER TO PROVIDE THE RESPECTIVE MANUFACTURER'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. We must maintain our authorized status as an authorized reseller or authorized service provider in order to market the products of most major manufacturers. Such authorizations are conditioned upon our continued ability to meet specified requirements, usually related to technical skill levels of our personnel. Although we do not foresee any problem in maintaining our authorizations or obtaining future authorizations, without these authorizations or suitable replacements, we would not be able to offer our clients the products we currently market. WE PURCHASE PRODUCT FROM A SMALL NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS. The majority of our purchases are made from a single supplier who provides us with discounted prices. Although the product purchased from that supplier is available from other sources, if that supplier relationship were terminated, we may not be able to obtain the products at the same discounted pricing, and that may have an adverse impact on our ability to compete and our profit margins. A PORTION OF OUR REVENUE COMES FROM GOVERNMENTAL CLIENTS. A portion of our revenue is derived from contracts with state and local governments and governmental agencies. Future statutes and/or regulations, and/or changes in purchasing methods by these entities may affect future revenues and/or profitability of these contracts. THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN OUR STOCK PRICE. The market for our common stock has a limited daily trading volume, and therefore even moderate selling pressure could have a depressive effect on our stock price. Price volatility may continue. The stock price is affected by revenue, earning results, and general economic conditions.
