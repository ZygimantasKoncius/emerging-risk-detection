Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) for 10 consecutive business days on December 22, 2009. We could be late in filing future annual or quarterly SEC filings for various reasons and our closing bid price could fall below $1.00 for an extended period of time. If we do not file our annual or quarterly SEC filings within the required timeframe or allowed extension period or if our closing bid price falls below $1.00 for an extended period of time, our common shares could be delisted from trading on the NASDAQ, which could materially adversely affect the liquidity of our common shares, the price of our common shares, and our ability to raise additional capital. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
