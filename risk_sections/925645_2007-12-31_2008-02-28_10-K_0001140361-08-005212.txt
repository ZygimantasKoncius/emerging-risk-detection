GALAXIE SPORT derives its revenues principally from cable subscription fees and carries a low volume of advertising. NOVA CINEMA is a cable and satellite channel launched in December 2007. We are not currently selling any advertising on NOVA CINEMA but in addition to advertising revenue we expect it will also derive part of its revenues from subscription fees.

According to the Broadcasting Act 2001, a television broadcasting license can be extended once for an additional twelve years. The Czech Republic Media Council has granted one extension of the TV NOVA (Czech Republic) license, held by CET 21, which expires in January 2017. The Czech Republic Media Council issued a decision dated December 21, 2006 confirming that CET 21's existing analog license (No. 001/1993) is also valid for digital broadcasting and permits the company to broadcast TV NOVA (Czech Republic) throughout the entire territory of the Czech Republic in any electronic communications network designated for digital terrestrial television broadcasting. Page 16 Table of Contents An amendment of the broadcasting laws related to digital terrestrial broadcasting and the analog switch-off was approved in November 2007. Pursuant to that amendment TV NOVA (Czech Republic)'s current broadcasting license can be extended for an additional eight years (until 2025) in exchange for a pledge to switch off analog broadcasting by October 10, 2010 or at such later date as might be approved by the Czech government in accordance with its technical plan for the transition to digital (“TTP”). In the event this pledge to switch over to digital broadcasting is breached by CET 21, the extension of the license will be cancelled. At present it is expected that the analog switch-off will not occur by October 10, 2010, as the Czech Telecommunications Office and certain ministries of the Czech government are still in discussions with broadcasters and the prospective operators of the digital networks over the TTP. The GALAXIE SPORT license expires in March 2014, and the NOVA CINEMA license expires in November 2019. Ownership We own 100% of CET 21, the operating company for TV NOVA (Czech Republic) and NOVA CINEMA. CET 21 owns 100% of Galaxie Sport, the operating company for GALAXIE SPORT.

Our interest in our Romania operations is generally governed by the articles of Pro TV. We have the right to appoint two of the three members of the Council of Administration, the governing body of Pro TV. Although we have majority voting power in Pro TV, the affirmative vote of Adrian Sarbu is required with respect to certain financial and corporate matters. Such matters are in the nature of protective rights, and are not an impediment to consolidation for accounting purposes. We have a 95% voting and economic interest in Media Vision, which, together with other subsidiaries of the Media Pro group of companies, provides programming and production services to Pro TV. We increased our voting and economic interest from 75% to 95% following the sale by Media Pro Pictures SA of a 20% interest on May 16, 2007. Page 21 Table of Contents We also have a put option agreement with Adrian Sarbu that grants him the right to sell us his remaining interest in Pro TV and certain other companies of our Romania operations from November 12, 2009 for a twenty-year period thereafter.

According to our estimates, in local currency the Slovak Republic television advertising market grew by approximately 25 - 30% in 2007 and was worth approximately US$ 165 - 170 million. In the Slovak Republic, we operate one national television channel, TV MARKIZA. The other significant national broadcasters are the public broadcaster STV, which operates two channels, and privately owned broadcaster TV JOJ. License Holder Markiza holds a national terrestrial broadcast license for TV MARKIZA. Operations TV MARKIZA, launched in August 1996, reaches approximately 86% of the Slovak Republic's television households. TV MARKIZA had an average national all day audience share for 2007 of 35.4%, versus 17.7% for its nearest competitor, STV 1. In October 2004, the journal method of measuring audience share and ratings was replaced with peoplemeters (an electronic audience measurement device). The introduction of peoplemeters has resulted in lower audience share and ratings being recorded for all national broadcasters (see Part II, Item 7, “Analysis of Segment Results, Slovak Republic”). Since the introduction of peoplemeters, the national all day audience share of TV MARKIZA has fallen from 39.6% to 35.4%. The chart below summarizes national all day and prime time audience share figures for TV MARKIZA: 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 All day 45.8 % 39.6 % 31.1 % 33.6 % 35.4 % Prime time 45.5 % 40.0 % 32.8 % 35.9 % 39.5 % Source: TNS. We primarily sell a 12+ target group. In that group, our national all day and national prime time audience shares were 35.5% and 39.5%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Programming TV MARKIZA broadcasts 24 hours per day and its programming strategy is to appeal to a broad audience through news, movies, entertainment and sports programming, with specific groups targeted in off-peak broadcasting hours. Approximately 30% of TV MARKIZA programming is locally produced, including ‘Televizne noviny’ (‘TV News’), ‘Sportove noviny’ (‘Sports News’), ‘Susedia’ (‘Neighbours’), ‘Slovensko hlada Superstar 3’ (‘Pop Idol 3’), and ‘Bailando’ (a dance show). ‘Televizne noviny’ is consistently the top-ranked show in the Slovak Republic. ‘Susedia’, ‘Slovensko hlada Superstar 3’ and ‘Bailando’ were also among the most popular shows in 2007. TV MARKIZA has secured exclusive broadcast rights to a variety of popular American and European series, films and telenovellas produced by major international studios including Warner Bros., NBC Universal, CBS Paramount, Dreamworks/Paramount, Grandview-Castle, and Buena Vista. All foreign language programming (other than that in the Czech language) is dubbed into the Slovak language. Foreign news reports and film footage licensed from CNN, Reuters, APTN and SNTV are integrated into news programs on TV MARKIZA. Page 23 Table of Contents TV MARKIZA is required to comply with several restrictions on programming, including regulations on the origin of programming. These include the requirement that a minimum of 11% of programming be public interest programming (which includes news and topical shows), and that a minimum of 51% of films and series be European productions. Advertising TV MARKIZA derives revenues principally from the sale of commercial advertising time through media buying groups and independent agencies. Advertisers include large multinational companies such as T-Com / T-Mobile, Orange, Telefonica O2, Benckiser, Procter & Gamble, Henkel, L’Oréal, Unilever, Nestlé and Danone. The top ten advertisers of TV MARKIZA contributed 39% of the channel’s total Segment Net Revenues in 2007. Within the Slovak advertising market, television accounts for approximately 46% of total advertising spending. TV MARKIZA also competes for advertising revenues with other media such as print, radio, outdoor advertising and direct mail. Privately owned broadcasters are permitted to broadcast advertising for up to twelve minutes per hour but not for more than 15% of their total daily broadcast time. The public broadcaster, STV, which is also financed through a compulsory license fee, can broadcast advertising for up to twelve minutes per hour, but between 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. may broadcast only eight minutes of advertising per hour and not more than 3% of their total daily broadcast time. There are restrictions on the frequency of advertising breaks during and between programs. STV is not permitted to broadcast advertising breaks during programs. There are also restrictions that relate to advertising content, including a ban on tobacco advertising and a ban on advertisements of alcoholic beverages (excluding beer) between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Competition In addition to TV MARKIZA, the Slovak Republic is served by two national public television channels, STV1 and STV2, which dominated the ratings until TV MARKIZA began broadcasting in 1996. TV MARKIZA also competes with the privately owned broadcaster TV JOJ. During 2007 TV MARKIZA achieved a national all day audience share of 35.4%, which made it the highest ranked station nationally.

The current broadcasting license for TV MARKIZA expires in September 2019. Ownership On January 23, 2006, we acquired control of our Slovak Republic operations and increased our economic interest from 70% to 80%. Following the merger of STS into Markiza on January 1, 2007 and our acquisition of 20% of Markiza on July 13, 2007, we now own a 100% voting and economic interest in Markiza (see Part II, Item 7, “Analysis by Geographic Segment, Slovak Republic”). SLOVENIA General Slovenia is a parliamentary democracy with a population of approximately 2.0 million people. Per capita GDP is estimated to be US$ 23,000 in 2007, the highest per capita GDP in Central and Eastern Europe, with a GDP growth rate of 5.9% in 2007. Approximately 99% of Slovenian households have television and cable penetration is approximately 63%. According to our estimates, the Slovenian television advertising market grew by approximately 8 - 10% during 2007 and was worth approximately US$ 85-90 million. We operate two national television channels in Slovenia, POP TV and KANAL A. The other significant national broadcasters are two channels operated by the public broadcaster, SLO 1 and SLO 2, and privately owned broadcaster TV3. License Holders Pop TV holds the broadcast licenses for the POP TV channel and Kanal A holds the broadcast licenses for the for the KANAL A channel. Operations POP TV and KANAL A POP TV is the leading national commercial television broadcaster in Slovenia and reaches approximately 95% of the television households, including the capital Ljubljana and Maribor, Slovenia's second largest city.

KANAL A primarily sells an 18-49 target group. In that group, our national all day and national prime time audience shares were 14.4% and 15.4%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Programming POP TV broadcasts 24 hours per day and its programming strategy is to appeal to a broad audience through a wide variety of programming including series, movies, news, variety and game shows and features. Approximately 33% of programming is locally produced, including ‘Preverjeno!’ (‘Confirmed!’), ‘Trenja’ (‘Friction’), the local series ‘Nasa Mala Klinika’ (‘Our Little Clinic’) and the reality show ‘Farm’. KANAL A broadcasts 24 hours per day and has a programming strategy to complement that of POP TV with a mixture of locally produced programs (approximately 27% in 2007) such as ‘World on Kanal A’, the reality show ‘Big Brother’ and acquired foreign programs, including films and series. Pro Plus has secured exclusive program rights in Slovenia to a variety of successful American and Western European programs and films produced by studios such as Warner Bros., Twentieth Century Fox and Paramount. All foreign language programs and films are subtitled in Slovenian with the exception of some children’s programming that is dubbed. Pro Plus has agreements with CNN, Reuters and APTN to receive foreign news reports and film footage to integrate into news programs on POP TV and KANAL A. POP TV and KANAL A are required to comply with several restrictions on programming, including regulations on the origin of programming. These include the requirement that 20% of a station's daily programming consist of locally produced programming, of which at least 60 minutes must be broadcast between 6:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. Two percent of the station's annual broadcast time must be Slovenian origin audio-visual works and this amount must increase each year until it reaches five percent. In the future a majority, increased from the current 20%, of the station's annual broadcast time will be required to be European origin programming. Furthermore, 10% of the station’s annual broadcast time is required to be devoted to programs made by European producers who are independent of broadcasters, and 50% of such works are to have been produced in the last five years. Advertising Pro Plus derives revenues from the sale of commercial advertising time on POP TV and KANAL A. Current multinational advertisers include firms such as Reckitt Benckiser, Procter & Gamble, Mobitel, L’Oréal, Wrigley, Henkel and Beiersdorf, although no advertiser dominates the market. During the year 2007, we serviced a wide variety of advertisers, the majority through advertising agencies. The top ten advertisers of POP TV and KANAL A contributed approximately 26% of our total Segment Net Revenues in Slovenia in 2007. Page 26 Table of Contents Within the Slovenian advertising market, television accounts for approximately 58% of total advertising spending. In addition, POP TV and KANAL A compete for revenues with other media such as print, radio, outdoor advertising, the internet and direct mail. Privately owned broadcasters are allowed to broadcast advertising for up to 12 minutes in any hour and for up to 20% of their total daily broadcasting time (with 15% for advertisements only). The public broadcaster, SLO, which is also financed through a compulsory television license fee, is allowed to broadcast advertising for up to 12 minutes per hour and for up to 15% of its total daily broadcasting time (with 10% for advertisements only), but is only permitted up to 9 minutes per hour between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. There are restrictions on the frequency of advertising breaks during programs.

UKRAINE General Ukraine, the most populous market in which we operate, is a parliamentary democracy with a population of approximately 46.4 million people. Per capita GDP is estimated to be US$ 2,943 in 2007, the lowest of all our markets, with a GDP growth rate in 2007 of 7.2%. Nearly 100% of Ukrainian households have television, and cable penetration is approximately 19%. According to our estimates, the Ukrainian television advertising market grew by approximately 25 - 35% in 2007 and was worth approximately US$ 390 - 400 million (excluding political advertising and sponsorship). We operate one national television channel in Ukraine, STUDIO 1+1, the regional channel KINO and the local channel CITI. The other significant national broadcasters are the state-owned broadcaster UT-1, which operates one channel, and privately owned broadcasters Inter, Novy Kanal, ICTV and STB. License Holders Studio 1+1 holds the broadcasting licenses for STUDIO 1+1. The sale of Studio 1+1’s advertising has been outsourced to Video International Prioritet, a Ukrainian subsidiary of a Russian advertising sales company, in which we have neither an economic nor a voting interest. Gravis broadcasts KINO through terrestrial licenses covering 16 cities and a satellite license and re-broadcasts across a network of regional stations (including our subsidiaries Tor and Zhysa) and cable operators The sale of KINO’s advertising has been outsourced to Video International Group. Gravis conducts advertising sales for CITI. Operations STUDIO 1+1 STUDIO 1+1, launched in 1997, reaches approximately 99% of Ukraine television houselolds. STUDIO 1+1 initially began broadcasting on the national frequencies of UT-2 under a license permitting 15 hours of broadcasting per day, primarily in prime time and off prime time. In July 2004, STUDIO 1+1 was awarded a second license allowing it to broadcast for the remaining nine hours per day on the UT-2 frequencies. STUDIO 1+1 has been broadcasting a full 24-hour schedule since early September 2004. STUDIO 1+1 had a national all day audience share of 16.1% and an 18.2% prime time audience share in the year ended December 31, 2007.

We primarily sell an 18+ target group. In that group, our national all day and national prime time audience shares were 16.0% and 18.5% respectively for the year ended December 31, 2007. KINO and CITI KINO reaches approximately 56% of television households and broadcasts on average 19 hours per day with a national all day 15-50 audience share of 0.9%. CITI reaches approximately 12% of television households in Ukraine and broadcasts 24 hours per day to the city of Kiev and the Kiev region. CITI achieved an average all day 15-50 audience share in Kiev and Kiev region of 1.86%. ` Programming STUDIO 1+1’s programming strategy is to appeal to a broad audience through a wide variety of programming, including series (popular Russian police and action series in particular), movies and locally produced Ukrainian shows, features and news. In 2007, approximately 60% of programming for prime-time broadcasting hours were either in-house or outsourced local productions, which consist primarily of news broadcasts and news related programs, entertainment shows and TV series of various genres. The Studio 1+1 Group, comprised of several entities that are involved in broadcast operations of Studio 1+1, has secured exclusive territorial or local language broadcast rights in Ukraine to a variety of successful high quality Russian, American and Western European programs and films from many of the major studios, including Warner Bros., Paramount, Universal and Columbia. Studio 1+1 has agreements with Reuters for foreign news packages and other footage to be integrated into its programming. Most non-Ukrainian language programs and films (including those in the Russian language) are dubbed or subtitled in Ukrainian. KINO, which targets the 15-50 age group, male skewed in prime time, female skewed in off-prime and family oriented on weekends, offers feature films, series, animation and other entertainment programming, much of which is acquired from Western sources. CITI, which targets the 15-50 age group, broadcasts mainly originally-produced shows, local news, and programs on Kiev culture, business and community, as well as teleshopping. STUDIO 1+1, KINO and CITI are required to comply with certain restrictions on programming, including regulations on the origin of programming and the language of broadcast. At least 50% of programming broadcast by STUDIO 1+1, KINO and CITI must be of Ukrainian origin and STUDIO 1+1 is further required to broadcast not less than 75% of its programming in Ukrainian or dubbed into Ukrainian. Furthermore, the law stipulates that between 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. at least 80% of programming be European-made. Advertising The Studio 1+1 Group derives revenues principally from the sale of commercial advertising time through both media buying groups and independent agencies. Video International sells advertising for the Studio 1+1 Group. Advertisers include large multinational firms such as Procter & Gamble, Kraft Foods, Unilever, Samsung, Mars, Sony, L’Oréal, Nestlé and Baltic Beverage Holding, as well as large Ukrainian companies like Volun Holding, Obolon and Kyiv Star. The top ten advertising clients of STUDIO 1+1 contributed approximately 29% of STUDIO 1+1’s total Segment Net Revenues in 2007. Furthermore, in the year ended December 31, 2007, parliamentary elections in September brought extra revenue for STUDIO 1+1 from the sale of political advertising. In Ukraine, political elections tend to have the effect of decreasing advertising activity around the time of the elections, but attracting additional revenues from political advertising. Page 29 Table of Contents Gravis derives revenue from the sale of commercial advertising time on KINO and CITI. Video International sells advertising for KINO. KINO targets smaller national advertisers and CITI aims to attract Kiev-based clients. Some of the biggest KINO and CITI advertisers/ clients are: Procter & Gamble, Obolon, Unilever, Meloni, Nestlé, Ukrtelecom and Wrigley. The top ten advertising clients of KINO and CITI contributed approximately 28% of the total Segment Net Revenues of KINO and CITI in 2007. Privately owned broadcasters are allowed to broadcast advertising for 15% of their total broadcast time. During an electoral season this quota increases to 20% of the total broadcasting time. These requirements are not applicable to specialized broadcasting channels. The portion of advertising per hour of actual broadcasting cannot exceed 20%, and during the electoral process may not exceed 25%. The state owned broadcaster is subject to the same restrictions on advertising time. There are restrictions on the frequency of advertising breaks both during and between programs. There are also restrictions that relate to advertising content, including a ban on tobacco advertising and a prohibition on the advertising of alcoholic beverages from 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Competition In addition to STUDIO 1+1, Ukraine is served by public broadcaster UT-1 and privately owned broadcasters Inter, ICTV, STB and Novy Channel.

KINO and CITI compete with certain regional and Kiev-based channels and other regions where KINO is broadcast, including TRK Ukraine, TRK Kiev, Megasport, RTR Planet, Enter Film, NTV Mir, RU Music, K1 and K2 channels and Channel 1 Rus. License Renewal In December 2006, the Ukraine Media Council extended the 15-hour broadcast license of STUDIO 1+1, covering prime time and off prime time, until December 29, 2016. The license to broadcast the remaining nine hours on the same frequencies expires on July 30, 2014. Following the acquisition of a 42% direct interest in Studio 1+1 by our subsidiary, UMS in August 2007, Studio 1+1 filed an amended charter that reflected the current ownership of Studio 1+1 with the Ukraine Media Council and solicited the reissuance of the 15-hour (for prime time and off prime time) and 9-hour broadcasting licenses for the STUDIO 1+1 channel. The Ukraine Media Council has reissued the 15-hour broadcast license but has postponed a decision in respect of the reissuance of the 9-hour broadcasting license. Under amendments to the Ukrainian Media Law adopted in March 2006, a broadcaster is entitled to hold only one broadcasting license that covers a territorial segment (national, regional, or local). The Ukraine Media Council has taken the position that Studio 1+1 is not in compliance with this provision of the Ukraine Media Law because it holds two broadcasting licenses. To date the Ukraine Media Council has not accepted our position that the fact that the two licenses held by Studio 1+1 are in respect of the same frequencies but for different time periods does not contradict the intent of this limitation in the Ukraine Media Law. Notwithstanding the current position of the Ukraine Media Council, Studio 1+1 is entitled to continue to broadcast during the period permitted by the 9-hour license. We are in discussions with the Ukraine Media Council to resolve this issue and expect to have a resolution before the end of the second quarter of 2008. Page 31 Table of Contents Ownership The Studio 1+1 Group consists of several entities in which we hold direct or indirect interests. We hold a 60% ownership and economic interest in each of Innova, IMS and TV Media Planet. Innova owns 100% of Inter-Media, which in turn holds a 30% interest in Studio 1+1. We hold a 99.9% interest in UMS, which owns 42% of Studio 1+1. On January 31, 2008, we entered into agreements with Igor Kolomoisky, Boris Fuchsmann and Alexander Rodnyansky to acquire the remaining interests in the Studio 1+1 Group. Upon completion of an initial sale transaction, we will own 90% of Studio 1+1 and Messrs. Fuchsmann and Rodnyansky will have the right to put to us, and we will have the right to call from them, the remaining 10% interest (see Part II, Item 8, Note 22, “Subsequent Events – Ukraine”). On January 11, 2006, we acquired a 65.5% interest in Ukrpromtorg 2003 LLC (“Ukrpromtorg”), which owns 92.2% of Gravis LLC, which formerly operated the local channels KINO (formerly CHANNEL 7) and CITI (formerly CHANNEL 35). On June 21, 2007, we acquired a 60.4% interest in each of Tor and Zhysa, two regional broadcasters. CORPORATE OPERATIONS In addition to group management and corporate administration, our central organization provides oversight and support to our television operations. The functions include treasury, internal audit, financial planning and analysis, financial control and legal services. SEASONALITY We, like other television operators, experience seasonality, with advertising sales tending to be lowest during the third quarter of each calendar year due to the summer holiday period (typically July and August), and highest during the fourth quarter of each calendar year. See Part II, Item 6, “Selected Financial Data” for further discussion. EMPLOYEES As of February 20, 2008, our operating companies had a total of approximately 3,500 employees (including contractors) and we had a corporate staff of 48 employees in London and Amsterdam. None of our employees or the employees of any of our subsidiaries are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. FINANCIAL INFORMATION BY OPERATING SEGMENT AND BY GEOGRAPHICAL AREA For financial information by operating segment and geographic area, see Part II, Item 8, Note 18, “Segment Data”. Page 32 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS This report and the following discussion of risk factors contain forward-looking statements as discussed on page 4. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this report. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are not aware, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also become important factors that affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Prospective investors are advised to consider carefully the risk factors below and other information in this report before making an investment in our securities. Risks Relating to our Operations Our operating results are dependent on favorable economic and political conditions in countries in which we operate. The results of our operations rely heavily on advertising revenue and demand for advertising is affected by prevailing general and regional economic conditions. Although recently there has been growth in the economies of our operating countries, there can be no assurance that these trends will continue or that any such improvement in economic conditions will generate increased advertising revenue. Adverse economic conditions generally and downturns in the economies of our operating countries specifically are likely to negatively impact the advertising industries in those countries by reducing the amounts our customers spend on advertising, which could result in a decrease in demand for our advertising airtime. In addition, disasters, acts of terrorism, civil or military conflicts or general political uncertainty may create economic uncertainty that reduces advertising spending. The occurrence of any of these events may have a material adverse affect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our operating results depend on our ability to generate advertising sales. We generate almost all of our revenues from the sale of advertising airtime on our television channels. Our advertising revenues generally depend on the pricing of our advertising time as well as other factors, including television viewing levels, changes in audience preferences, our stations’ technical reach, technological developments relating to media and broadcasting, competition from other broadcasters and operators of other media platforms, seasonal trends in the advertising market in the countries in which we operate, and shifts in population and other demographics. Therefore, in order to maintain and increase our advertising sales, we must be able to offer programming which appeals to our target audiences in order to generate GRPs, respond to technological developments in media, compete effectively with other broadcasters seeking to attract similar audiences and manage the impact of any seasonal trends as well as respond successfully to changes in other factors affecting advertising sales generally, particularly in Ukraine. Any decline in advertising sales due to a failure to respond to such changes or to successfully implement our advertising sales strategies could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We will not have management control of our affiliate in Ukraine until we complete the Ukraine Buyout. Prior to the completion of the initial sale transactions to acquire an additional 30% interest in the Studio 1+1 Group from our partners (the “Ukraine Buyout”) (see Part II, Item 8, Note 22, “Subsequent Events – Ukraine”), we continue to own our operations in Ukraine jointly with our partners through subsidiaries and affiliates. We currently hold a direct 42% ownership interest and an indirect 18% ownership interest in Studio 1+1. Although our partners have resigned their management and board positions in the Studio 1+1 Group in connection with entering into transaction documents in respect of the Ukraine Buyout, we believe that to unilaterally assert management control or unilaterally direct the strategies, operations and financial decisions prior to the completion of the Ukraine Buyout may impede the successful completion of the transaction. Therefore, prior to the closing of the Ukraine Buyout, we do not intend to institute material operational changes, including those that may affect the implementation of all of the financial reporting and management processes that exist in our other operations, including ensuring compliance with relevant tax and other obligations of Studio 1+1. Until the Ukraine Buyout is completed, decisions may be taken that do not fully reflect our strategic objectives or may result in Studio 1+1 being in breach of such tax or other obligations. In addition, Studio 1+1 may not adopt decisions in respect of advertising and sponsorship, programming, production, scheduling, personnel or otherwise that we believe are necessary in order to respond to competitive market dynamics in Ukraine for audience share and advertising. The occurrence of any or all of these events may have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Page 33 Table of Contents We may not be aware of all related party transactions, which may involve risks of conflicts of interest that result in concluding transactions on less favorable terms than could be obtained in arms-length transactions. In Romania and Ukraine, the local shareholders, general directors or other members of the management of our operating companies have other business interests in their respective countries, including interests in television and other media-related companies. We may not be aware of all such business interests or relationships that exist with respect to entities with which our operating companies enter into transactions. Transactions with companies, whether or not we are aware of any business relationship between our employees and third parties, may present conflicts of interests which may in turn result in the conclusion of transactions on terms that are not arms-length. It is likely that our subsidiaries will continue to enter into related party transactions in the future. In the event there are transactions with persons who subsequently are determined to be related parties, we may be required to make additional disclosure and, if such contracts are material, may not be in compliance with certain covenants under the Senior Notes (as defined in Part II, Item 7, V(c) “Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements”) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (“EBRD”) Loan (as defined in Part II, Item 7, V(c) “Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements”). In addition, there have been instances in the past where certain related party receivables have been collected more slowly than unrelated third party receivables, which have resulted in slower cash flow to our operating companies. Any related party transaction that is entered into on terms that are not arms-length may result in a negative impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We may not be able to prevent the management of our operating companies from entering into transactions that are outside their authority and not in the best interests of shareholders. The general directors of our operating companies have significant management authority on a local level, subject to the overall supervision by the corresponding company board of directors. In addition, we typically grant authority to other members of management through delegated authorities. Our internal controls have detected transactions that have been entered into by managers acting outside of their authority. Internal controls may not be able to prevent an employee from acting outside his authority. There is therefore a risk that employees with delegated authorities may act outside their authority and that our operating companies will enter into transactions that are not duly authorized. Unauthorized transactions may not be in the best interests of our shareholders, may create the risk of fraud or the breach of applicable law, which may result in transactions or sanctions that may have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our programming content may become more expensive to produce or acquire or we may not be able to develop or acquire programming content that is attractive to our audiences. Television programming is one of the most significant components of our operating costs, particularly in Ukraine. The commercial success of our channels depends substantially on our ability to develop, produce or acquire syndicated television programming content that matches audience tastes, attracts high audience shares and generates advertising revenues. The costs of acquiring programming content attractive to our viewers, such as feature films and popular television series and formats, may increase as a result of greater competition from existing and new television broadcasting channels. Our expenditure in respect of locally produced programming content may also increase due to the implementation of new laws and regulations mandating the broadcast of a greater number of locally produced programs, changes in audience tastes in our markets in favor of locally produced content, and competition for talent. In addition, we typically acquire syndicated programming rights under multi-year commitments before we can predict whether such programming will perform well in our markets. In the event any such programming does not attract adequate audience share, it may be necessary to increase our expenditures by investing in additional programming as well as write down the value of such underperforming programming. Any increase in programming costs or write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Page 34 Table of Contents Our broadcasting licenses may not be renewed and may be subject to revocation. We require broadcasting, and in some cases, other operating licenses as well as other authorizations from national regulatory authorities in our markets, in order to conduct our broadcasting business. We cannot guarantee that our current licenses or other authorizations will be renewed or extended, or that they will not be subject to revocation, particularly in markets where there is relatively greater political risk as a result of less developed political and legal institutions. The failure to comply in all material respects with the terms of broadcasting licenses or other authorizations or with applications filed in respect thereto may result in such licenses or other authorizations not being renewed or otherwise being terminated. Furthermore, no assurances can be given that renewals or extensions of existing licenses will be issued on the same terms as existing licenses or that further restrictions or conditions will not be imposed in the future. Our current broadcasting licenses expire at various times between November 2008 and 2019. Any non-renewal or termination of any other broadcasting or operating licenses or other authorizations or material modification of the terms of any renewed licenses may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our operations are in developing markets where there is a risk of economic uncertainty, biased treatment and loss of business. Our revenue generating operations are located in Central and Eastern Europe. These markets pose different risks from those posed by investments in more developed markets and the impact in our markets of unforeseen circumstances on economic, political or social life is greater. The economic and political systems, legal and tax regimes, standards of corporate governance and business practices of countries in this region continue to develop. Government policies may be subject to significant adjustments, especially in the event of a change in leadership. This may result in social or political instability or disruptions, potential political influence on the media, inconsistent application of tax and legal regulations, arbitrary treatment before judicial or other regulatory authorities and other general business risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our on our financial positions, results of operations and cash flows. Other potential risks inherent in markets with evolving economic and political environments include exchange controls, higher tariffs and other levies as well as longer payment cycles. The relative level of development of our markets and the influence of local political parties also present a potential for biased treatment of us before regulators or courts in the event of disputes involving our investments. If such a dispute occurs, those regulators or courts might favor local interests over our interests. Ultimately, this could lead to loss of our business operations, as occurred in the Czech Republic in 1999. The loss of a material business would have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We may seek to make acquisitions of other stations, networks, content providers or other companies in the future, and we may fail to acquire them on acceptable terms or successfully integrate them or we may fail to identify suitable targets. Our business and operations continue to experience rapid growth, including through acquisition. The acquisition and integration of new businesses pose significant risks to our existing operations, including: Page 35 Table of Contents · additional demands placed on our senior management, who are also responsible for managing our existing operations; · increased overall operating complexity of our business, requiring greater personnel and other resources; · difficulties of expanding beyond our core expertise in the event that we acquire ancillary businesses; · significant initial cash expenditures to acquire and integrate new businesses; and · in the event that debt is incurred to finance acquisitions, additional debt service costs related thereto as well as limitations that may arise under our Senior Notes and the EBRD Loan. To effectively manage our growth and achieve pre-acquisition performance objectives, we will need to integrate any new acquisitions, implement financial and management controls and produce required financial statements in those operations. The integration of new businesses may also be difficult due to differing cultures or management styles, poor internal controls and an inability to establish control over cash flows. If any acquisition and integration is not implemented successfully, our ability to manage our growth will be impaired and we may have to make significant additional expenditures to address these issues, which could harm our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, even if we are successful in integrating new businesses, expected synergies and cost savings may not materialize, resulting in lower than expected profit margins. In addition, prospective competitors may have greater financial resources than us and increased competition for target broadcasters may decrease the number of potential acquisitions that are available on acceptable terms. Our operating results are dependent on the importance of television as an advertising medium. We generate almost all of our revenues from the sale of advertising airtime on television channels in our markets. Television competes with various other media, such as print, radio, the internet and outdoor advertising, for advertising spending. In all of the countries in which we operate, television constitutes the single largest component of all advertising spending. There can be no assurances that the television advertising market will maintain its current position among advertising media in our markets or that changes in the regulatory environment or improvements in technology will not favor other advertising media or other television broadcasters. Increases in competition among advertising media arising from the development of new forms of advertising media and distribution could result in a decline in the appeal of television as an advertising medium generally or of our channels specifically. A decline in television advertising spending in any period or in specific markets could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The transition to digital broadcasting may require substantial additional investments and the timing of such investments is uncertain. Countries in which we have operations are initiating the migration from analog terrestrial broadcasting to digital terrestrial broadcasting. Each country has independent plans with its own timeframe and regulatory and investment regime. The specific timing and approach to implementing such plans is subject to change. We cannot predict the effect of the migration on our existing operations or predict our ability to receive any additional rights or licenses to broadcast for our existing channels or any additional channels if such additional rights or licenses should be required under any relevant regulatory regime. Furthermore, we may be required to make substantial additional capital investment and commit substantial other resources to implement digital terrestrial broadcasting and the availability of competing alternative distribution systems, such as direct-to-home platforms, may require us to acquire additional distribution and content rights. We may not have access to resources sufficient to make such investments when required. Page 36 Table of Contents Our operations are subject to significant changes in technology that could adversely affect our business. The television broadcasting industry may be affected by rapid innovations in technology. The implementation of new technologies and the introduction of broadcasting distribution systems other than analog terrestrial broadcasting, such as digital broadcasting, direct-to-home cable and satellite distribution systems, the internet, video-on-demand and the availability of television programming on portable digital devices, have fragmented television audiences in more developed markets and could adversely affect our ability to attract advertisers as such technologies penetrate our markets. New technologies that enable viewers to choose when and what content to watch, as well as to fast-forward or skip advertisements, may cause changes in consumer behavior that could impact our business. In addition, compression techniques and other technological developments allow for expanded programming offerings to be offered to highly targeted audiences. Reductions in the cost of creating additional channel capacity could lower entry barriers for new channels and encourage the development of increasingly targeted niche programming on various distribution platforms. Our television broadcasting operations may be required to expend substantial financial and managerial resources on the implementation of new broadcasting technologies or distribution systems. In addition, an expansion in competition due to technological innovation may increase competition for audiences and advertising revenue as well as the competitive demand for programming. Any requirement for substantial further investment to address competition that arises on account of technological innovations in broadcasting may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our success depends on attracting and retaining key personnel. Our success depends partly upon the efforts and abilities of our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Our management teams have significant experience in the media industry and have made an important contribution to our growth and success. Although we have been successful in attracting and retaining such people in the past, competition for highly skilled individuals is intense. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining such individuals in the future. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flow. Risks Relating to our Financial Position We may require additional external sources of capital, which may not be available or may not be available on acceptable terms. The acquisition, ownership and operation of television broadcasting operations require substantial investment. Our ability to meet our total capital requirements is based on our expected cash resources, including our debt facilities, as well as estimates of future operating results, which are derived from a variety of assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. If our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, if our assumptions or our investment plans change in light of additional acquisitions or other investments, or if our costs increase due to competitive pressures or other unanticipated developments, we may need to obtain additional financing. Such financings, if available at all, may not be available on acceptable terms. Sources of financing may include public or private debt or equity financings, proceeds from the sale of assets or other financing arrangements. Any additional debt or equity securities issued to raise funds may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to shares of our Common Stock, and the issuance of additional equity may dilute the economic interest of the holders of shares of our Common Stock. It is also not possible to ensure that such debt financings will be available within the limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness contained in the Indentures pursuant to which our Senior Notes were issued in 2005 (the “2005 Indenture”) and in 2007 (the “2007 Indenture” and collectively with the 2005 Indenture the “Indentures”) or pursuant to the terms of the EBRD Loan or as a result of general economic conditions. If we cannot obtain adequate capital or on obtain it on acceptable terms, this could have an adverse effect on our financial positions, results of operations and cash flows. Page 37 Table of Contents Our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for future debt service and other obligations. Our ability to make debt service payments under our Senior Notes and other indebtedness depends on our future operating performance and our ability to generate sufficient cash, which in turn depends in part on factors that are not within our control, including general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we would face substantial liquidity problems. We may not be able to maintain the ratings of our Senior Notes without adequate liquidity, which would have an adverse impact on our ability to raise additional debt financing. We may be obliged to reduce or delay capital or other material expenditures at our stations, restructure our debt, obtain additional debt or equity capital (if available on acceptable terms), or dispose of material assets or businesses to meet our debt service and other obligations. It may not be possible to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, which may have an adverse effect on our financial positions, results of operations and cash flows. Our debt service obligations following the issuance of the Senior Notes may restrict our ability to fund our operations. We have significant debt service obligations under our Senior Notes and we are restricted in the manner in which our business is conducted (see Part II, Item 8, Note 6 “Senior Notes”). Our high leverage could have important consequences to our business and results of operations, including but not limited to increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or economic and industry conditions, as well as limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, business opportunities and other corporate requirements. We may have a higher level of debt than certain of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. A substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is required to be dedicated to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which means that this cash flow is not available to fund our operations, capital expenditures or other corporate purposes. Therefore, our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive environment and the industry in which we operate is somewhat limited. Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations and would therefore have potentially harmful consequences for the development of our business and strategic plan. Under the Senior Notes and the EBRD Loan, we have pledged shares in our two principal subsidiary holding companies that hold substantially all of our assets and a default on our obligations could result in our inability to continue to conduct our business. Pursuant to the terms of the Indentures and the EBRD Loan, we have pledged shares in our two principal subsidiary holding companies, which own substantially all of our interests in our operating companies, including the TV Nova (Czech Republic) group, Pro TV, Markiza, Pro Plus and Studio 1+1. If we were to default on either of the Indentures or the EBRD Loan, the trustees under our Indentures or the EBRD Loan would have the ability to sell all or a portion of all of these assets in order to pay amounts outstanding under our Indentures or the EBRD Loan. We may be adversely affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. Our reporting currency is the dollar but a significant portion of our consolidated revenues and costs, including programming rights expenses and interest on debt, are in other currencies. Furthermore, the functional currency of our operations in Romania and Ukraine is the dollar. This is subject to annual review and new circumstances that may be identified during these annual reviews may result in the use of functional currencies in these markets that differ from our reporting currency. In addition, our Senior Notes are denominated in Euros. We have not attempted to hedge the Senior Notes. We have in the past and may therefore in the future continue to experience significant gains and losses on the translation of the Senior Notes into dollars due to movements in exchange rates between the Euro and the dollar. Page 38 Table of Contents If our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, future cash flows, and slower growth rates in our industry. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined resulting in a negative impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our holding company structure may limit our access to cash. We are a holding company and we conduct our operations through subsidiaries and affiliates. The primary internal source of our cash to fund our operating expenses as well as service our existing and future debt depends on debt repayments from our subsidiaries, the earnings of our operating subsidiaries, earnings generated from our equity interest in certain of our affiliates and distributions of such earnings to us. Substantially all of our assets consist of ownership of and loans to our subsidiaries and affiliates. We currently rely on the repayment of intercompany indebtedness and the declaration of dividends to receive distributions of cash from our operating subsidiaries and affiliates. The distribution of dividends is generally subject to conformity with requirements of local law, including the funding of a reserve account and, in certain instances, the affirmative vote of our partners. If our operating subsidiaries or affiliates are unable to distribute to us funds to which we are entitled, we may be unable to cover our operating expenses. Such inability would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Risks Relating to Enforcement Rights We are a Bermuda company and enforcement of civil liabilities and judgments may be difficult. Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. is a Bermuda company; substantially all of our assets and all of our operations are located, and all of our revenues are derived, outside the United States. In addition, several of our directors and officers are non-residents of the United States, and all or a substantial portion of the assets of such persons are or may be located outside the United States. As a result, investors may be unable to effect service of process within the United States upon such persons, or to enforce against them judgments obtained in the United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal and state securities laws. There is uncertainty as to whether the courts of Bermuda and the countries in which we operate would enforce (i) judgments of United States courts obtained against us or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal and state securities laws or (ii) in original actions brought in such countries, liabilities against us or such persons predicated upon the United States federal and state securities laws. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock CME Holdco L.P. is in a position to decide corporate actions that require shareholder approval and may have interests that differ from those of other shareholders. CME Holdco L.P. owns all our outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, each of which carries 10 votes per share. Ronald Lauder, the chairman of our Board of Directors, is the majority owner of CME Holdco L.P. and, subject to certain limitations described below, is entitled to vote those shares on behalf of CME Holdco L.P. The shares over which Ronald Lauder has voting power represent 63.7% of the aggregate voting power of our outstanding Common Stock. On September 1, 2006, Adele (Guernsey) L.P., a fund affiliated with Apax Partners, acquired 49.7% of CME Holdco L.P. Under the terms of the limited partnership agreement of CME Holdco L.P., Adele (Guernsey) L.P. has certain consent rights in respect of the voting and disposition of the shares of Class B Common Stock. CME Holdco L.P. is in a position to control the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as the election of directors (including two Adele (Guernsey) L.P. is entitled to recommend for appointment) and transactions involving a change of control. The interests of CME Holdco L.P. may not be the same as those of other shareholders, and such shareholders will be unable to affect the outcome of such corporate actions for so long as CME Holdco L.P. retains voting control. Page 39 Table of Contents The price of our Class A Common Stock is likely to remain volatile. The market price of shares of our Class A Common Stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including those described above under “Risks Relating to our Business and Operations” as well as the following: license renewals, general economic and business trends, variations in quarterly operating results, regulatory developments in our operating countries and the European Union, the condition of the media industry in our operating countries, the volume of trading in shares of our Class A Common Stock, future issuances of shares of our Class A Common Stock and investor and securities analyst perception of us and other companies that investors or securities analysts deem comparable in the television broadcasting industry. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to and disproportionate to the operating performance of broadcasting companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of shares of our Class A Common Stock, regardless of our operating performance. Our share price may be adversely affected by potential future issuances and sales of our shares. As at February 25, 2008, we have a total of 1.1 million options to purchase Class A Common Stock outstanding and 0.1 million options to purchase shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding. An affiliate of PPF a.s., from whom we acquired the TV Nova (Czech) group, holds 3,500,000 unregistered shares of Class A Common Stock and Igor Kolomoisky, a member of our Board of Directors and a party to the Ukraine Buyout, holds 1,275,227 unregistered shares of Class A Common Stock. In addition, a portion of the consideration for the Ukraine Buyout may be paid in shares of Class A Common Stock (see Part II, Item 8, Note 22 “Subsequent Events”). We cannot predict what effect, if any, the issuance of shares underlying options, the entry into trading of such unregistered shares or any future issuances of our shares will have on the market price of our shares. If more shares are issued, the economic interest of current shareholders may be diluted and the price of our shares may be adversely affected. Page 40 Table of Contents ITEM 1 B.
