Exhibits 95 Index of Exhibits 95 iii Introduction Industrias Bachoco, S.A.B. de C.V. is a holding company with no operations other than holding the stock of its subsidiaries. Our two main subsidiaries are Bachoco, S.A. de C.V. (“BSACV”), located in Mexico, and Bachoco USA, LLC (“Bachoco USA”) located in the United States of America (“United States” or “U.S.”). References herein to “Bachoco,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “its” or the “Company” are, unless the context requires otherwise, to Industrias Bachoco, S.A.B. de C.V. and its consolidated subsidiaries as a whole. Additionally, references herein to “OK Industries” or “OK Foods” are, unless the context requires otherwise, to Bachoco USA and its consolidated subsidiaries as a whole. We are incorporated under the laws of the United Mexican States (“Mexico”), but we have operations in both Mexico and the U.S. Our principal executive offices are located in Mexico at Avenida Tecnologico 401, Ciudad Industrial, zip code 38010, Celaya, State of Guanajuato, Mexico, and our main telephone number is +52 (461) 618 3500, or +52 (461) 618 3555. Presentation of Information Fiscal Year The fiscal year for Bachoco and its subsidiaries in Mexico ends in December each year. The fiscal year for Bachoco USA and its subsidiaries in the U.S. ends in April each year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of our consolidated financial statements, the accounting year period for all the Company’s subsidiaries ends on December 31. Currency Except as otherwise indicated, all data in the financial statements included below and in Item 18 (which together with the attached notes constitute our “Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”) and the selected financial information included throughout this Form 20-F (this “Annual Report”) have been presented in millions of nominal pesos unless otherwise indicated. References herein to “pesos” or “$”are to the lawful currency of Mexico. References herein to “dollar”, or “USD$” are to the lawful currency of the United States of America. This Annual Report contains translations of certain peso amounts into dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise indicated, such dollar amounts have been translated from pesos at an exchange rate of $14.75 to USD$1.00 (one dollar), the exchange rate on December 31, 2014, according to the Banco de Mexico (or the “Central Bank”). Accounting Practices In January 2009, the Comision Nacional Bancaria y de Valores (Mexican Banking and Securities Commission or “CNBV”) published certain amendments to the Rules for Public Companies and other participants in the Mexican Securities Market that require public companies to report financial information in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), effective as of January 1, 2012. 4 Following these amendments, on January 1, 2012, we adopted IFRS, meeting the CNBV requirements. At the same time, our financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, and the opening balance as of January 1, 2011, were converted from Mexican Financial Reporting Standards (MFRS) to IFRS to make them comparable to our financial statements for fiscal year 2012. Our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, as issued by the IASB. The rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), do not require foreign private issuers that prepare their financial statements on the basis of IFRS (as published by the IASB) to reconcile such financial statements to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). As such, while Bachoco has in the past reconciled its consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with MFRS to U.S. GAAP, those reconciliations are no longer presented in Bachoco’s filings with the SEC. Other References Bachoco’s production volume is measured in “tons”, which term refers to metric tons of 1,000 kilograms, equal to 2,204.6 pounds; the term “billion” refers to one thousand million (1,000,000,000). Non-GAAP Financial Measures The body of generally accepted accounting principles is commonly referred to as “GAAP.” For this purpose, a non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined by the SEC as a numerical measure of a company’s historical or financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of comprehensive income, statement of financial position or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements) of the company; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. The Company discloses in this Annual Report the so-called non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA result, EBITDA margin, and Net debt. EBITDA result is defined as profit before income tax expense (benefit), financial income (expense), net and depreciation. EBITDA margin is defined as EBITDA result divided by total net revenues. Net debt is defined as long-term debt (including the current portion) plus short term debt minus cash and cash equivalents, primary financial instruments and derivative financial instruments. The non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA result and EBITDA margin are not substitutes for the GAAP measure of net income. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement the GAAP measure of net income by providing further understanding of the Company’s results of operations from management’s perspective. Additionally, the non-GAAP financial measure of Net debt is not a substitute for the GAAP measure of Total debt. Rather, this measure is provided as additional information to contemplate the GAAP measure of Total debt by providing further understanding of the Company’s debt obligations. Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of the Company’s financial performance, liquidity or debt obligations. 5 Company management believes that disclosure of these non-GAAP measures are an important supplemental measure of the Company’s operating performance and debt obligations because investors, financial analysts and other interested parties frequently use EBITDA and Net debt in the evaluation of other companies in the same industry in which the Company operates. Market Data This Annual Report contains certain statistical information regarding the Mexican chicken, egg and balanced feed (or “feed”) markets. We have obtained this information from a variety of sources, including but not limited to; Union Nacional de Avicultores (the National Poultry Union or “UNA”), the Consejo Nacional de Fabricantes de Alimentos Balanceados y de la Nutricion Animal, A.C. (or “CONAFAB”), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (or “USDA”), and the Banco de Mexico (the Bank of Mexico), among others. Other sources of statistical information used by the Company include Consejo Mexicano de Porcicultura (the Mexican Pork Council or “CMP”), Secretaria de Agricultura, Ganaderia, Desarrollo Rural, Pesca y Alimentacion (Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fishing and Food or “SAGARPA”), among others. The producers’ associations rely principally on data provided by their members. Information for which no source is cited was prepared by us on the basis of our knowledge of the Mexican chicken, egg, feed, turkey and swine markets and the wide variety of information available regarding these markets. The methodology and terminology used by different sources are not always consistent, and data from different sources are not readily comparable. Forward-looking Statements We may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements in our periodic reports to the SEC on Forms 20-F and 6-K, in our Annual Report to stockholders, in offering circulars and prospectuses, in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by one of our officers, directors or employees to analysts, institutional investors, representatives of the media and others. Examples of such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (i) projections of revenues, income (or loss), earnings (or loss) per share, capital expenditures, dividends, capital structure or other financial items or ratios; (ii) statements of our plans, objectives or goals or those of our management, including those relating to new contracts; (iii) statements about future economic performance; and (iv) statements of assumptions underlying such statements. Words such as “believe,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “expect,” “intend,” “target,” “estimate,” “project,” “predict,” “forecast,” “guideline,” “should” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and a number of unexpected changes could cause actual results to deviate from our plans, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions. We recognize that the accuracy of our predictions and our ability to follow through on our intentions depend on factors beyond our control. The potential risks are many and varied, but include unexpected changes in: economic, weather and political conditions; raw material prices; competitive conditions; and demand for chicken, eggs, turkey, balanced feed, beef and swine. 6 PART I ITEM 1.

VOLUME SOLD BY BUSINESS LINE In thousands of tons, as of December 31, 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 Total sales volume: 1,841.4 1,771.1 1,861.6 1,606.3 1,473.3 Poultry 1,495.0 1,429.2 1,485.2 1,205.9 1,125.8 Others 346.4 341.9 376.4 400.4 347.5 Gross Domestic Product, Inflation Rate and CETES The chart below includes Mexican gross domestic product (“GDP”) and inflation rate data from 2010 to 2014, and the average interest rates on 28-day Mexican treasury bills (“CETES”), as provided by the Mexican Central Bank. Gross Domestic Product Mexico has experienced economic growth in the last five years, but to varying degrees. In 2014, the Mexican GDP was 2.1%, lower than expected, but higher than the growth reached in 2013, which was 1.1%. In 2012 and 2011, Mexican GDP was 3.9% and in 2010 it had a strong year, reaching a growth rate of 5.5%. 8 Interest Rates Mexico historically has had, and may continue to have, high real and nominal interest rates. The interest rates on 28-day Mexican government treasury securities averaged 2.7%, 3.8%, 3.9% and 4.3% for 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. High interest rates in Mexico could increase our financing costs and thereby impair our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Inflation Rates Inflation rates in Mexico have remained on the low end for more than a decade. The annual rate of inflation, as measured by changes in the Mexican National Consumer Price Index, or NCPI, was 4.1% in 2014, 3.97% in 2013, 3.6% in 2012, 3.8% in 2011 and 4.4% in 2010, according to the Banco de Mexico. An adverse change in the Mexican economy may have a negative impact on price stability and result in higher inflation than its main trading partners, including the United States. GDP, INFLATION RATE AND CETES DATA Year GDP Inflation Rate CETES 2014 2.1% 4.08% 2.7% 2013 1.1% 3.97% 3.8% 2012 3.9% 3.57% 3.9% 2011 3.9% 3.82% 4.3% 2010 5.5% 4.40% 4.4% On March 30, 2015, the 28 day CETES rate was 3.02%. Exchange Rates In 2010, the Mexican peso strengthened its position during the year as compared to the dollar, appreciating approximately 5.3% since the end of 2009, while the inflation rate for 2010 was 4.40%. During the first half of 2011, the exchange rate of the peso to the dollar was stable, showed an average rate of $11.89 per one dollar. This stability changed drastically during the second half of the year, were we observed a higher average rate peso-dollar of $12.97, with a final depreciation of 13.0% by the end of the year with respect to year-end of 2010. In 2012, the Mexican peso strengthened its position during the year as compared to the U.S. dollar, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, with the average peso-dollar exchange rate being $13.15 and appreciated with respect to the U.S. dollar by 7.1% at year-end (or 7.9% according with Banco de Mexico statistics). In 2013, the exchange rate of the peso against the dollar started the year strong with an upward trend, but ended the year with a slight depreciation of 1.0% compared with December 31, 2012. During most of 2014, the Mexican peso-dollar exchange rate was stable. This stability changed drastically toward the end of the year, when we observed a higher than average Mexican peso-dollar exchange rate, leading the Mexican peso-dollar exchange rate to depreciate 11.2% in 2014 with respect to the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2013. The following table sets forth the high, low, average and year-end exchange rates for cable transfers in pesos as certified for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, for periods indicated: 9 EXCHANGE RATE FOR THE LAST 5 YEARS In pesos per one dollar High Low Average (1) Close $ $ $ $ 2014 14.79 12.85 13.30 14.751(1) 2013 13.43 11.98 12.76 13.10 2012 14.37 12.63 13.15 12.96 2011 14.25 11.51 12.43 13.95 2010 13.19 12.16 12.62 12.38 EXCHANGE RATE FOR THE LAST 6 MONTHS March 2015 15.63 14.93 15.24 15.26 February 2015 15.10 14.75 14.92 14.94 January 2015 15.00 14.56 14.69 15.00 December 2014 14.79 13.94 14.52 14.751(1) November 2014 13.92 13.54 13.61 13.92 October 2014 13.57 13.39 13.48 13.48 Source: http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h10/Hist/dat00_mx.htm. (1)As of December 31, 2014, the exchange rate for the year end for the Banco de Mexico was $14.75 per one dollar.

B.Capitalization and Indebtedness Not applicable. C.Reasons for the Offer and Use of Proceeds Not Applicable. D.Risk Factors The Company is exposed to a wide range of risks. Note that the order in which the below risks are described does not necessarily reflect the effect that any of the below risks would have on the Company. Risks Related to Economic, Political and Regulatory Conditions Bachoco’s core businesses are conducted in Mexico and in the United States and, therefore its performance depends, among other factors, on the economic conditions prevailing in those countries, and particularly in Mexico. The Company's risk exposure related to economic conditions includes risks related to economic performance, exchange rates, interest rates, as well as other political, economic and social events that may negatively affect the Company's performance and may result in lower demand for, and lower real pricing of, our products. Additionally, the Mexican economy continues to be heavily influenced by the U.S. economy, and therefore, deterioration in economic conditions in the U.S. economy may affect the Mexican economy. Prolonged periods of weak economic conditions in Mexico may have, and in the past have had, a negative effect on our Company and a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition. 10 Unfavorable economic conditions in Mexico or the United States, such as a recession or increases in interest and inflation rates could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. If the Mexican or U.S. economies experience a high inflation rate, recession or economic slowdown, consumers may not be able to purchase our products as usual, especially in Mexico, where these factors have a direct impact on the consumers, and as a consequence our earnings may be adversely affected. High interest rates in Mexico or in the U.S. could adversely affect our costs and our earnings due to the impact those changes have on our variable-rate debt instruments; on the other hand, we may benefit from the interest we earn on our cash balance. Mexico historically has had, and may continue to have, high real and nominal interest rates. A strong variation in the exchange rates between the peso and dollar could negatively affect our financial results, as a greater percentage of our sales are made in pesos, and a large percentage of our raw material purchases are made in dollars. Furthermore, the Company could be adversely affected by negative economic conditions prevalent in the U.S. or other countries, even when economic conditions in such countries may differ significantly from economic conditions in Mexico, as investors’ reactions to developments in any of these other countries may have an adverse effect on our securities. Consequently, the market value of our securities may be adversely affected by events taking place outside of Mexico or the U.S. Political events and regulatory changes in Mexico, including new elections, could affect Mexican economic conditions and, as a consequence, negatively affect our operations. The Company has operations in both Mexico and the U.S. However, it is incorporated under the laws of Mexico, where a greater percentage of its sales are made. Accordingly we foresee an impact mainly from negative developments in the political, regulatory and economic conditions in Mexico. Mexican political events may significantly affect our operations. In June 2015, federal elections will take place in Mexico, including, among others, the election of 500 representatives of the Mexican Congress and nine governors of various Mexican states. We cannot predict the impact these elections may have on future business conditions in Mexico. These federal elections may result in government instability and political uncertainty, which could have an adverse effect on Mexican economic policy and as a result, it could affect our business, financial position and operating results. In July 2012, Enrique Peña Nieto of the Partido Revolucionario Institucional was elected as President of Mexico. After taking office he started to implement significant changes in laws, public policy and regulations in areas such as the energy sector and fiscal affairs, all of which are still in process of becoming fully implemented, and it is still unclear what effect these and other possible reforms may have on the Mexican economy. Political disagreements between the executive and the legislative branches could result in deadlock and prevent the timely implementation of political and economic reforms. We cannot provide any assurances that political developments in Mexico, over which we have no control, will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results. Although the U.S. presidential election in 2012 did not result in a change of the nations' leadership, any political or regulatory change in the U.S. regarding Mexico may also affect the economic conditions in Mexico and, as a consequence, affect our financial performance. 11 Government regulations in Mexico and the U.S. could cause a material increase in the Company's costs of operations and thus could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Every region in which Bachoco operates is subject to extensive federal, state and foreign laws and regulations that govern the production, packaging, storage, moving and marketing in the food industry and the poultry industry in particular, including several provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment. We may be subject to fines, closures of our facilities, asset seizures, injunctions or criminal sanctions if we are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be non-compliant with any of the applicable laws and regulations. The adoption of new regulations or changes in the prevailing regulatory environment governing the food industry may entail restrictions in the daily operation of our Company, or increases in our expenses or production costs, conditions that could negatively affect our financial results. Additionally, the imposition of new taxes or changes in the existing tax rates in Mexico or the U.S. could have an adverse impact on our operations and, as a result, negatively affect our financial results. Risks Related to Bachoco and the Poultry Industry The poultry industry in Mexico and the U.S., as well as the chicken industry in other countries, has undergone cyclical periods of higher prices and profitability, followed by overproduction, leading to periods of lower prices and profitability. The market that we serve is subject to volatility with respect to supply and raw material prices, which affects our product prices. We can provide no assurance that future cyclicality, excess supply, increases in main raw materials prices, or downturns in real prices will not adversely affect our financial results. The largest single component of our cost of sales is the cost of grains used to prepare balanced feed, including sorghum and corn, and some other ingredients such as: soybean meal and marigold extract, among others. Increase or volatility in main raw materials prices may adversely affect our operating and financial results. The price of most of these raw materials is subject to significant volatility resulting from weather conditions, the size of harvests, governmental agricultural policies, currency exchange rates, transportation, storage costs, and other factors. Furthermore, the cost of corn in the U.S. may be affected by an increase in the demand of ethanol, which can reduce the supply of corn in the U.S. market, adversely affecting our operations in the U.S. High prices or volatility in main raw materials could adversely affect our production costs and as a consequence our financial results. 12 Supply, demand and the prices we are able to charge for our products may fluctuate due to competition from other food producers and the economic performance in the countries we are present may adversely affect our operating and financial results. Excess in chicken or eggs supply caused by increases in production from our competitors coupled with a weak demand for our products in the markets we operate may result in a downturn in prices for these products, and as a result, our operating margins and financial results could be negatively affected. We face competition from other chicken producers in all markets in which we sell our products. These chicken producers have the financial resources and operating strengths to directly compete with our Company. We expect to continue to face strong competition in every market, as our existing or new competitors are likely to broaden their product lines and extend their geographic markets. Accordingly, we can provide no assurance that our performance will not be adversely affected by increased competition. Raising animals and meat processing involve animal health and disease control risks, which can have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Our operations in Mexico and in the U.S. depend on raising animals and meat processing, which are subject to risks such as diseases (like different types of avian flu) and contamination during production, packaging, storage or distribution processes. Live chickens and swine are susceptible to infections by a variety of microbiological agents that may result in higher mortality rates, affecting our earnings and financial results. Our chicken, turkey, beef and eggs products are subject to contamination during processing, packaging, distribution or conservation. Potential contamination of our products during processing, however, could affect a larger number of our products, which may have a significant impact on our results. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes or earthquakes may result in additional losses of inventory and damage to our plants and equipment. Natural disasters could significantly damage our facilities. Our facilities in Mexico are susceptible mainly to earthquakes and hurricanes. Our facilities near Mexico’s coast are most vulnerable to the risk of severe weather. Our U.S. facilities are located in Arkansas and Oklahoma, a region vulnerable to being hit by tornadoes. Extensive damage to these facilities could affect our ability to conduct our regular production and, as a result, reduce our operation results. We recently identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting related to our risk assessment capabilities and physical control over fixed assets. Our management and auditors recently identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses identified are: (i) deficiencies in our risk assessment activities, which may have an effect on our response to mitigate risks associated with our Consolidated Financial Statements and (ii) deficiencies associated with physical control over our fixed assets. See Item 15 for more details on the material weaknesses. 13 Any failure to implement and maintain improvements in the controls over our financial reporting, or difficulties encountered in the implementation of such improvements, could result in a material misstatement in our annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected, and/or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations under applicable securities laws and could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have an adverse impact on the trading price of our shares or the ADRs. Our growth through mergers, acquisitions or joint ventures may be impacted by challenges in integrating significant acquisitions. We have made in the past, and may make in the future, certain acquisitions in order to continue our growth. Acquisitions involve risks, including, among others, the following: failure of acquired businesses to achieve expected results; inability to retain or hire key personnel of acquired businesses; inability to retain the same client and supplier base; and inability to achieve expected synergies and/or economies of scale. If we are unable to successfully integrate or manage our acquired businesses, we may not realize anticipated cost savings and revenue growth, which may result in reduced profitability or losses. Elimination of tariff barriers may adversely affect our performance. U.S. producers may increase exports to Mexico because chicken, eggs and swine are free of import quotas to Mexico according to the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”). Poultry producers in the United States have developed low cost production methods and have been successful in exporting primarily frozen and value-added poultry to other countries, especially in periods of overcapacity in the United States, a condition that could have a material adverse effect on our performance in Mexico. Regulations on animal health and environmental changes in Mexico could affect Mexican poultry industry conditions and, as a consequence, negatively affect the Company. Our processes are subject to several animal health and environmental regulations that include animal raising, transportation, packaging, storage and distribution regulations. Drastic changes in any of these regulations could negatively affect our daily operations and ability to supply our products, and, as a consequence, affect our financial results. Changes in regulations may also require the implementation of new processes or equipment to comply with the new regulations, a condition that may negatively affect our liquidity, as our capital investments could increase. Our inability to maintain good relationships with our work force and its labor union may affect our processes and, as a consequence, our financial results. If we are unable to maintain good relations with our employees and with our labor union we may be faced with significant work stoppages as a result of labor problems, a condition that may affect our processes and our operating results. Risks relating to Bachoco’s investors and its American Depositary Receipts (or ADRs) The Robinson Bours family owns 73.25% of our total shares outstanding and their interests may differ from other security holders. With that percentage they hold the power to elect a majority of the members of our Board of Directors and have the power to determine the outcome of certain other actions requiring the approval of our stockholders, including whether or not dividends are to be paid and the amount of such dividends. 14 The Company trades its ADRs on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) with each ADR representing twelve common shares. The prevailing market prices for the ADRs and the Shares could decline if the Robinson Bours family sold substantial amounts of their Shares, whether directly, or indirectly, through two Mexican trusts through which they hold their Shares, or if the perception arose that such a sale could occur. See Item 7 for more details about the Company’s trusts. The market value of our securities may be affected by economic and market conditions prevailing in any other country, although economic conditions in such countries may differ significantly from economic conditions in Mexico. Investors’ reactions to developments in any of these other countries may have an adverse perception and, consequently, the market value of our securities may be adversely affected by events elsewhere. Payment of cash dividends may be affected by the exchange rate of the peso versus the dollar. Because we pay cash dividends in pesos, exchange rate fluctuations will affect the U.S. dollar amounts received by holders of ADRs upon conversion of such cash dividends by BNY Mellon, who acts as our Depositary Bank. The protection afforded to non-controlling stockholders in Mexico is different from that in the United States. Under Mexican law, the protection afforded to minority stockholders is different from that in the United States. In particular, the law concerning fiduciary duties of directors is not well developed, there is no procedure for class actions or stockholder derivative actions, and there are different procedural requirements for bringing stockholder lawsuits. As a result, in practice it may be more difficult for the minority stockholders of Bachoco to enforce their rights against us or our directors or our controlling stockholder than it would be for stockholders of a U.S. company. Our bylaws restrict the ability of non-Mexican stockholders to invoke the protection of their governments with respect to their rights as stockholders. As required by Mexican law, our bylaws provide that non-Mexican stockholders shall be considered as Mexicans with respect to their ownership interests in Bachoco and shall be deemed to have agreed not to invoke the protection of their governments in certain circumstances. Under this provision, a non-Mexican stockholder is deemed to have agreed not to invoke the protection of its own government by asking such government to interpose a diplomatic claim against the Mexican government with respect to the stockholder’s rights as a stockholder, but is not deemed to have waived any other rights it may have, including any rights under the U.S. federal securities laws, with respect to its investment in Bachoco. If you invoke such governmental protection in violation of this agreement, your Shares could be forfeited to the Mexican government. Our bylaws may only be enforced in Mexico. Our bylaws provide that legal actions relating to the execution, interpretation or performance of the bylaws may be brought only in Mexican courts. As a result, it may be difficult for non-Mexican stockholders to enforce their stockholder rights pursuant to the bylaws. 15 It may be difficult to enforce civil liabilities against us or our directors, officers and controlling persons. We are organized under the laws of Mexico, and most of our directors, officers and controlling persons reside outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to affect service of process within the United States on such persons or to enforce judgments against them. This pertains also to any action based on civil liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws. There is doubt as to the enforceability against such persons in Mexico, whether in original actions or in actions to enforce judgments of U.S. courts of liabilities based solely on the U.S. federal securities laws. Non-Mexican stockholders may not be entitled to participate in future preemptive rights offerings. Under Mexican law and our bylaws, if we issue new Shares for cash as part of a capital increase, we must grant our stockholders the right to purchase a sufficient number of Shares to maintain their existing ownership percentage in the Company (“preemptive rights”). We can allow holders of ADRs in the United States to exercise preemptive rights in any future capital increase only in one of the following two circumstances: (i) we file a registration statement with the SEC with respect to that future issuance of Shares; or (ii) the offering qualifies for an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We make no promises that we will file a registration statement with the SEC to allow holders of ADRs in the United States to participate in a preemptive rights offering. As a result, the equity interests of such holders in the Company may be diluted proportionately. In addition, under current Mexican law, it is not practicable for the depositary to sell preemptive rights and distribute the proceeds from such sales to ADR holders.
