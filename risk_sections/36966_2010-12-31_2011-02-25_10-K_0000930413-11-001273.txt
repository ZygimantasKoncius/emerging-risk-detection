ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS This Item outlines specific risks that could affect the ability of our various businesses to compete, change our risk profile, or materially impact our financial results and condition. Our operating environment continues to evolve and new risks continue to emerge. To address that challenge we have a risk management governance structure that oversees processes for monitoring evolving risks and oversees various initiatives designed to manage and control our potential exposure. 18 The following discussion highlights risks which could impact us in material ways by causing our future results to differ materially from our past results, by causing future results to differ materially from current expectations, or by causing material changes in our financial condition. In this Item we have outlined risks that we believe are important to us at the present time. However, other risks may prove to be important in the future, and new risks may emerge at any time. We cannot predict with certainty all potential developments which could materially affect our financial performance or condition.

Forward-looking statements are statements that are not a representation of historical information but rather are related to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. The words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, should, is likely, will, going forward, and other expressions that indicate future events and trends identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, operational, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, and many of which, with respect to future business decisions and actions (including acquisitions and divestitures), are subject to change. Examples of uncertainties and contingencies include, among other important factors: general and local economic and business conditions, including economic recession or depression; the level and length of deterioration in the residential housing and commercial real estate markets; potential requirements for First Horizon to repurchase previously sold or securitized mortgages; potential claims relating to the foreclosure process; expectations of and actual timing and amount of interest rate movements, including the slope of the yield curve, which can have a significant impact on a financial services institution; market and monetary fluctuations, including fluctuations in mortgage markets; inflation or deflation; customer, investor, regulatory, and legislative responses to any or all of these conditions; the financial condition of borrowers and other counterparties; competition within and outside the financial services industry; geopolitical developments including possible terrorist activity; natural disasters; effectiveness and cost-efficiency of our hedging practices; technology; demand for our product offerings; new products and services in the industries in which we operate; and critical accounting estimates. Other factors are those inherent in originating, selling, servicing, and holding loans and loan-based assets including prepayment risks, pricing concessions, fluctuation in U.S. housing and other real estate prices, fluctuation of collateral values, and changes in customer profiles. Additionally, the actions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal 19 Reserve), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau), the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council), and other regulators; regulatory, administrative, and judicial proceedings and changes in laws and regulations applicable to us; and our success in executing our business plans and strategies and managing the risks involved in the foregoing, could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update or revise, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, any forward-looking statements that are made in this report or in any other statement, release, report, or filing from time to time. Actual results could differ and expectations could change, possibly materially, because of one or more factors, including those factors listed above or presented below, in other sections of this report, or in material incorporated by reference into this report. Readers of this report should carefully consider the factors discussed in this Item below, among others, in evaluating forward-looking statements and assessing our prospects. Competition Risks We compete with other financial services companies for customers. Our primary areas of competition include: retail and commercial deposits and bank loans, wealth management, personal or consumer loans including home mortgages and lines of credit, capital markets products and services, and other consumer and business financial products and services. Our competitors in these areas include national, state, and non-US banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, trust companies, investment counseling firms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies and agencies, securities firms, mortgage banking companies, hedge funds, and other financial services companies that serve the markets which we serve. Some competitors are banks, subject to the same regulatory regime as we are, while others are not banks and in many cases experience a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation. We expect that competition will continue to grow more intense with respect to most of our products and services. Heightened competition tends to put downward pressure on revenues from affected items, upward pressure on marketing and other promotional costs, or both. For additional information regarding competition for customers, refer to the Competition heading of Part I, Item 1 beginning on page 16 of this report. We compete for financial capital. See Financing, Funding, and Liquidity Risks beginning on page 31 of this report for additional information concerning those risks. We also compete to acquire and retain the human capital we need to thrive. The primary tools we use to attract and retain talent are: salaries; commission, incentive, and retention compensation programs; retirement benefits; change in control severance benefits; health and other welfare benefits; and our corporate culture. To the extent we are unable to use these tools effectively, we face the risk that, over time, our best talent will leave us and we will be unable to replace those persons effectively. Risk From Economic Downturns and Changes Delinquencies and credit losses generally increase during economic downturns due to an increase in liquidity problems for customers and downward pressure on collateral values. Likewise, demand for loans (at a given level of creditworthiness), deposit and other products, and financial services may decline during an economic downturn, and may be adversely affected by other national, regional, or local economic factors that impact demand for loans and other financial products and services. Such factors include, for example, changes in interest rates, real estate prices, or expectations concerning rates or prices. Accordingly, an economic downturn or other adverse economic change (local, regional, national, or global) can hurt our 20 financial performance in the form of higher loan losses, lower loan production levels, lower deposit levels, and lower fees from transactions and services. Since 2007, our operating results have been adversely affected by such a weakness in the economy, especially in real estate markets and commercial lending. In 2010 we experienced overall credit quality improvement, but with volatility from quarter to quarter in some portfolios. For example, at the end of 2010 our income commercial real estate portfolio remains stressed and we continue to expect industry conditions for income commercial real estate to remain stressed. Although we expect those overall and specific trends to continue into 2011, that expectation depends upon a continued mild economic recovery, among other things, which may not occur. If the strength of the U.S. economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which we conduct operations in particular decline, that could result in, among other things, a further deterioration in credit quality, including a resultant adverse effect on our loan portfolio and allowance for loan losses. Growth and Disposition Risks Every organization faces risks associated with growth. Our growth from 2003 to 2007 resulted primarily from a combination of: our expansion strategy in banking based on our mortgage operations; acquisition of customers from competitors that have merged with each other; and targeted non-bank business acquisitions. In 2007 and 2008 we modified our strategy in response to substantial and rapid changes in business conditions. As a result, in 2008 we sold our national mortgage platforms, closed our national specialty lending operations, and renewed our emphasis on financial services in our traditional Tennessee-based markets. Although our strategy is expected to evolve as business conditions continue to change, at present our strategys primary components are to invest capital and other resources in our current Tennessee-based retail/commercial banking market footprints, and in our capital markets business. Growth is expected to be coordinated with a focus on stronger and more stable returns on capital. Our growth in the past has been primarily organic rather than through substantial acquisitions; in the future, that pattern may shift if appropriate opportunities, within or outside of our current markets, present themselves. We believe that the successful execution of our strategy depends upon a number of key elements, including: ● our ability to attract and retain banking customers in our Tennessee-based regional banking market areas; ● in our capital markets business, our ability to maintain or strengthen our existing customer relationships while at the same time identifying and successfully executing upon opportunities to provide new or existing products and services to new or existing customers in the US and overseas; ● our ability to develop and retain profitable customer relationships while expanding or enhancing our existing information processing, technology, and other operational infrastructures effectively and efficiently; ● our ability to manage the liquidity and capital requirements associated with organic growth; and ● our ability to manage any operational, cultural, liquidity or capital risks associated with growth through purchases. We have in place strategies designed to achieve those elements that are significant to us at present. Our challenge is to execute those strategies and adjust them, or adopt new strategies, as conditions change. To the extent we engage in bank or non-bank business acquisitions, we face various risks associated with that practice, including: 21 ● our ability to identify, analyze, and correctly assess the execution, contingency, and other risks in the acquisition and to price the transaction appropriately; ● our ability to integrate the acquired company into our operations quickly and cost-effectively; ● our ability to integrate the franchise value of the acquired company with our own; and, ● our ability to retain customers and key employees of the acquired company. At times a company must consider exiting businesses or units that no longer fit into managements plans for the future. We have made several exit moves in recent years and could do so again as we continue to adapt to a changing business and regulatory environment. Key risks associated with exiting a business include: ● our ability to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate acceptable terms; ● our ability to identify and implement key customer, technology systems, and other transition actions to avoid or minimize negative effects on retained businesses; ● our ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the exited business had with our retained businesses; and ● our ability to manage capital, liquidity, and other challenges that may arise in the event of an exit that results in significant cash expenditures or a financial loss. Risks Related to Exited Businesses In 2008 we sold or closed our national mortgage and national specialty lending businesses. However, we retain as assets many of the loans that those businesses created. Most of those loans are secured by residential or other real estate situated across the U.S. We also retain a substantial portion of the mortgage servicing rights that we previously serviced, we continue to maintain hedge positions that we obtain to manage certain risks related to those retained servicing rights, and we retain the risk of liability to parties with whom we made contracts in the course of operating those businesses. These legacy assets and positions continue to impose risks on us. Key risks include: ● The retail and commercial loans on our books from our former national specialty lending business have experienced significantly higher default and loss rates compared to pre-recession years. For example, due to declining home values, home loans secured on a second-lien basis in a significant number of cases have little or no collateral value to cover the loan if it defaults. Accordingly, a default on such a loan today will result in a much higher loss severity than would have resulted shortly after the loan was originated. ● The incidence of parties claiming that mortgage loans that we sold to them did not meet contractual standards rose substantially in 2010, and we are defending a few claims brought in 2010 that our disclosures concerning securitized loans were deficient. Those trends may continue in 2011. Additional information concerning this risk appears in Mortgage Repurchase and Related Risks beginning on page 24 of this report. ● The incidence of counterparty loss on hedges, swaps, and other such instruments associated with mortgage servicing rights may rise as those counterparties experience financial stress or failure. ● In 2008 we contracted with the purchaser of our national mortgage business to subservice the mortgage loans as to which we retained servicing rights and obligations. In 2011 that contract will expire and we will have to obtain a new subservicer. We expect that our subservicing costs are likely to increase substantially under the terms of any new agreement relative to the terms of our 2008 agreement. 22 Other trends adverse to us may emerge from these legacy assets and positions as counterparties are stressed by economic conditions, and of course some of these impacts apply to continuing businesses. Over time those losses and risks related to legacy items should diminish since those exited businesses will not generate new loans and new contracts, but it is not possible to predict when that may occur. Reputation Risks Our ability to conduct and grow our businesses, and to obtain and retain customers, is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our business practices and our financial stability. Our reputation is, therefore, a key asset for us. Our reputation is affected principally by our own practices and how those practices are perceived and understood by others. Adverse perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, also may adversely impact our reputation. In addition, negative perceptions relating to parties with whom we have important relationships may adversely impact our reputation. Senior management oversees processes for reputation risk monitoring, assessment, and management. Damage to our reputation could hinder our ability to access the capital markets or otherwise impact our liquidity, could hamper our ability to attract new customers and retain existing ones, could impact the market value of our stock, could create or aggravate regulatory difficulties, and could undermine our ability to attract and retain talented employees, among other things. Adverse impacts on our reputation, or the reputation of our industry, may also result in greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws or regulations that change or constrain our business or operations. Events that result in damage to our reputation also may increase our litigation risk. Credit Risks We face the risk that our customers may not repay their loans and that the realizable value of collateral may be insufficient to avoid a loss. We also face risks that other counterparties, in a wide range of situations, may fail to honor their obligations to pay us. In our business some level of credit loss is unavoidable and overall levels of credit loss can vary over time. Since 2007 our credit losses, especially related to lending, increased to historically high levels. Although in recent quarters our credit losses have abated, in 2010 credit losses and reserves remained significantly elevated. Our ability to manage credit risks depends primarily upon our ability to assess the creditworthiness of loan customers and other counterparties and the value of any collateral, including real estate. We manage lending credit risk by attempting to diversify our loan portfolio, by managing its granularity, and by recording and managing an allowance for expected loan losses based on the factors mentioned above and in accordance with applicable accounting rules. We also record loan charge-offs in accordance with accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules. These guidelines and rules could change and cause charge-offs to increase for reasons related or unrelated to the underlying performance of our portfolio. Moreover, the SEC could take accounting positions applicable to our holding company that may be inconsistent with those taken by the OCC or other regulators for the Bank. We manage other counterparty credit risk in a variety of ways, some of which are discussed in other parts of this Item 1A and all of which have as a primary goal the avoidance having too much risk concentrated with any one counterparty. A significant challenge for us is to keep the credit and other models and approaches we use to originate and manage loans updated to take into account changes in the competitive environment, in real estate prices and other collateral values, and in the economy, among other things, based on our experience originating loans and servicing loan portfolios. In recent years we have changed our models and approaches based on changes in circumstances, and we will continue to do so as conditions change. At times those changes have had significant impacts upon our reported financial results and condition. In addition, we use 23 those models and approaches to manage our loan portfolios and lending businesses. To the extent our models and approaches are not consistent with underlying real-world conditions, our management decisions could be adversely affected with substantial adverse consequences to us. Additional information concerning credit risks and our management of them is set forth under the captions Credit Risk Management beginning on page 55 and Allowance for Loan Losses beginning on page 77 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. Mortgage Repurchase and Related Risks Like many other financial institutions that originated and sold significant amounts of mortgage loans, we have experienced elevated exposure to repurchase obligations from investors. Prior to August 2008, we originated loans through our legacy mortgage business, primarily first lien home loans, with the intention of selling them. A substantial majority of such loans were sold without recourse as to credit defaults by the borrowers. From 2005 through 2008, we originated and sold $69.5 billion original principal amount of first lien mortgage loans to government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) in so-called whole-loan sales. Although additional GSE whole-loan sales occurred in earlier years, a substantial majority of GSE repurchase requests (discussed below) have come from that period. In addition, from 2000 through 2007, we securitized $40.8 billion original principal amount of first lien mortgage loans and $2.5 billion original principal amount of HELOC loans without recourse in proprietary transactions. Whole-loan purchasers have increased their efforts to seek to require loan sellers to repurchase those loans or to reimburse purchasers for losses related to those loans when losses are incurred due to actual or alleged failure to strictly conform to the purchase contract representations or warranties. A substantial majority of our whole loan sales were to GSEs. The representations and warranties generally are broader for whole loans sold to the GSEs than they are for the loans sold in proprietary securitizations. GSE representations and warranties claims typically include claims that loans that had missing or insufficient file documentation or that loans were obtained through fraud by borrowers or other third parties such as appraisers. As a result, we face increasing pressure from GSE and other whole-loan purchasers to repurchase those loans or to make the purchaser whole, and we face increasing expenses to administer and in some cases to defend against such claims. Although we have been increasing our reserves for repurchase losses significantly over prior quarters a risk remains that these reserves will not be adequate. For loans sold in proprietary securitizations we have exposure for investment rescission or damages arising from legal claims that the offering documents under which the loans were securitized were materially deficient. In 2010 we became one of many defendants in three such lawsuits, and we have had information subpoenaed in another matter which is not litigation against us at present. There is also potential repurchase exposure and rescission risk associated with the proprietary securitizations under the contracts through which the securitizations were created. The repurchase process is more difficult for securitization investors than it is for GSEs in whole loan sales, and at year-end no such requests had been received. Additionally, the HELOC securitizations are enhanced, or wrapped, by a monoline insurance company that has certain contractual rights to pursue repurchase. Also, the monoline insurer for three such securitizations has become insolvent. At December 31, 2010, based on applicable accounting guidance associated with pending litigation and in light of the absence of any conventional repurchase requests, we had no reserve for potential losses associated with private securitizations. A significant portion of the loans we sold to GSEs, and some of the loans in proprietary securitizations, were required to have private mortgage insurance (PMI). We have experienced a significant increase in the number of rescission notices we have received from the insurers which wrote these policies, based on claims of fraud or misrepresentations relating to the insured loans. To date a majority of 24 PMI cancellations have involved loans sold to GSEs. Although unresolved PMI cancellation notices are not formal repurchase requests, we include these in the active repurchase request pipeline when analyzing and estimating loss content in relation to the loans sold to GSEs. Our ability to predict repurchase losses is adversely affected by both the absence of significant historical precedent for repurchase requests of this scope and our lack of visibility into current loan information for the majority of the loans that we sold to GSEs. As a result of the sale of our national mortgage banking business in the third quarter of 2008 and later sales of mortgage servicing rights, we no longer service the majority of the loans that we sold to GSEs and therefore no longer have visibility into current loan information. Those facts increase the risk that our reserves may not reflect our actual ultimate loss. While the vast majority of claims made to date relate to whole-loan sales to GSEs, we could possibly see an increase in claims made with respect to other purchasers and investors, which may increase over time. As a result, the number of repurchase requests, PMI cancellation notices, or lawsuits may increase materially over time. An increase in the volume of such claims beyond what we are currently experiencing, or an increase in the loss rate we experience upon resolution of these claims, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additional information concerning these risks and our management of them is set forth under the captions Repurchase Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Other Contractual Obligations beginning on page 61 and Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability beginning on page 80 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. Operational Risks Our ability to conduct and grow our businesses is dependent in part upon our ability to create and maintain an appropriate operational and organizational infrastructure, manage expenses, and recruit and retain personnel with the ability to manage a complex business. Operational risk can arise in many ways, including: errors related to failed or inadequate physical, operational, information technology, or other processes; faulty or disabled computer or other technology systems; fraud, theft, physical security breaches, electronic data and related security breaches, or other criminal conduct by employees or third parties; and exposure to other external events. Inadequacies may present themselves in a myriad of ways, and actions taken to manage one risk may be ineffective against others. For example, information technology systems may be insufficiently redundant to withstand a fire, incursion, or other major casualty, and they may be insufficiently adaptable to new business conditions or opportunities. Efforts to make such systems more robust may also make them less adaptable, and vice-versa. In addition, we outsource some of our operational functions to third parties. Those third parties may experience similar errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control and, in some cases, limited ability to quickly obtain an alternate vendor. To the extent we increase our reliance on third party vendors to perform or assist operational functions, the challenge of managing the associated risks becomes more difficult. For example, in 2008 we sold our national mortgage origination and servicing platforms. We retained significant servicing right assets, however, and we continue to originate mortgage products in our regional banking markets in and around Tennessee. Of practical necessity, we outsourced our servicing functions to the purchaser of our platforms, and since then we have outsourced many key roles in the Tennessee-based mortgage origination process to a third party. Managing the operational, compliance, 25 reputational, liability, and other risks associated with this level of outsourcing in those business areas is an ongoing challenge for us. Failure to build and maintain the necessary operational infrastructure, or failure of our disaster preparedness plans if primary infrastructure components suffer damage, can lead to risk of loss of service to customers, legal actions, and noncompliance with applicable laws or regulatory standards. Operational risk is specifically managed through internal monitoring, measurement, and assessment by line management and oversight of processes by top management, and by maintaining systems to adhere to regulatory guidance. Additional information concerning operational risks and our management of them appears under the caption Operational Risk Management beginning on page 54 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. Service Risks We engage in a wide range of activities in which we provide services to customers. These activities create risk of claims against us that the services were provided in a manner that harmed the customer or a third party, or were contrary to applicable laws or rules. These activities include fiduciary, custodial, funds management, and advisory services, among others. We manage these risks primarily through training programs, compliance programs, and supervision processes. Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal Risks We operate in a heavily regulated industry. The regulatory environment has been changing more rapidly in recent years, and the regulatory burdens generally have been increasing, as a result of recent events affecting traditional banking, mortgage banking, and financial markets generally. Heightened levels of regulatory change are likely to continue for at least the next several years. We are subject to many banking, deposit, insurance, insurance brokerage, securities brokerage and underwriting, and consumer lending regulations in addition to the rules applicable to all companies publicly traded in the U.S. securities markets and, in particular, on the New York Stock Exchange. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in financial, structural, and operational penalties. In addition, efforts to comply with applicable regulations may increase our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities. See Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this report, beginning on page 5, for additional information concerning financial industry regulations. Federal and state regulations significantly limit the types of activities in which we, as a financial institution, may engage. In addition, we are subject to a wide array of other regulations that govern other aspects of how we conduct our business, such as in the areas of employment and intellectual property. Federal and state legislative and regulatory authorities increasingly consider changing these regulations or adopting new ones. Such actions could further limit the amount of interest or fees we can charge, could further restrict our ability to collect loans or realize on collateral, could affect the terms or profitability of the products and services we offer, or could materially affect us in other ways. Additional federal and state consumer protection regulations also could expand the privacy protections afforded to customers of financial institutions, restricting our ability to share or receive customer information and increasing our costs. The following paragraphs highlight certain specific important risk areas related to legal matters currently. These paragraphs do not describe these risks exhaustively, and they do not describe all legal risks that we face currently. Moreover, the importance of specific risks will grow or diminish as circumstances change. 26 Regulatory and Other Pressures Related to Operating Results The Bank is required to maintain certain regulatory capital levels and ratios, as discussed under the caption Capital Adequacy beginning on page 8 of this report. If the Banks financial losses from recent years were to resume, or if the regulatory requirements were to increase, then at some point the Banks ability to meet those requirements could be adversely affected. Those effects would be made worse if the regulatory requirements become more stringent, as is expected. Pressure to maintain appropriate capital levels and address business needs in a weak economy may lead to actions that could be adverse to our shareholders, at least in the short term. Such actions that have occurred in the past three years include the elimination of our common cash dividend (which was reinstated at one cent per share in January 2011), two sales of our common stock and the issuance of a common stock warrant at times when market prices were relatively disadvantageous, and a contraction of our balance sheet (involving sales or other dispositions of assets or businesses) at times when market values were depressed. Further such actions could occur. Recent Legislation: Dodd-Frank Act The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (DF Act) was enacted on July 21, 2010. The DF Act made a substantial number of significant changes to how financial services companies are regulated. Additional information concerning the DF Act is provided in the section captioned Dodd-Frank Act beginning on page 13 of this report, which section is incorporated by reference into this Item 1A. Many of the most sweeping changes in the DF Act are not complete or specific but instead authorize potentially expansive new regulations to be issued in the future. At this time it is not known how the DF Act and the regulations that eventually will be adopted under it will affect the financial services industry in general or our company in particular, and it could be several years before all the impacts are known. Although it is not possible to summarize in any detail the effects of this legislation, one likely overall impact upon us will be to increase our regulatory compliance and certain other costs significantly. In addition, it is possible that our operations and associated revenues will be constrained in some respects, perhaps significantly in some areas. Areas covered by the DF Act which presently appear likely to present the greatest risks to us are mentioned below: ● Due to the scope of the new regulations authorized, it is likely that our compliance costs will rise appreciably over the next several years, and a substantial portion of that increase likely will be permanent. ● Recently proposed regulations under the DF Acts so-called Durbin Amendment would severely cap the interchange fees which banks charge merchants for debit card transactions. It has been reported that the proposed cap could reduce banking industry reveues from interchange fees by more than 70% on average. A reduction of that scale could cost the Bank $30 million in revenues from interchange fees and could disrupt that business, and is likely to cause the Bank and others in the industry to revamp debit card practices and fee structures. The Bank may not be able to recover all of the revenues lost in the revamping process. ● There is a risk that the burden of many of the increased compliance costs could be uneven over the industry in terms of the impact to each institutions efficiency ratio (the ratio of costs to revenues), leaving some institutions disadvantaged relative to others. Uneven outcomes could arise because: larger institutions may be able to bear some of the new costs more efficiently due to economies of scale; some new burdens do not apply to smaller institutions at all or are intended to impact community banks much less than regional, national, or international banks; and, there is a risk of unintended impacts. Uneven impact may be inevitable because in most cases each new 27 burden will apply only to a narrow range of activities, institutions have differing mixes of business activities, and the various burdens will be unequal from one activity to the next. ● A new regulatory agency has been created: the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, or Bureau. The Bureau has substantial authority over our consumer finance products and services, and therefore is likely to have a substantial impact on our retail financial services businesses. Although presently unknown, the Bureaus rules could conflict with, and possibly override, our Banks primary regulator in consumer matters. Since the Bureaus mission is not focused upon the safety and soundness of our Bank, conflicts of that sort could be significantly adverse to us. The Bureaus rule-making authority is extensive, including such things as setting terms and conditions on consumer products and services and defining deceptive practices. The Bureaus rules could substantially reduce revenues, increase costs and risks, and otherwise make our consumer products and services less profitable or unprofitable. ● The DF Acts new municipal advisor registration regime could adversely affect our capital markets and other activities with municipal customers. ● The DF Act allows banks to pay interest on certain business checking accounts beginning in 2011. If the industry responds by competing for those deposits with interest-bearing accounts, this provision would put some degree of downward pressure upon our net interest margin when it becomes effective. ● The DF Act is likely to substantially increase our deposit insurance costs. The assessment rate is expected to increase, at least temporarily, and the base upon which the assessment is made has been expanded from insured deposits to include all consolidated assets less tangible capital. ● The DF Acts new requirements on mortgage lenders and securitizers could adversely impact our ability to conduct mortgage lending activities, and similarly could impact banks which are customers of ours. Regarding that last matter, we provide or facilitate working capital to support the mortgage lending businesses of some of our bank customers; those activities of ours could be harmed if our customers businesses are harmed. ● Regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the FDIC, have been given expansive authority to regulate compensation and many other matters throughout our company in connection with enhanced risk regulation functions. If new regulations in this area are severe, they could adversely impact our ability to attract or retain key employees and could make some business activities impractical for banks and bank holding companies. ● The DF Act appears to weaken existing federal pre-emption of state laws which regulate certain banking and financial activities, especially activities involving consumer customers, and it may limit the ability of federal regulators to pre-empt state laws in the future. In general, a weakening of federal pre-emption tends to increase our compliance and operational costs and risks, and can increase them substantially. Additional information on this topic is provided in the section captioned Federal and State Regulatory Jurisdiction beginning on page 29 of this report. ● The DF Act has excluded certain items, including trust preferred securities, from Tier 1 capital of financial institutions having assets of $15 billion or more. A direct effect of this exclusion will be to remove $200 million of currently outstanding securities from our Tier 1 capital after a phase-out period has passed. Perhaps more importantly, this provision could adversely affect our capital markets business in the future, which traditionally has helped other financial institutions issue trust preferred securities. Recent Legislation: Healthcare In 2010 a sweeping healthcare reform law was enacted. Many of the most significant provisions of this legislation depend upon substantial, and as yet unknown, regulations and other rules, and the application of many provisions are to be phased in over several years. Accordingly, the overall impact of the law upon us will not be known for some time. However, at this early time it appears likely that the new law will increase our costs and there is a significant risk that the increases over time will be substantial. 28 Federal and State Regulatory Jurisdiction Some state authorities from time to time have challenged, and on occasion continue to challenge, the position of the OCC that it is the exclusive regulator of various aspects of national banks or their operating subsidiaries. If one or more of those challenges were successful, or if Congress or the OCC were to change the applicable banking laws or regulations, we could be impacted significantly, due, among other things, to possible increased regulatory burdens, governmental (including state attorney general) and private party actions alleging non-compliance with state law, and the expense of tracking and complying with the different laws and regulations of those states in which we do business. In its 2009 decision known as Cuomo v. Clearing House Association L.L.C., the U.S. Supreme Court determined that the OCC does not have the exclusive ability to enforce certain state and local laws applicable to certain business activities of national banks which are not pre-empted by federal law. The Cuomo decision modified the position of the OCC and lower court decisions that had affirmed the OCCs regulations regarding its visitorial power, and limited the application of a 2007 Supreme Court decision known as Watters v. Wachovia Bank N.A. which had been viewed as indirectly supportive of the OCCs position. Cuomo holds that the National Bank Act allows states to enforce non-pre-empted laws through judicial proceedings against national banks. As discussed in the immediately preceding section captioned Recent Legislation  Dodd-Frank Act, federal pre-emption of state banking laws and regulations appears to have been weakened in 2010, though the effect that legislation remains unclear. Most states and some communities have in place various laws pertaining to lending and other business activities conducted by banks, some of which may not be pre-empted by federal law. Dealing with potential state and local enforcement activity relating to non-pre-empted laws would, at a minimum, increase the compliance costs for national banks that have multi-state operations. Mortgage Foreclosure Risks State and federal officials have announced and commenced inquiries and investigations into the procedures followed by mortgage servicing companies and banks, including us and our subservicer, in completing affidavits relating to foreclosures and into the authority of the servicer to foreclose if assignments of legal interests in the mortgage loans have not been properly recorded. We have received letters of informal inquiry from a few state attorneys general and are responding to and cooperating with those inquiries. Additional state or federal inquiries or investigations may be commenced. We cannot predict at this early stage the ultimate outcome of these inquiries and investigations or the impact that they could have on our financial condition, results of operations or business. Additional information concerning foreclosure-related risks and our management of them is set forth under the captions Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability beginning on page 71, Foreclosure Practices beginning on page 75, Subserviced Loan Modification Programs beginning on page 76, and Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability beginning on page 80 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. Litigation Risks We face litigation risks from customers, employees, vendors, contractual parties, and other persons, either singly or in class actions, and from federal or state regulators. We manage those risks through internal controls, personnel training, insurance, litigation management, our compliance and ethics processes, and other means. However, the commencement, outcome, and magnitude of litigation cannot be predicted or controlled with certainty. Since 2008 the risks of certain types of litigation have increased. For us, the most notable of those types are (i) lender liability claims, (ii) claims involving other types of distressed counterparties, (iii) claims 29 based on declines in our stock price, and (iv) a new type of lender tort claim. The risk from the first two types has increased primarily because borrowers and other contractual counterparties have experienced financial stress, in many cases resulting in an attempt to obtain funds or relief from a solvent party (us). We expect that this heightened risk level will not abate until after economic conditions substantially improve. The elevated risk associated with type (iii) largely is a result of our volatile stock price performance in 2007 and 2008, and eventually should fall back to ordinary levels if volatility in our stock price remains relatively moderate. Regarding type (iv), some local governments or agencies have claimed that certain lenders in their communities have created a public nuisance, engaged in predatory or discriminatory lending, or otherwise are liable for the alleged consequences of inappropriate consumer lending, especially home mortgage lending. Lender tort claims of this sort, where alleged damages are measured on a statistical and/or city-wide basis, create litigation costs immediately and create a risk of significant litigation losses for those lenders which are named as defendants in them. Moreover, claims of this sort adversely alter the business climate and raise the costs and risks for all lenders, both in the communities involved and in similar communities across the country. Risks of Expense Control Expenses and other costs directly affect our earnings. Our ability to successfully manage expenses is important to our long-term survival and prosperity. Many factors can influence the amount of our expenses, as well as how quickly they grow. As our businesses change, either by expansion or contraction, additional expenses can arise from asset purchases, structural reorganization, evolving business strategies, and changing regulations, among other things. We manage expense growth and risk through a variety of means, including selectively outsourcing or multi-sourcing various functions and procurement coordination and processes, and through an expense management committee. Geographic Risks Our capital markets business is national in scope, and our capital markets division has a business presence in selected Asian markets. Also, we continue to hold substantial assets across the U.S. originated under our now-discontinued national lending businesses. However, our traditional banking business remains grounded in, and depends upon, the major Tennessee markets. As a result, although some of our business operations and assets are exposed to geographically broad risks, to a significant degree our banking business is exposed to economic, regulatory, natural disaster, and other risks that primarily impact Tennessee and neighboring states where we do our traditional banking business. In other words, if the Tennessee region experiences adversity not shared by other parts of the country, we are likely to experience adversity to a degree not shared by those competitors which have a broader footprint. Non-U.S. Operations Risks We have two capital markets offices outside of the United States, in Hong Kong and Tokyo. Opening and operating non-U.S. offices creates a number of risks. Specific risks associated with any non-U.S. presence include: the risk that taxes, licenses, fees, prohibitions, and other barriers and constraints may be created or increased by the U.S. or other countries that would impact our ability to operate overseas profitably or at all; the risk that our assets and operations in a particular country could be nationalized in whole or part without adequate compensation; the risk that currency exchange rates could move unfavorably so as to diminish or destroy the U.S. dollar value of assets, or to enlarge the U.S. dollar value of liabilities, denominated in those currencies; the risk that legal recourse against foreign counterparties may be limited in unexpected ways; risks and costs associated with U.S. banking and other regulation of non-U.S. business activities; and the risk that political or cultural preferences in a particular host country might become 30 antagonistic to U.S. companies. Our ability to manage those and other risks will depend upon a number of factors, including: our ability to recognize and anticipate differences in cultural and other expectations applicable to customers, employees, regulators, vendors, and other business partners and counterparties; our ability to recognize and act upon opportunities and constraints peculiar to the countries and cultures in which our offices operate; our ability to recognize and manage any exchange rate risks to which we are exposed; and our ability to anticipate the stability of or changes in the political, legal, and monetary systems of the countries in which our offices operate. Insurance We use insurance to manage a number of risks, including damage or destruction of property, legal and other liability, and certain types of credit risks. Not all such risks are insured, in any given insured situation our insurance may be inadequate to cover all loss, and many risks we face are uninsurable. For those risks that are insured, we also face the risks that the insurer may default on its obligations or that the insurer may refuse to honor them. We treat the former risk as a type of credit risk, which we manage by reviewing the insurers that we use and by striving to use more than one insurer when practical. The risk of refusal, whether due to honest disagreement or bad faith, is inherent in any contractual situation. A portion of our retail loan portfolio involves mortgage default insurance. If a default insurer were to experience a significant credit downgrade or were to become insolvent, that could adversely affect the carrying value of loans insured by that company, which could result in an immediate increase in our loan loss provision or write-down of the carrying value of those loans on our balance sheet and, in either case, a corresponding impact on our financial results. If many default insurers were to experience downgrades or insolvency at the same time, the risk of a financial impact would be amplified and the disruption to the default insurance industry could curtail our ability to originate new loans that need such insurance, which would result in a loss of business for us. Financing, Funding, and Liquidity Risks Management of liquidity and related risks is a key function for our business. Additional information concerning liquidity risk management is set forth under the caption Liquidity Management beginning on page 58 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. In general, the costs of our funding directly impact our costs of doing business and, therefore, can positively or negatively affect our financial results. Our funding requirements in 2010 were met principally by deposits and by financing from other financial institutions. Historically we also depended upon financing from private institutional investors by means of the capital markets. In 2008 and 2009 we were not able to utilize the private markets economically, but late in 2010 we issued and sold $500 million of senior notes in an underwritten offering. The recent past illustrates, however, the risk that capital markets may become unavailable for reasons beyond our control. Deposits traditionally have provided our most affordable funds, and in 2010 our deposits were trending upward despite the low-interest-rate environment. However, deposit trends can shift with economic conditions; if the economy improves, deposit levels in our Bank might fall as depositors become more comfortable with risk and seek higher returns in other vehicles. A number of more general factors could make such funding more difficult, more expensive, or unavailable on affordable terms, including, but not limited to, our financial results, organizational or political changes, adverse impacts on our reputation, changes in the activities of our business partners, disruptions in the capital markets, specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry, counterparty availability, changes affecting our loan portfolio or other assets, changes affecting our corporate and 31 regulatory structure, interest rate fluctuations, ratings agency actions, general economic conditions, and the legal, regulatory, accounting, and tax environments governing our funding transactions. In addition, our ability to raise funds is strongly affected by the general state of the U.S. and world economies and financial markets as well as the policies and capabilities of the U.S. government and its agencies, and may become or remain increasingly difficult due to economic and other factors beyond our control. Events affecting interest rates, markets, and other factors which adversely impact our ability or desire to access the capital markets for funding likewise may adversely affect the demand for our services in our capital markets business. As a result, disruptions in those areas may adversely impact our earnings in that business unit as well as in our regional banking unit. For instance, disruptions in 2007 that were related to mortgages and mortgage-backed assets significantly reduced the demand for certain of our capital markets products and services and increased the costs and uncertainties associated with our mortgage servicing portfolio. Rating agencies assign credit ratings to issuers and their debt. In that role, agencies directly affect the availability and cost of our funding. The Corporation and the Bank currently receive ratings from several rating entities for unsecured borrowings. A rating below investment grade typically reduces availability and increases the cost of market-based funding. A debt rating of Baa3 or higher by Moodys Investors Service, or BBB- or higher by Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings, is considered investment grade for many purposes. At December 31, 2010, all three rating agencies rated the unsecured senior debt of the Corporation and the Bank as investment grade, although we were at or near the lowest levels of that grade. To the extent that in the future we depend on institutional borrowing and the capital markets for funding and capital, we could experience reduced liquidity and increased cost of funding if our debt ratings were lowered further, particularly if lowered below investment grade. In addition, other actions by ratings agencies can create uncertainty about our ratings in the future and thus can adversely affect the cost and availability of funding, including placing us on negative outlook or on watchlist. Please note that a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. In addition to the direct liquidity risks noted above, reductions in our credit ratings could allow counterparties to terminate and immediately force us to settle certain derivatives agreements, and could force us to provide additional collateral with respect to certain derivatives agreements. Additional information concerning those matters is provided under the caption Derivative Instruments within Note 25 to our financial statements, beginning on page 191 of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 15 of Part IV of this report. Certain regulatory laws or rules establish minimum capital levels or define risk-weighting for capital, regulate deposit insurance, and govern related funding matters for banks. Those laws or rules could be changed in a manner that could increase our overall cost of capital and thus reduce our earnings. Significant changes are expected in the next year or two, as mentioned in the next two paragraphs. International banking industry regulators have largely agreed upon significant changes in the regulation of capital required to be held by banks and their holding companies to support their businesses. The new international rules, known as Basel III, generally increase the capital required to be held, narrow the types of instruments which will qualify as providing appropriate capital, and tighten liquidity requirements. The Basel III requirements are complex and will be phased in over many years. The Basel III rules do not apply to U.S. banks or holding companies automatically. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (DF Act) requires U.S. regulators to reform the system under which the safety and soundness of banks and other financial institutions, individually and systemically, are regulated. That reform effort will include the regulation of 32 capital. It is not known whether or to what extent the U.S. regulators will incorporate elements of Basel III into the reformed U.S. regulatory system, but it is expected that the U.S. reforms will include an increase in capital requirements and a narrowing of what qualifies as appropriate capital. One likely effect of a significant tightening of U.S. capital requirements would be to increase our cost of capital, among other things. Any permanent significant increase in our cost of capital could have significant adverse impacts on the profitability of many of our products, the types of products we could offer profitably, our overall profitability, and our overall growth opportunities, among other things. Although most financial institutions would be affected, these business impacts could be felt unevenly, depending upon the business and product mix of each institution. Other potential effects could include less ability to pay cash dividends and repurchase our common shares, higher dilution of common shareholders, and a higher risk that we might fall below regulatory capital thresholds in an adverse economic cycle. Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks A significant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money. Accordingly, changes in interest rates directly impact our revenues and expenses, and potentially could expand or compress our net interest margin. We actively manage our balance sheet to control the risks of a reduction in net interest margin brought about by ordinary fluctuations in rates. Additional information concerning those risks and our management of them appears under the caption Interest Rate Risk Management beginning on page 56 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. Our mortgage servicing rights (MSR) portfolio is affected by changes in interest rates. Although we sold our mortgage servicing platform in 2008, at present we still retain substantial MSR assets. The value of MSR assets declines when the underlying loans are refinanced, otherwise paid early, or charged off. Generally, when interest rates increase, the value of MSR generally increases, and when rates decline the value of MSR tends to decline. However, those general tendencies do not result in concrete outcomes in all circumstances; for example, a decrease in interest rates does not always result in a predictable increase in refinancings because other factors may blunt loan demand or curtail credit availability. Additional information concerning those risks and our management of them appears under the caption Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) and Other Related Retained Interests beginning on page 77 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. We face the risks associated with movements in the yield curve. The yield curve simply shows the interest rates applicable to short and long term debt. The curve is steep when short-term rates are much lower than long-term rates; it is flat when short-term rates are equal, or nearly equal, to long-term rates; and it is inverted when short-term rates exceed long-term rates. Historically, the yield curve normally is positively sloped. However, the yield curve can be relatively flat or inverted for short or even protracted periods. A flat or inverted yield curve tends to decrease net interest margin, which would adversely impact our lending businesses, and it tends to reduce demand for long-term debt securities, which would adversely impact the revenues of our capital markets business. A prolonged inversion of the yield curve historically is so uncommon that it is difficult to predict all the effects that such a market condition is reasonably likely to create. Expectations by the market regarding the direction of future interest rate movements, particularly long-term rates, can impact the demand for long-term debt which in turn can impact the revenues of our capital markets business. That risk is most apparent during times when strong expectations have not yet been reflected in market rates, or when expectations are especially weak or uncertain. 33 Securities Inventories and Market Risks Our capital markets business buys and sells various types of securities for its institutional customers. In the course of that business we hold inventory positions and are exposed to certain risks of market fluctuations. In addition, we are exposed to credit risk and interest rate risk associated with debt securities. We manage the risks of holding inventories of securities through certain policies and procedures, including hedging activities related to certain interest rate risks. Additional information concerning those risks and our management of them appears under the caption Market Risk Management beginning on page 54 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report, and in the Credit Risks discussion beginning on page 23 of this report. In addition, we earn fees and other income related to our brokerage business and our management of assets for customers. Declines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in markets or market prices can adversely affect those revenue sources. We have exposure to risks related to securities markets in other respects as well. We have a number of assets and obligations that are linked, directly or indirectly, to major securities markets. Significant changes in market performance can have a material impact upon our assets, liabilities, and financial results. A major example of that linkage is our obligation to fund our pension plan so that it may satisfy benefit claims in the future. Our pension funding obligations generally depend upon actuarial estimates of benefits claims and actuarial estimates of future plan asset values. To a substantial extent the pension plan invests its assets in marketable securities. Our obligations to fund the plan can diminish substantially if the plans investments perform well, and can grow substantially if those investments perform poorly. Changes in those obligations generally translate into positive or negative changes in our pension expense, which in turn affects our financial performance. Although our obligations and expenses relative to the plan can be affected by many other things, including changes in our participating employee population and changes to the plan itself, declines in market performance in recent years have tended to increase our obligations to fund the pension plan, and that tendency is likely to continue to be felt over the next several years. We announced in 2009 that we will implement a freeze of new benefits after 2012, and we changed the asset allocation investment strategy; although we expect these changes to moderate future volatility in this area, risk of some level of volatility is unavoidable. That risk of volatility would be amplified if certain actuarial assumptions change adversely, especially the discount rate used to estimate the adequacy of assets to cover projected benefits, or if the accounting rules regarding pension liability estimates change adversely. Venture Capital Assets Venture capital investments are inherently volatile. The companies in which we have invested are much less mature, smaller, and much more unproven than a typical public company. Accordingly, those investments carry a substantial risk of loss which can be realized suddenly. Venture capital investments also are inherently illiquid. Although we have been winding down this business since 2008, the wind-down process is likely to occur over an extended period. At December 31, 2010 our venture capital investments had a book value of $13 million. Hedge Risks In the normal course of our businesses, including (among others) banking, capital markets, and legacy mortgage servicing, we attempt to create partial or full economic hedges of various, though not all, 34 financial risks. Our hedging activities are discussed in more detail in various places under the following captions of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report: Risk Management, beginning on page 53; and, Critical Accounting Policies, beginning on page 76. Hedging creates certain risks for us, including the risk that the other party to the hedge transaction will fail to perform (counterparty risk, which is a type of credit risk), and the risk that the hedge will not fully protect us from loss as intended (hedge failure risk). Unexpected counterparty failure or hedge failure could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings. Accounting Risks Uncertainties in Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. Three of our most critical estimates are: the level of the allowance for credit losses; the level of repurchase, make-whole, and foreclosure reserves; and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights. However, other estimates occasionally become highly significant, especially in volatile situations such as litigation and other loss contingency matters. Estimates are made at specific points in time; as actual events unfold, estimates are adjusted accordingly. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, it is possible that, at some time in the future, we may significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance, or we may recognize a significant provision for impairment of our goodwill or other assets, or we may recognize a significant decline in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights, or we may make some other adjustment that will differ materially from the estimates that we make today. For additional information concerning the sensitivity of these estimates, refer to Critical Accounting Policies beginning on page 76 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders. Changes to Rules and Practices In addition, accounting rules and practices change over time. Changes in accounting rules can significantly affect how we record and report assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and earnings. Although such changes generally affect all companies in a given industry, in practice changes sometimes have a disparate impact due to differences in the circumstances or business operations of companies within the same industry. Risks of Holding our Common Stock Holding Company Dividends Historically the Corporation has depended upon common dividends from the Bank for cash to fund common dividends paid to the Corporations shareholders. However, in part because of the losses experienced by the Bank since 2007, regulatory constraints generally will prevent the Bank from declaring and paying dividends to the Corporation in 2011 without regulatory approval. Also, we are required to provide financial support to the Bank. Additional information concerning those regulatory restrictions on the Bank is discussed in more detail under the heading Liquidity Management in the Managements Discussion and Analysis section beginning on page 58 of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, which section is incorporated herein by reference. 35 Furthermore, the Federal Reserve and the OCC have issued policy statements generally requiring insured banks and bank holding companies only to pay dividends out of current operating earnings. The Federal Reserve has released a supervisory letter advising bank holding companies, among other things, that as a general matter a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce its dividends if (i) the bank holding companys net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the bank holding companys prospective rate of earnings is not consistent with the bank holding companys capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. In 2008 the Corporation discontinued paying a quarterly cash dividend to its common stockholders and began distributing a dividend payable in shares of common stock. In 2010 the Corporation returned to profitability, but preferred stock dividends to the Treasury in connection with the TARP program significantly exceeded those earnings. In January 2011 the Corporation, having exited the TARP program, resumed a cash dividend at the rate of one cent per share, substantially lower than the rate prior to 2008. For the reasons mentioned above, our dividend rate may remain muted until our earnings are stronger and less volatile. Dilution Potential We may decide to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings to fund our operations, to increase our capital, or to expand. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities or instruments that are convertible into equity securities, the percentage ownership of our current stockholders will be reduced, the new equity securities may have rights and preferences superior to those of the common stock, and additional issuances could be at sales price which is dilutive to current stockholders. We may also issue equity securities directly as consideration for acquisitions we may make that could be dilutive to current stockholders. Anti-takeover Provisions Provisions of Tennessee law, and certain provisions of our charter and bylaws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or could have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. These provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be at a price attractive to many of our stockholders. ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
