D. RISK FACTORS We are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to or arising out of the nature of our business and general business, economic, financing, legal and other factors or conditions that may affect us. We believe that the occurrence of any one or some combination of the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry We have a history of substantial losses. We may experience additional losses in the future. We have incurred significant research and development expenses addressing the development of the metro CM-100 and CM-4000 products, both telecommunication equipment products addressing high transmission of data for the metropolitan area. We began to recognize revenues from sales of CM-100 products in 2004 and from sales of CM-4000 products in 2008. We were able to generate both operating income and net income for the first time in 2005, as well as in 2006, although at much lower levels than in 2005, as a result of the receipt of significant revenues from KDDI a Japanese telecommunication carrier. We incurred operating losses of approximately $32 million in 2007, $34 million in 2008 and $25 million in 2009 due to a significant decrease in revenues from KDDI. We also incurred significant net losses in each of those years. We cannot be s ure that we will be able to return to profitability. 5 Recent and future economic conditions, including turmoil in the financial and credit markets, may adversely affect our business. The current economic and credit crisis is having a significant negative impact on business around the world. The impact of this crisis on the technology industry and our major customers has been quite severe. Conditions may continue to be depressed or may be subject to further deterioration which could lead to a further reduction in consumer and customer spending overall, which could have an adverse impact on sales of our products. A disruption in the ability of our significant customers to access liquidity could cause serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of their businesses which could lead to a significant reduction in their orders of our products and the inability or failure on their part to meet their payment obligations to us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our res ults of operations and liquidity. In addition, any disruption in the ability of customers to access liquidity could lead customers to request longer payment terms from us or long-term financing of their purchases from us. If we are unable to grant extended payment terms when requested by customers, our sales could decrease. Granting extended payment terms or a significant adverse change in a customer’s financial and/or credit position would have an immediate negative effect on our cash balance, and could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer’s receivables or could limit our ability to collect receivables related to purchases by that customer. As a result, we may have to defer recognition of revenues, our reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase and our losses may increase. We depend on sales to a limited number of significant customers. The loss of a significant customer, or a decrease in purchases by a significant customer, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our revenues from 2004 through 2007 were dependent on sales of one product line, the CM-100, to KDDI, a Japanese telecommunication carrier, which remained a significant customer in 2008 and 2009. Approximately 99.3% of our revenues in 2007, 45.5% of our revenues in 2008 and 44% of our revenues in 2009 were derived from sales of these metro products to KDDI. We do not know for how long a period of time KDDI will continue to purchase products from us, nor do we have any control or influence over the purchasing decisions of KDDI, including the quantities and timing of the deployment of the CM-100 product line in its network. KDDI purchased the CM-100 for initial coverage deployment in its metropolitan area network. It began significant deployment in late 2004, continuing through 2005. KDDI’s deployments of the CM-100 decreased in 2 006 through 2009. Deployments by KDDI in 2010 may be insignificant. In 2007, we introduced the CM-4000, a metro product with additional features and capabilities. KDDI has not made purchases of this product and we do not know if KDDI will choose to make purchases of our CM-4000 product line. In 2008, our CM-100 and CM-4000 product lines were selected by Media Broadcast GmbH as a network infrastructure building block for network solutions deployed by Deutsche Telekom’s wholesale business unit, and leased to a leading cable operator in Germany. Media Broadcast, which was a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, began purchasing and deploying our products in 2008, becoming our second largest customer in 2008. Approximately 44.1% of our revenues in 2008 were derived from sales of metro products to Media Broadcast. Sales to Media Broadcast decreased significantly in 2009 and constituted approximately 13.6% of our revenues in 2009. To date, Media Broadcast has not purchased any CM-4000 products. There can be no assurance that the cable operator in Germany will continue to outsource the expansion of its network through Deutsche T elekom’s wholesale business unit. Deutsche Telekom sold Media Broadcast to Telediffusion de France in 2008. As a result, even if the cable operator outsources the expansion of its network through Deutsche Telekom’s wholesale business unit, there is no assurance that Deutsche Telekom will purchase products from Media Broadcast. Further, the cable operator is considering building its own network structure. If the cable operator decides to build its own network structure, our sales to Media Broadcast may be significantly reduced or even eliminated. 6 In 2008, our CM-100 was selected by Korea’s Hanaro Telecom (now called SK Broadband) as their main network infrastructure building block for their premium IPTV services. SK Broadband, which began purchasing our CM-100 products in 2008, became our second largest customer in 2009 with sales to SK Broadband representing 22.9% of our revenues in 2009. We cannot be sure that SK Broadband will continue to purchase our CM-100 products to the same extent, if at all. We expect to depend on sales of our CM product lines to a limited number of customers for the substantial majority of our revenues in 2010. Demand for CM products from our customers will likely be derived from growth in the number of subscribers for services offered by them, both for wireline and wireless subscribers. There can be no assurance that our customers will be successful in offering new services or securing additional subscribers. Sales to our customers are dependent on their success in offering new services and securing additional subscribers. Even if successful, there is no assurance that our customers, including KDDI, SK Broadband and Media Broadcast, will continue to purchase our products or that they will not choose another vendor. Our revenues from KDDI were lower in 2008 than in 2007 and were lower again in 2009. Our revenues from Media Broadcast were significantly lower in 2009 than in 2008. This materially adversely affected our results of operations. The loss of KDDI, SK Broadband or Media Broadcast as a customer, or a significant decrease in revenues from one of them, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We are expending a significant amount of our research and development time and resources with respect to product development for a major customer. These efforts may not result in the receipt of revenues from this customer. We are expending significant time and resources on research and development activities aimed at obtaining a new project from one of our major customers. This effort has resulted in an increase in our operating expenses since late 2009 and a diversion of resources away from other existing customers and from our efforts to attract new customers. We may not recognize any additional revenues as a result of our efforts for this major customer. Even if we are able to generate additional revenues from this customer, the diversion of our efforts away from other customers could strain our relationship with existing customers and impede our ability to make sales to new customers. We need to make sales to additional customers and to develop additional products in order to become profitable. We need to make sales to additional customers and to develop additional products in order to become profitable. Since 2004, almost all of our revenues have been derived from our CM-100 product line to a very limited number of customers. In 2008, we added a second generation product line, the CM-4000, which has started to be commercially deployed. We cannot be sure that we will be able to make significant sales of this product. There is no specific obligation on any customer to purchase products from us. Thus, we cannot be sure of the amount of our products that will be purchased as a result of selections of our products by new customers, or the period of time over which our products may be purchased by any customers. 7 In late 2008, we reduced the number of our research and development personnel by approximately 40%. This reduction has limited our ability to develop new products and support new product requirements from existing and new customers. In late 2008, we reduced the number of our research and development personnel by approximately 40%. Subsequent increases in the number of our research personnel in late 2009 and early 2010 have not fully lessened the negative effect of the 2008 reduction in product development and support because the increase in personnel has mainly focused on a potential project for one major customer. As a result, we have selectively slowed down the development of new capabilities for our CM-4000 platform and have halted further development of our CM-100 product line. This reduction in our research and development activities could adversely impact our ability to secure new customers or to address requirements of our existing customers, which could cause our existing customers to discontinue purchasing our products. We require a significant amount of cash to fund our operating activities. We used cash in the amount of $15.7 million in 2007, $33.4 million in 2008 and $20.0 million in 2009 in our operating activities. Our use of cash in 2007 was lower than in 2008 and 2009 primarily because we received approximately $14.2 million in cash in 2007 in connection with the settlement of a commercial dispute related to our legacy operations. In 2010, we expect to continue to use a significant amount of cash in our operating activities. In December 2009, one of our major customers notified us that it intends to undertake an additional project in 2010. To compete for this project, we started to expend significant time and resources with respect to research and development related to this project. This project has resulted in an increase in o ur operating expenses since late 2009 which will further increase the cash we use in our operations. If we are not able to generate cash from our operations in future periods, we may need to obtain additional financing. We might not be able to secure additional funding, which could result in a significant reduction in our expenditures for research and development and for sales and marketing. We may need additional financing to operate or grow our business. We may need to raise additional capital to operate our business or continue our longer term expansion plans. The substantial cash required to fund our operating activities could impede our ability to fund our operations and to invest in our business. In order to operate or grow our business, we may need to raise equity or debt funds through additional public or private financing or through arrangements with strategic partners to the extent that we cannot fund our activities through our existing cash resources and any cash we may generate from operations. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all. This could inhibit our ability to operate or grow our business or cause us to reduce our expenditures for research and development and for sales and marketing, which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to grow. 8 We depend on third party distributors, mainly in Japan, Korea and Germany, for the sale of our products. If these distributors do not succeed in selling our products, or if we are not able to maintain our relationship with them, our results of operations will suffer. Our sales of products to KDDI are made through OKI Electric Industry Co., Ltd., our sales of products to SK Broadband are made through Global Telecom and our sales in Germany are made through Media Broadcast GmbH. We are dependent on the marketing and sales efforts of our distributors to convince customers or end-users to purchase our products and to provide local support services. If a distributor terminates or adversely changes its relationship with us, we may be unsuccessful in replacing it. The loss of a distributor could impair our ability to sell our products and materially adversely affect our results of operations. The purchasing patterns in the markets we address will likely result in our revenues being highly volatile. Sales of our product lines are dependent on the capital equipment expenditure budgets of telecommunication carriers for metro network equipment. The purchasing patterns of telecommunication carriers for this type of expansion project are subject to high volatility. Uncertainty with respect to consumer spending as a result of weak economic conditions could cause our customers to delay the placing of orders and slow the pace of reorders. We have experienced a concentrated and inconsistent pattern of purchasing by KDDI in Japan. We have limited experience with respect to the purchasing patterns of SK Broadband and Media Broadcast. While product selections and subsequent deliveries may last several years, the purchasing pattern during the deployment period is highly uncertain and, accordingly, our revenues are likely to be subject to high volatility. A substantial amount of our shipments are currently in Korea and India. We have limited experience in selling and servicing metro products in these countries. This lack of experience could materially adversely impact our results of operations. In 2008, a substantial portion of our shipments was to Germany. In 2009, a substantial portion of our shipments was to Korea, and, in late 2009, we began to make shipments of our metro products to India. Telecommunication equipment sales in these countries are subject to high quality and strict delivery requirements. We have limited experience in making sales of metro products into these markets and could face business requirements for quality, delivery, service and support that we may not meet. Failure to meet these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Successful introduction of service applications by telecommunication carriers that are expected to drive demand for our metro products could be delayed or slow to emerge. Service applications that drive the demand for our metro telecommunication products are related to the offering of data services and video services, such as video-on-demand, HDTV and Internet TV, as well as other media services by telecommunication carriers over data networks. These types of services require very high bandwidth for packet-based transmissions and, as a result, require an upgrade of metropolitan, or metro, network equipment and access equipment. The availability of these services has begun to emerge in Asia, the United States and parts of Europe, but is still limited in the breadth of services offered as well as in the number of subscribers. The launch of these services requires significant capital investment in equipment by telecommunication carriers in the access and metro networks for a range of products, as well as for content packages to be provided by the telecommunication carriers. Delays in the launch of these services or slow subscriber additions to these services will have an adverse effect on the demand for our metro products. If the growth of these services continues to be limited, we will be required to invest additional resources and use more cash in our research and development, as well as in marketing efforts, in an effort to attain and maintain a competitive position in these markets before we can benefit from commercial selection and revenues from our products. Telecommunication carriers could select solutions offered by our competitors to provide video services. Thus, even if the demand for video services increases, we cannot be sure that this increased demand will result in increased sales of our products. 9 A slowdown in capital expenditures by telecommunication service providers had a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the past and may again in the future. The global economic deterioration and economic uncertainty that began in 2008 has resulted in a curtailment of capital investment by telecommunication carriers and service providers. Consolidation of telecommunication carriers in the United States has led carriers to purchase from fewer telecommunication equipment vendors. We are currently experiencing a slow capital investment environment in Asia, the United States and Europe, which is likely to have a negative effect on the demand for new technologies and new types of equipment. This could significantly limit our ability to sell our products. A continued industry downturn could increase our inventories, decrease our revenues, result in additional pressure on the price of our products and prolong the time until we are paid, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our re sults of operations. We plan to continue to invest substantial capital and other resources in the development, sales and marketing of new telecommunication equipment. We intend to incur substantial expenses in the development of telecommunication solutions capable of supporting high bandwidth services in telecommunication networks located in metropolitan areas. Most of our research and development and other operating expenses in 2007, 2008 and 2009 were related to our CM-4000 products and we expect the CM-4000 to continue to constitute a significant part of our efforts in 2010 as well. In early 2010, we increased expenses in research and development primarily in order to meet the requirements for a potential project for one of our major customers. We also increased our sales and marketing expenses as a result of establishing a presence in new countries. These expenditures could reduce our cash balances. There is no assurance that these investments will result in increased revenues. Our future growth will depend upon requirements by our customers and potential customers to develop new products and features and whether we have sufficient resources to meet these requirements. In order to win new orders from our current customers and receive orders from new customers, we are required from time to time to develop new products and product features. These development projects require us to expend significant time and resources. For example, in early 2010, we increased expenses in research and development primarily in order to meet the requirements for a potential project for one of our major customers. We may not have sufficient resources to develop all the products and features required by our customers and prospective customers, which would entail recruiting and training new employees and other associated costs. Even if we have sufficient resources, our organization may not have the ability to recruit, train and manage a higher number of employees. These develo pment projects could reduce our cash balances, strain our relationships with our customers and prevent us from acquiring new customers. 10 Our future growth will depend upon the acceptance of the technologies developed by us and the development of markets for our products. The markets for our products are dependent on carrier Ethernet, resilient packet ring, or RPR, multi protocol label switching, or MPLS, MPLS-TP, pseudo wire emulation, or PWE, and a range of other emerging technologies. These technologies address migration of synchronous transmission protocols to a metropolitan area Ethernet network that is not limited to synchronous transmission protocols and operates at 10 Gbps and higher rates. We believe that these technologies will support the upgrade of existing metro networks on a cost efficient basis in order to provide packet transmission addressing high numbers of subscribers and multiple services at significantly higher transmission. The markets for our products are also dependent on the need to support legacy services and new data services over a single, unified metro network. The market for products based on carrier Ethernet, MPLS, MPLS-TP and PWE technologies in the metropolitan area may not fully develop, whether as a result of competition, adoption of alternative technologies or changes in technologies. Ethernet over fiber in the metro area, an alternative technology, has gained market share. In addition, changes in technology, such as IP routers or reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexing, or ROADM, technology, has developed as an alternative technology which was recently selected as a prime network architecture for the metro network by major telecommunication carriers. Our future success depends on the acceptance of our products and technologies and the purchase of high-transmission services by the customers of telecommunication companies. We have no control over the development of these target ma rkets. Even if our technologies are accepted, relationships with providers of telecommunication services must be developed in order to be successful. Furthermore, competing technologies in the targeted areas may be utilized in the majority of these target markets. This would leave us with a small market to address. We may not be able to keep pace with emerging industry standards for products we are developing. This could make these products more costly or unacceptable to potential customers. Industry-wide standards for MPLS, MPLS-TP and PWE, as well as various aspects of the standards applicable to Ethernet, continue to be enhanced. We design our products to support these standards and evaluate new requirements as they are proposed by industry working groups. The adoption of standards different from those currently used by us could result in our having to incur additional time and expense in order for our products to comply with these standards. Standards may be adopted by various industry groups or may be proprietary and nonetheless accepted broadly in the industry. The failure to support evolving standards could limit acceptance of our products. Since these products will be integrated into networks consisting of elements manufactured by various companies, they must support a number of current and future industry standar ds and practices. It may take us a significant amount of time to develop and design products incorporating these new standards. We may also have to pay licensing fees to the developers of the technologies that constitute newly adopted standards. This would increase our expenses and could adversely affect our results of operations. 11 Customers and potential customers may want their metropolitan area networks to be able to support the emerging MPLS Transport Profile, or MPLS-TP, standard. Although we are working on the development of features that will enable our CM-4000 product to comply with the MPLS-TP standard, our products do not as yet incorporate this standard. If our customers decide to implement MPLS-TP, our sales to these customers could be adversely affected. Specifically, one of our major customers notified us that our CM-4000 must comply with the MPLS-TP standard in order for our products to be incorporated in future deployments. If our development efforts are not successful or are not completed on time, our revenues from this customer may be adversely affected.< /div> Because telecommunication companies must obtain in-house and regulatory approvals before they can order our products, expected sales of our products to new customers or new products to existing customers are likely to be subject to a long sales cycle, which may harm our business. Before telecommunication companies can purchase our products, these products must undergo a lengthy approval process. Evaluations and modifications of our products to meet customers’ requirements are likely to take several years prior to commercial selection. Accordingly, we are required to submit enhanced versions of products undergoing the approval process and products in development for approval. The following factors, among others, affect the length of the approval process: · the time required for telecommunication companies to determine and publish specifications; · the technological priorities and budgets of telecommunication companies; · product acceptance tests; and · the regulatory requirements applicable to telephone companies. Delays in the product approval process could seriously harm our business and results of operation. Because of rapid technological and other changes in the market for telecommunication products, we must continually develop and market new products and product enhancements while reducing production costs. The market for our products is characterized by: · rapid technological change; · frequent product introductions and enhancements; · evolving industry standards; · changes in end-user requirements; and · changes in services offered by telecommunication companies. 12 Technologies or standards applicable to our products could become obsolete or fail to gain widespread, commercial acceptance, resulting in losses and inventory write-offs. Rapid technological change and evolving technological standards are resulting in relatively short life cycles for our products. Short life cycles for our products could cause decreases in product prices at the end of the product life cycle, inventory write-offs and a lower rate of return on our research and development expenditures. We may not be able to respond effectively to technological changes or new product introductions by others or successfully develop or market new products. We may accumulate excess or obsolete inventory that could result in unanticipated price reductions or write downs and adversely affect our results of operations. Telecommunication companies typically require prompt delivery of products. Sales are typically shipped within a period of up to three months from the date we receive a purchase order. As a result, we may be required to maintain or have available sufficient inventory levels or make advance long lead-time component orders to satisfy anticipated demand on a timely basis. Rapid technological change, evolving industry standards or shifts in demand can also result in shorter life cycles for our inventory. The introduction of the CM-4000 product may result in reduction in the demand for CM-100 and faster obsolescence of related inventory. Certain components of the CM-4000 product could also become obsolete if these components are not included in the specifications for products ordered from us. This increases the risk of decreases in selling prices, inventory obsolescence and associated write-offs, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations. The market for our telecommunication products is intensely competitive. Because substantially all of our competitors have much greater resources than we have, it may be difficult for us to effect commercial sales or to achieve operating profitability. The market for our products is intensely competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. Many of our current and potential competitors are large and established companies and have better name recognition and greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and personnel resources than we. Consolidation has increased the size and scope of a number of our competitors. Any of these competitive factors could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers, cause us to lower our prices in order to compete and reduce our market share and revenues, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The expansion of research and design facilities in China and India, where engineering costs are significantly lower compared to the United States, Western E urope or Israel, has increased and could further increase competition and price pressure for our products. In addition, manufacturers of telecommunication equipment in China are attempting to leverage their success in supplying telecommunication equipment to local carriers in Asia and market and sell their products outside China. The competitors in our markets are numerous and we expect competition to increase in the future. The principal competitors for our products include Alcatel-Lucent, Brocade, Ciena, Cisco Systems, Inc., ECI Telecom Ltd., Ericsson, Extreme Networks, Inc., Fujitsu, Hitachi, Huwaei, Juniper Networks, NEC, Nokia-Siemens Networks, Tellabs and UTStarcom. 13 Government regulation of telecommunication companies could adversely affect the demand for our products. Telecommunication regulatory policies affecting the availability of telephone companies’ services, and other terms on which telephone companies conduct their business, may impede the market penetration of our metro products. For example, our CM-100 and CM-4000 product lines address high bandwidth packets, and are dependent on new service offerings, such as video services, which require regulatory approvals for introduction by telecommunication carriers, including for the scope of content, service packages and tariffs. Telecommunication companies in markets in other countries in which we may attempt to sell our products are also subject to evolving governmental regulation or state monopolies. Changes in laws or regulations in Japan, the United States, Korea, India, Latin America, Germany, the rest of Europe or elsewhere could materially adversely affect our ability, and the ability of our customers, to deploy our products. Sales of our products to our customer in India are subject to the TSEC approval process. If we do not receive this approval, we may not be able to conclude sales of our products in India or recognize revenues with respect to products that have been shipped to India. Products sold by us in India are subject to the TSEC approval process which is an acceptance test performed to verify that our products conform to the tender specifications. We are currently in the TSEC approval process. Payment to us by our customer may be subject to TSEC approval. Approval of our products is not assured. If we do not receive this approval, we may not be able to recognize revenues with respect to approximately $4.0 million of products that we have shipped to India and may not be able to collect these amounts from our customer. In addition, if approval is not received, we may not be able to receive new orders and sell our products in India. Because a limited number of subcontractors manufacture and assemble our products and because we currently use one subcontractor to source components and provide other services, our business could suffer if we cannot retain or replace a key subcontractor. We use third-party subcontractors to assemble our products. We have not entered into multi-year agreements with assurances of supply with any of our suppliers or subcontractors. Our reliance on third-party subcontractors involves several risks, including: · the potential absence of adequate capacity if we are able to sell a significant amount of our products; · the unavailability of, or interruption in access to, certain process technologies; · reduced control over product quality, delivery, schedules, manufacturing yields and costs; and · higher per unit prices we could be charged for the manufacturing services we purchase based on the amount of services purchased. 14 Shortages of raw materials or production capacity constraints at our subcontractors could negatively affect our ability to meet product delivery obligations and result in increased costs for affected products that we may not be able to recover. Use of subcontractors also involves the risk of reduced control over product quality, delivery schedules and manufacturing yields, as well as limited negotiating power to reduce costs. We currently use one subcontractor for component sourcing, inventory warehousing, board assembly, testing and shipment. As a result, we are highly dependent on this major subcontractor. In 2008, we switched to a new subcontractor and do not yet have significant experience dealing with this subcontractor. If we do not have a successful relationship with this subcontractor and need to switch to another subcontractor, we may not be able to timely satisfy our contractual obligations. In order to have an adequate supply of components with a long lead-time for delivery, we may order significant quantities of components in advance of receiving a purchase order from a customer. A shortage in the supply of key semiconductor and other components could affect our ability to manufacture and deliver our products and result in lower revenues. We may be unable to find alternative sources in a timely manner, if at all, if our major subcontractor were unwilling or unable to provide us with key components. In addition, supply from single source suppliers limits our ability to purchase components at competitive prices and could require us to maintain higher inventory levels. This could increase our need for working capital and could increase the risk of an inventory write-off. In addition, unless we can significantly increase our sales above 2009 levels, we may be charged higher per unit prices for the manufacturing services we purchase. In addition, we may also be charged higher per unit prices for certain components whose costs are unit sensitive. This would adversely affect our gross profit margins and results of operations. If we cannot obtain sufficient manufacturing services or key components as required, or develop alternative sources if and as required in the future, product shipments may be delayed or reduced. This co uld adversely affect our end-user relationships, business and results of operations. We are subject to regulations that require us to use components based on environmentally friendly materials. Compliance with these regulations has increased our costs and is expected to continue to increase our costs. Failure to comply with these regulations could materially adversely affect our results of operations. We are subject to telecommunication industry regulations requiring the use of environmentally-friendly materials in telecommunication equipment. For example, pursuant to a European Union directive, known as the “RoHs5 regulations,” telecommunication equipment suppliers were required to stop using specified materials that are not “environmentally friendly” (as defined in the relevant directive) by July 1, 2006 and to eliminate lead solders from their products by 2010 (the “RoHs6 regulations”). Although we believe that we are in compliance with the RoHs5 and RoHs6 regulations, the tests for compliance with these regulations are limited in their ability to fully ensure compliance. If in spite of the tests performed, if we are not in compliance with these regulations, it could harm our ability to sell o ur products in Europe and in any other countries that may adopt these regulations. In addition, we have not tested all of our products for RoHs compliance. We have relied on the results for products tested in deciding not to test all of our products. If untested products are determined not to comply with these regulations, it could harm our ability to sell our products. 15 Compliance with these regulations, especially with respect to the requirement that products be lead free, as well as additional regulations that are likely to apply in the future, requires us to undertake significant expense with respect to the re-design of our products. This could also result in part or all of our inventory becoming obsolete. We may also be required to pay higher prices for components that comply with these regulations. In addition, such regulations could reduce our production yield and decrease our gross margin. We may not be able to pass these higher component costs and the cost of the decrease in production yield on to our customers. We cannot at this point estimate the expense that will be required to redesign our products in order to include “environmentally friendly” components. We cannot be s ure that we will be able to comply with such regulations, that we will be able to comply on a cost effective basis or that a sufficient supply of compliant components will be available to us. Compliance with such regulations has increased our product design costs and could continue to increase these costs. Our inability or failure to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We could incur substantial costs if customers assert warranty claims or request product recalls. Any significant product returns or claims under our warranty or post-contract hardware and software support services, or PCS, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We offer complex products that have in the past and may in the future contain errors, defects or failures when introduced or as new versions are released. If we deliver products with defects, errors or bugs or if we undergo a product recall as a result of errors or failures, market acceptance of our products could be lost or delayed and we could be the subject of substantial negative publicity. This could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We commenced commercial sales of our metro product in 2004. While to date we have not incurred warranty expenses that exceeded our estimates, we could incur a higher level of warranty expense claims at any time compared to our prior experience. We have agreed to indemnify our customers in some circumstances against liability from defects in the products sold by us and expect to continue to provide a similar indemnity in connection with future sales. In some cases, our indemnity also covers indirect damages. Product liability claims could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of our issuance of convertible notes in March 2007, we have a significant amount of debt denominated in New Israeli Shekels that are linked to the Israeli CPI and we may have insufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations. In addition, the amount of our debt could impede our operations and flexibility. In March 2007, we issued convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $25.8 million (based on the U.S. Dollar/New Israeli Shekel (“NIS”) exchange rate at that time). The convertible notes are denominated in NIS, bear interest at the rate of 6% and are linked to the Israeli CPI. The convertible notes are due in March 2017, and are subject to the right of the holders to request early repayment in March 2012. In the first quarter of 2009, we used $3.0 million to repurchase approximately 25% of the then principal amount of the convertible notes. As of December 31, 2009, the net indexed principal amount outstanding under the convertible notes was approximately $24.0 million (based on the U.S. Dollar/New Israeli Shekel exchange rate at December 31, 2009). We may be unable to repay these notes when due. 16 The notes are convertible at the election of the holders into our ordinary shares at the initial conversion price of NIS 52.50 (approximately $13.90, based on U.S. Dollar/NIS exchange rate at December 31, 2009) per share if the conversion occurs by March 10, 2010 and at the initial conversion price of NIS 63.00 (approximately $16.69, based on U.S. Dollar/NIS exchange rate at December 31, 2009) per share if the conversion occurs thereafter, in each case subject to adjustment for customary events. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the notes, we will be in default under the trust agreement governing the notes which could, in turn, cause defaults under our other existing or future indebtedness. Even if we are able to meet our payment obligations on the notes, the amount of debt we have incurred could adversely affect us in a number of ways, including by: · limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; · limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business; · placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors who have less or no debt; · making us more vulnerable to the downturn in our business and the economy generally; · requiring us to apply a substantial portion of our cash towards payments on our debt, instead of using those funds for other purposes, such as working capital or capital expenditures; and · harming our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to international business risks. We sell our CM-100 and CM-4000 products internationally, mainly in Japan, Korea, India and Europe, and we are marketing our products primarily in Asia, Latin America, Europe and the United States. Expansion of our international business requires significant management attention and financial resources. Our international sales and operations are subject to numerous risks inherent in international business activities, including: · compliance with foreign laws and regulations; · staffing and managing foreign operations; · import or currency control restrictions; · burdens that may be imposed by tariffs and other trade barriers; · local and international taxation; · increased risk of collections; · transportation delays; and · seasonal reduction of business activities. 17 These factors, as well as different technical standards or product requirements for our systems in different markets, may limit our ability to penetrate foreign markets. We depend on a limited number of key personnel who would be difficult to replace. If we lose the service of these individuals, our business could be harmed. Our growth and future success largely depends on the managerial and technical skills of members of senior management. If any of them is unable or unwilling to continue with us, our business could be harmed and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We have experienced periods of growth and consolidation of our business. If we cannot adequately manage our business, our results of operations will suffer. We have experienced both growth and consolidation in our operations from sales of our metro products. In November 2008, in order to decrease our expenses, we substantially decreased our employee head count. Beginning in late 2009, we increased our research and development and sales and marketing expenses primarily as a result of the hiring of new employees. Future growth or consolidation may place a significant strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources. We are currently expending significant time and resources with respect to research and development related to a potential project for one of our major customers. This project has resulted in an increase in our operating expenses since late 2009 and has increased the operational responsibilities of our management team. We cannot be sure that we have made adequate allowances for the costs and risks associated with possible expansion and consolidation of our business, or that our systems, procedures and managerial controls will be adequate to support our operations. Any delay in implementing, or transitioning to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls may adversely affect our ability to manage our product inventory and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. We believe that significant growth may require us to hire additional engineering, technical support, sales, administrative and operational personnel. Competition for qualified personnel can be intense in the areas where we operate. The process of locating, training and successfully integrating qualified personnel into our operations can be le ngthy and expensive. If we are unable to successfully manage our expansion, we may not succeed in expanding our business, our expenses may increase and our results of operations may be adversely affected. Our proprietary technology is difficult to protect and unauthorized use of our proprietary technology by third parties may impair our ability to compete effectively. We may not be able to prevent the misappropriation of our technology, and our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours. We have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our technologies. To protect our unpatented proprietary know-how, we rely on technical leadership, trade secrets and confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements. These agreements and measures may not adequately protect our technology and it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without our authorization or to develop similar technology. 18 There is a risk that we may violate the proprietary rights of others. We are subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of other companies. Many participants in the telecommunication industry have an increasing number of patents and patent applications and have frequently commenced litigation based on alleged infringement. We indemnify our customers with respect to infringement of third party proprietary rights by our products. Third parties may assert infringement claims in the future and these claims may require us to enter into license arrangements or result in costly litigation, regardless of the merits of these claims. Licensing may be unavailable or may not be obtainable on commercially reasonable terms. We face foreign exchange currency risks. We operate in a number of territories and typically our prices are determined in local currencies of the countries in which we operate. The main currencies of the countries in which we operate are the U.S. dollar, Japanese Yen (“Yen”), NIS and Euro. In 2010, we expect that a majority of our revenues will be derived from the Yen and Euro and that significant revenues may also be generated in Indian Rupees. A major part of our expenses will be denominated in U.S. dollars and in NIS. In particular, we are obligated to pay interest on, and to repay the principal of, our convertible notes in NIS. We currently do not use hedge instruments. We are likely to face risks from fluctuations in the value of the Yen, NIS, Euro and the Rupee compared to the U.S. dollar, our functional currency in our financial state ments. In 2007 and 2008 the value of the U.S. dollar decreased against the Yen, and since our sales prices to KDDI were determined in Yen, based on currency exchange rates that prevailed in prior years, this caused us to recognize higher dollar revenues and gross profit in our financial statements in those years. In 2009, the value of the U.S. dollar insignificantly increased against the Yen. In 2008, the value of the U.S. dollar increased against the Euro, which caused us to recognize lower dollar revenues and gross profit in our financial statements for Euro linked prices. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Yen and Euro in 2010 would cause a decrease in our revenues and gross profit derived from sales denominated in Yen or Euro. In 2007, 2008 and 2009, the value of the U.S. dollar decreased against the NIS, which caused us to recognize higher dollar expenses (mainly salary expenses). A further decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against the NIS would cause a further increase in our expenses. We are subject to risks from our financial investments. We invest the majority of our cash on hand in a variety of financial instruments, including different types of corporate and government bonds from different countries, and other financial instruments. Some of these bonds and instruments are rated below investment grade or are not rated. In 2008, based on our evaluation of certain obligors to pay their debts, we recognized an impairment charge with respect to the value of certain bonds we hold. Also, in 2009 the market value of part of our investments was significantly lower than the book value. If the obligors of any of the bonds or instruments we hold default or undergo a reorganization in bankruptcy, we may lose all or a portion of our investment in any such investment. This would harm our financial condition. 19 We are subject to taxation in several countries. Because we operate in several countries, mainly in Israel, Japan, the United States, Germany, Korea, India and Mexico, we are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions. We are required to report to and are subject to local tax authorities in Israel, the United States, Japan, Korea and India and cannot be sure of the amount of taxes we may become obligated to pay in these countries. In addition, our income that is derived from sales to customers in one country might also be subject to taxation in other countries. The tax authorities in the countries in which we operate may not agree with our tax position. Our tax benefits from carry forward losses and other tax planning benefits such as Israeli Approved Enterprise programs, may prove to be insufficient due to Israeli tax limitations, or may prove to be insufficient to of fset tax liabilities from foreign tax authorities. Foreign tax authorities may also use our gross profit or our revenues in each territory as the basis for determining our income tax, and our operating expenses might not be considered for related tax calculations. This could adversely affect our results of operations. Risks Relating to Our Operations in Israel Potential political, economic or military instability in Israel may adversely affect our results of operations. Our principal offices and many of our subcontractors and suppliers are located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel affect our operations. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors. A state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity, has led to security and economic problems for Israel. Since October 2000, there has been a marked increase in hostilities between Israel and the Palestinians, and in January 2006, Hamas, an Islamist movement responsible for many attacks against Israelis, won the majority of the seats in the Parliament of the Palestinian Authority. Further, in the summer of 2006, Israel engaged in a war with Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based Islamist Shiite militia grou p, which involved thousands of missile strikes and disrupted most day-to-day civilian activity in northern Israel. In June 2007, there was an escalation of violence in the Gaza Strip, resulting in Hamas effectively controlling the Gaza Strip. Since June 2007, thousands of missiles have been fired from Gaza at population centers in southern Israel, leading to an armed conflict between Israel and Hamas in January 2009. In addition, Iran has threatened to attack Israel and is widely believed to be developing nuclear weapons. Ongoing violence between Israel and the Palestinians, as well as tension between Israel and terror organizations and other countries in the Middle East, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The future of relations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority is uncertain. Terror attacks, armed conflicts or political instability in the region could negatively affect local business conditions and harm our results of operations. We cannot predict the effect on us of the increase in the degree of violence by Palestinians against Israel or the effect of military action elsewhere in the Middle East. Furthermore, several countries restrict doing business with Israel and Israeli companies, and additional companies may restrict doing business with Israel and Israeli companies as a result of the increase in hostilities. This may also seriously harm our operating results, financial condition and the ability to expand our business. 20 Our results of operations may be negatively affected by the obligation of our personnel to perform military service. Most of our male employees in Israel are obligated to perform military reserve duty from time to time. In addition, in the event of a military conflict or other attack on Israel, including the ongoing conflict with the Palestinians, these persons could be required to serve in the military for extended periods of time and on very short notice. The absence of a number of our officers and employees for significant periods could disrupt our operations and harm our business. Our results of operations may be adversely affected by inflation rates in Israel. We could be exposed to risk if the rate of inflation in Israel exceeds the rate of devaluation of the NIS in relation to the Yen, U.S. dollar and other currencies of other foreign countries in which we operate, or if the timing of such devaluation lags behind inflation in Israel. In that event, the cost in U.S. dollars of our operations in Israel would increase and our U.S. dollar-measured results of operations would be adversely affected. For example, in 2009, the value of the U.S. dollar decreased in relation to the NIS by 0.7%, after fluctuating during the year, while inflation increased by 3.9%. As a result, our salary expenses, which are primarily linked to the NIS, increased in U.S. dollar terms. In 2008, there was a similar increase in expenses in U.S. dollar terms. Our issuance in March 2007 of convertible notes, which are den ominated in NIS, has made us more sensitive to increases in the value of the NIS relative to the U.S. dollar. In 2007, 2008 and 2009 the value of the U.S. dollar decreased in relation to the NIS, and the Israeli CPI increased, which caused us to record significant financial expenses in relation with these notes. Due to these fluctuations, we may record higher or lower expenses in our financial statements. We benefit from government grant programs that have been reduced and may be unavailable to us in the future. Our participation in these programs restricts our ability to freely transfer manufacturing rights and technology out of Israel. Since our inception, we have relied on Israeli government grants for the financing of a portion of our product development expenditures. Due to a continuing reduction of the budget of Israel’s Office of the Chief Scientist of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor, the amount of grants we receive in the future might be lower than in prior years, if we receive any at all. We recognized grants in the amount of $2.5 million in 2007, $2.1 million in 2008 and $1.7 million in 2009. Generally, according to Israeli law, any products developed with grants from the Office of the Chief Scientist, or OCS, are required to be manufactured in Israel, unless we obtain prior approval of a governmental committee. As a condition to obtaining this approval, we may be required to pay the OCS up to 300% of the grants we received and to repay these grants at an accelerated rate, depending on the portion of manufacturing performed outside Israel. We have obtained an approval from the OCS to manufacture part of our products outside Israel. We intend to keep sufficient manufacturing activities in Israel so that we will be subject to a repayment percentage of up to 150% of the grants we received. In addition, we are prohibited from transferring to third parties the technology developed with these grants without the prior approval of a governmental committee. We received a letter from the OCS requesting that we make certain payments related to our manufacturing activities outside of Israel. In addition, the OCS has claimed that we are required to repay grants related to a research and development project that was cancelled. We are disputing some of the claims made by the OCS and are attempting to negotiate a settlement of these claims. While we have made a provision in our financial statements to cover the estimated outcome of these claims, the amount we ultimately pay may exceed our estimate, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 21 The tax benefits to which we are currently entitled require us to meet several conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future, which would increase our taxes. We are entitled to certain government programs and tax benefits, particularly as a result of the “Approved Enterprise” status of most of our existing facilities. If we fail to meet eligibility conditions in the future, our tax benefits could be reduced or canceled. For more information about Approved Enterprises, see “Item 5.B - Liquidity and Capital Resources – Effective Corporate Tax Rates in Israel” in this Annual Report, "Item 10.E – Taxation – Israeli Tax Considerations – Tax Benefits Under the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959" in this Annual Report, and Note 7a to the financial statements incorporated by reference in this Annual Report. It may be difficult to enforce a U.S. judgment against us, our officers and directors and our Israeli auditors or to assert U.S. securities law claims in Israel. Service of process upon our directors and officers and our Israeli auditors may be difficult to effect in the United States because all these parties reside outside the United States. Any judgment obtained in the United States against such parties may not be collectible in the United States. It may be difficult to assert U.S. securities law claims in original actions instituted in Israel. Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on a violation of U.S. securities laws because Israel is not the most appropriate forum to bring such a claim. In addition, even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Israeli law and not U.S. law is applicable to the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Israeli law. There is little binding case law in Israel addressing these matters. However, subject to time limitations, Israeli courts may enforce a U.S. judgment in a civil matter, if: · adequate service of process has been effected and the defendant has had a reasonable opportunity to be heard; · the judgment and its enforcement are not contrary to the law, public policy, security or sovereignty of the State of Israel; · the judgment was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, in compliance with due process and the rules of private international law prevailing in Israel; · the judgment was not obtained by fraudulent means and does not conflict with any other valid judgment in the same matter between the same parties; · no action between the same parties in the same matter is pending in any Israeli court at the time the lawsuit is instituted in a U.S. court; and · the U.S. courts are not prohibited from enforcing judgments of the Israeli courts. 22 Provisions of Israeli law may delay, prevent or make an acquisition of us more difficult, which could depress our share price. The Israeli Companies Law generally requires that a merger be approved by the board of directors and a majority of the shares voting on the proposed merger. Upon the request of any creditor of a party to the proposed merger, a court may delay or prevent the merger if it concludes that there is a reasonable concern that, as a result of the merger, the surviving company will be unable to satisfy its obligations. In addition, a merger may generally not be completed unless at least (i) 50 days have passed since the filing of the merger proposal with the Israeli Registrar of Companies and (ii) 30 days have passed since the merger was approved by the shareholders of each of the parties to the merger. Also, in certain circumstances an acquisition of shares in a public company must be made by means of a tender offer if as a result of the acquisition the purchaser would become a 25% or greater or 45% or greater shareholder of the company (unless there is already a 25% or greater or a 45% or greater shareholder of the company, respectively). If, as a result of an acquisition, the acquirer would hold more than 90% of a company’s shares, the acquisition must be made by means of a tender offer for all of the shares. The described restrictions could prevent or make more difficult an acquisition of Orckit, which could depress our share price. Risks Relating to the Ownership of our Ordinary Shares Holders of our ordinary shares who are U.S. residents face certain income tax risks. In any tax year, we could be deemed a passive foreign investment company, which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences for U.S. holders of our ordinary shares. Based on the composition and value of our gross assets during 2007, 2008 and 2009, it is likely that we would be deemed to have been a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes during each of such years. For each of 2005 and 2006, we believe that we would not be deemed to have been a PFIC, although it is likely that we would be deemed to have been a PFIC in each of 2003 and 2004. There can be no assurance that we will not be deemed a PFIC for any future tax year in which, for example, the value of all our assets, as measured by the public market valuation of our ordinary shares and the amount of our liabilities, declines in relation to the value of our passive assets (such as cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities). If we are a PFIC for any tax year, U. S. holders of our ordinary shares during such year may be subject to increased U.S. federal income tax liabilities and reporting requirements for such year and succeeding years, even if we are no longer a PFIC in such succeeding years. U.S. residents should carefully read “Item 10.E - Taxation – United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” in this Annual Report for a more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax risks related to owning and disposing of our ordinary shares and the consequences of PFIC status. 23 We do not intend to pay cash dividends. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, for funding growth. Accordingly, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Two shareholders who are also our senior officers may be able to control us. As of March 1, 2010, Eric Paneth, our Chief Executive Officer, and Izhak Tamir, our Chairman and President, each beneficially owned an aggregate of 1,679,267 ordinary shares, representing 9.8% of our ordinary shares, including 480,000 ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of options that are currently vested, of which 60,000 options have no exercise price and 420,000 options have an exercise price of $27.14. Each of Mr. Paneth and Mr. Tamir is an executive officer and a member of our board of directors. Currently, Messrs. Paneth and Tamir are not parties to a shareholders’ agreement. However, if Messrs. Paneth and Tamir act together, they may have the power to control the outcome of matters submitted for the vote of shareholders, including the approval of significant change in control transactions. The equity interest in Orckit of Mr. Paneth and Mr. Tamir may make certain transactions more difficult and result in delaying or preventing a change in control of us unless approved by one or both of them. Our shareholder bonus rights plan and the super-majority voting requirements in our articles of association may delay, prevent or make more difficult a hostile acquisition of us, which could depress our share price. In November 2001, we adopted a shareholder bonus rights plan pursuant to which share purchase bonus rights were distributed to our shareholders. These rights generally will be exercisable and transferable apart from our ordinary shares only if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our ordinary shares, or commences a tender or exchange offer upon consummation of which that person or group would hold such a beneficial interest. Once these rights become exercisable and transferable, the holders of rights, other than the person or group triggering their transferability, will be generally entitled to purchase our ordinary shares at a discount from the market price. The rights will expire on December 31, 2011. While these rights remain outstanding, they may make an acquisition of us more dif ficult and result in delaying or preventing a change in control of Orckit. In addition, our articles of association require the approval of the holders of at least 75% of our ordinary shares voting on the matter to remove a director from office and the approval of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares voting on the matter to elect a director. These requirements could also delay or prevent a change of control of our company. 24 Our stock price has fluctuated significantly and could continue to fluctuate significantly. The market price for our ordinary shares, as well as the prices of shares of other technology companies, has been volatile. Between January 1, 2005 and March 1, 2010, our share price has fluctuated from a low of $1.77 to a high of $31.22. The following factors may cause significant fluctuations in the market price of our ordinary shares: · fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and earnings or those of our competitors; · shortfalls in our operating results compared to levels forecast by securities analysts; · announcements concerning us, our competitors or telephone companies; · announcements concerning our customers; · announcements of technological innovations; · the introduction of new products; · changes in product price policies involving us or our competitors; · market conditions in the industry; · the conditions of the securities markets, particularly in the technology and Israeli sectors; and · political, economic and other developments in the State of Israel and world-wide. In addition, stock prices of many technology companies fluctuate significantly for reasons that may be unrelated or disproportionate to operating results. The factors discussed above may depress or cause volatility of our share price, regardless of our actual operating results. Our quarterly results of operations, including revenues, net income and net loss, net income and net loss per share, and cash flow, have fluctuated significantly in the past, and these fluctuations are expected to continue in 2010 and beyond. Fluctuations in our results of operations may disappoint investors and result in a decline in our share price. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations. In some periods, our operating results may be below public expectations or below revenue levels and operating results reached in prior quarters or in the corresponding quarters of the previous year. If this occurs, the market price of our ordinary shares could decline. The following factors have affected our quarterly results in the past and are likely to affect our quarterly results in the future: · size and timing of orders, including order deferrals and delayed shipments; · launching of new product generations; · length of approval processes or market testing; · technological changes in the telecommunication industry; · accuracy of telecommunication company, distributor and original equipment manufacturer forecasts of their customers’ demands; · changes in our operating expenses; · the timing of approval of government research and development grants; 25 · disruption in our sources of supply; · competitive pricing pressures; · funding required for our operations; · general economic conditions; · terms and conditions of supply agreements with our customers and their impact on our recognition of revenues from these agreements; · changes in our revenue recognition practice as a result of changes in the commercial terms between us and our customers; · determination of the fair value of the conversion feature in our convertible notes; · timely payments of receivables by customers; · changes in payment terms between us and our suppliers which could accelerate the timing of payments by us and negatively affect our working capital and cash balances; and · changes in payment terms between us and our customers which could defer the timing of payments by our customers and negatively affect our working capital and cash balances. Other factors could also impact our results. Therefore, the results of past periods may not be relied on as an indication of our future performance. Our actual financial results might vary from our publicly disclosed financial forecasts. From time to time, we publicly disclose financial forecasts. Our forecasts reflect numerous assumptions concerning our expected performance, as well as other factors which are beyond our control and which might not turn out to be correct. As a result, variations from our forecasts could be material. Our financial results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those identified throughout this “Risk Factors” section. If our actual financial results are worse than our financial forecasts, the price of our ordinary shares may decline. There may be an adverse effect on the market price of our shares as a result of shares being available for sale in the future. If our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our ordinary shares, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options, the market price of our ordinary shares may fall. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. 26 Our ordinary shares are listed for trading in more than one market and this may result in price variations. Our ordinary shares are listed for trading on NASDAQ and the TASE. Trading in our ordinary shares on these markets is made in different currencies (U.S. dollars on NASDAQ and NIS on TASE), and at different times (resulting from different time zones, different trading days and different public holidays in the United States and Israel). The trading prices of our ordinary shares on these two markets can often differ, resulting from the factors described above, as well as differences in exchange rates. Any decrease in the trading price of our ordinary shares on one of these markets could cause a decrease in the trading price of our ordinary shares on the other market. We are subject to ongoing costs and risks associated with complying with extensive corporate governance and disclosure requirements. As a foreign private issuer subject to U.S. federal securities laws, we spend a significant amount of management time and resources to comply with laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, SEC regulations and NASDAQ rules. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires an annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting of the effectiveness of these controls by our management and, under certain circumstances, by our independent registered public accounting firm. There is no guarantee that these efforts will result in management assurance or, when required, an attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm that our internal control over financial reporting is adequate in future periods. In connection wi th our compliance with Section 404 and the other applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time, and we may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff, to assure that we continue to comply with these requirements. The additional management attention and costs relating to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other corporate governance requirements could materially and adversely affect our financial results.
