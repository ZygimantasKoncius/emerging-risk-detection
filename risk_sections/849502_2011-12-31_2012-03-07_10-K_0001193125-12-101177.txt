Item 1A. RISK FACTORS As previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below. These and many other factors described in this report could adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition. Our achievement of sustained profitability is uncertain. We recognized a net loss of $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, and had net income for the year ended December 31, 2010 of $1.6 million. Our ability to generate a profit from ongoing operations in future periods 11 Table of Contents is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, our ability to successfully sell our products at prices that are sufficient to cover our operating costs, to enter into additional technology development and license arrangements, to obtain sufficient contract manufacturing capacity and, if necessary, to raise additional financing to fund our growth. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in reducing these risks. We have spent substantial amounts of money in developing our products and in our efforts to obtain commercial manufacturing capabilities for those products. At December 31, 2011, our accumulated deficit was $219 million. Our ability to increase revenue and achieve profitability in the future will depend substantially on our ability to increase sales of our products by gaining new customers and increasing sales to our existing customers, our success in reducing manufacturing costs, while increasing our contract manufacturing capacity, our ability to significantly increase sales of existing products, and our success in introducing and profitably selling new products. We may need to raise additional funds to finance our operations. In view of our expected future working capital requirements in connection with the fabrication and sale of our specialized memory and integrated semiconductor products, as well as our projected research and development and other operating expenditures, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. We cannot be sure that any additional financing or other sources of capital will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. The inability to obtain additional financing when needed would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results, which could adversely affect our ability to continue our business operations. Under our existing financing arrangements, we would be required to obtain approval from our current lender, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), for any additional debt financing. If additional equity financing is obtained, any issuance of common or preferred stock or convertible securities to obtain funding would result in dilution of our existing stockholders interests. We are subject to certain covenants related to our bank loan and line of credit and such covenants may be challenging to the Company. We are required to comply with certain covenants under our loan agreement, as amended, and our line of credit, including requirements to maintain a minimum EBITDA and maintain certain liquidity ratios, and restrictions on certain business actions without the consent of SVB. SVB may require new and more restrictive covenants in the future, with increased costs to the Company. If we are not able to comply with such covenants at a point of time in the future, our outstanding loan balance will become due and payable immediately, our existing line of credit could be cancelled, and unless we are able to obtain a waiver from the bank for such covenant violations, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed. If we fail to vigorously protect our intellectual property, our competitive position may suffer. Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to develop additional and maintain existing proprietary technology used in our products. We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and employee and third party non-disclosure and assignment agreements. We cannot provide assurances that any of our pending patent applications will be approved or that any of the patents that we own will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others or be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage. Policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our technologies, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. In addition, we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent other parties from designing and marketing semiconductor products or that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire the same or substantially equivalent technologies as ours. We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims by others that result in costly litigation and could harm our business and ability to compete. Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, as well as frequent claims and related litigation regarding these patents and other intellectual property rights. In 12 Table of Contents particular, many leading semiconductor memory companies have extensive patent portfolios with respect to manufacturing processes, product designs, and semiconductor memory technology, including ferroelectric memory and wireless communication technologies. We may be involved in litigation to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets and know-how, to determine the validity of property rights of others, or to defend against claims of invalidity. This type of litigation can be expensive, regardless of whether we win or lose. Also, we cannot be certain that third parties will not make a claim of infringement against us or against our licensees in connection with their use of our technology. In the event of claims of infringement against our licensees with respect to our technology, we may be required to indemnify our licensees, which could be very costly. Any claims, even those without merit, could be time consuming to defend, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. A successful claim of infringement against us or one of our semiconductor manufacturing licensees in connection with our use of our technology would harm our business and result in significant cash expense to us to cover litigation costs, as well as the reduction of future license revenue. Catastrophic events causing system failures may disrupt our business. We are a highly automated business and rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology systems and our Web site for our development, marketing, operational, support, hosted services and sales activities. A disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our product development, breaches of data security and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers orders. We have developed certain disaster recovery plans and certain backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, but a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected. Earthquakes, other natural disasters and power shortages or interruptions may damage our business. If a major earthquake, power outage or other natural disaster occurs that damages our contract manufacturers facilities or restricts their operations, or interrupts our suppliers or customers communications, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. A major earthquake or other natural disaster near one or more of our major suppliers could disrupt the operations of those suppliers, which could limit the supply of our products and harm our business. Our future success depends in part on a relatively small number of key employees. Our future success depends, among other factors, on the continued service of our key technical and management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees. We are particularly dependent on the highly skilled design, process, materials and testing engineers involved in the development and oversight of the manufacture of our semiconductor products and processes. The competition for these personnel is intense, and the loss of key employees, including our executive officers, or our inability to attract additional qualified personnel in the future, could have both an immediate and a long-term adverse effect on us. In January 2011, our former CEO and COO both resigned. Our former CFO was appointed as CEO. A replacement CFO was hired in April 2011 and later resigned in October 2011. At that time our controller was appointed as interim CFO. We are conducting an executive search for a new CFO and do not intend to name a replacement COO. In March 2011, we appointed a vice president of customer satisfaction, responsible for directing the quality assurance program as well as managing the product and test engineering organizations. In June 2011, our former chief marketing officer resigned and we appointed a new vice president of worldwide sales in August 2011, to oversee our worldwide sales organization for all product lines. In addition, we appointed a vice president of marketing in October 2011. If we experience further turnover in our key management personnel, we may incur additional expenses and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected. 13 Table of Contents General economic trends and other factors, including another worldwide credit crisis, may negatively affect our business. Adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our operating results. Our products are complex and any defects in our products may result in liability claims, an increase in our costs and a reduction in our revenue. Our products are complex and may contain defects, particularly when first introduced or as new versions are released or defects may result from the manufacturing process employed by our foundries. We develop integrated semiconductor products containing functions in addition to memory, thereby increasing the overall complexity of our products. We rely primarily on our in-house testing personnel to design test operations and procedures to detect any defects prior to delivery of our products to our customers. However, we rely on both in-house personnel and subcontractors to perform our testing. Because our products are manufactured by third parties and involve long lead times, we may experience delays in meeting key introduction dates or scheduled delivery dates to our customers if problems occur in the manufacture or operation or performance of our products. These defects also could cause us to incur significant re-engineering or production costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our new product development efforts and cause significant customer relations issues and damage to our business reputation. Any defects could require product replacement, cost of remediation, or recall of products, or we could be obligated to accept product returns. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur substantial costs and harm our business. A defect or failure in our product could cause failure in our customers end-product, so we could face product liability claims for property damage, lost profits damages, or consequential damages that are disproportionately higher than the revenue and profits we receive from the products involved. There can be no assurance that any insurance we maintain will sufficiently protect us from any such claims. We depend on a small number of suppliers for the supply of our products and the success of our business may be dependent on our ability to maintain and expand our relationships with foundries and other suppliers. We currently rely on foundry services from TI and IBM for commercial manufacturing of our F-RAM products. Our foundry agreements with TI and with IBM may not be renewed at the end of the contract term or negotiation of new contract terms may not be acceptable. In this event, the engagement of alternative foundry services will become necessary, which would require capital investment and related cash funding, and would likely result in our inability to fill our customers orders. In addition, we rely on a small number of other contract manufacturers and foundries to manufacture our other products. Reliance on a limited number of foundries involves several risks, including capacity constraints or delays in the timely delivery of our products, reduced control over delivery schedules and the cost of our products, variations in manufacturing yields, dependence on the foundries for quality assurance, and the potential loss of production and a slowdown in filling our orders due to seismic activity, other force majeure events and other factors beyond our control, including increases in the cost of the wafers we purchase from our foundries. Although we continuously evaluate sources of supply and may seek to add additional foundry capacity in the future, there can be no assurance that such additional capacity can be obtained at acceptable prices, if at all. Because our products require the foundries to make specified modifications to their standard process technologies and integrate our ferroelectric materials into their processes, transitioning the manufacturing of our products to other foundries or other facilities of an existing foundry may require process design changes and substantial lead time. Any delay resulting from such transition could negatively affect product performance, delivery, and yields or increase manufacturing costs. We are also subject to the risks of service disruptions, raw material shortages, or increased prices affecting our foundry suppliers, which could also result in additional costs or charges to us. We also rely on domestic and international subcontractors for packaging and testing of products, and are subject to risks of disruption of these services and possible quality problems. The occurrence of any supply or other problem resulting from these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations. 14 Table of Contents We cannot provide any assurance that foundry or packaging and testing services will be available to us on terms and conditions, and at the times, acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain foundry and packaging and testing services meeting our needs, we may be unable to produce products at the times and for the costs we anticipate and our relationships with our customers may be harmed and financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. We are a relatively small company with limited resources, compared to some of our current and potential competitors, and we may not be able to compete effectively and increase our market share. Our nonvolatile memory and integrated semiconductor products, which presently account for a substantial portion of our revenue, compete against products offered by current and potential competitors with longer operating histories, significantly greater financial and personnel resources, better name recognition and a larger base of customers than we have. In addition, many of our competitors have their own facilities for the production of semiconductor memory components or have recently added significant production capacity. As a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with our existing and potential customers. They also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours. In addition, some of our current and potential competitors have already established supplier or joint development relationships with the decision makers at our current or potential customers. These competitors may be able to leverage their existing relationships to discourage their customers from purchasing products from us or persuade them to replace our products with their products. These and other competitive pressures may prevent us from competing successfully against current or future competitors, and may materially harm our business. Competition could force us to decrease our prices, reduce our sales, lower our gross profits or decrease our market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. Our competitors include companies such as ST Microelectronics, Everspin Technologies, Cypress Semiconductor, Microchip Technology, Atmel, Fujitsu, TI, and Maxim Integrated, that produce or may produce products that compete with our current products and may compete with our future products. Our ability to compete with these and other competitors will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to continue to recruit and retain qualified engineers and other employees, our ability to introduce new and competitive products in a timely manner, the availability of foundry, packaging and testing services for our products to meet our customers demands, effective utilization and protection of our intellectual property rights, and general economic and regulatory conditions. Emerging technologies and standards may pose a threat to the competitiveness of our products. Competition affecting our F-RAM products may also come from alternative nonvolatile technologies such as magnetic random access memory or phase change memory, or other developing technologies. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to identify new product opportunities successfully, develop and bring to market new products, achieve design wins or respond effectively to new technological changes or product announcements by our competitors. In addition, we may not be successful in developing or using new technologies or in developing new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance. Our competitors or customers may offer new products based on new technologies, new industry standards or end-user or customer requirements, including products that have the potential to replace, or provide lower-cost or higher-performance alternatives to, our products. The introduction of new products by our competitors or customers could render our existing and future products obsolete or unmarketable. A memory technology other than F-RAM nonvolatile memory technology, such as the competitive technologies mentioned above, may be adopted or become generally accepted in integrated semiconductor products, or in stand-alone memory products, and our competitors may be in a better financial and marketing position than we are to influence such adoption or acceptance. The adoption or acceptance of such alternative memory technology could also render our existing and future products obsolete or unmarketable. Additionally, the inability to supply customer orders with our F-RAM products on a timely basis may also cause those customers to sample or purchase alternative memory products, and thereafter choose to continue using such alternative products even after our F-RAM product supply availability returns. 15 Table of Contents Our research and development efforts are focused on a limited number of new technologies and products, and any delay in the development, or the abandonment, of these technologies or products by industry participants, or their failure to achieve market acceptance, could compromise our competitive position. Our F-RAM semiconductor memory and integrated semiconductor products are used as components in electronic devices in various markets. As a result, we have devoted and expect to continue to devote a large amount of resources to develop products based on new and emerging technologies and standards that will be commercially introduced in the future. Our research and development expense, for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $18.3 million, or 28% of our total revenue. If we do not accurately anticipate new technologies and standards, or if the products that we develop based on new technologies and standards fail to achieve market acceptance, our competitors may be better positioned to satisfy market demand than us. Furthermore, if markets for new technologies and standards develop later than we anticipate, or do not develop at all, demand for our products that are currently in development would suffer, resulting in lower sales of these products or lower selling prices, or both, than we currently anticipate, which would adversely affect our revenue and gross profits. We cannot be certain that any products we may develop based on new technologies or for new standards will achieve market acceptance. If we experience difficulties in manufacturing our existing products on our established or new manufacturing lines, we may have to commit our design and R&D resources to resolving those issues, which may delay the development of new products and compromise our competitive market position. If we do not continually develop new products that achieve market acceptance, our revenue may decline. We need to develop new products and new process and manufacturing technologies. We believe that our ability to compete in the markets in which we expect to sell our F-RAM based integrated semiconductor products will depend, in part, on our ability to produce products that address customer needs efficiently and in a cost-effective manner and also our ability to incorporate effectively other semiconductor functions with our F-RAM products. Our inability to successfully develop and have manufactured new products would harm our ability to compete and have a negative impact on our operating results. If we fail to introduce new products in a timely manner or are unable to manufacture such products successfully, or if our customers do not successfully introduce new systems or products incorporating our products, or if market demand for our new products does not develop as anticipated, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. Our expansion into new products and markets may be unsuccessful. We plan to introduce new products into new markets in the future. We do not have experience in the markets our new products will address and these products may not achieve acceptance in those markets because they do not solve a substantial market need or are not competitively priced. Even if our new products achieve substantial market penetration, we may not be able to produce them in sufficient quantities or at prices that will enable us to generate profits for several years. The introduction of new products into new markets also increases the demands on our management and key employees, who may fail to manage those demands successfully. Our introduction of new products may be unsuccessful or delayed, which would result in a reduction in projected revenue from such new products. We depend on IBM and Texas Instruments, our only F-RAM product contract manufacturers, to supply components of the new products, and, if the new products are ordered in substantial quantities, or, if for any other reason, those contract manufacturers are not able timely to supply sufficient components for the new products, our new products may be unsuccessful in the markets, which would result in our not achieving expected revenue from the new products. 16 Table of Contents We compete in certain markets with some of our F-RAM technology licensees, which may reduce our product sales. We have licensed the right to fabricate and sell products based on our F-RAM technology and memory architecture to certain independent semiconductor device manufacturers. Fujitsu and TI, who are currently licensed to use our F-RAM technology, market certain F-RAM memory products that compete with certain of our F-RAM products. Some of our licensees have suspended or terminated their F-RAM initiatives, while others may still be pursuing a possible F-RAM based technology initiative or product development without our knowledge. We expect manufacturers that develop products based on our technology to sell such products worldwide. We are entitled to royalties from sales of F-RAM products by some but not all of these licensees, and we have the right under certain of our licensing agreements to negotiate an agreement for a portion of the licensees F-RAM product manufacturing capacity. TI may, however, give the development and manufacture of their own F-RAM products a higher priority than ours. Any competition in the marketplace from F-RAM products manufactured and marketed by our licensees could reduce our product sales and harm our operating results. We may not be able to replace our expected revenue from significant customers, which could adversely affect our business. Our success depends upon continuing relationships with significant customers who, directly or indirectly, purchase significant quantities of our products. For the year ended December 31, 2011, approximately 41% of our total product sales revenue was generated by five customers. Our top customers include our distributors. Any reduction of product sales to our significant customers, without a corresponding increase in revenue from existing and new customers, may result in significant decreases in our revenue, which would harm our cash flows, operating results and financial condition. We cannot assure that we would be able to replace these relationships in a timely manner or at all. Our product allocations and inability to fulfill all of our customers orders on a timely basis during the first half of 2011 may have caused certain customers to seek substitute products from our competitors, or to design-out our products and substitute alternative technologies and systems. If any of our significant customers or a substantial number of our other customers find alternative suppliers or adopt alternative means of filling the need for our products, our future orders may be less than anticipated, which may result in increased inventories and decreasing revenues, which would materially and adversely affect our cash flows, operating results and financial condition. In addition, approximately 80% of our product sales are through our distributor network. These distributors have a right of return for a percentage of their purchases and we could overstate our revenues if we underestimate the potential rate of returns. We expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our product sales in the future. As a result, we are subject to a number of risks resulting from such operations. International sales comprise a significant portion of our product sales, which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks. Such risks include political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, foreign currency fluctuations, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws. Competitors based in the countries where we have substantial sales, such as Japan, may be able to supply products to customers in those countries more efficiently and at lower prices than we are able to. There can be no assurance that such factors will not adversely impact our results of operations in the future or require us to modify our current business practices. Our business is also subject to risks generally associated with doing business with third-party manufacturers in non-U.S. jurisdictions including, but not limited to, government regulations and political and financial unrest, which may cause disruptions or delays in shipments to our customers or access to our inventories. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by these or other factors related to our international operations. 17 Table of Contents We are subject to environmental laws that are subject to change and may restrict the marketability of certain of our products, which could adversely impact our financial performance or expose us to future liabilities. We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the use of and human exposure to hazardous materials. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to future liabilities or result in the limitation or suspension of the sale or production of product, including without limitation, products that do not meet the various regulations relating to use of lead-free components in products. Our products as manufactured contain lead, but in ceramic form (the ferroelectric memory capacitor) and are at levels below the threshold concentration levels specified by RoHS and similar directives. However, these directives are still subject to amendment and such changes may be unfavorable to our products. Any supply of products that infringe applicable environmental laws may subject us to penalties, customer litigation or governmental sanctions, which may result in significant costs to us, which could adversely impact our results of operations. Our business operations are also subject to strict environmental regulations and legal uncertainties, which could impose unanticipated requirements on our business in the future and subject us to liabilities. Federal, state and local regulations impose various environmental controls on the discharge of chemicals and gases used in the manufacturing processes of our third-party foundry and contract manufacturers. Compliance with these regulations can be costly. Increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of semiconductor operations. Any changes in environmental rules and regulations may impose the need for additional investments in capital equipment and the implementation of compliance programs in the future. Any failure by us or our foundries or contract manufacturers to comply with present or future environmental rules and regulations regarding the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to serious liabilities or cause our foundries or contract manufacturers to suspend manufacturing operations, which could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to the costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements, in the future we may incur costs defending against environmental litigation brought by government agencies and private parties. We may be defendants in lawsuits brought by parties in the future alleging environmental damage, personal injury or property damage. A significant judgment against us could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our stock price is extremely volatile and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in recent periods and is likely to continue to be volatile. A number of other factors and contingencies can affect the market price for our common stock, including the following:  actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;  the low daily trading volume of our stock, which has in recent years traded at prices below $5 per share;  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;  competition, including pricing pressures and the potential impact of competitors products on our sales;  conditions or trends in the semiconductor memory products industry;  unexpected design or manufacturing difficulties;  any announcement of potential design or manufacturing defects in our products;  changes in financial estimates or recommendations by stock market analysts regarding us or our competitors;  announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures; and additions or departures of our senior management; and  one shareholder owning approximately 9% of our outstanding common stock, the sale of which could affect the stock price. In addition, in recent years the stock market in general, and shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these technology companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating results. 18 Table of Contents Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and preferred shares rights agreement may have anti-takeover effects and could affect the price of our common stock. Our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the voting powers, designations, preferences and relative rights, qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the preferred stock, without any vote or action by our stockholders. Our authority to issue preferred stock with rights preferential to those of our common stock could be used to discourage attempts by others to obtain control of or acquire us, including an attempt in which the potential purchaser offers to pay a per share price greater than the current market price for our common stock, by making those attempts more difficult or costly to achieve. In addition, we may seek in the future to obtain new capital by issuing shares of preferred stock with rights preferential to those of our common stock. This provision could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock. We also entered into a preferred shares rights agreement with Citicorp N.A., as rights agent on April 19, 2001, which gives our stockholders certain rights that would likely delay, defer or prevent a change of control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors. On July 1, 2007, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. assumed these duties as rights agents. On March 2, 2011, the rights agreement was amended and its expiration extended to April 19, 2016. Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
