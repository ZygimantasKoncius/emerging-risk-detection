GENERAL We design and market Skechers-branded contemporary footwear for men, women and children under several unique lines. Our footwear reflects a combination of style, quality and value that appeals to a broad range of consumers. In addition to Skechers-branded lines, we also offer nine uniquely branded designer, fashion and street-focused footwear lines for men, women and children. These lines are branded and marketed separately from Skechers and appeal to specific audiences. Our brands are sold through department stores, specialty stores, athletic retailers, and boutiques as well as our e-commerce website and our own retail stores. We operate 50 concept stores, 61 factory outlet stores and 33 warehouse outlet stores in the United States, and 10 concept stores and two factory outlets internationally. Our objective is to profitably grow our operations worldwide while leveraging our recognizable Skechers brand through our strong product lines, innovative advertising and diversified distribution channels. We seek to offer consumers a vast array of fashionable footwear that satisfies their active, casual, dress casual and dress footwear needs. Our core consumers are style-conscious 12- to 24-year-old men and women attracted to our youthful brand image and fashion forward designs. Many of our best-selling and core styles are also developed for children with colors and materials that reflect a playful image appropriate for this demographic. We believe that brand recognition is an important element for success in the footwear business. We have aggressively promoted our brands through comprehensive marketing campaigns for men, women and children. In 2005, we signed American Idol winner and rising star Carrie Underwood for our domestic and international print advertising which ran through the end of 2006. During 2006, we continued our celebrity driven ads with the launch of platinum recording artist Ashlee Simpson as our new Skechers celebrity endorsee. In addition, we launched television sponsor spots for many of our Skechers branded mens and womens lines. Our strategy for kids continues to primarily focus on television ads. For adults, our strategy continues to focus on print advertisements in targeted publications, which are supported by sponsorship television spots. Select fashion brands were also supported by television commercials, including 310 and Marc Ecko Footwear. For 310 Motoring, we also continued print ads featuring accomplished actor Terrence Howard, and multi-platinum hip hop recording artist The Game for his signature 310 footwear line. Our Unltd. by Marc Ecko and Rhino Red Footwear lines are also supported through print ads developed by Marc Ecko, as well as ads for Zoo York and Avirex. During 2006, we signed Evangeline Lilly, star of the hit TV show Lost, to support our Michelle K line. Since we introduced our first line, Skechers USA Sport Utility Footwear, in December 1992, we have expanded our product offering and grown our net sales while substantially increasing the breadth and penetration of our account base. Our mens, womens and childrens Skechers-branded product lines benefit from the Skechers reputation for contemporary and progressive styling, quality, comfort and affordability. Our lines that are not branded with the Skechers name benefit from our marketing support, quality management and expertise. To promote innovation and brand relevance, we manage our product lines separately by utilizing dedicated sales and design teams. Our product lines share back office services in order to limit our operating expenses and fully utilize our managements vast experience in the footwear industry. SKECHERS LINES Skechers USA. Our Skechers USA category for men and women includes five types of footwear: (i) Casuals, (ii) Dress Casuals, (iii) Comfort (for men only), (iv) Outdoor (for men only) and (v) Casual Fusion. This category is generally sold through mid-tier retailers, department stores and some footwear specialty shops. 2 Table of Contents  For men, the Casuals category includes black and brown boots, shoes and sandals that generally have a rugged urban design  some with industrial-inspired fashion features. This category is defined by the heavy-lugged outsole and value-oriented materials employed in the uppers. For women, the Casuals category includes basic black and brown oxfords and slip-ons, lug outsole boots, and casual sandals. The womens line also uses value-oriented materials, but a growing number of styles may also be designed in leather. We design and price both the mens and womens categories to appeal primarily to younger consumers with broad acceptance across age groups.  For men, the Dress Casuals category is comprised of basic black and brown mens shoes that feature shiny leathers and dress details, but may utilize traditional or lugged outsoles as well as value-oriented materials.

A category with unique features, we market and package the Skechers Comfort styles in a shoe box that is distinct from that of other categories in the Skechers USA line of footwear.  Our Outdoor styles for men primarily consist of hiker-influenced constructions including boots and shoes. While this category includes many technical performance features, we market this category of footwear primarily on the basis of style and comfort. Outsoles generally consist of molded and contoured hardened rubber. Many designs include gussetted tongues to prevent penetration of water and debris, cushioned mid-soles, motion control devices such as heel cups, water-resistant or water-proof construction and materials, and more durable hardware such as metal D-rings instead of eyelets. Uppers are generally constructed of heavily oiled nubuck and full-grain leathers.  Our Casual Fusion line is comprised of low-profile, sport-influenced Euro casuals targeted at trend-conscious young men and women. The outsoles are primarily rubber and adopted from our mens Sport and womens Active lines.

Street Casual is targeted to young consumers, but also appeals to a broader demographic.  Our Sport Sandals are primarily designed from existing Skechers Sport outsoles and may include many of the same sport features as our sneakers with the addition of new technologies geared toward making a comfortable sport sandal. Sport sandals are designed as seasonal footwear for the consumer who already wears our Skechers Sport sneakers. Skechers Active.

The outsoles project a sleeker profile and may be either leather or man-made. The uppers are quality leathers including glossy, box, distressed and aniline. Skechers Collection is designed and priced for young men seeking their first dress or evening shoe. Adding to the line is a reasonably priced assortment of stylized boots and oxfords designed in Italy.

Expanding on our heritage of cutting-edge utility footwear, Skechers Work offers a complete line of mens and womens sport oxfords, field boots, trail hikers and athletic shoes.

The uppers are in high-quality leather, nubuck, trubuck and durabuck. Constructed on high-abrasion, long wearing soles, the line is designed for men and women with jobs that require certain safety requirements.

Their innovative design includes a durable, ultra-lightweight safety toe, and high-grade materials for superior strength and comfort.  Our safety toe athletic sneakers, boots, hikers, oxfords and sport oxfords are ideal for environments requiring safety footwear.

Skechers Kids and Skechers Cali for Girls are comprised primarily of shoes that are designed as takedowns of their adult counterparts, allowing the younger set the opportunity to wear the same popular styles as their older siblings and schoolmates. This takedown strategy maintains the products integrity by offering premium leathers, hardware and outsoles without the attendant costs involved in designing and developing new products. In addition, we adapt current fashions from our mens and womens lines by modifying designs and choosing colors and materials that are more suitable for the playful image that we have established in the childrens footwear market. Each Skechers Kids line is marketed and packaged separately with a distinct shoe box. Skechers Kids shoes are available at department stores and specialty and athletic retailers. 4 Table of Contents  The Skechers Kids line includes embellishments or adornments such as fresh colors and fabrics from our Skechers adult shoes.

PRODUCT DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT Our principal goal in product design is to generate new and exciting footwear in all of our product lines with contemporary and progressive styles and comfort-enhancing performance features. Targeted to the active, youthful and style-savvy, we design most new styles to be fashionable and marketable to the 12- to 24-year old consumer, while substantially all of our lines appeal to the broader range of 5- to 40-year-old consumers, with an exclusive selection for infants and toddlers. While many of our shoes have performance features, we generally do not position our shoes in the marketplace as technical performance shoes. We believe that our products success is related to our ability to recognize trends in the footwear markets and to design products that anticipate and accommodate consumers ever-evolving preferences. We are able to quickly translate the latest footwear trends into stylish, quality footwear at a reasonable price by analyzing and interpreting current and emerging lifestyle trends. Lifestyle trend information is compiled and analyzed by our designers from various sources, including the review and analysis of modern music, television, cinema, clothing, alternative sports and other trend-setting media; traveling to domestic and international fashion markets to identify and confirm current trends; consulting with our retail and e-commerce customers for information on current retail selling trends; participating in major footwear trade shows to stay abreast of popular brands, fashions and styles; and subscribing to various fashion and color information services. In addition, a key component of our design philosophy is to continually reinterpret and develop our successful styles in our brands image. The footwear design process typically begins about nine months before the start of a season. Our products are designed and developed primarily by our in-house design staff. To promote innovation and brand relevance, we utilize dedicated design teams, who report to our senior design executives, and focus on each of the mens, womens and childrens categories. In addition, we utilize outside design firms on an item-specific basis to supplement our internal design efforts. The design process is extremely collaborative, as members of the design staff frequently meet with the heads of retail, merchandising, sales, production and sourcing to further refine our products to meet the particular needs of the target market. After a design team arrives at a consensus regarding the fashion themes for the coming season, the designers then translate these themes into our products. These interpretations include variations in product color, material structure and embellishments, which are arrived at after close consultation with our production department. Prototype blueprints and specifications are created and forwarded to our manufacturers for a design prototype. The design prototypes are then sent back to our design teams. Our major retail customers may also review these new design concepts. Customer input not only allows us to measure consumer reaction to the latest designs, but also affords us an opportunity to foster deeper and more collaborative relationships with our customers. We also occasionally order limited production runs that may initially be tested in our concept stores. By working closely with store personnel, we obtain customer feedback that often influences product design and development. Our design teams can easily and quickly modify and refine a design based on customer input. Generally, the production process can take six months to nine months from design concept to commercialization. 6 Table of Contents SOURCING Factories. Our products are produced by independent contract manufacturers located primarily in China and, to a lesser extent, in Italy, Vietnam, Brazil and various other countries. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities as we believe that the use of independent manufacturers substantially increases our production flexibility and capacity while reducing capital expenditures and avoiding the costs of managing a large production work force. When possible, we seek to use manufacturers that have previously produced our footwear, which we believe enhances continuity and quality while controlling production costs. We attempt to monitor our selection of independent factories to ensure that no one manufacturer is responsible for a disproportionate amount of our merchandise. We source product for styles that account for a significant percentage of our net sales from at least four different manufacturers. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we had four manufacturers that accounted for approximately 59.6% of total purchases. One manufacturer accounted for 30.8%, and two others each accounted for over 10.0% of our total purchases. To date, we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining manufacturing services. We finance our production activities in part through the use of interest-bearing open purchase arrangements with certain of our Asian manufacturers. These facilities currently bear interest at a rate between 0% and 1.5% for 30 to 60 days financing, depending on the factory. We believe that the use of these arrangements afford us additional liquidity and flexibility. We do not have any long-term contracts with any of our manufacturers; however, we have long-standing relationships with many of our manufacturers and believe our relationships to be good. We closely monitor sales activity after initial introduction of a product in our concept stores to determine whether there is substantial demand for a style, thereby aiding us in our sourcing decisions. Styles that have substantial consumer appeal are highlighted in upcoming collections or offered as part of our periodic style offerings, while less popular styles can be discontinued after only a limited production run. We believe that sales in our concept stores can also help forecast sales in national retail stores, and we share this sales information with our wholesale accounts. Sales, merchandising, production and allocations management analyze historical and current sales and market data from our wholesale account base and our own retail stores to develop an internal product quantity forecast that allows us to better manage our future production and inventory levels. For those styles with high sell-through percentages, we maintain an in-stock position to minimize the time necessary to fill customer orders by placing orders with our manufacturers prior to the time we receive customers orders for such footwear. Production Oversight. To safeguard product quality and consistency, we oversee the key aspects of production from initial prototype manufacture through initial production runs to final manufacture. Monitoring of all production is performed in the United States by our in-house production department and in Asia through an approximately 250-person staff working from our offices in China and Taiwan. We believe that our Asian presence allows us to negotiate supplier and manufacturer arrangements more effectively, decrease product turnaround time and ensure timely delivery of finished footwear. In addition, we require our manufacturers to certify that neither convicted, forced or indentured labor (as defined under U.S. law) nor child labor (as defined by the manufacturers country) is used in the production process, and that compensation will be paid according to local law and that the factory is in compliance with local safety regulations. Quality Control. We believe that quality control is an important and effective means of maintaining the quality and reputation of our products. Our quality control program is designed to ensure that not only finished goods meet our established design specifications, but also that all goods bearing our trademarks meet our standards for quality. Our quality control personnel located in China and Taiwan perform an array of inspection procedures at various stages of the production process, including examination and testing of prototypes of key raw materials prior to manufacture, samples and materials at various stages of production and final products prior to shipment. Our employees are on-site at each of our major manufacturers to oversee production. For some of our lower volume manufacturers, our staff is on-site during significant production runs or we will perform unannounced visits to their manufacturing sites to further monitor compliance with our manufacturing specifications. ADVERTISING AND MARKETING With a marketing philosophy of Unseen, Untold, Unsold, we take a targeted approach to marketing to drive traffic, build brand recognition and properly position our diverse lines within the marketplace. Senior management is directly involved in shaping our image and the conception, development and implementation of our advertising and marketing activities. The focus of our marketing plan is print and television advertising, which is supported by outdoor, trend-influenced marketing, public relations, promotions and 7 Table of Contents in-store support. In addition, we utilize celebrity endorsees in our advertisements. We also believe our Internet websites and trade shows are effective marketing tools to both consumers and corporate accounts. We have historically budgeted advertising as a percentage of projected net sales. During 2006, we broadened our marketing campaign which resulted in advertising and marketing expenditures equaling 6.9% of our annual net sales, which was higher than the prior year and below our targeted range of 8% to 10% of annual net sales. Advertising. The majority of our advertising is conceptualized by our in-house design team. We believe that our advertising strategies, methods and creative campaigns are directly related to our success. Through our lifestyle and image-driven advertising, we generally seek to build and increase brand awareness by linking the Skechers brand and our fashion and street brands to youthful, contemporary lifestyles and attitudes rather than to market a particular footwear product. In addition to our compelling Skechers lifestyle ads, we have also created product specific ads for our mens lines to appeal to men as well as women who purchase footwear for men. Our ads are designed with a broad approach to eliminate single categorization and to provide merchandise flexibility and to facilitate the brands and product designs direction of evolving footwear fashions and consumer preferences. To further build brand awareness and influence consumer spending, we have selectively signed endorsement agreements with celebrities whom we believed would reach new markets. In 2005, we signed American Idol winner and rising star Carrie Underwood for a Skechers marketing agreement through 2006, and in 2006 we signed pop star Ashlee Simpson to appear in Skechers marketing campaigns through 2007. In past years, we had similar endorsement agreements for Skechers with singers Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears, professional basketball player and actor Rick Fox, and actors Robert Downey, Jr., Matt Dillon and Rob Lowe. From time to time, we may sign other celebrities to endorse our brand name and image in order to strategically market our products among specific consumer groups in the future. In addition to advertising our Skechers branded lines through mens, womens and childrens ads, we also support Michelle K, Mark Nason, 310 Motoring, Marc Ecko, Zoo York and Avirex lines through individual unique print advertisements  some which may include celebrity endorsees. In 2006, we signed Evangeline Lilly, star of the hit TV show Lost, to appear in Michelle K advertisements through 2007. In 2005, we signed critically acclaimed actor Terrence Howard to appear in 310 lifestyle advertisements and we signed an agreement with multi-platinum hip hop superstar The Game to appear in marketing campaigns in support of his signature 310 shoe Hurricane. During 2006, we also signed an endorsement deal with Nas to support a 310 signature shoe. For Mark Nason, we have focused on key-selling styles in product-driven ads that captured the brands essence. For the Marc Ecko footwear brands, Marc Eckos design team has created relevant targeted ads for men and women. These include a multi-media mens campaign featuring our graffiti painted shoe as well as the first Unltd. by Marc Ecko for boys spot. In 2007, singer/actress JoJo became the new face of Rhino Red, and she will appear in print and outdoor advertising and a compelling television commercial. With a targeted approach, our print ads appear regularly in popular fashion and lifestyle consumer publications, such as GQ, Cosmopolitan, Elle, Lucky, In Style, Seventeen, Maxim, Slam, Road & Track, and Complex, as well as in weekly publications such as People, Us Weekly, Star, Sports Illustrated and InTouch, among others. Our television commercials are produced both in-house and through producers we have utilized in the past and are familiar with our brands. In 2006, we created product-driven sponsor spots like our first animated spot for Skechers Airators as well as lifestyle campaigns for men, women and kids. We have found these to be a cost-effective way to advertise during key national and cable programming in key selling seasons. Our in-house media buyer strategically selects the ideal programs and geographic areas for our commercials for maximum consumer impact. Outdoor. In an effort to reach consumers where they shop and in high traffic areas as they travel to and from work or while running errands, we continued our multi-level outdoor campaign that included kiosks in key malls across the United States, and billboards, transportation systems and telephone kiosks in North America and Europe. We believe these are effective and efficient ways to reach a broad range of consumers and leave a lasting impression of our many brands. Trend-Influenced Marketing/Public Relations. Our public relations teams objectives are to secure product placement in key fashion magazines, place our footwear on the feet of trend-setting celebrities, and garner positive and accurate press on our company. Through our commitment to aggressively promote our upcoming styles, our products are often featured in leading fashion and pop culture magazines, as well as in select films and popular television shows. Our footwear and our company have been prominently displayed and referenced on news and magazine shows including The Today Show, Good Day L.A., Entertainment Tonight, and E!; and on television programs, including Law & Order, Entourage, and The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch, among others. We have also amassed an array of prominent product placements in magazines including Lucky, Seventeen, OK!, Teen Vogue, CosmoGirl, InStyle, Stuff, Maxim, Slam, Dime and Footwear News. In addition, our brands have been associated with cutting edge events and select 8 Table of Contents celebrities, and our product has been seen worn by trend-setters like Denis Leary, Chris Cornell, Debra Messing, Nicole Richie, Ashlee Simpson, The Game, Paris Hilton and Jamie Foxx, among others. Promotions. By applying creative sales techniques via a broad spectrum of mediums, our marketing team seeks to build brand recognition and drive traffic to Skechers retail stores, websites and our retail partners locations. Skechers promotional strategies have encompassed in-store specials, charity events, product tie-ins and giveaways, and collaborations with national retailers and radio stations. Our imaginative promotions are consistent with Skechers imaging and lifestyle. Visual Merchandising. Our in-house visual merchandising team supports wholesale accounts, distributors and our retail stores by developing displays that effectively leverage our products at the point of purchase. Our point-of-purchase display items include signage, graphics, displays, counter cards, banners and other merchandising items. These materials mirror the look and feel of our national print advertising in order to reinforce brand image at the point-of-purchase. Our visual merchandising coordinators (VMCs) work with our sales force and directly with our customers to ensure better sell-through at the retail level by generating greater consumer awareness through Skechers brand displays. Our VMCs communicate with and visit our wholesale customers on a regular basis to aid in proper display of our merchandise. They also run in-store promotions to enhance the sale of Skechers footwear and create excitement surrounding the Skechers brand. We believe that these efforts help stimulate impulse sales and repeat purchases. Trade Shows. To better showcase our diverse products to footwear buyers in the United States and Europe, and to distributors around the world, we regularly exhibit at leading trade shows. Along with specialty trade shows, we exhibit at WSAs The Shoe Show, FFANY, ASR and MAGIC in the United States, and GDS, MICAM, Bread & Butter, MIDEC and Whos Next in Europe. Our dynamic, state-of-the-art trade show exhibits are developed by our in-house architect to showcase our latest product offerings in a lifestyle setting reflective of each of our brands. By investing in innovative displays and individual rooms showcasing each line, our sales force can present a sales plan for each line and buyers are able to truly understand the breadth and depth of our offerings, thereby optimizing commitments and sales at the retail level. For select non-Skechers branded lines such as Michelle K, 310 Motoring and our Marc Ecko footwear lines, we have created individual exhibits to ensure their brand integrity. Our innovative exhibits have won numerous awards over the years, including Best Booth Design at the WSA Shoe Show, February 2001 and February 2003, and for our Unltd. by Marc Ecko and Rhino Red booth in August 2004 and February 2005. Internet. We also promote our brands through our e-commerce websites www.skechers.com and www.soholab.com to consumers who access the Internet. These websites currently enable us to present information on our products, provide a brand experience and store locations to consumers, and allow consumers the ability to directly order products on the Internet. These sites also provide us a mechanism for customer feedback as well as allowing us to receive and respond directly to consumer feedback. Our websites are intended to enhance the Skechers brand and increase sales through all our retail channels. Similarly, www.soholab.com is an extension of our SoHo Lab retail stores and allows us the opportunity to offer consumers our fashion and street brands through an e-commerce site. Our websites also allow us to leverage our brand awareness at a lower cost than traditional distribution channels. Along with www.skechers.com and www.soholab.com, we have also established unique Internet websites for our fashion brands Mark Nason (www.marknason.com) and 310 Motoring (www.310motoring.com). These websites are designed to serve as marketing tools, properly imaging these brands while also informing customers about the respective product lines. PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS We have four reportable segments  domestic wholesale sales, international wholesale sales, retail sales and e-commerce sales. In the United States, our products are available through a network of wholesale accounts comprised of department, athletic and specialty stores. Internationally, our products are available through wholesale accounts in more than 100 countries and territories through our global network of distributors and our Canadian and European subsidiaries. Additionally, 15 distributors have opened 52 distributor-owned Skechers retail stores in 21 countries as of December 31, 2006. Skechers owns and operates retail stores both domestically and internationally through three integrated retail formatsconcept, factory outlet and warehouse outlet stores. Each of these channels serves an integral function in the global distribution of our products. Domestic Wholesale. We distribute our footwear through the following domestic wholesale distribution channels: department stores, specialty stores, athletic shoe stores and independent retailers. Department stores and specialty retailers are the largest distribution channels, but we believe that we appeal to a variety of wholesale accounts, many of whom may operate stores within the same retail location due to our distinct product lines and variety of styles, from which retailers can select those lines and styles that 9 Table of Contents best satisfy the fashion, function and price criteria of their customers. Management has a clearly defined growth strategy for each of our channels of distribution. An integral component of our strategy is to offer our accounts the highest level of customer service so that our products will be fully represented in existing retail locations and new locations within each account. In an effort to provide knowledgeable and personalized service to our wholesale accounts, the sales force is segregated by product line, each of which is headed by a vice president or national sales manager. Reporting to each sales manager are knowledgeable account executives and territory managers. Our vice presidents and national sales managers report to a senior vice president of sales. All of our vice presidents and national sales managers are compensated on a salary basis, while our account executives and territory managers are compensated on a commission basis. None of our domestic sales personnel sell competing products. We believe that we have developed a loyal customer base of wholesale accounts through a heightened level of customer service. We believe that our close relationships with these accounts help us to maximize their retail sell-throughs. Our visual merchandise coordinators work with our wholesale accounts to ensure that our merchandise and point-of-purchase marketing materials are properly presented. Sales executives and merchandise personnel work closely with accounts to ensure that appropriate styles are purchased for specific accounts and for specific stores within those accounts as well as to ensure that appropriate inventory levels are carried at each store. Such information is then utilized to help develop sales projections and determine the product needs of our wholesale accounts. The value-added services we provide our wholesale customers help us maintain strong relationships with our existing wholesale customers and attract potential new wholesale customers. International Wholesale. Our products are sold in more than 100 countries and territories throughout the world. We generate revenues from outside the United States from three principal sources: (i) direct sales to department stores and specialty retail stores through our subsidiaries in Canada, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, Austria, the Benelux Region and the United Kingdom (ii) sales of our footwear to foreign distributors who distribute such footwear to department stores and specialty retail stores in countries and territories across Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America, South America, Africa, the Middle East and Australia, among other regions and (iii) to a lesser extent, royalties from licensees who manufacture and distribute our non-footwear products outside the United States. We believe that international distribution of our products represents a significant opportunity to increase sales and profits. We intend to further increase our share of the international footwear market by heightening our marketing presence in those countries in which we currently have a presence through our international advertising campaigns, which are designed to establish Skechers as a global brand synonymous with trend-right casual shoes.  International Subsidiaries Europe We currently distribute product in most of Western Europe through the following subsidiaries: Skechers USA Ltd., with its offices and showrooms in London, England; Skechers S.a.r.l., with its offices and showrooms in Lausanne, Switzerland; Skechers USA France S.A.S., with its offices and showrooms in Paris, France; Skechers USA Deutschland GmbH, with its offices and showrooms in Dietzenbach, Germany; Skechers USA Iberia, S.L., with its offices and showrooms in Madrid, Spain; Skechers USA Benelux B.V., with its offices and showrooms in Waalwijk, the Netherlands; and Skechers USA Italia S.r.l., with its offices and showroom in Verona, Italy. Skechers-owned retail stores in Europe include nine concept stores and one factory outlet store located in five countries, including the key locations of Oxford Street in London, Alstadt District in Düsseldorf and Kalverstraat Street in Amsterdam. To accommodate our European subsidiaries operations, we operate an approximately 240,000 square foot distribution center in Liege, Belgium. This distribution center is currently used to store and deliver product to our subsidiaries and retail stores throughout Europe. Canada Merchandising and marketing of our product in Canada is managed by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Skechers USA Canada, Inc. with its offices and showrooms outside Toronto in Mississauga, Ontario. Product sold in Canada is 10 Table of Contents primarily sourced from our U.S. distribution center in Ontario, California. We have two concept stores, one located in Torontos Eaton Centre, and one in the West Edmonton Mall and one factory outlet store located in Toronto.  Distributors Outside of Western Europe and Canada, our footwear is distributed through an extensive network of more than 30 distributors, who sell our products to department, athletic and specialty stores in more than 100 countries around the world. Through agreements with 14 of these distributors, 51 distributor-owned Skechers retail stores are open in 20 countries, including 15 stores that were opened in 2006 and one that was opened to date in 2007. Two distributor-owned stores were closed in 2006. STORE NUMBER OF REGION FORMAT STORES LOCATION(1) Asia Concept 4 Osaka, Japan; Tokyo, Japan; Shanghai, China; Malaysia Warehouse 4 Osaka, Japan (2); Shizuoka, Japan; Tochigi-ken, Japan Australia Concept 1 Sydney, Australia Warehouse 1 Sydney, Australia Central America/South America Concept 26 Chile (7); Columbia (6); Ecuador; El Salvador; Guatemala (2); Panama (2); Peru; Venezuela (6) Western Europe Concept 6 Spain (6) Eastern Europe Concept 4 Moscow, Russia (2); Kiev, Ukraine; Poland Middle East Concept 4 Saudi Arabia (3); Dubai, UAE South Africa Concept 1 Sandton, South Africa (1) One store per location except as otherwise noted. The distributors are responsible for their respective stores operations, have ownership of their respective stores assets and select the broad collection of our products to sell to consumers in their regions. In order to maintain a globally consistent image, we provide architectural, graphic and visual guidance and materials for the design of the stores, and we train the local staff on our products and corporate culture. We intend to expand our international presence and global recognition of the Skechers brand name by continuing to sell our footwear to foreign distributors and by opening flagship retail stores with distributors that have local market expertise. Retail Stores. We pursue our retail store strategy through our three integrated retail formats: the concept store, the factory outlet store and the warehouse outlet store. Our three-store format enables us to promote the full Skechers product offering in an attractive environment that appeals to a broad group of consumers. In addition to Skechers stores, we also operate SoHo Lab concept stores, which are designed to specifically promote our SoHo Lab and other fashion brands as well as more fashionable Skechers styles. This format also allows us to manage our inventory in an efficient and brand sensitive manner. In addition, most of our retail stores are profitable and have a positive effect on our operating results. As of February 28, 2007, we owned and operated 50 concept stores, 61 factory outlet stores and 33 warehouse outlet stores in the United States, and 10 concept stores and two factory outlet stores internationally. We closed three stores and opened 23 new stores in 2006. We opened four new stores in the first two months of 2007, while closing one store in Germany, and we plan to open an additional 20 to 25 stores by the end of 2007. In addition, we own and operate six SoHo Lab concept stores, including four that opened in 2006.  Concept Stores. Our concept stores are located at either marquee street locations or in major shopping malls in large metropolitan cities. Our concept stores have a threefold purpose in our operating strategy. First, concept stores serve as a showcase for a wide range of our product offering for the current season as we estimate that our average wholesale customer carries no more than 5% of the complete Skechers line in any one location. Our concept stores showcase our products in a cutting-edge, open-floor setting, providing the customer with the complete Skechers story. Second, retail locations are generally chosen to generate maximum marketing value for the Skechers brand name through signage, store front presentation and interior design. Domestic locations include concept stores at Times Square and 34th Street in New York, Hollywood and Highland in Hollywood, Santa Monicas Third Street Promenade, Dallas Northpark Center, Las Vegas Fashion Show Mall, Seattles 11 Table of Contents Bellevue Square Mall, Woodfield Mall outside Chicago and international locations include Oxford Street in London, Alstadt District in Dusseldorf, Torontos Eaton Centre, and Kalverstraat Street in Amsterdam. The stores are typically designed to create a distinctive Skechers look and feel, and enhance customer association of the Skechers brand name with current youthful lifestyle trends and styles. Third, the concept stores serve as marketing and product testing venues. We believe that product sell-through information and rapid customer feedback derived from our concept stores enables our design, sales, merchandising and production staff to respond to market changes and new product introductions. Such responses serve to augment sales and limit our inventory markdowns and customer returns and allowances. We opened 13 domestic concept stores, one international concept store and closed one domestic concept store in 2006. The typical Skechers concept store is approximately 2,500 square feet, although in certain markets we have opened concept stores as large as 6,400 square feet or as small as 1,200 square feet. When deciding where to open concept stores, we identify top geographic markets in the larger metropolitan cities in the United States, Europe and Canada. When selecting a specific site, we evaluate the proposed sites traffic pattern, co-tenancies, sales volume of neighboring concept stores, lease economics and other factors considered important within the specific location. If we are considering opening a concept store in a shopping mall, our strategy is to obtain space as centrally located as possible in the mall where we expect foot traffic to be most concentrated. We believe that the strength of the Skechers brand name has enabled us to negotiate more favorable terms with shopping malls that want us to open up concept stores to attract customer traffic to their venues. In an effort to market and test our non-Skechers brands, we opened a new concept format store, SoHo Lab. In 2004, we converted an existing Skechers concept store in New Yorks SoHo district to the new format. In 2005, we converted two additional Skechers concept stores in urban and/or fashion locations to SoHo Lab stores. In 2006, we opened four more SoHo Lab locations built from the ground up, including San Diegos Gas Lamp District. We also converted one SoHo Lab store back to a Skechers concept store in 2006, bringing our total for this concept to six. These stores may also include more fashion forward Skechers styles.  Factory Outlet Stores. Our factory outlet stores are generally located in manufacturers direct outlet centers throughout the United States. In addition, we have two international outlet stores  one in Canada and one in England. Our factory outlet stores provide opportunities for us to sell discontinued and excess merchandise, thereby reducing the need to sell such merchandise to discounters at excessively low prices, which could otherwise compromise the Skechers brand image. Skechers factory outlet stores range in size from approximately 1,900 to 9,000 square feet. Inventory in these stores is supplemented by certain first-line styles sold at full retail price points. We opened eight domestic factory outlet stores in 2006.  Warehouse Outlet Stores. Our free-standing warehouse outlet stores, which are located throughout the United States, enable us to liquidate excess merchandise, discontinued lines and odd-size inventory in a cost-efficient manner. Skechers warehouse outlet stores range in size from approximately 5,200 to 14,800 square feet. Our warehouse outlet stores enable us to sell discontinued and excess merchandise that would otherwise typically be sold to discounters at excessively low prices, which could otherwise compromise the Skechers brand image. We seek to open our warehouse outlet stores in areas that are in close proximity to our concept stores in order to facilitate the timely transfer of inventory that we want to liquidate as soon as practicable. We opened one new warehouse outlet store in 2006. Electronic Commerce. Our e-commerce sales represented less than 1.0% of total net sales in each of 2006, 2005 and 2004. Our websites, www.skechers.com and www.soholab.com are virtual storefronts that promote the Skechers and street and fashion brands. Our websites are designed to provide a positive shopping and brand experience, showcasing our products in an easy-to-navigate format, allowing consumers to browse our selections and purchase our footwear. This virtual store has provided a convenient alternative-shopping environment and brand experience. These websites have become an efficient and effective additional retail distribution channel, and have improved our customer service. LICENSING We believe that selective licensing of the Skechers brand name and our product line names to manufacturers may broaden and enhance the individual brands without requiring significant capital investments or additional incremental operating expenses. Our multiple product lines plus additional subcategories present many potential licensing opportunities on terms with licensees that we 12 Table of Contents believe will provide more effective manufacturing, distribution or marketing of non-footwear products. We also believe that the reputation of Skechers and its history in launching brands has also enabled us to partner with reputable non-footwear brands in order to design and market their footwear. The first launch of Skechers licensed product was Skechers Kids apparel for boys and girls from the licensee, Kids Headquarters, in the United States for the 2003 back-to-school selling season. Due to the successful in-store launch of Skechers Kids, we expanded our licensing agreement with Kids Headquarters to include infant and toddler apparel, boys and girls daywear and sleepwear, and swimwear for boys and girls. As of February 28, 2007, we had 10 active domestic and international licensing agreements in which we are the licensor. We have international licensing agreements for the design and distribution of mens and womens active apparel in Israel; mens and womens apparel in select European countries; bags in select Central and South American countries; watches in the Philippines, and bags in China. We have signed agreements to design, develop and market footwear for the street lifestyle apparel brands, Ecko Unltd., Ecko Red, Red by Marc Ecko, Zoo York and Avirex under the Marc Ecko Enterprises umbrella, and apparel and footwear for Kitson, the ultra-hip Hollywood boutique. DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS We believe that strong distribution support is a critical factor in our operations. Once manufactured, our products are packaged in shoe boxes bearing bar codes that are shipped either (i) to our approximately 1.7 million square-foot distribution centers located in Ontario, California, (ii) to our approximately 240,000 square-foot distribution center located in Liege, Belgium or (iii) directly from third-party manufacturers to our other international customers. Upon receipt at either of the distribution centers, merchandise is inspected and recorded in our management information system and packaged according to customers orders for delivery. Merchandise is shipped to customers by whatever means each customer requests, which is usually by common carrier. The distribution centers have multi-access docks, enabling us to receive and ship simultaneously, and to pack separate trailers for shipments to different customers at the same time. We have an electronic data interchange system, or EDI system, to which some of our larger customers are linked. This system allows these customers to automatically place orders with us, thereby eliminating the time involved in transmitting and inputting orders, and it includes direct billing and shipping information. BACKLOG As of December 31, 2006, our backlog was $322.9 million, compared to $250.5 million as of December 31, 2005. While backlog orders are subject to cancellation by customers, we have not experienced significant cancellation of orders in the past, and we expect that substantially all the orders will be shipped in 2007. However, for a variety of reasons, including customer demand for our products, the timing of shipments, product mix of customer orders, the amount of in-season orders and a shift towards tighter lead times within backlog levels, backlog may not be a reliable measure of future sales for any succeeding period. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS We own and utilize a variety of trademarks, including the Skechers trademark. We have a significant number of both registrations and pending applications for our trademarks in the United States. In addition, we have trademark registrations and trademark applications in approximately 80 foreign countries. We also have design patents and pending design and utility patent applications in both the United States and approximately 25 foreign countries. We continuously look to increase the number of our patents and trademarks both domestically and internationally where necessary to protect valuable intellectual property. We regard our trademarks and other intellectual property as valuable assets and believe that they have significant value in the marketing of our products. We vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement, including through the use of cease and desist letters, administrative proceedings and lawsuits. We rely on trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret protection, non-disclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to establish, protect and enforce intellectual property rights in our logos, tradenames and in the design of our products. In particular, we believe that our future success will largely depend on our ability to maintain and protect the Skechers trademark. Despite our efforts to safeguard and maintain our intellectual property rights, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in this regard. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that our trademarks, products and promotional materials or other intellectual property rights do not or will not violate the intellectual property rights of others, that our intellectual property would be upheld if challenged, or that we would, in such an 13 Table of Contents event, not be prevented from using our trademarks or other intellectual property rights. Such claims, if proven, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, although any such claims may ultimately prove to be without merit, the necessary management attention to and legal costs associated with litigation or other resolution of future claims concerning trademarks and other intellectual property rights could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have sued and have been sued by third parties for infringement of intellectual property. It is our opinion that none of these claims has materially impaired our ability to utilize our intellectual property rights. The laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent or in the same manner as do the laws of the United States. Although we continue to implement protective measures and intend to defend our intellectual property rights vigorously, these efforts may not be successful or the costs associated with protecting our rights in certain jurisdictions may be prohibitive. From time to time we discover products in the marketplace that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe upon intellectual property rights held by us. Actions taken by us to establish and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violating trademarks and intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in challenging a third partys products on the basis of infringement of our intellectual property rights, continued sales of such products by that or any other third party could adversely impact the Skechers brand, result in the shift of consumer preferences away from our products and generally have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. COMPETITION Competition in the footwear industry is intense. Although we believe that we do not compete directly with any single company with respect to its entire range of products, our products compete with other branded products within their product category as well as with private label products sold by retailers, including some of our customers. Our utility footwear and casual shoes compete with footwear offered by companies such as The Timberland Company, Dr. Martens, Kenneth Cole Productions Inc., Steven Madden, Ltd., Wolverine World Wide, Inc., V.F. Corporation, and CROCS, Inc. Our athletic lifestyle shoes compete with footwear offered by companies such as Nike, Inc., Reebok International Ltd., Adidas-Salomon AG, Puma AG and New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc. Our childrens shoes compete with footwear offered by companies such as The Stride Rite Corporation. In varying degrees, depending on the product category involved, we compete on the basis of style, price, quality, comfort and brand name prestige and recognition, among other considerations. These and other competitors pose challenges to our market share in our major domestic markets and may make it more difficult to establish our products in Europe, Asia and other international regions. We also compete with numerous manufacturers, importers and distributors of footwear for the limited shelf space available for the display of such products to the consumer. Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing capacity allows ease of access by new market entrants. Many of our competitors are larger, have been in existence for a longer period of time, have achieved greater recognition for their brand names, have captured greater market share and/or have substantially greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do. We cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully against present or future competitors, or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. EMPLOYEES As of February 28, 2007, we employed 3,628 persons, 1,982 of whom were employed on a full-time basis and 1,646 of whom were employed on a part-time basis. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information in this annual report, the following factors should be considered in evaluating us and our business. Our Future Success Depends On Our Ability To Respond To Changing Consumer Demands, Identify And Interpret Fashion Trends And Successfully Market New Products. The footwear industry is subject to rapidly changing consumer demands and fashion trends. Accordingly, we must identify and interpret fashion trends and respond in a timely manner. Demand for and market acceptance of new products are uncertain and achieving market acceptance for new products generally requires substantial product development and marketing efforts and 14 Table of Contents expenditures. If we do not continue to meet changing consumer demands and develop successful styles in the future, our growth and profitability will be negatively impacted. We frequently make decisions about product designs and marketing expenditures several months in advance of the time when consumer acceptance can be determined. If we fail to anticipate, identify or react appropriately to changes in styles and trends or are not successful in marketing new products, we could experience excess inventories, higher than normal markdowns or an inability to profitably sell our products. Because of these risks, a number of companies in the footwear industry specifically, and others in the fashion and apparel industry in general, have experienced periods of rapid growth in revenues and earnings and thereafter periods of declining sales and losses, which in some cases have resulted in companies in these industries ceasing to do business. Similarly, these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Our Business And The Success Of Our Products Could Be Harmed If We Are Unable To Maintain Our Brand Image. Our success to date has been due in large part to the strength of the Skechers brand, and to a lesser degree, the reputation of our fashion brands. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand, our brand name and brand image may be impaired. Even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences, consumers may consider our brand image to be outdated or associate our brand with styles of footwear that are no longer popular. In the past, several footwear companies including ours have experienced periods of rapid growth in revenues and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses. Our business may be similarly affected in the future. Our Business Could Be Harmed If We Fail To Maintain Proper Inventory Levels. We place orders with our manufacturers for some of our products prior to the time we receive all of our customers orders. We do this to minimize purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non-delivery. We also maintain an inventory of certain products that we anticipate will be in greater demand. However, we may be unable to sell the products we have ordered in advance from manufacturers or that we have in our inventory. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply the quality products that we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships, and diminish brand loyalty. We Face Intense Competition, Including Competition From Companies With Significantly Greater Resources Than Ours, And If We Are Unable To Compete Effectively With These Companies, Our Market Share May Decline And Our Business Could Be Harmed. We face intense competition in the footwear industry from other established companies. A number of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technological, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution resources than we do. Their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the footwear industry, compete more effectively on the basis of price and production and more quickly develop new products. In addition, new companies may enter the markets in which we compete, further increasing competition in the footwear industry. We believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including the style and quality of our products and the strength of our brand name, as well as many factors beyond our control. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand our development and marketing of new products, which would adversely impact the trading price of our Class A Common Stock. We Depend Upon A Relatively Small Group Of Customers For A Large Portion Of Our Sales. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, our net sales to our five largest customers accounted for approximately 24.9%, 25.4%, and 26.8% of total net sales, respectively. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales during 2006, 2005 and 2004. One customer accounted for 12.0% and 10.3% of net trade receivables at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. Although we have long-term relationships with many of our customers, our customers do not have a contractual obligation to purchase our products and we cannot be certain that we will be able to retain our existing major customers. Furthermore, the retail industry regularly experiences consolidation, contractions and closings which may result in our loss of customers or our inability to collect accounts receivable of major customers. If we lose a major customer, experience a significant decrease in sales to a major customer or are unable to collect the accounts receivable of a major customer, our business could be harmed. 15 Table of Contents Our International Sales And Manufacturing Operations Are Subject To The Risks Of Doing Business Abroad, Particularly In China, Which Could Affect Our Ability To Sell Or Manufacture Our Products In International Markets, Obtain Products From Foreign Suppliers Or Control The Costs Of Our Products. Substantially all of our net sales during the year ended December 31, 2006 were derived from sales of footwear manufactured in foreign countries, with most manufactured in China and, to a lesser extent, in Italy, Vietnam and Brazil. We also sell our footwear in several foreign countries and plan to increase our international sales efforts as part of our growth strategy. Foreign manufacturing and sales are subject to a number of risks, including the following: political and social unrest, including the military presence in Iraq; changing economic conditions; currency exchange rate fluctuations; international political tension and terrorism; labor shortages and work stoppages; electrical shortages, transportation delays; loss or damage to products in transit; expropriation; nationalization; the imposition of domestic and international tariffs and trade duties, import and export controls and other non-tariff barriers, exposure to different legal standards (particularly with respect to intellectual property), compliance with foreign laws, and changes in domestic and foreign governmental policies. We have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risks, but we cannot predict the likelihood of such developments occurring or the resulting long-term adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In particular, because most of our products are manufactured in China, adverse changes in trade or political relations with China, political instability in China, the occurrence of a natural disaster such as an earthquake or typhoon in China or the outbreak of a pandemic disease such as the Avian Flu in China could severely interfere with the manufacture of our products and would have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, electrical shortages, labor shortages or work stoppages may extend the production time necessary to produce our orders, and there may be circumstances in the future where we may have to incur premium freight charges to expedite the delivery of product to our customers. If we incur a significant amount of premium charges to airfreight product for our customers, our gross profit will be negatively affected if we are unable to collect those charges. Also, our manufacturers located in China may be subject to the effects of exchange rate fluctuations should the Chinese currency not remain stable with the U.S. dollar. The value of the Chinese currency depends to a large extent on the Chinese governments policies and Chinas domestic and international economic and political developments. Since 1994, the official exchange rate for the conversion of the Chinese currency was pegged to the U.S. dollar at a virtually fixed rate of approximately 8.28 Yuan per U.S. dollar. However, on July 21, 2005, the Chinese government revalued the Yuan by 2.1%, setting the exchange rate at 8.11 Yuan per U.S. dollar, and adopted a more flexible system based on a trade-weighted basket of foreign currencies of Chinas main trading partners. Under the new managed float policy, the exchange rate of the Yuan may shift each day up to 0.3% in either direction from the previous days close, and as a result, the valuation of the Yuan may increase incrementally over time should the China central bank allow it to do so, which could significantly increase labor and other costs incurred in the production of our footwear in China. The Potential Imposition Of Additional Duties, Tariffs And Other Trade Restrictions Could Have An Adverse Impact On Our Sales And Profitability. All of our products manufactured overseas and imported into the United States, the European Union (EU) and other countries are subject to customs duties collected by customs authorities. Customs information submitted by us is routinely subject to review by customs authorities. We are unable to predict whether additional customs duties, anti-dumping duties, quotas, safeguard measures or other trade restrictions may be imposed on the importation of our products in the future. Such actions could result in increases in the cost of our products generally and might adversely affect the sales and profitability of Skechers and the imported footwear industry as a whole. We May Be Unable To Successfully Execute Our Growth Strategy Or Maintain Our Growth. Although our company has generally exhibited steady growth since we began operations, we had a decrease in net sales in the past and our rate of growth has declined at times as well, and we may experience similar decreases in net sales or declines in rate of growth again in the future. Our ability to grow in the future depends upon, among other things, the continued success of our efforts to maintain our brand image and expand our footwear offerings and distribution channels. Furthermore, as our business grows, we may need to improve and enhance our overall financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures to effectively manage our growth. We may be unable to successfully implement our current growth strategy or other growth strategies or effectively manage our growth, any of which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 16 Table of Contents Our Business May Be Negatively Impacted As A Result Of Changes In The Economy. Our business depends on the general economic environment and levels of consumer spending that affect not only the ultimate consumer, but also retailers, our primary direct customers. Purchases of footwear tend to decline in periods of recession or uncertainty regarding future economic prospects, when consumer spending, particularly on discretionary items, declines. During periods of recession or economic uncertainty, we may not be able to maintain or increase our sales to existing customers, make sales to new customers, open and operate new retail stores, maintain sales levels at our existing stores, maintain or increase our international operations on a profitable basis, or maintain or improve our earnings from operations as a percentage of net sales. As a result, our operating results may be adversely and materially affected by downward trends in the economy or the occurrence of events that adversely affect the economy in general. Furthermore, in anticipation of continued increases in net sales, we have significantly expanded our infrastructure and workforce to achieve economies of scale. Because these expenses are mostly fixed in the short term, our operating results and margins will be adversely impacted if we do not continue to grow as anticipated. Economic, Political, Military Or Other Events In The United States Or In A Country Where We Make Significant Sales Or Have Significant Operations Could Interfere With Our Success Or Operations There And Harm Our Business. We market and sell our products and services throughout the world. The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks disrupted commerce throughout the United States and other parts of the world. The continued threat of similar attacks throughout the world and the military action, or possible military action, taken by the United States and other nations, in Iraq or other countries may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world. To the extent that such disruptions further slow the global economy or, more particularly, result in delays or cancellations of purchase orders for our products, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We are unable to predict whether the threat of new attacks or the responses thereto will result in any long-term commercial disruptions or if such activities or responses will have a long-term material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our Quarterly Revenues And Operating Results Fluctuate As A Result Of A Variety Of Factors, Including Seasonal Fluctuations In Demand For Footwear, Delivery Date Delays And Potential Fluctuations In Our Annualized Tax Rate, Which May Result In Volatility Of Our Stock Price. Our quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and can be expected to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our major customers generally have no obligation to purchase forecasted amounts and may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice and without penalty. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. In addition, sales of footwear products have historically been somewhat seasonal in nature with the strongest sales generally occurring in our second and third quarters for the back-to-school selling season. Back-to-school sales typically ship in June, July and August, and delays in the timing, cancellation, or rescheduling of these customer orders and shipments by our wholesale customers could negatively impact our net sales and results of operations for our second or third quarters. More specifically, the timing of when products are shipped is determined by the delivery schedules set by our wholesale customers, which could cause sales to shift between our second and third quarters. Because our expense levels are partially based on our expectations of future net sales, our expenses may be disproportionately large relative to our revenues, and we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shifts, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our annualized tax rate is based on projections of our domestic and international operating results for the year, which we review and revise as necessary at the end of each quarter, and it is highly sensitive to fluctuations in projected international earnings. Any quarterly fluctuations in our annualized tax rate that may occur could have a material impact on our quarterly operating results. As a result of these specific and other general factors, our operating results will likely vary from quarter to quarter and the results for any particular quarter may not be necessarily indicative of results for the full year. Any shortfall in revenues or net income from levels expected by securities analysts and investors could cause a decrease in the trading price of our Class A Common Stock. We Rely On Independent Contract Manufacturers And, As A Result, Are Exposed To Potential Disruptions In Product Supply. Our footwear products are currently manufactured by independent contract manufacturers. During 2006 and 2005, the top four manufacturers of our products produced approximately 59.6% and 59.7% of our total purchases, respectively. One manufacturer accounted for 30.8% and 32.4% of total purchases during 2006 and 2005, respectively. Two other manufacturers each accounted for over 10.0% of our total purchases during 2006, and one other manufacturer accounted for over 10.0% of our total purchases during 17 Table of Contents 2005. We do not have long-term contracts with our manufacturers, and we compete with other footwear companies for production facilities. We could experience difficulties with these manufacturers, including reductions in the availability of production capacity, failure to meet our quality control standards, failure to meet production deadlines or increased manufacturing costs. In particular, manufacturers in China are facing a labor shortage as migrant workers seek better wages and working conditions in farming and other vocations, and if this trend continues, our current manufacturers operations could be adversely affected. If our current manufacturers cease doing business with us, we could experience an interruption in the manufacture of our products. Although we believe that we could find alternative manufacturers, we may be unable to establish relationships with alternative manufacturers that will be as favorable as the relationships we have now. For example, new manufacturers may have higher prices, less favorable payment terms, lower manufacturing capacity, lower quality standards or higher lead times for delivery. If we are unable to provide products consistent with our standards or the manufacture of our footwear is delayed or becomes more expensive, this could result in our customers canceling orders, refusing to accept deliveries or demanding reductions in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our Business Could Be Harmed If Our Contract Manufacturers, Suppliers Or Licensees Violate Labor, Trade Or Other Laws. We require our independent contract manufacturers, suppliers and licensees to operate in compliance with applicable United States and foreign laws and regulations. Manufacturers are required to certify that neither convicted, forced or indentured labor (as defined under United States law) nor child labor (as defined by the manufacturers country) is used in the production process, that compensation is paid in accordance with local law and that their factories are in compliance with local safety regulations. Although we promote ethical business practices and our sourcing personnel periodically visit and monitor the operations of our independent contract manufacturers, suppliers and licensees, we do not control them or their labor practices. If one of our independent contract manufacturers, suppliers or licensees violates labor or other laws or diverges from those labor practices generally accepted as ethical in the United States, it could result in adverse publicity for us, damage our reputation in the United States or render our conduct of business in a particular foreign country undesirable or impractical, any of which could harm our business. In addition, if we, or our foreign manufacturers, violate United States or foreign trade laws or regulations, we may be subject to extra duties, significant monetary penalties, the seizure and the forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import or the loss of our import privileges. Possible violations of United States or foreign laws or regulations could include inadequate record keeping of our imported products, misstatements or errors as to the origin, quota category, classification, marketing or valuation of our imported products, fraudulent visas or labor violations. The effects of these factors could render our conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical and have a negative impact on our operating results. Our Operating Results Could Be Negatively Impacted If Our Sales Are Concentrated In Any One Style Or Group Of Styles. If any one style or group of similar styles of our footwear were to represent a substantial portion of our net sales, we could be exposed to risk should consumer demand for such style or group of styles decrease in subsequent periods. We attempt to mitigate this risk by offering a broad range of products, and no style comprised over 5% of our gross wholesale sales during 2006 or 2005. However, this may change in the future and fluctuations in sales of any given style that represents a significant portion of our future net sales could have a negative impact on our operating results. Our Strategies Involve A Number Of Risks That Could Prevent Or Delay Any Successful Opening Of New Stores As Well As Impact The Performance Of Our Existing Stores. Our ability to open and operate new stores successfully depends on many factors, including, among others, our ability to identify suitable store locations, the availability of which is outside of our control; negotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired tenant improvement allowances; source sufficient levels of inventory to meet the needs of new stores; hire, train and retain store personnel; successfully integrate new stores into our existing operations; and satisfy the fashion preferences in new geographic areas. In addition, some or a substantial number of new stores could be opened in regions of the United States in which we currently have few or no stores. Any expansion into new markets may present competitive, merchandising and distribution challenges that are different from those currently encountered in our existing markets. Any of these challenges could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, to the extent that any new store openings are in existing markets, we may experience reduced net sales volumes in existing stores in those markets. 18 Table of Contents Many Of Our Retail Stores Depend Heavily On The Customer Traffic Generated By Shopping And Factory Outlet Malls Or By Tourism. Many of our concept stores are located in shopping malls and some of our factory outlet stores are located in manufacturers outlet malls where we depend on obtaining prominent locations and the overall success of the malls to generate customer traffic. We cannot control the development of new malls, the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new malls or the success of individual malls. Some of our concept stores occupy street locations that are heavily dependent on customer traffic generated by tourism. Any substantial decrease in tourism resulting from political, social or military events, a downturn in the economy or otherwise, is likely to adversely affect sales in our existing stores, particularly those with street locations. The effects of these factors could hinder our ability to open retail stores in new markets or reduce sales of particular existing stores, which could negatively affect our operating results. We Depend On Key Personnel To Manage Our Business Effectively In A Rapidly Changing Market, And If We Are Unable To Retain Existing Personnel, Our Business Could Be Harmed. Our future success depends upon the continued services of Robert Greenberg, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Greenberg, President, and David Weinberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. The loss of the services of any of these individuals or any other key employee could harm us. Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain additional qualified personnel. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. The Disruption, Expense And Potential Liability Associated With Existing And Unanticipated Future Litigation Against Us Could Have A Material Adverse Effect On Our Business, Results Of Operations And Financial Condition. We are subject to various legal proceedings and threatened legal proceedings from time to time as part of our business. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings or aware of any threatened legal proceedings, the adverse outcome of which, individually or in the aggregate, we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. However, any unanticipated litigation in the future, regardless of its merits, could significantly divert managements attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees to us. Further, there can be no assurance that any actions that have been or will be brought against us will be resolved in our favor or, if significant monetary judgments are rendered against us, that we will have the ability to pay such judgments. Such disruptions, legal fees and any losses resulting from these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our Trademarks, Design Patents And Other Intellectual Property Rights May Not Be Adequately Protected Outside The United States. We believe that our trademarks, design patents and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position. We devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and design patents on a worldwide basis. In the course of our international expansion, we have, however, experienced conflicts with various third parties that have acquired or claimed ownership rights in certain trademarks similar to ours or have otherwise contested our rights to our trademarks. We have in the past successfully resolved these conflicts through both legal action and negotiated settlements, none of which we believe has had a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Nevertheless, we cannot assure you that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights outside the United States will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and proprietary rights of others. Also, we cannot assure you that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks, designs and other proprietary rights of ours or that we will be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights outside the United States, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition may be adversely affected. Our Ability To Compete Could Be Jeopardized If We Are Unable To Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights Or If We Are Sued For Intellectual Property Infringement. We use trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying us and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We 19 Table of Contents consider our Skechers®, S in Shield Design® and Performance-S Shifted Design® trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in many countries. In addition, we own many other trademarks, which we utilize in marketing our products. We continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement. We also have a number of design patents and a limited number of utility patents covering components and features used in various shoes. We believe that our success depends primarily upon skills in design, research and development, production and marketing rather than upon our patent position. However, we have followed a policy of filing applications for United States and foreign patents on designs and technologies that we deem valuable. We believe that our patents and trademarks are generally sufficient to permit us to carry on our business as presently conducted. We cannot, however, know whether we will be able to secure patents or trademark protection for our intellectual property in the future or that protection will be adequate for future products. Further, we face the risk of ineffective protection of intellectual property rights in the countries where we source and distribute our products. We have been sued for patent and trademark infringement and cannot be sure that our activities do not and will not infringe on the proprietary rights of others. If we are compelled to prosecute infringing parties, defend our intellectual property or defend ourselves from intellectual property claims made by others, we may face significant expenses and liability and necessary management attention to such matters, which could negatively impact our business or financial condition. Natural Disasters Or A Decline In Economic Conditions In California Could Increase Our Operating Expenses Or Adversely Affect Our Sales Revenue. A substantial portion of our operations are located in California, including 40 of our retail stores, our headquarters in Manhattan Beach and our domestic distribution center in Ontario. Because a significant portion of our net sales is derived from sales in California, a decline in the economic conditions in California, whether or not such decline spreads beyond California, could materially adversely affect our business. Furthermore, a natural disaster or other catastrophic event, such as an earthquake or wild fires affecting California, could significantly disrupt our business including the operation of our only domestic distribution center. We may be more susceptible to these issues than our competitors whose operations are not as concentrated in California. Failure By Us To Comply With Any Of The Financial Covenants In Our Long-Term Debt Agreements And $150.0 Million Line Of Credit Facility Could Have A Material Adverse Impact On Our Business. A significant decrease in our operating results could adversely affect our ability to maintain required financial covenants under our various long-term debt agreements and our $150.0 million credit facility. If these financial covenants are not maintained, the creditors will have the option to require immediate repayment of all outstanding long-term debt and any amounts outstanding under the credit facility, if any, and some of these agreements also contain cross-default provisions. The most likely result would require us to renegotiate certain terms of these agreements, obtain waivers from the creditors or obtain new debt agreements with other creditors, which may contain less favorable terms. If we are unable to renegotiate acceptable terms, obtain necessary waivers or obtain new debt agreements, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. One Principal Stockholder Is Able To Control Substantially All Matters Requiring A Vote Of Our Stockholders And His Interests May Differ From The Interests Of Our Other Stockholders. As of December 31, 2006, Robert Greenberg, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned 77.4% of our outstanding Class B Common Stock and members of Mr. Greenbergs immediate family beneficially owned the remainder of our outstanding Class B Common Stock. The holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock have identical rights except that holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share while holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to ten votes per share on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. As a result, as of December 31, 2006, Mr. Greenberg beneficially owned approximately 64.3% of the aggregate number of votes eligible to be cast by our stockholders, and together with shares beneficially owned by other members of his immediate family, he beneficially owned approximately 83.1% of the aggregate number of votes eligible to be cast by our stockholders. Mr. Greenberg may have different interests than our other stockholders, and because he is able to control substantially all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, he may direct the operations of our business in a manner contrary to the interests of our other stockholders. Matters that require the approval of our stockholders include the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. Mr. Greenberg also has control over our management and affairs. As a result of such control, certain transactions are not possible without the approval of Mr. Greenberg, including proxy contests, tender offers, open market purchase programs or other transactions that can give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market prices for their shares of our Class A Common Stock. The 20 Table of Contents differential in the voting rights may adversely affect the value of our Class A Common Stock to the extent that investors or any potential future purchaser view the superior voting rights of our Class B Common Stock to have value. Our Charter Documents And Delaware Law May Inhibit A Takeover, Which May Cause A Decline In The Value Of Our Stock. Provisions of Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if closing such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders. Mr. Greenbergs substantial beneficial ownership position, together with the authorization of Preferred Stock, the disparate voting rights between our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, the classification of our Board of Directors and the lack of cumulative voting in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, may discourage bids for our Class A Common Stock at a premium over the market price of the Class A Common Stock and may adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
