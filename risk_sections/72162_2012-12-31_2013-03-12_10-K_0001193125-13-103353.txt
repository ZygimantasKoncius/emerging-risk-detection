ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Listed below are certain risk factors associated with us and our businesses. In addition to the potential effect of these risk factors discussed below, any risk factor which could result in reduced earnings or operating losses, or reduced liquidity, could in turn adversely affect our ability to service our liabilities or pay dividends on our common stock or adversely affect the quoted market prices for our securities. We could incur significant costs related to legal and environmental matters. We formerly manufactured lead pigments for use in paint. We and others have been named as defendants in various legal proceedings seeking damages for personal injury, property damage and governmental expenditures allegedly caused by the use of lead-based paints. These lawsuits seek recovery under a -19- variety of theories, including public and private nuisance, negligent product design, negligent failure to warn, strict liability, breach of warranty, conspiracy/concert of action, aiding and abetting, enterprise liability, market share or risk contribution liability, intentional tort, fraud and misrepresentation, violations of state consumer protection statutes, supplier negligence and similar claims. The plaintiffs in these actions generally seek to impose on the defendants responsibility for lead paint abatement and health concerns associated with the use of lead-based paints, including damages for personal injury, contribution and/or indemnification for medical expenses, medical monitoring expenses and costs for educational programs. As with all legal proceedings, the outcome is uncertain. Any liability we might incur in the future could be material. See also Item 3Legal Proceedings  Lead pigment litigation. Certain properties and facilities used in our former operations are the subject of litigation, administrative proceedings or investigations arising under various environmental laws. These proceedings seek cleanup costs, personal injury or property damages and/or damages for injury to natural resources. Some of these proceedings involve claims for substantial amounts. Environmental obligations are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons, and we may incur costs for environmental remediation in the future in excess of amounts currently estimated. Any liability we might incur in the future could be material. See also Item 3Legal Proceedings  Environmental matters and litigation. Our assets consist primarily of investments in our operating subsidiaries and affiliates, and we are dependent upon distributions from our subsidiaries and affiliates. The majority of our operating cash flows are generated by our operating subsidiaries and affiliates, and our ability to service liabilities and to pay dividends on our common stock depends to a large extent upon the cash dividends or other distributions we receive from our subsidiaries and affiliates. Our subsidiaries and affiliates are separate and distinct legal entities and they have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay such cash dividends or other distributions to us. In addition, the payment of dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries and affiliates could be subject to restrictions on, or taxation of, dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable law, monetary transfer restrictions, currency exchange regulations in jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries and affiliates operate or any other restrictions imposed by current or future agreements to which our subsidiaries and affiliates may be a party, including debt instruments. Events beyond our control, including changes in general business and economic conditions, could adversely impact the ability of our subsidiaries and affiliates to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. If our subsidiaries and affiliates were to become unable to make sufficient cash dividends or other distributions to us, our ability to service our liabilities and to pay dividends on our common stock could be adversely affected. In addition, a significant portion of our assets consist of ownership interests in our subsidiaries and affiliates. If we were required to liquidate any of such securities in order to generate funds to satisfy our liabilities, we may be required to sell such securities at a time or times at which we would not be able to realize what we believe to be the actual value of such assets. -20- Future acquisitions could subject us to a number of operational risks. A key component of our strategy is to grow and diversify our business through targeted acquisitions. Our ability to successfully execute this component of our strategy entails a number of risks, including:  the identification of suitable growth opportunities;  an inaccurate assessment of acquired liabilities that were undisclosed or not properly disclosed;  the entry into markets in which we may have limited or no experience;  the diversion of managements attention from our core businesses;  the potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses;  the potential of not identifying that acquired products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others;  difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings; and  an increase in our indebtedness and a limitation in our ability to access additional capital when needed. Many of the markets in which we operate are mature and highly competitive resulting in pricing pressure and the need to continuously reduce costs. Many of the markets CompX serves are highly competitive, with a number of competitors offering similar products. CompX focuses efforts on the middle and high-end business of the market where we feel that we can compete due to the importance of product design, quality and durability to the customer. However, our ability to effectively compete is impacted by a number of factors. The occurrence of any of these factors could result in reduced earnings or operating losses.  Competitors may be able to drive down prices for our products because their costs are lower than our costs, especially products sourced from Asia.  Competitors financial, technological and other resources may be greater than our resources, which may enable them to more effectively withstand changes in market conditions.  Competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements.  Consolidation of our competitors or customers in any of the markets in which we compete may result in reduced demand for our products.  New competitors could emerge by modifying their existing production facilities to manufacture products that compete with our products.  We may not be able to sustain a cost structure that enables us to be competitive.  Customers may no longer value our product design, quality or durability over the lower cost products of our competitors. Our development of innovative features for our current component products is critical to sustaining and growing our sales. Historically, CompXs ability to provide value-added custom engineered component products that address requirements of technology has been a key element of its success. We spend a significant amount of time and effort to -21- refine, improve and adapt our existing products for new customers and applications. Since expenditures for these types of activities are not considered research and development expense under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the amount of our research and development expenditures, which is not significant, is not indicative of the overall effort involved in the development of new product features. The introduction of new products and features requires the coordination of the design, manufacturing and marketing of such products with current and potential customers. The ability to coordinate these activities with current and potential customers may be affected by factors beyond CompXs control. While we will continue to emphasize the introduction of innovative new product features that target customer-specific opportunities, there can be no assurance that any new product features CompX introduces will achieve the same degree of success that it has achieved with its existing products. Introduction of new product features typically requires us to increase production volume on a timely basis while maintaining product quality. Manufacturers often encounter difficulties in increasing production volumes, including delays, quality control problems and shortages of qualified personnel or raw materials. As CompX attempts to introduce new product features in the future, there can be no assurance that CompX will be able to increase production volume without encountering these or other problems, which might negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights or claims by others that we infringe their intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business. CompX relies on patent, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in our technology and designs. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or misappropriated. Others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Further, there can be no assurance that any of our pending trademark or patent applications will be approved. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our intellectual property rights. In addition, the laws of certain countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our technology and designs adequately against unauthorized third party use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Third parties may claim that we or our customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Even if we believe that such claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and distract our management and technical staffs attention and resources. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected technology, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our technology. If we cannot or do not license the infringed technology on reasonable pricing terms or at all, or substitute similar technology from another source, our business could be adversely impacted. -22- Global climate change legislation could negatively impact our financial results or limit our ability to operate our businesses. CompX operates production facilities in the United States and Kronos operates production facilities in several countries. We believe that all production facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws. Legislation has been passed, or proposed legislation is being considered, to limit greenhouse gases through various means including emissions permits and/or energy taxes. In several production facilities, we consume large amounts of energy, including electricity and natural gas. To date the climate change legislation in effect has not had a material adverse effect on our financial results. However, if greenhouse gas legislation were to be enacted in one or more countries, it could negatively impact our future results from operations through increased costs of production, particularly as it relates to our energy requirements. If such increased costs of production were to materialize, we may be unable to pass price increases onto our customers to compensate for increased production costs, which may decrease our liquidity, income from operations and results of operations. Higher costs or limited availability of our raw materials may decrease our liquidity. Certain of the raw materials used in CompXs products are commodities that are subject to significant fluctuations in price in response to world-wide supply and demand as well as speculative investor activity. Zinc and brass are the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of security products. Stainless steel tubing is the major raw material used in the manufacture of marine exhaust systems. These raw materials are purchased from several suppliers and are generally readily available from numerous sources. CompX occasionally enters into short-term raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the impact of future increases in commodity raw material costs. Materials purchased outside of these arrangements are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases. Should our vendors not be able to meet their contractual obligations or should we otherwise be unable to obtain necessary raw materials, we may incur higher costs for raw materials or may be required to reduce production levels, either of which may decrease our liquidity as we may be unable to offset the higher costs with increases in our selling prices or reductions in other operating costs. For Kronos, the number of sources for and availability of certain raw materials is specific to the particular geographical region in which a facility is located. For example, titanium-containing feedstocks suitable for use in its TiO2 facilities are available from a limited number of suppliers around the world. Political and economic instability in the countries from which Kronos purchases raw material supplies could adversely affect their availability. If Kronos worldwide vendors were unable to meet their contractual obligations and it was unable to obtain necessary raw materials, Kronos could incur higher costs for raw materials or may be required to reduce production levels. After experiencing significant increases in feedstock ore costs in 2012 as compared to 2011, Kronos expects that its ore costs will be somewhat lower in 2013 as compared to 2012. Kronos may also experience higher operating costs such as energy costs, which could affect its profitability. Kronos may not always be able to increase selling prices to offset the impact of any higher costs or reduced production levels, which could reduce its earnings and decrease its liquidity. -23- Kronos has long-term supply contracts that provide for its TiO2 feedstock requirements that currently expire through 2016, most of which it may be able to renew. Kronos may not be successful in renewing these contracts or in obtaining long-term extensions to these contracts prior to expiration. Kronos current agreements (including those entered into in January 2013) require Kronos to purchase certain minimum quantities of feedstock with minimum purchase commitments aggregating approximately $1.8 billion at December 31, 2012. In addition, Kronos has other long-term supply and service contracts that provide for various raw materials and services. These agreements require Kronos to purchase certain minimum quantities or services with minimum purchase commitments aggregating approximately $122 million at December 31, 2012. Kronos commitments under these contracts could adversely affect its financial results if it significantly reduced production and was unable to modify the contractual commitments. Demand for, and prices of, certain of Kronos products are influenced by changing market conditions for its products, which may result in reduced earnings or operating losses. A significant portion of our net income is attributable to sales of TiO2 by Kronos. Approximately 90% of Kronos revenues are attributable to sales of TiO2. Pricing within the global TiO2 industry over the long term is cyclical, and changes in economic conditions, especially in Western industrialized nations, can significantly impact Kronos earnings and operating cash flows. Historically, the markets for many of Kronos products have experienced alternating periods of increasing and decreasing demand. Relative changes in the selling prices for Kronos products are one of the main factors that affect the level of its profitability. In periods of increasing demand, Kronos selling prices and profit margins generally will tend to increase, while in periods of decreasing demand Kronos selling prices and profit margins generally tend to decrease. In addition, pricing may affect customer inventory levels as customers may from time to time accelerate purchases of TiO2 in advance of anticipated price increases or defer purchases of TiO2 in advance of anticipated price decreases. Kronos ability to further increase capacity without additional investment in greenfield or brownfield capacity increases may be limited and as a result, Kronos profitability may become even more dependent upon the selling prices of its products. The demand for TiO2 during a given year is also subject to annual seasonal fluctuations. TiO2 sales are generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year. This is due in part to the increase in paint production in the spring to meet demand during the spring and summer painting season. The TiO2 industry is concentrated and highly competitive and Kronos faces price pressures in the markets in which it operates, which may result in reduced earnings or operating losses. The global market in which Kronos operates is concentrated, with the top five TiO2 producers accounting for 58% of the worlds production capacity and is highly competitive. Competition is based on a number of factors, such as price, product quality and service. Some of Kronos competitors may be able to drive down prices for its products because their costs are lower than Kronos costs. In addition, some of the competitors financial, technological and other resources may be greater than Kronos resources and such competitors may be better able to withstand changes in market -24- conditions. Kronos competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Further, consolidation of competitors or customers may result in reduced demand for Kronos products or make it more difficult for Kronos to compete with competitors. The occurrence of any of these events could result in reduced earnings or operating losses. Kronos leverage may impair our financial condition or limit our ability to operate our businesses. Kronos currently has a significant amount of debt. As of December 31, 2012, Kronos had consolidated debt of approximately $400.1 million, which relates primarily to a term loan entered into in 2012. Kronos level of debt could have important consequences to its stockholders (including us) and creditors, including:  making it more difficult for Kronos to satisfy its obligations with respect to its liabilities;  increasing its vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;  requiring that a portion of Kronos cash flows from operations be used for the payment of interest on its debt, which reduces its ability to use cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends on its common stock, acquisitions or general corporate requirements;  limiting its ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, dividends on its common stock, acquisitions or general corporate requirements;  limiting its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in Kronos business and the industry in which it operates and  placing it at a competitive disadvantage relative to other less leveraged competitors. In addition to Kronos indebtedness, at December 31, 2012, Kronos is party to various lease and other agreements (including feedstock ore purchase contracts as previously described) pursuant to which, along with its indebtedness, Kronos is committed to pay approximately $716.1 million in 2013. Kronos ability to make payments on and refinance its debt, and to fund planned capital expenditures, depends on Kronos future ability to generate cash flow. To some extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, Kronos ability to borrow funds under its or its subsidiaries credit facilities in the future will in some instances depend in part on its ability to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial covenants contained in the applicable credit agreement. Kronos business may not generate cash flows from operating activities sufficient to enable Kronos to pay its debts when they become due and to fund other liquidity needs. As a result, Kronos may need to refinance all or a portion of its debt before maturity. Kronos may not be able to refinance any of its debt in a timely manner on favorable terms, if at all in the current credit markets. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flows or to refinance Kronos debt on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition. -25- ITEM 1B.
