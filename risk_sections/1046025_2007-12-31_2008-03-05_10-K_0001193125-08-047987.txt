ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following are certain risks that management believes are specific to our business. This should not be viewed as an all inclusive list or in any particular order. Current credit market conditions may have an impact on our loan and investment portfolios In 2007, the financial services industry was significantly affected by turmoil in the financial markets created by a downturn in the consumer credit cycle, and specifically the residential housing market. The deterioration in the credit markets created market volatility and illiquidity, resulting in significant declines in the market values of a broad range of investment products and loans. The challenging operating environment has not had a significant impact on our financial condition but we continue to monitor the loan portfolio for deteriorating collateral values and the borrowers ability to pay, and other-than-temporary impairments in our investment portfolio. Future loan losses may exceed our allowance for loan losses We are subject to credit risk, which is the risk of losing principal or interest due to borrowers failure to repay loans in accordance with their terms. A downturn in the economy or the real estate market in our market areas or a rapid change in interest rates could have a negative effect on collateral values and borrowers ability to repay. This deterioration in economic conditions could result in losses to the Company in excess of loan loss 19 Table of Contents allowances. To the extent loans are not paid timely by borrowers, the loans are placed on non-accrual, thereby reducing interest income. To the extent loan charge-offs exceed our financial models, increased amounts charged to the provision for loan losses would reduce income. Rapidly changing interest rate environments could reduce our net interest margin, net interest income, fee income and net income Interest and fees on loans and securities, net of interest paid on deposits and borrowings, are a large part of our net income. Interest rates are key drivers of our net interest margin and subject to many factors beyond the control of management. As interest rates change, net interest income is affected. Rapid increases in interest rates in the future could result in interest expense increasing faster than interest income because of mismatches in financial instrument maturities. Further, substantially higher interest rates generally reduce loan demand and may result in slower loan growth. Decreases or increases in interest rates could have a negative effect on the spreads between the interest rates earned on assets and the rates of interest paid on liabilities, and therefore decrease net interest income. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Slower than anticipated growth in new branches and new product and service offerings could result in reduced net income We have placed a strategic emphasis on expanding our branch network and product offerings. Executing this strategy carries risks of slower than anticipated growth both in new branches and new products. New branches and products require a significant investment of both financial and personnel resources. Lower than expected loan and deposit growth in new investments can decrease anticipated revenues and net income generated by those investments, and opening new branches and introducing new products could result in more additional expenses than anticipated and divert resources from current core operations. The financial services industry is very competitive We face competition in attracting and retaining deposits, making loans, and providing other financial services throughout our market area. Our competitors include other community banks, larger banking institutions, and a wide range of other financial institutions such as credit unions, government-sponsored enterprises, mutual fund companies, insurance companies and other non-bank businesses. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources than us. Decreased volumes and lower gains on sales and brokering of mortgage loans sold could adversely impact net income We originate and sell mortgage loans as well as broker mortgage loans. Changes in interest rates affect demand for our loan products and the revenue realized on the sale of loans. A decrease in the volume of loans sold/brokered can decrease our revenues and net income. Inability to hire or retain certain key professionals, management and staff could adversely affect our revenues and net income We rely on key personnel to manage and operate our business, including major revenue generating functions such as our loan and deposit portfolios. The loss of key staff may adversely affect our ability to maintain and manage these portfolios effectively, which could negatively affect our revenues. In addition, loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting and hiring expenses, which could cause a decrease in our net income. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 1B.
