Risk FactorsState-related entities may have an important influence on the Bank". Hellenic Republic as Shareholder Not applicable. Hellenic Republic as Customer The Hellenic Republic, including state-related entities, is a large customer of the Bank in terms of loans and deposits. At December 31, 2007, approximately 4.7% of the Bank's outstanding gross loans were to the Hellenic Republic and state-related entities, and approximately 3.7% of the Bank's deposits were from the Hellenic Republic and state-related entities. The commercial relationship between the Bank, the Hellenic Republic and other state-owned enterprises is conducted on a normal "arm's length" basis. The Group's senior management believes that the commercially-oriented strategy currently being implemented will continue for the foreseeable future. ITEM 11 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk In recent years, we have expanded our trading activities by engaging into a wide variety of financial products in order to enhance profitability and service our clientele. This involves the undertaking of Market Risk, which we seek to identify, measure and manage effectively through a framework of principles, measurement processes and an adequate limit structure. Based on our positions, the most significant types of Market Risk that we distinguish are the following: Interest Rate Risk, Equity Risk and Foreign Exchange Risk. Interest Rate Risk Interest Rate Risk is the risk related to the potential loss that might incur on the Bank's portfolio due to adverse movements in the interest rates. In our case, the interest rate risk stems from the trading and AFS Bond portfolios and the interest rate exchange-traded and OTC derivatives. More specifically, as we are the principal market maker in Greek Government bonds (we have been ranked first among the 22 prime dealers of the Electronic Secondary Securities Market ("HDAT") for the past seven years), we retain a substantial portfolio of sovereign debt and we carry a moderate portfolio of Greek and international investment grade corporate issuers. As of December 31, 2007, 87% of our total bond portfolio comprised Greek Government bonds, of which 70% were fixed. In order to provide an economic hedge for the fixed interest rate exposure arising from our position in fixed rate Greek Government bonds, we enter into future contracts relating to short-, medium- and long-term German government bonds. To a lesser extent, we maintain positions on bond and interest rate futures for speculative purposes. 171 We are also active in the swap market, engaging in straightforward as well as more sophisticated deals for hedging and proprietary purposes. As a means of hedging, we convert the fixed rate risk into floating rate risk in order to reduce earnings volatility. Equity Risk Equity Risk is the risk related to the potential loss that might occur due to adverse movements in the prices of stocks and equity indices. The Bank holds a portfolio of stocks, the majority of which are traded on the ATHEX, and retains positions on stock and equity index derivatives traded in Greek and international exchanges. Our cash portfolio comprises trading (i.e. short-term) and Available for Sale ("AFS") (i.e. long-term) positions. Our portfolio of equity derivatives primarily serves as a mechanism to hedge the equity risk arising from our cash position and from the equity-linked products given to our clientele. In the same context and to a lesser extent, we enter into OTC equity transactions for pure trading and hedging purposes. Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign Exchange Risk is the risk related to the potential loss the Bank may suffer due to adverse movements in foreign exchange prices. The foreign exchange risk derives from the Bank's Open Currency Position ("OCP"), which mostly stems from the transactions of our Treasury Division in foreign currency (i.e. foreign exchange ("FX") spot and forward transactions). The OCP is distinguished between Trading OCP and Structural OCP. The Structural OCP contains all the Bank's investment assets and liabilities in foreign currency (i.e. loans, deposits, etc) along with the FX transactions performed by our Treasury Division. The Bank trades in all major currencies holding mainly short-term positions for trading purposes and for servicing our institutional, corporate, domestic and international clientele. According to the Bank's strategy, the end of day open currency position should comply with the relevant limits set by the Treasury Division (i.e. the overnight, intra-day and stop loss limits). Measurement Method The Bank estimates the market risk of the trading and AFS portfolios by applying a Value-at-Risk ("VaR") methodology. VaR is a measure of the maximum potential change in value of a portfolio of financial instruments with a predefined confidence interval over a given time horizon. We have adopted the variance-covariance methodology with a 99% confidence interval and 1-day holding period. The VaR is calculated on a daily basis for the Bank's trading and AFS positions, along with the VaR per risk type (interest rate, equity and FX risk). The model and the VaR calculations have been thoroughly examined and approved by the Bank of Greece and our Internal Audit Division, as well as by an external auditor. Moreover, our Internal Audit Division conducts annual assessments of the model and reports the results to the appropriate supervisory authority. The calculations are used for both internal and regulatory purposes. For internal use, the volatilities and correlations of the risk factors are computed with the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Model ("EWMA") and a decay factor l = 0.94. The model is accepted worldwide and was developed by RiskMetrics/JP Morgan. The calculations derive from 75 daily observations, where the latest observations carry the highest weight in the volatility estimate. For regulatory purposes, the calculations refer only to the Trading Book and the correlations and volatilities are based on 252 equally weighted daily observations. 172 NBG VaR per Type of Risk (99%, 1-day) Total VaR Interest Rate VaR Equity VaR FX VaR 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 (Amounts in million EUR) Average 3.3 5.1 2.7 3.9 1.9 3.4 0.6 0.3 Max 6.6 10.6 5.3 9.0 3.5 8.2 2.0 1.5 Min 1.7 1.5 1.5 1.2 0.9 0.6 0.1 0.1 Year End 5.9 2.2 4.9 1.9 2.5 0.9 1.1 0.1 Also, the VaR for internal use is calculated with the Historical Simulation approach for comparative reasons. The calculations are based on 252 daily observations for each risk factor. The VaR reports are sent to the Senior Managers of each Business Unit, the GRMD and the responsible members of the Internal Audit Division and the Board of Directors each receive copies of all VaR reports. Limitations of our VaR model We are confident in our market risk measurement method and the implemented system which has been approved by both the Bank of Greece and our auditors. However, our VaR model is based on certain theoretical assumptions, which under extreme market conditions might not capture the maximum loss the Bank will suffer. The restrictions of our methodology are summarized below: The use of volatilities and correlations as predictive measures for the behavior of risk factors in the future might be proven insufficient in periods of intense volatility in financial markets. The one day holding period for VaR calculations (or ten days for regulatory purposes) implies that the Bank will be able to liquidate all its trading assets within this length of time. Nevertheless, this assumption might underestimate market risk in periods of insufficient liquidity in financial markets or in cases where certain assets in the Bank's portfolio cannot be easily liquidated. VaR refers to the plausible loss on the Bank's portfolio for a 99% confidence interval, not taking into account any losses beyond that level. All calculations are based on the Bank's positions at the end of each business day, ignoring the intra-day exposures and any realized losses that might have incurred. VaR estimates rely on small changes in the prices of risk factors. For bigger movements, the methodology would not fully capture the convexity effect on the value of the portfolio. Returns on individual risk factors are assumed to follow a normal distribution. If this not the case, the probability of extreme market movements could be underestimated. To enhance the predictability of our VaR model and minimize the effect of the aforementioned limitations, we perform stress testing on a weekly basis. Limits Framework For the effective management of Market Risk, the GRMD has established a framework of VaR limits. These limits are based on the desired level of risk the Bank is willing to take in accordance with the decisions of its management bodies, the Bank's regulatory capital and the business activities of the Treasury Division. 173 The VaR limits refer to the Bank's trading and the AFS portfolios and are set on both total VaR level and on per type of risk level (i.e. Interest Rate VaR, Equity VaR & FX VaR limits). The Treasury Division is responsible for maintaining those limits, whereas the GRMD monitors them on a daily basis. According to our Market Risk Policy, the limits are reviewed every year, or earlier if necessary (e.g. due to the expansion of the Bank's trading activities). Also, there are formal procedures in place to anticipate plausible limit bridges. Backtesting We perform backtesting in order to verify the predictive power of our VaR model. The calculations refer only to the Bank's trading positions, in accordance with the guidelines from the Bank of Greece, and involve the comparison of the "hypothetical" daily gains and losses with the respective estimates of our VaR model used for regulatory purposes. In the case where the backtesting result exceeds VaR, the model has underestimated the potential loss and is deemed to have failed. Backtesting is conducted on a daily basis and any excess is immediately reported to the Bank of Greece. Additionally, all the results are disclosed to the Bank of Greece on a quarterly basis. Stress Testing The daily VaR estimations refer to "normal" market conditions. However, it is necessary to carry out supplementary analysis in order to capture the potential loss that might incur under extreme and unusual circumstances in the financial markets. Thus, the GRMD conducts stress testing for various risk factors (e.g. interest rates, stock index prices, exchange rates) on a weekly basis through the simulation of relevant scenarios for a given risk factor. These scenarios are in compliance with the IMF guidelines and are approved by our regulatory authorities. The relevant scenarios are presented in the table below: INTEREST RATES Scenario Description 0-3 Months 3 Months- 5 Years >5 Years 1 Parallel Curve Shift +200 bp +200 bp +200 bp 2 Parallel Curve Shift -200 bp -200 bp -200 bp 3 Steepening 0 bp +100 bp +200 bp 4 Flattening +200 bp +100 bp 0 bp STOCK MARKET INDICES Scenario Description 1 -30% for all indices FX RATES Scenario Description 1 EUR depreciation by 30% Stress testing is performed on both the trading and AFS portfolios, as well as separately on the positions of the Trading Book. 174 Emerging Markets Risk We operate in Turkey, Bulgaria, Albania, FYROM, Romania, Serbia and Egypt, all of which are considered emerging markets. In order to monitor Market Risk on a Group level, during 2007, Finansbank implemented the VaR measurement system "Risk Watch" created by "Algorithmics". The fourth quarter of 2007 was a testing period of daily operations and review of the VaR estimation by Finansbank, while from January 1, 2008, the Risk Watch system is the official method for calculating VaR on its portfolio. Note that Finansbank's VaR (99%, 1 day) for the trading and available for sale portfolio varied in 2007 from €1.1 million to €8.1 million, with an average rate estimation for the year of €2.7 million. On December 31, 2007, Finansbank's VaR was estimated to €4.5 million. Additionally, we conduct stress testing on the positions held in the Trading, AFS and Investment portfolios of Finansbank on a quarterly basis, in order to estimate the potential loss for NBG due to extreme movements in Turkey's market conditions. The rest of our subsidiaries individually do not bear significant Market Risk. However, their positions are monitored by our Group Risk Management and Treasury Divisions apart from UBB, which is in the process of implementing a VaR system. Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk is the risk arising from an obligor's failure to meet its contractual obligations. This risk includes: Pre Settlement Risk: the risk arising from a counterparty's default on off-balance sheet products, where the credit equivalent exposure reflects both the current replacement cost (marked to market) of the product plus an estimate of the Bank's potential future credit exposure from the product as a result of prevailing market prices. Settlement Risk: the risk arising from a counterparty's default on transactions in the process of being settled and where the sold asset or cash has been delivered to the counterparty but the purchased asset or cash has not yet been received in return as expected. Specific risk: the possibility of losses that can take place in interest rate related securities or equities, due to the financial condition of the issuer and regardless of the prevailing market volatility. Counterparty Risk Limits Framework We have developed a methodology for determining and allocating counterparty limits for interbank market transactions based on counterparty's creditworthiness. Eligible counterparties are those financial institutions that are assigned by Moody's and Standard & Poor's credit ratings from Aaa/AAA to Baa/BBB-. Non-rated banks are assigned credit rating by the Bank's internal model. The Risk Management Division is responsible for: controlling and managing the risks by ensuring that the Bank's policies, procedures and practices with regard to the measurement, monitoring and mitigation of risks are at all times both complied and congruent with good industry practice, and regularly enhancing the control framework. It is our policy not to allow limit breaches. Counterparty limits are subject to annual revision. 175 Sensitivity Analysis We made certain assumptions in calculating fair values for presentation in the U.S. GAAP Financial Statements. These assumptions are stated in Note 36 to the U.S. GAAP Financial Statements and include the notion that assets and liabilities that reprice or mature within a relatively short period of time have a fair value that approximates their carrying amount. However, for the purposes of the sensitivity analysis below, we included assets and liabilities that mature or reprice within a relatively short period of time and calculated the effect on the fair value of all positions. The effect that financial instruments, which reprice frequently or have short periods to maturity, had on the revised fair values was immaterial. Interest rate sensitivity analysis We performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate the impact of certain potential changes in interest rates on the fair value of financial instruments held as at December 31, 2007. The analysis below was performed based on the following assumptions: Balance sheet items (except Derivative financial instruments) All balance sheet items have been revalued assuming both a 0.5% and a 1% (i.e., 50 and 100 basis points) increase in interest rates for 2006 and 2007 and both a 0.5% and a 1% (i.e., 50 and 100 basis points) decrease in interest rates in 2006 and 2007 across the maturity ladder (i.e. "parallel shift of the yield curve"). For 2006 and 2007 in the negative shifts (i.e. -100, -50 basis points) the JPY rates were not changed because the biggest part of each corresponding curve was less than 100 basis points. For 2006 and 2007, TRY balance sheet items have been revalued assuming both a 1.0% and a 1.5% (i.e., 100 and 150 basis points) increase and both a 1.0% and 1.5% for 2006 (i.e., 100 and 150 basis points) decrease in interest rates across the maturity ladder. The interest rate basis used for short-term instruments maturing or repricing within one year varied depending upon the currency in which the instrument is denominated. For example, for instruments denominated in euro, EURIBOR was used; for instruments denominated in currencies that are not fixed to the euro, the London Interbank Offered Rate, commonly referred to as "LIBOR" was used. The bond yield curves were used as the basis for valuing instruments with maturities or repricing intervals of over one year. The yield curves were adjusted uniformly to the changes in interest rates. Future loan cashflows were discounted using the interest rates implied by the bond yield curves, increased by 1.5% (150 basis points) which represents a uniform credit spread that management believes to be representative of the average spread applicable to the relevant loan accounts. All other variables, such as foreign currency exchange rates, were held constant. Please see Item 11, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskSensitivity AnalysisForeign currency exchange sensitivity analysis". Derivative financial instruments All derivative financial instruments have been revalued for 2006 and 2007 assuming both a 0.5% and a 1.0% (i.e., 50 and 100 basis points) increase and both a 0.5% and a 1.0% (i.e., 50 and 100 basis points) decrease in interest rates across the maturity ladder, (i.e., "parallel shift of the yield curve"), except for TRY financial instruments, which were revalued assuming both a 1.0% and a 1.5% for 2006 and 2007 (i.e., 100 and 150 basis points) increase and both a 1.0% and a 1.5% for 2006 and 2007 (i.e., 100 and 150 basis points) decrease in interest rates across the maturity 176 ladder. For 2006, in the negative shifts (i.e., -100, -50 basis points), the JPY rates were not changed because the biggest part of each corresponding curve was less than 100 basis points. For 2007 in the negative shifts (i.e., -100, -50 basis points), the JPY rates were not changed because the biggest part of each corresponding curve was less than 100 basis points. The interest rate basis used for short-term instruments maturing or repricing within one year varied depending upon the currency in which the instrument is denominated. For example, for derivative instruments denominated in euro, EURIBOR was used; for derivative instruments denominated in currencies that are not fixed to the euro, LIBOR was used. The swap yield curves were used as the basis for valuing derivative instruments except from bond futures which were valued based on the bond yield curves. The yield curves were adjusted parallel to the changes in interest rates. All other variables, such as foreign currency exchange rates, were held constant.

ITEM 15 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of December 31, 2007, we performed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Deputy CEO, and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operations Officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls 183 and procedures including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer, Deputy CEO, and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operations Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that material financial and non-financial information required to be disclosed in this Annual Report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Deputy CEO, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Disclosure and Transparency Committee In June 2003, the Bank's Management established the Disclosure and Transparency Committee. The purpose of the committee is to monitor the accuracy and adequacy of the information included in public announcements, and generally, in any kind of publications made by the Bank, especially information submitted to the SEC. The following are members of the Disclosure and Transparency Committee: Anthimos Thomopoulos (Chairman) Petros Oikonomou Alexandros Tourkolias Agis Leopoulos Alexandros Georgitsis Petros Christodoulou George Paschas Michael Oratis Paul Mylonas Ioannis Kyriakopoulos (b) Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The management of the National Bank of Greece S.A. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for National Bank of Greece S.A. and its subsidiaries ("the Group"). The Group's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Group's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Group; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Group, are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Group; and 184 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Group's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Group's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (COSO). Based on that assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2007, the Group's internal control over financial reporting is effective. Management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Group's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, has been audited by Deloitte Hadjipavlou Sofianos & Cambanis S.A., an independent registered public accounting firm. Dated May 27, 2008 Efstratios-Georgios (Takis) A. Arapoglou Efstratios-Georgios (Takis) A. Arapoglou Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ioannis G. Pechlivanidis Ioannis G. Pechlivanidis Vice-Chairman and Deputy Chief Executive Officer Anthimos Thomopoulos Anthimos Thomopoulos Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operations Officer (c) Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of National Bank of Greece S.A. and subsidiaries Athens, Greece We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of National Bank of Greece S.A. and subsidiaries (the "Group") as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Group's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Group's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over 185 financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 of the Group. Our report dated May 27, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph relating to the translation of Euro amounts into U.S. dollar amounts for the convenience of the readers in the United States in accordance with Note 2 of such consolidated financial statements. Deloitte Hadjipavlou Sofianos & Cambanis S.A. Athens, Greece May 27, 2008 (d) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the year ended December 31, 2007, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

Thus, the July 2007 purchase of 307,500 shares did not surpass the maximum number of shares that the Bank is permitted to buy under the program. As at December 31, 2007, the Bank held 502,500 own shares. All purchases and disposals were made in market transactions effected on the ATHEX. No purchases were made other than in accordance with our buy-back program.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Group's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of National Bank of Greece S.A. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our audits also comprehended the translation of the Euro amounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made in conformity with the basis stated in Note 2. Such US dollar amounts are presented solely for the convenience of the readers in the United States. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Group's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated May 27, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Group's internal control over financial reporting.

F-10 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1: ORGANIZATION The National Bank of Greece S.A. (the "Bank") was incorporated in the Hellenic Republic in 1841. The National Bank of Greece S.A. and subsidiaries (the "Group") is involved in diversified financial services activities including retail and commercial banking, global investment management, investment banking, insurance, investment activities and securities trading. The Group's non-financial service activities include hotels, warehouse management and real estate investments. The Group operates primarily in Greece, but also has operations in South East Europe, Turkey and Africa. NOTE 2: REPORTING CURRENCY AND TRANSLATION INTO US DOLLARS Financial statements for the Group as of December 31, 2007, are expressed in Euro (EUR). The translation of EUR amounts into US dollar amounts is presented solely for the convenience of the reader and should not be construed as representations that the amounts stated in EUR have been or could have been or could be now or at any time in the future converted into US dollars at this or any other rate of exchange. The exchange rate used for the purpose of this disclosure is the noon buying rate in New York City for cable transfers in foreign currencies, as certified for customs by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on April 30, 2008 which was EUR 0.6423 to USD 1.00 (EUR 0.6793 to USD 1.00 on December 31, 2007). NOTE 3: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies followed by the Group in preparing these financial statements. Principles of consolidationThe consolidated financial statements of the Group include the accounts of the Bank and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Bank's subsidiaries are entities in which it holds, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights or where it exercises control, for entities in which the equity holders have substantive voting interests. Effective December 31, 2003, the Group also consolidates variable interest entities (VIEs) where the Group is the primary beneficiary in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation (FIN) No. 46 "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No 51" ("FIN 46"), as revised. The effects of inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated. Options over minority interest which are not free standing are disclosed in note 4. The excess of the cost of acquisition of the investments and the Group's equity in the investees underlying net assets represents purchased goodwill. Equity method investment goodwill is not amortized but all equity investments are reviewed for impairment annually. Basis of presentationThe accounting records of the Group have been maintained in accordance with the provisions of the Greek Company Law, the Greek Banking Chart of Accounts, the Greek Books and Records Code and the Bank of Greece regulations (collectively, "Greek GAAP"), except for foreign subsidiaries which maintain their accounting records in accordance with the legislation and regulations of the country in which they operate. Necessary adjustments have been made, for financial reporting purposes, in order to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). Foreign currency translationAssets, liabilities and operations of foreign branches and subsidiaries are recorded based on the functional currency of each entity. The functional currency is the local currency for the majority of the foreign operations. The assets, liabilities and equity are translated, for consolidation purposes, from the other local currencies to the reporting currency, EUR, at current F-11 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 3: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) exchange rates. The resulting gains or losses are reported as a component of other comprehensive income and losses within shareholder's equity. Transactions executed in other than local currencies are first translated into the local reporting currency. Any related currency exchange adjustments are included in income prior to any translation. Statement of cash flowsFor purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are defined as those amounts included in the balance sheet caption "Cash and due from banks". Securities: Trading, Available-for-Sale ("AFS"), Held-to-Maturity ("HTM"), Money market investmentsDebt securities are classified as trading, available for sale or held to maturity, based on management's intention on the date of purchase. Equity securities are classified as trading or available for sale. Debt securities which management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are reported at amortized cost. Debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of resale in the near term are classified as trading instruments and are stated at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in net trading profit or loss. All other debt and equity securities are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value with net unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income on a net of tax basis. Interest and dividends on securities, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are included in interest income. Fair value is generally based on quoted market prices. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are estimated based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow analysis or quoted prices for instruments with similar characteristics. Individual held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities with declines to their fair values below their cost that are other than temporary are written down to their fair value on an individual security basis. The related write-downs are included in earnings as realized losses. Gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities are recorded on the trade date and are calculated using the average cost method. Money market investments include treasury bills that are held for short term liquidity management purposes and whose fair value approximates their carrying amount. Equity method investmentsEquity investments in which the Group exercises significant influence but does not control, are initially recorded at cost and the carrying amount of the investments is adjusted to recognize the Group's share of the earnings or losses of investees after the date of acquisition. The amount of the adjustment, after elimination of any intercompany gains and losses and impairment of goodwill, if any, is included in the determination of the Group's net income. Dividends received by the Group from its equity method investments reduce the carrying amount of those investments. Loans and leasesLoans are included at their outstanding unpaid principal balances adjusted for charge-offs, the allowance for loan losses, and any deferred fees or costs on originated loans or unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Discounts and premiums are amortized to income using the interest rate method. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to yield of the related loans. There are no loans that have been originated which are intended for sale in the secondary market. F-12 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 3: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Loans include aggregate rentals on lease financing transactions and residual values net of related unearned income. Lease financing transactions represent direct financing leases. Unearned income is amortized under a method that results in an approximate level rate of return when related to the unrecovered lease investment. Loans acquired in a purchase business combination with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination, for which it is probable at purchase that the Group will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are accounted for under AICPA Statement of Position 03-3, "Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer" (SOP 03-3). SOP 03-3 addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor's initial investment in loans acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality. SOP 03-3 requires impaired loans to be recorded at fair value and prohibits "carrying over" or the creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting of loans acquired in a transfer that are within the scope of this SOP. Under SOP 03-3, the excess of cash flows expected at purchase over the purchase price allocated, is recorded as interest income over the life of the loan. Non-accruing loansIn general, the accrual of interest on commercial loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days delinquent unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection. Residential real estate loans are typically placed on non-accrual at the time the loan is 180 days delinquent in Greece and 90 days abroad. Credit card loans, other unsecured personal credit lines and certain consumer finance loans are typically placed on non-accrual basis no later than the date upon which they become 100 days delinquent. In all cases, loans are placed on non-accrual, or written-off at an earlier date, if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. All interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on non-accrual or written-off is reversed against interest income. The interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash-basis, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 118 Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a LoanIncome Recognition and Disclosures ("SFAS 118"), until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within a reasonable time frame and when the borrower has demonstrated payment performance of cash or equivalents for a minimum of six months. Allowance for loan lossesThe allowance for loan losses is management's estimate of probable incurred loan losses in the lending portfolios. Additions to the allowance for loan losses are made by charges to the provision for loan losses. Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses. Recoveries of amounts previously charged as uncollectible are credited to the allowance for loan losses. The Group performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its lending portfolios to identify inherent risks and to assess the overall collectability of those portfolios. The allowance on certain homogeneous loan portfolios, which generally consist of consumer and mortgage loans, is based on aggregated portfolios of homogeneous loans' evaluations, generally by loan type. Loss forecast models are utilized for portfolios of homogeneous loans which consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, anticipated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies and credit scores, and expected loss factors by loan type. The remaining loan portfolios are reviewed on an individual loan basis. F-13 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 3: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Under Greek regulations, non-performing loans cannot be written off until legal remedies for recovery, which can be a very lengthy process, have been exhausted. Historical loss amounts include both amounts actually written off and amounts that are expected to be written off, but for which not all legal remedies for recovery have been fully exhausted. Loans subject to individual reviews are analyzed and segregated by risk according to the Group's internal risk rating scale. These risk classifications, in conjunction with an analysis of historical loss experience, current economic conditions and performance trends within specific portfolio segments, and any other pertinent information (including individual valuations on non-performing loans in accordance with SFAS 114 "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan") result in the estimation allowances for loan losses. If necessary, an allowance for loan losses is established for individually impaired loans. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Group will be unable to collect all amounts due, including principal and interest, according to the contractual terms of the agreement. Once a loan has been identified as individually impaired, management measures impairment in accordance with SFAS 114. Individually impaired loans are measured based on the present value of payments expected to be received, or for loans that are solely dependent on the collateral for repayment, the estimated fair value of the collateral. If the recorded investment in impaired loans exceeds the measure of estimated fair value, a specific allowance is established as a component of the allowance for loan losses. Due to the subjectivity involved in the determination of the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses, the relationship of the unallocated component to the total allowance for loan losses may fluctuate from period to period. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on the combined total of the allocated and unallocated components. Goodwill, software and other intangiblesNet assets of companies acquired in purchase transactions are recorded at fair value at the date of the acquisition. As such, the historical cost basis of individual assets and liabilities are adjusted to reflect their fair value. Identified intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period benefited. Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for potential impairment at least on an annual basis or if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment more frequently, at the reporting unit level. The impairment test is performed in two phases. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired; however, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an additional procedure must be performed. That additional procedure compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill, as defined in SFAS 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", with the carrying amount of that goodwill. An impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Intangible assets subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment in accordance with SFAS 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" if events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment. There were no events or changes in circumstances in 2007, 2006, and 2005 that indicated the carrying amounts of our intangibles may not be recoverable. Intangible assets are amortized using an estimated range of anticipated lives, which is 3 to 12 years for software and 6 to 11 years for intangibles arising on acquisitions such as customer relationships and core deposits. Trade names have indefinite useful lives. F-14 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 3: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Premises and equipmentTangible fixed assets, including buildings are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, except for land, which is stated at cost. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line depreciation basis over the estimated useful lives of individual assets and classes of assets. Maintenance, repairs and minor alterations are expensed as incurred. Long-lived assets that are held, including those that are to be disposed of, are evaluated periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment is evaluated by determining if the difference between the expected undiscounted future cash flows of a long-lived asset is lower than its carrying value. In event of impairment, the Group recognizes a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the asset as measured using a discounted cash flow analysis. The impairment loss, if any, is reflected in non-interest expense. Special purpose financing entitiesThe Group is involved with special-purpose entities (SPEs) in the normal course of business. The primary uses of SPEs are to obtain sources of liquidity for the Group. SPEs used by the Company are accounted for as Variable Interest Entities (VIEs). VIEs are entities defined in FIN 46-R as entities which either have a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest (i.e., ability to make significant decisions through voting rights, right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity, and obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity). Investors that finance the VIE through debt or equity interests, or other counterparties that provide other forms of support, such as guarantees, or subordinated fee arrangements, are variable interest holders in the entity. The variable interest holder, if any, that will absorb a majority of the entity's expected losses, receive a majority of the entity's expected residual returns, or both, is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. Consolidation under FIN 46-R is based on expected losses and residual returns. Consolidation of a VIE is determined based primarily on variability generated in scenarios that are considered most likely to occur, rather than based on scenarios that are considered more remote. Certain variable interests may absorb significant amounts of losses or residual returns contractually, but if those scenarios are considered very unlikely to occur, they may not lead to consolidation of the VIE. All of these facts and circumstances are taken into consideration when determining whether the Company has variable interests that would deem it the primary beneficiary and, therefore, require consolidation of the related VIE. For additional information on other special purpose financing entities, see note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Income taxesThere are two components of income tax expenses: current and deferred. Current income tax expense approximates cash to be paid or refunded for taxes for the applicable period. The company treats interest and penalties on income taxes as a component of income tax expense. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the asset and liability (or balance sheet) method based on enacted income tax rates/laws expected to apply upon reversal. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax bases of the balance sheet assets and liabilities. The impact on changes in tax laws and rates are recognized in their entirely within tax expense on continuing operations in the period that includes the date of enactment in the respective jurisdiction. F-15 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 3: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Recognition of deferred tax assets is based on management's belief that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit associated with certain temporary differences, such as tax operating loss carry forward and tax credits, will be realized, based on all available evidence. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the amount of the deferred tax assets to that amount that is at least more likely than not to be realized. The Group does not recognize in its financial statements tax benefits for tax positions unless it has met the recognition and measurement principles contained in FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" (FIN 48). Benefits can only be recognized if it is "more likely than not" that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. In this evaluation, the Group assumes that the position (1) will be examined by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information and (2) will be resolved in the court. If the recognition threshold is not met, no benefit is recognized, even when the Group believes that certain amount of benefit will ultimately be realized. Tax benefits for positions meeting the recognition criteria, are recognized in the financial statements in the amount that is at least more likely than not to be sustained upon settlement with the tax authorities. Insurance operationsInsurance includes both life and general (property and casualty) insurance underwriting operations. Income and expenses from insurance operations are included in other non-interest income and expenses. Premium revenues from life insurance policies (long-duration contracts) are recognized as revenue as and when they become due from policyholders. Variable costs incurred in the acquisition of such policies are capitalized and expensed proportionately with the recognition of premium revenues. Premium income from property and casualty policies (short-duration contracts) is recognized over the life of the policy. Income and costs on policies, which relate to subsequent periods are deferred and recognized in the period to which they relate. Claims relating to property and casualty policies are recognized as and when these become known based on the information available. Insurance reserves for expected costs relating to life insurance policies are accrued over the current and expected renewal periods of the contracts. The present value of estimated future policy benefits payable, less the present value of estimated future net premia to be collected is estimated using approved actuarial methods that use assumptions about future investment yields, mortality, expenses, options and guarantees, morbidity and termination rates at the time of inception of insurance contracts. Original assumptions are adjusted to reflect actual experience and any premium deficiency estimated is charged off to income for the period. Revised assumptions reflect estimates of future monetary inflation, medical inflation, the swap rate of bonds as at the end of each reporting period and recent experience concerning risk factors mentioned above. An appropriate discount factor is used. Insurance reserves for property and casualty insurance include, apart from an unearned premium reserve, a provision for outstanding claims and a provision for claims incurred but not reported ("IBNR"). Loss estimates rely on observations of loss experience for similar historic events that relate to cumulative gross paid claim amount, settled claim amount, incurred claim amount and claim number developments. Such observations are periodically revised and any premium deficiency is charged to income for the period. Projections are based on historical development patterns. The development ratios are adjusted in a small number of cases to remove the effect of claim developments, which F-16 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 3: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) appear to be of an exceptional nature. Projections of reinsurance recoveries are also undertaken. Allowance is made for claim adjustment expenses and an appropriate discount factor is used. DerivativesAll derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and recorded as derivative assets or liabilities. For exchange-traded contracts, fair value is based on quoted market prices. For non-exchange traded contracts, fair value is based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow analysis or quoted prices for instruments with similar characteristics. The Group designates a derivative as held for trading or hedging purposes when it enters into a derivative contract. Derivatives designated as held for trading activities are included in derivative assets or liabilities with changes in fair value reflected in net trading profit or loss. The Group primarily manages interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity through the use of derivatives. The Group occasionally purchases or issues financial instruments containing embedded derivatives. The embedded derivative is separated from the host contract and carried at fair value if the economic characteristics of the derivative are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract. Other assets and other liabilitiesOther assets includes, among other items, assets acquired through foreclosure proceedings, accounts receivable of non-financial services sector subsidiaries, deferred tax assets and taxes withheld. Other liabilities includes, among other items, accrued expenses and deferred income, deferred tax liabilities, accrued interest and commissions, pension liabilities, dividends payable and other accounts payable. Discontinued operationsA discontinued operation is a component of the Group that comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale. Classification as discontinued operations occurs upon disposal or when the operations meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale. Discontinued operations are presented on the face of the income statement. Dividend policyThe Bank, on the basis of its statutory financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") as endorsed by the EU, pays dividends out of: distributable profits for the year (i.e. profits net of: a) tax, b) losses carried forward, and c) prior years tax audit differences); and retained earnings, special reserves or ordinary reserves to the extent they exceed the amount required to be maintained by law. Each year the Bank is required, by Greek Law 2190/1920, to declare and distribute a minimum dividend out of its net profits if any, equal to 35% of the net profits for the year less statutory reserves, any profits resulting from the sale of equity participations that represent at least 20% of the paid up share capital of a subsidiary company in which the Bank has held an equity participation for at least ten years and unrealized net gains from financial instruments. Any distribution of the remainder of the distributable profits must be approved by a "General Meeting of the Shareholders" with the ordinary quorum and majority voting requirements. No F-17 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 3: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) distribution can be effected if, on the closing date of the last financial year, the total shareholders' equity is, or will become after that distribution, lower than the sum of share capital and the reserves, the distribution of which is prohibited by Greek law or the Bank's Articles of Association. A majority representing at least 65% of the paid-up share capital may vote to waive this. The undistributed dividend (up to 35% minimum dividend) must then be transferred to a special reserve which must, within four years following the General Meeting, be distributed in the form of a stock dividend. Furthermore, a majority representing at least 70% of the Bank's paid-up capital may vote to waive this stock dividend. Normally, dividends are declared and paid in the year subsequent to the reporting period. Up to and including the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, dividends were accounted for once declared. Beginning in 2006, the Group records a liability related to the mandatory minimum dividend payment computed as 35% of the net profits for the year less unrealized gains. Resale and repurchase agreementsThe Group enters into securities purchases under agreements to resell ("resale agreements") and securities sales under agreements to repurchase ("repurchase agreements") of substantially identical securities. Resale agreements and repurchase agreements are generally accounted for as secured lending and secured borrowing transactions, respectively. The amounts advanced under resale agreements and the amounts borrowed under repurchase agreements are carried on the balance sheet at the amount advanced or borrowed plus accrued interest. The market value of these securities is monitored and the level of collateral is adjusted accordingly. Share-based payment transactionsThe Bank has approved Group-wide share options plans for the executive members of the Board of Directors, management and staff of the Group. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognized as a compensation cost, with the corresponding credit recognized in equity. The total amount to be expensed over the requisite period is determined by reference to the fair value of the share options granted. The fair value of the options is determined using an option-pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the grant date, the exercise price, the expected life of the options, the expected volatility of and the expected dividends on the underlying stock , and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. When the options are exercised and new shares are issued, the proceeds received net of any transaction costs are credited to paid-in capital. Accumulated other comprehensive incomeThe Group records unrealized gains and losses on AFS Securities, unrecognized actuarial gains and losses, transition obligation and prior service costs on Pension and Postretirement plans, foreign currency translation adjustments, and related hedges of net investments in foreign operations in Accumulated OCI, net of tax. Gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges are reclassified to Net Income when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on AFS Securities are reclassified to Net Income as the gains or losses are realized upon sale of the securities. Other-than-temporary impairment charges are reclassified to Net Income at the time of the charge. Translation gains or losses on foreign currency translation adjustments are reclassified to Net Income upon the substantial sale or liquidation of investments in foreign operations. F-18 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 3: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Treasury stockThe Group parent company's common stock, owned by the Group entities, is considered to be treasury stock and is recorded at cost. Gains and losses on disposal of treasury stock are recorded in equity. Earnings per shareBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts were exercised and is computed after giving consideration to the weighted average dilutive effect of these common stock equivalents. For the purpose of the earnings per share calculations, shares owned by entities within the Group are not included in the calculations of the denominators Use of estimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management are discussed in the notes as applicable. Recently issued accounting pronouncements In May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 162, "The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles". The new standard is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework, or hierarchy, for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for nongovernmental entities. Statement 162 is effective 60 days following the SEC's approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing amendments to AU Section 411, "The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles". Management does not expect that the adoption of SFAS 162 will have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income and consolidated balance sheets. In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-an amendment of SFAS 133" (SFAS 161), which amends SFAS 133 and requires enhanced disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities. The Statement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS 161 on the consolidated statements of income and consolidated balance sheets. In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 160, "Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements-an amendment of ARB No.51" (SFAS 160), which amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. This Statement also changes the way the consolidated income statement is presented. It requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the F-19 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 3: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) parent and the non-controlling interest. SFAS 160 establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent's ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation and treats all of those transactions as equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest in the subsidiary. A parent recognizes a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. A parent deconsolidates a subsidiary as of the date the parent ceases to have a controlling financial interest in the subsidiary. The Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2009 and earlier adoption is prohibited. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS 160 on the consolidated statements of income and consolidated balance sheets. In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141 (Revised 2007) (SFAS 141R), "Business Combinations" which replaces FASB Statement No. 141, "Business Combinations". This Statement retains the fundamental requirements in SFAS 141 that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer (i.e. the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses at the acquisition date) to be identified for each business combination. It requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date. The goodwill is recognized as of the acquisition date, measured as a residual, as the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. When the total acquisition-date fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred plus any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, the acquirer should recognize that excess in earnings as a gain attributable to the acquirer (bargain purchase). This Statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS 141R on the consolidated statements of income and consolidated balance sheets. In December 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110 (SAB 110). SAB 110 clarifies that the SEC staff will continue to accept, under certain circumstances, the use of the "simplified" method for estimating the expected term of "plain vanilla" share options, as discussed in SAB No. 107, beyond December 31, 2007. SAB 110 is effective from January 1, 2008. Management does not expect that the adoption of SAB 110 will have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income and consolidated balance sheets. In November 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 109 "Written loan commitments recorded at fair value through earnings" (SAB 109). SAB 109 clarifies that consistent with the guidance in SFAS 156 "Accounting for servicing of Financial Assets" and SFAS 159 "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities", the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan should be included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that accounted for at fair value through earnings. SAB 109 is effective from January 1, 2008. Management does not expect that the adoption of SAB 109 will have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income and consolidated balance sheets. In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" (SFAS 159), which allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis. Subsequent changes in fair value of these financial assets and liabilities would be recognized in earnings F-20 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 3: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) when they occur. SFAS 159 further establishes certain additional disclosure requirements. SFAS 159 is effective for the Group's financial statements for the year beginning on January 1, 2008. The Group elected to apply the fair value option for certain fixed rate loans and a debt issue. The net effect, net of tax, on January 1, 2008, opening retained earnings was a decrease of EUR 45 million. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. SFAS 157 is effective for the Group's financial statements for the year beginning on January 1, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 157 did not have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income and consolidated balance sheets. In July 2006, the FASB released FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting and reporting for income taxes where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain. FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of income tax uncertainties with respect to positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. The Group adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. The effect of adopting FIN 48 is discussed in Note 31. In March 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.156, "Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets-an amendment to FASB Statement No. 140" ("SFAS 156"), which permits but does not require, an entity to account for one or more classes of servicing rights at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in Consolidated Statement of Income. The Group adopted SFAS 156 on January 1, 2007. The adoption of this Standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income and consolidated balance sheets. NOTE 4: MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSALS AND NEW ENTITIES ESTABLISHED a)In October 2005, the Group announced the signing of the agreement for the sale of its subsidiary Atlantic Bank of New York to New York Community Bancorp, Inc. the holding company for New York Community Bank. On April 28, 2006, NBG International Holdings BV (a wholly owned subsidiary established by NBG in September 2005) sold for USD 400 million in cash, before incurred expenses, its subsidiary, Atlantic Bank of New York, whose consolidated net assets as at the date of disposal (April 2006) amounted to USD 247 million. b)In November 2005, the Bank announced the signing of the agreement for the sale of its subsidiary, National Bank of Greece (Canada), to Scotiabank. The sale concluded on February 3, 2006. The consideration received amounted to CAD 71.3m in cash (equivalent of EUR 52 million). c)In January 2006, following its Board of Directors decision on December 20, 2005, the Bank participated in the share capital increase of its subsidiary, Banca Romaneasca, acquiring 109.8 out of 122.5 million new shares for the amount of RON 219.6 million (equivalent EUR 60 million). The share capital increase was concluded in February 2006. Following this share capital increase, the Bank currently controls 194.4 million shares (98.88%). F-21 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 4: MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSALS AND NEW ENTITIES ESTABLISHED (Continued) d)In January 2006, the Bank concluded the sale of its subsidiary, ASTIR Alexandroupolis. The total consideration received was EUR 6.5 million. e)On April 3, 2006, the Bank entered into an agreement to acquire 46.00% of the ordinary shares and 100.00% of Finansbank's founder shares, a commercial and retail bank in Turkey. Pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, the Bank has agreed to acquire from Fiba Holding A.S. ("Fiba Holding"), Fina Holding A.S. ("Fina Holding"), Girisim Factoring A.S. ("Girisim Factoring") and Fiba Factoring Hizmetleri A.S. ("Fiba Factoring") (together, the "Fiba Sellers") 46.00% of the ordinary shares of Finansbank, and 100.00% of Finansbank's founder shares. The acquisition concluded on August 18, 2006, by which NBG acquired from FIBA Sellers, 46.00% of Finansbank ordinary shares and 100.00% of the Founder Shares for a consideration of USD 2,323 million (EUR 1,834 million) and USD 451 million (EUR 356 million) respectively. The sellers, FIBA Sellers retain a residual stake of 9.68% in the ordinary share capital of Finansbank, which is subject to put and call agreements, as provided for in the shareholders' agreement between the Bank and the Sellers, exercisable for a two year period commencing two years after closing of the acquisition at a multiple of between two and a half and three and a half times the book value of the Finansbank's share, subject to certain performance criteria. These put and call agreements are not legally detachable neither separately exercisable from the respective shares held by FIBA. The sellers also agreed and undertook to attend any general meetings of the Finansbank and to vote such number of shares they then own as is equal to the difference between 50.01% of the ordinary shares and the total number ordinary shares then owned by the Bank in accordance with the instructions and directions of the Bank. Based on that, it was deemed that the Bank has obtained a controlling interest on August 18, 2006 and as such this acquisition was within the scope of FAS 141 Business Combinations. As a result of Turkish Capital Markets legislation NBG made a mandatory offer to minority shareholders. From the Mandatory Offer which lasted from January 8 to January 29, 2007, the Bank acquired a further 43.44% holding of the share capital. The total consideration paid amounted to EUR 1,733 million. After the Mandatory Offer and until December 31, 2007 the bank further acquired through stock exchange transactions 0.45% of Finansbank's share capital at a cost of EUR 2 million. In April 2007, the Bank sold to International Finance Corporation ("IFC") 5% of Finansbank ordinary shares for USD 259.2 million. This stake is subject to put and call arrangements, as provided for in the shareholders' agreement between the Bank and IFC, exercisable after 5 and 7 years, respectively. These put and call agreements are not legally detachable neither separately exercisable from the respective shares held by IFC. The price per share received from the IFC was determined to be the price per share paid by the Bank to the Finansbank shareholders during the Mandatory Tender Offer. The above transaction was concluded on April 5, 2007. Cash and cash equivalents acquired on August 18, 2006 were EUR 101 million. F-22 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A.

The central bank requires all banks established in Greece to maintain deposits equal to 2% of total customer deposits as these are defined by the European Central Bank ("ECB"). These deposits bear interest at the refinancing rate as set by the ECB (4% at December 31, 2007). NOTE 7: SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL The Group enters into purchases of securities under agreements to resell substantially identical securities. These agreements are classified as lending arrangements. Agreements with third parties specify the Group's rights to request collateral, based on its monitoring of the fair value of the underlying securities on a daily basis.

NOTE 11: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MARKED TO MARKET THROUGH THE PROFIT AND LOSS "Financial instruments marked to market through the profit and loss" relates to a loan with an embedded derivative issued in August 2005 with a cost of EUR 5,125,250 thousand that will mature in September 2037. This instrument was issued by the Bank and would otherwise have to be bifurcated under FAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities". The Group elected to account for this instrument at fair value through the profit and loss under the provisions of FAS 155 "Accounting for certain Hybrid Financial Instruments- an amendment of FASB statement 133 and 140" instead of separating the embedded derivative. The net effect on earnings from this instrument for 2007 and 2006 was a gain of EUR 384,746 thousand and EUR 203,189 thousand respectively. The financial instrument is held by the Bank. F-26 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 12: DERIVATIVES The Group designates a derivative as held for trading or hedging purposes when it enters into a derivative contract. The designation may change based upon management's reassessment and changing circumstances. Derivatives utilized by the Group include interest rate, cross currency interest rate and foreign exchange swaps, financial futures, outright foreign exchange forwards and option contracts. Interest-rate swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating-rate interest payment obligations over a prescribed period of time without the exchange of the underlying principle amounts. Cross currency interest rate swaps generally involve the exchange of both interest and principal amounts in two different currencies over a prescribed period of time. Foreign exchange swaps involve the exchange through simultaneous spot and forward foreign exchange transactions of principle amounts in two different currencies. Financial future contracts are contracts in which the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to make delivery of a specific financial instrument at a predetermined price or yield. Outright foreign exchange forward contracts are agreements to exchange at a specified future date, currencies of different countries at a specified rate. An option contract is an agreement that conveys to the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a financial instrument, index, or currency at a predetermined rate or price during a period or at a time in the future. Option agreements can be transacted on organized exchanges or directly between parties. Credit risk associated with derivative activities Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured as the net replacement cost should the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to the Group completely fail to perform under the terms of those contracts assuming no recoveries of underlying collateral. In managing credit risk associated with its derivative activities, the Group deals primarily with commercial banks, broker-dealers and corporations. In addition, the Group reduces credit risk by obtaining collateral based on individual assessment of counterparties. Required collateral levels vary depending on the credit risk rating and the type of counterparty. Generally, the Group accepts collateral in the form of cash and other marketable securities. A portion of the derivative activity involves exchange-traded instruments. Exchange-traded instruments conform to standard terms and are subject to policies set by the exchange involved, including counterparty approval, margin requirements and security deposit requirements. Management believes the credit risk associated with these types of instruments is minimal. The following tables present the contract or notional amounts and the credit risk or fair value amounts at December 31, 2006 and 2007 of the Group's derivative asset and liability positions held for trading and hedging purposes. These derivative positions are primarily executed in the over-the-counter market. The credit risk amounts presented below do not consider the value of any collateral held.

The average fair value of derivative liabilities for 2006 and 2007 were EUR 365,704 thousand and EUR 769,327 thousand, respectively. AssetLiability management activities Interest rate and foreign exchange contracts are utilized in the Group's Asset Liability Management ("ALM") process. The Group maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities are expected to substantially F-28 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 12: DERIVATIVES (Continued) offset this appreciation or depreciation. The Group uses foreign currency contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign denominated assets and liabilities. Fair value and net investment economic hedges The Group uses various types of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate derivative contracts to protect against changes in the fair value of its fixed rate assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates. None of these derivatives has been designated as a hedge item, although the management of the Group believes that they provide effective economic hedges. The Group also hedges its net investment in consolidated foreign operations with functional currencies other than the Euro using forward foreign exchange contracts. These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting.

NOTE 27: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES In the normal course of business, the Group enters into a number of off-balance sheet commitments to meet the financing needs of its customers, through the use of commitments to extend credit and commercial and standby letters of credit. The Group's exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and commercial and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. The Group uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. The following table summarizes the Group's off-balance-sheet financial instruments, whose contract amounts represent credit risk, as of December 31: 2006 2007 (EUR in thousands) Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk: Commitments to extend credit: Commercial and personal. 15,282,264 18,541,224 Commercial real estate 44,991 76,541 Residential real estate 622,607 611,777 Commercial letters of credit. 742,780 857,967 Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written 5,769,479 6,550,513 Commitments to Extend Credit. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer, as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The majority of commitments to extend credit have terms up to one year and are based on EURIBOR/ LIBORor other base rates. Management evaluates each customer's credit worthiness in determining the amount of collateral to obtain. Collateral held varies and may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment and real estate. Commercial Letters of Credit. Commercial letters of credit ensure payment by a bank to a third party for a customer's foreign or domestic trade transactions, generally to finance a commercial contract for the shipment of goods. A significant portion of commercial letters of credit is on an immediate payment basis. The Group's credit risk in these transactions is limited since the contracts are collateralized by the merchandise being shipped and are generally of short duration. Standby Letters of Credit and Financial Guarantees Written. Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written are conditional commitments issued by the Group to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support the financing needs of the F-50 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 27: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) Bank's commercial customers, and are short-term in nature. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Group holds marketable securities as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary. Legal Contingencies. The Group is a defendant in certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, the ultimate disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Group.

The differences between the statutory income tax rates and the effective tax rates are summarized as follows: 2005 2006 2007 (EUR in thousands) Average statutory income tax rates(1) 30.40 % 27.17 % 23.99 % Effect of tax-exempt income (2.70 )% (3.69 )% (4.02 )% Effect of companies with losses 0.43 % (0.65 )% (0.15 )% Non deductible expenses 7.52 % 2.87 % 3.96 % Non deductible goodwill 0.61 % 1.28 %  Statutory revaluation of fixed assets (0.06 )%  0.02 % Effect of change in income tax rate (1.62 )% 0.29 %  Effect of 5% tax reduction due to merger activity (2.26 )% (2.19 )%  General allowance for loans losses recognized only for tax purposes (3.14 )% (5.39 )% (6.69 )% Other (0.09 )% (0.36 )% 1.27 % Average effective rate 29.09 % 19.33 % 18.38 % (1)The average statutory income tax rates are used in view of the fact that the consolidated subsidiaries are taxed under different tax rates depending on the nature of their entrepreneurial activity and the jurisdiction in which taxes are levied. F-52 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 31: INCOME TAXES (Continued) The significant components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities at December 31 comprised: 2006 2007 (EUR in thousands) Deferred Tax Assets: Allowance for loan losses 17,497 1,977 Mark to market valuation of securities and derivative liabilities 132,827 145,042 Retirement Benefits 17,725 16,822 Insurance Reserves 41,851 39,270 Statutory revaluation on fixed assets 305,440 269,470 Other 66,816 100,991 Total deferred tax assets 582,156 573,572 Deferred Tax Liabilities: Tax free reserves (110,476 ) (117,841 ) Other(1) (95,048 ) (225,197 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (205,524 ) (343,038 ) Net deferred tax asset 376,632 230,534 (1)Consists mainly of the mark to market valuation of trading, available-for-sale securities and derivative assets and deferred tax on acquisitions. The deferred tax on the mark-to-market valuation of securities includes both trading and available-for-sale securities, as most of these mark-to-market gains/losses are not recognized for Greek income tax purposes. Following legislation enacted in December 2004, the applicable Greek statutory rate of tax is reduced from 35% for 2004, to 32% for 2005, 29% for 2006 and 25% for 2007 and thereafter. The rate for 2006 applicable to the Bank was 24%, based on a law, which reduced the tax rate by 5% for companies, which effected legal mergers until December 31, 2005. Up to December 31, 2006 the tax-free reserves represented profits made on the sale of shares, property, bonds and other similar assets as well as income taxed at privileged rates, such as interest earned on treasury bills and bonds, which were not distributed. These reserves are fully taxed upon distribution and have, therefore, been treated as temporary differences in the deferred tax computations. On January 29, 2008, a new tax law (Law 3634/2008) was enacted, whereby any non-taxed bank reserves of 2007 onwards, deriving from realized gains from stock exchange traded shares, realized gains from stock exchange traded derivatives and unrealized losses from valuation of shares and bonds, which are reflected in the financial statements of a bank approved by the Annual General Meeting of the shareholders, are subject to tax at the current tax rate. The Group adopted the provision of FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" (FIN 48) on January 1, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting and reporting for income taxes where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain. The adoption of FIN 48 by the Group had no effect on the Unrecognized Tax Benefit F-53 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A.

As of December 31, 2007, the Group's accrual for penalties that related to income taxes was EUR 2,861 thousand. The Group companies files income tax returns in most of the jurisdictions in which it conducts business.

NOTE 35: REGULATORY MATTERS Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios determined on a risk-weighted basis, capital (as defined) to assets, certain off-balance sheet items, and the notional credit equivalent arising from the total capital requirements against market risk, of at least 8%. At least half of the required capital must consist of "Tier I" capital (as defined), and the rest of "Tier II" capital (as defined). The framework applicable to Greek banks conforms to European Union requirements, in particular the Own Funds, the Solvency Ratio and the Capital Adequacy Directives. However, under the relevant European legislation, supervisory authorities of the member-states have some discretion in determining whether to include particular instruments as capital guidelines and to assign different weights, within a prescribed range, to various categories of assets. As of December 31, 2007, the Bank was adequately capitalized under the applicable regulatory framework. To be categorized as adequately capitalized the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based and Tier I risk based ratios as set forth in the table below. There are no conditions or events since December 31, 2007 that management believes have changed the Bank's compliance with capital requirements. F-56 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A.

Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Group could have realized in a sale transaction on the dates indicated. The estimated fair value amounts have been measured as of their respective year-ends, and have not been re-evaluated or updated subsequent to those respective dates for the purpose of these consolidated financial statements. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than the amounts reported at each year-end. The following information should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Group. A fair value calculation is only provided for a limited portion of the Group's assets. Due to a wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Group's disclosures and those of other companies may not be meaningful. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Group's financial instruments at December 31, 2006 and 2007: Cash, deposits, repos, money market investments. The carrying amount of cash, deposits with central bank and other banks, repurchase and resale agreements and money market investments approximates their fair value. F-58 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 36: FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued) Trading, marked-to-market through profit or loss and available for sale securities. Fair value of trading, marked-to-market through profit or loss and available for sale assets, which also is the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet, is based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments. For debt instruments, for which such quoted market prices are not available the fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on contractual cash flows discounted at the corresponding market rates. Derivative Financial Instruments. All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. For exchange traded contracts, fair value is based on quoted market prices. For non-exchange traded contracts, fair value is based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow analysis or quoted prices for instruments with similar characteristics. Loans. Fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow models. The discount rates are based on current market interest rates for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. For variable rate commercial loans that re-price frequently (within a relatively short time frame) and have no significant change in credit risk, fair value is based on carrying amount. Fair value for impaired loans is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis or underlying collateral values, where applicable. Deposits. The fair value for demand deposits and deposits with no defined maturity is determined to be the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value for fixed-maturity deposits is estimated using discounted cash flow models based on rates currently offered for the relevant product types with similar remaining maturities. Other borrowed funds & Long-Term Debt. Fair value is estimated using market prices, or if such are not available, using a discounted cash flow analysis, based on current market rates of similar maturity debt securities. F-59 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 36: FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued) The carrying amount, the amount at which financial instruments are reported in the balance sheet, and the estimated fair value of the Group's financial instruments at December 31, is presented below. For items, which re-price frequently and/or are short in duration, carrying amount approximates fair value. 2006 2007 Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value (EUR in thousands) (EUR in thousands) Financial Assets: Cash and due from banks 1,863,974 1,863,974 4,226,768 4,226,768 Deposits with central bank 2,110,191 2,110,191 2,372,145 2,372,145 Securities purchased under agreements to resell 2,398,097 2,398,097 1,415,688 1,415,688 Interest bearing deposits with banks 2,272,043 2,270,151 1,777,422 1,777,446 Money market investments 367,653 367,653 254,034 254,034 Trading assets 7,374,207 7,374,207 6,678,634 6,678,634 Financial instruments marked to market through profit or loss 5,307,946 5,307,946 5,692,692 5,692,692 Derivative assets 325,013 325,013 334,783 334,783 Securities available-for-sale 4,155,066 4,155,066 4,550,227 4,550,227 Loans, net of allowance 42,532,086 43,555,342 54,427,540 54,943,425 Accrued interest receivable 700,660 700,660 843,675 843,675 Total financial assets 69,406,936 70,428,300 82,573,608 83,089,517 Financial Liabilities: Total deposits 55,886,085 55,820,187 66,872,882 66,822,922 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 3,037,503 3,037,503 3,509,525 3,509,397 Derivative liabilities 423,685 423,685 1,071,806 1,071,806 Other borrowed funds 295,243 302,089 473,666 471,706 Long-term debt 4,445,565 4,412,288 5,425,319 5,321,106 Total financial liabilities 64,088,081 63,995,752 77,353,198 77,196,937 NOTE 37: SEGMENT INFORMATION The Group is a diversified financial services company operating primarily in Greece with operations in various countries including the United Kingdom, SE Europe (namely Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, F.Y.R.O.M.), Luxemburg, Cyprus, South Africa, Egypt, the Netherlands (closed down in 2005) and North America operations (United States and Canada, closed down in 2006) and from 2006 in Turkey.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 38: EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS a) Defined Contribution Main Pension Plans Covered by Greek Law 3655/2007 In common with other large companies in Greece that are, or were, in the public sector, the employees of the Bank and certain of our subsidiaries participate in employee-managed pension schemes. National Bank of Greece Employee Main Pension Plan The Bank's employees' Main Pension Plan provides for defined contributions to be made by the Bank at a rate of 26.5% of the employee's salary, for employees who joined any social security plan prior to January 1, 1993. The corresponding rate for employees insured by any social security fund after that date is 13.33%. Following legislation passed in April 2008, the Bank's main pension plan will be incorporated into the main pension branch of the state-sponsored social security fund IKA-ETAM as of August 1, 2008. Pursuant to this legislation, which must be enacted by Ministerial Decree in order to come into force, the Bank will contribute EUR 25.5 million into IKA-ETAM per year for 15 years starting from December 2009. The Bank has contested these payments as unfair compared to those imposed to other banks and has reserved all legal rights. The April 2008 legislation also prescribes that employer contributions made by the Bank to the existing funds to be merged into IKA-ETAM, will be reduced every three years in equal increments, starting in 2013 from 26.5% until they reach 13.33% for employees who joined any social security plan prior to January 1, 1993. Employee contributions, for employees insured by any social security fund before 1.1.1993, will be reduced to 6.67% in the same period, from 11%. Employees insured by any social security fund after 1.1.1993 already pay contributions at 6.67%. Contributions made to this fund by the Bank totaled EUR 93.8 million, EUR 98.2 million and EUR 107.1 million in 2005, 2006 and 2007 respectively. Ethniki Hellenic General Insurance Co ("EH") Employee Plan (T.A.P.E.) The main pension branch of EH post retirement and health plan will also be incorporated into the main pension branch of the state-sponsored social security fund IKA-ETAM as of August 1, 2008. Employer contributions made by EH to the existing funds to be merged into IKA-ETAM, will be reduced every three years in equal increments until they are reduced to 13.33% from 20% for employees who joined any social security plan prior to January 1, 1993. T.A.P.E. also provides for health benefits to its members. Employer contributions to this plan totaled EUR 10.8 million both in 2005 and 2006 and EUR 11.1 million in 2007. b) Defined Contribution Plans Covered by Greek Law 2084/1992 and 2556/1997 Group employees participate in auxiliary pension plans governed by Greek Law 2084/1992 as amended by Law 2556/1997. Similar to the "main" plans above, the employees of the Bank and several of its subsidiaries participate in auxiliary pension funds rather than participating in state-sponsored auxiliary social security schemes. These plans, described below, have contribution rates and benefit schemes that are determined by Ministerial Decree. As such, these plans are substitutes for standard Greek employees' auxiliary social security benefits typically available to employees in other Greek companies. New legislation passed in 2005 and 2006 (Law 3371/2005, as amended) as mentioned previously, provides that employees that were hired by the Bank from January 1, 2005 and thereafter are insured in the state auxiliary pension plan IKA-ETEAM. Employees hired before January 1, 2005 and F-64 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 38: EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS (Continued) pensioners of the bank will also be covered by the same plan should the interested parties (employees and employers) decide to dissolve the Bank's auxiliary plan. In this case employees will be expected to make contributions to this fund, which will be a percentage of the salaries paid. The exact percentage will be assessed through a special financial study. The new law also provides for the creation of a new Insurance Fund of Bank Employees and pensioners insured in the social security system before January 1, 1993 ("ETAT"), that will pay additional benefits to the aforementioned employees and pensioners, being the difference between those provided by the existing auxiliary plan and those provided by IKA-ETEAM. In April 2006, the Bank applied under Law 3371/2005, as amended, to merge its Auxiliary Pension Fund into ETAT. An independent financial study commissioned by the Ministry of Finance pursuant to this legislation will be carried out to assess the contribution of the employer to the fund. National Bank of Greece Auxiliary Pension Plan The Bank's employees' Auxiliary Pension Plan provides for defined contributions to be made by the Bank at a rate of 9.0% of the employee's salary. Such contributions totaled EUR 33 million, EUR 35.5 million and EUR 39.3 million in 2005, 2006 and in 2007 respectively. Employees contribute at a rate of 3.5% of their salary. The benefits paid by the Fund are determined by a formula, which takes into account years of service with the Bank and the employee's final pensionable pay. c) Defined Contribution Plans Other Than Pensions National Bank of Greece Health Plan (T.Y.P.E.T.) T.Y.P.E.T. is accounted for as a defined contribution plan according to Law 3029/2002. The Bank has no legal obligation to contribute any amounts in excess of its defined contributions of 6.25% of employees' salaries. Contributions to this plan totaled EUR 22.7 million, EUR 24.9 million and EUR 27.8 million in 2005, 2006 and in 2007 respectively. T.A.P.E. mentioned above also falls into this category. d) Other Defined Contribution Plans The Group makes contributions to other defined contribution pension plans. Group contributions to these plans totaled approximately EUR 1.1 million, EUR 2.4 million and EUR 2.9 million in 2005, 2006 and 2007 respectively. e) National Bank of Greece Lump Sum Benefit Plan The Bank does not make any contributions to this plan. The Bank has granted a loan to the plan, the outstanding balance of which was EUR 63.4 million and EUR 58.8 million on December 31, 2006 and 2007 respectively, maturing in 2020, bearing interest at three-month Euribor and fully collateralized. f) Defined Benefit Pension Plans In addition to the plans discussed above, the Bank and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans. The plans vary in their specific features, but most are contributory, final pay and F-65 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 38: EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS (Continued) accumulated years of service-based defined benefit plans. The funding policies vary slightly but typically include employee and employer monthly contributions in accordance with Greek or local laws regarding such plans. Some companies within the Group also provide termination indemnities. Net periodic pension costs for these defined benefit plans include the following components for the years ended December 31: 2005 2006 2007 (EUR in thousands) Service cost 11,625 11,777 14,327 Interest cost 17,729 15,310 17,688 Expected return on plan assets (7,523 ) (8,740 ) (10,982 ) Amortization of actuarial losses 4,685 5,298 3,536 Amortization of prior year cost 53 393 81 Costs of additional benefits 2,386 38,793 36,782 Other expense 5,670 557 402 Net periodic pension cost 34,625 63,388 61,834 Included in cost of additional benefits in 2006 are costs of voluntary retirement schemes of Group companies National Management and Organization Company ("Ethnokarta") EUR 15.6 million, Ethniki Insurance EUR 15.0 million and ASTIR Palace Vouliagmenis EUR 8.0 million, as well as small costs of additional payments to employees by Group banks UBB and Stopanska. Included in cost of additional benefits in 2007 are costs of voluntary retirement schemes of Group companies: Ethniki Insurance EUR 29.5 million, the former National Management and Organization Company ("Ethnokarta") which was merged into the Bank in October 2007 EUR 5.0 million and ASTIR Palace Vouliagmenis EUR 1.4 million, as well as small costs of additional payments to employees mainly by Group banks Finansbank A.S. and Vojvodjanska. Weighted average assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension cost for the years ended December 31: 2005 2006 2007 Discount rate 5.2 % 4.3 % 4.7 % Expected return on plan assets 6.3 % 6.4 % 7.5 % Rate of compensation increase 4.1 % 4.1 % 4.6 % To set the expected long-term rate of return assumptions the Group, in consultation with its advisors, uses forward-looking assumptions in the context of historical returns and volatilities of each asset class as well as correlations among asset classes. The expected long-term rate of return assumption is annually adjusted based on revised expectations of future investment performance of the overall capital markets, as well as changes to local regulations affecting investment strategy. The weighted average expected long-term rate of return assumption used in computing the 2007 net periodic pension cost was 7.5%. F-66 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A.

F-67 NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) NOTE 38: EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS (Continued) Additional year-end information for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets: 2006 2007 (EUR in thousands) Projected benefit obligation 265,269 283,145 Accumulated benefit obligation 200,912 224,828 Fair value of plan assets 49,535 54,488 For the financial year ended December 31, 2005, the Group recognized a pension liability in other comprehensive income and an intangible asset, to the extent where the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets. On December 31, 2005, past service cost amounted to EUR 0.7 million and actuarial loss amounted to EUR 75 million. Of the aforementioned amounts EUR 0.7 million was recognized as an intangible asset and EUR 34.0 million was recognized as a pension liability on December 31, 2005. On December 31, 2006, the Group adopted SFAS 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)" which requires the recognition of a plan's over-funded or under-funded status as an asset or liability with an offsetting adjustment to Accumulated OCI. SFAS 158 requires the determination of the fair values of a plan's assets at a company's year-end and recognition of actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition assets or obligations as a component of Accumulated OCI. These amounts will be subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs. Further, actuarial gains and losses that arise in subsequent periods that are not initially recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost will be recognized as a component of Accumulated OCI. Those amounts will subsequently be recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost as they are amortized during future periods. The adoption of SFAS 158 had no effect on the Group's Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2006, or for any year presented. The amount recognized in the statement of financial position on December 31, 2006 and 2007 respectively was EUR 245.7 million and EUR 230.2 million. Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income on December 31, 2006 and 2007 respectively were a transition obligation of nil and nil, past service cost of EUR 0.5 million and EUR 0.4 million and net actuarial losses of EUR 77.1 million and EUR 28.9 million. Included in Other Comprehensive Income as at December 31, 2006 is EUR 5.4 million relating to our associated company AGET Heracles, which was sold in April 2007. The estimated amounts to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost during financial year 2008 are EUR 0.05 million of prior service cost and EUR 1.1 million of net actuarial loss.
