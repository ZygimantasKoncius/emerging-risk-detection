ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Statements in this Annual Report under the captions "Business" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", as well as oral statements that may be made by us or by our officers, directors or employees acting on our behalf, that are not historical fact constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from the historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the risk factors set forth below. We do not intend to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY WITH NO OPERATING HISTORY AND, ACCORDINGLY, YOU WILL NOT HAVE ANY BASIS ON WHICH TO EVALUATE OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES. We will not generate any revenues (other than interest income on the cash held in trust) until, at the earliest, after the consummation of a business combination. We cannot assure you as to when or if a business combination will occur. WE EXPECT TO LIQUIDATE AND DISTRIBUTE THE TRUST ACCOUNT, AND OUR PUBLIC STOCKHOLDERS MAY RECEIVE LESS THAN $6.08 PER SHARE UPON DISTRIBUTION OF THE TRUST ACCOUNT AND OUR WARRANTS MAY EXPIRE WORTHLESS. The per-share liquidation distribution may be less than $6.08 because of our general and administrative expenses and the costs of seeking a business combination. Furthermore, there will be no distribution with respect to our outstanding warrants, which may expire worthless if we liquidate. UNDER DELAWARE LAW, THE REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS CONTAINED IN OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION MAY BE AMENDED, WHICH COULD REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE PROTECTION AFFORDED TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS BY SUCH REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, set forth certain requirements and restrictions that shall apply to us until the consummation of a business combination. Specifically, our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, provides, among other things, that: * prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we shall submit such business combination to our stockholders for approval; * we may consummate our initial business combination if: (i) approved by a majority of the shares of common stock voted by the public stockholders, and (ii) public stockholders owning less than 20% of the shares purchased by the public stockholders in this offering exercise their conversion rights; * if our initial business combination is approved and consummated, public stockholders who voted against the business combination and exercised their conversion rights will receive their pro rata share of the trust account; * if a business combination is not consummated or a letter of intent, an agreement in principle or a definitive agreement is not signed within the prescribed time periods, then we will be dissolved and distribute to all of our public stockholders their pro rata share of the trust account; and * we may not consummate any other merger, capital stock exchange, stock purchase, asset acquisition or similar transaction other than a business combination that meets the conditions specified in our initial public offering, including the requirement that our initial business combination be with one or more operating businesses whose fair market value, either individually or collectively, is equal to at least 80% of our net assets at the time of such business combination. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation prohibit the amendment of the above-described provisions. However, the validity of provisions prohibiting amendment of the articles of incorporation under Delaware law has not been settled. A court could conclude that the prohibition on amendment violates the stockholders' implicit rights to amend the corporate charter. In that case, the above-described provisions would be amendable and any such amendment could reduce or eliminate the protection afforded to our stockholders. However, we view the foregoing provisions as obligations to our stockholders, and we will not take any actions to waive or amend any of these provisions. 2 OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS WILL ALLOCATE THEIR TIME TO OTHER BUSINESSES THEREBY CAUSING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN THEIR DETERMINATION AS TO HOW MUCH TIME TO DEVOTE TO OUR AFFAIRS, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO CONSUMMATE A BUSINESS COMBINATION. Our officers and directors are not required to commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and other businesses. This could have a negative effect on our ability to consummate a business combination. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination. All of our executive officers are engaged in several other business endeavors and are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours to our affairs, although we expect Mr. Wilson to devote substantial time to our business during the process of conducting due diligence on a target company with whom we have signed a term sheet for a business combination conditioned on the successful conclusion of due diligence. If our executive officers' or directors' other business affairs require them to devote more substantial amounts of time to such affairs, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs and could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate a business combination. For a complete discussion of the potential conflicts of interest that you should be aware of, see the section appearing elsewhere in this report entitled "Management - Conflicts of Interest." We cannot assure you that these conflicts will be resolved in our favor. IF THIRD PARTIES BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US, THE PROCEEDS HELD IN TRUST COULD BE REDUCED AND THE PER SHARE LIQUIDATION PRICE RECEIVED BY STOCKHOLDERS WOULD BE LESS THAN $6.08 PER SHARE. Our placing of funds in trust may not protect those funds from third party claims against us. Messrs. Wilson and Spickelmier have agreed to indemnify us against any claims by any vendor or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or products sold to us that would reduce the amount of the funds in the trust. However, we cannot assure you that Messrs. Wilson and Spickelmier will be able to satisfy those obligations. In addition, such third party claims may result in the per share conversion price received by the stockholders who vote against a business combination and elect to convert their shares into cash being less than approximately $6.08 per share. WE MAY ISSUE SHARES OF OUR CAPITAL STOCK OR DEBT SECURITIES TO COMPLETE A BUSINESS COMBINATION WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE EQUITY INTEREST OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND COULD LIKELY CAUSE A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF OUR OWNERSHIP. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 50,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.0001 per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.0001 per share. There will be 9,441,665 authorized but unissued shares of our common stock available for issuance (after appropriate reservation for the issuance of shares upon full exercise of our outstanding warrants and the purchase option granted to Ferris, Baker Watts, Inc.), and all of the 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock available for issuance. We may issue a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock, a combination of common and preferred stock, or debt securities, to complete a business combination. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock or any number of shares of our preferred stock: * may significantly dilute the equity interest of our initial public offering investors; * may subordinate the rights of holders of common stock if the preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded to our common stock; * could likely cause a change in control if a substantial number of our shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and most likely also result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and * may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. Similarly, if we issue debt securities, it could result in: * default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after a business combination were insufficient to service our debt obligations; * acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we have made all principal and interest payments when due if the debt security contains covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves and any such covenant is breached without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; * our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; and * our inability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain additional financing while such security is outstanding. 3 WE DEPEND ON OUR CURRENT MANAGEMENT TEAM, THE LOSS OF ANY MEMBER OF WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. WE DO NOT CARRY KEY MAN LIFE INSURANCE AND HAVE NOT REQUIRED NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENTS. We depend on the services of management to meet our business development objectives. We would expect to encounter difficulty replacing any of them. The loss of any person on our management team, or the inability of one or more of them to devote sufficient attention to our operations, could materially adversely affect our business and operations. We have not entered into an employment or a non-competition agreement with any member of management. As a result, any such member may discontinue providing his services to us at any time and for any reason, and even thereafter commence competition with us. We do not carry key person life insurance for any member of our management team. OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS MAY NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE OR KNOWLEDGE OF THE INDUSTRY OF THE TARGET BUSINESS. We cannot assure you that our officers and directors will have experience or sufficient knowledge relating to the industry of the target business to make an appropriate acquisition decision. SOME OF OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS ARE CURRENTLY, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BECOME, AFFILIATED WITH ENTITIES ENGAGED IN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES SIMILAR TO THOSE INTENDED TO BE CONDUCTED BY US AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY HAVE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN DETERMINING TO WHICH ENTITY A PARTICULAR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY SHOULD BE PRESENTED. Some of our officers and directors are currently, and may in the future become, affiliated with entities, including other "blank check" companies, engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us. Additionally, our officers and directors may become aware of business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as the other entities to which they have fiduciary obligations. Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. For a complete discussion of our management's business affiliations and the potential conflicts of interest that you should be aware of, see the sections appearing elsewhere in this report entitled "Management - Directors and Officers" and "Management - Conflicts of Interest." We cannot assure you that these conflicts will be resolved in our favor. NONE OF OUR OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS HAVE EVER BEEN A PRINCIPAL OF, OR HAVE EVER BEEN AFFILIATED WITH, A COMPANY FORMED WITH A BUSINESS PURPOSE SIMILAR TO OURS. Our officers and directors have never served as officers or directors of a development stage public company with the business purpose of raising funds to acquire an operating business. Accordingly, you may not be able to adequately evaluate their ability to successfully consummate a business combination. WE EXPECT THAT OUR SECURITIES WILL CEASE TO BE LISTED ON THE THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE IN THE NEAR FUTURE, AND THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FIND AN ALTERNATIVE TRADING MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES WHICH COULD LIMIT INVESTORS' ABILITY TO MAKE TRANSACTIONS IN OUR SECURITIES AND SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL TRADING RESTRICTIONS. We expect that our securities will cease to be listed on the American Stock Exchange in the near future due to our inability to meet continuing listing requirements. In such event, we will try to have our securities quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. However, we have no certainty that we will be able to accomplish this. If the American Stock Exchange delists our securities from trading on its exchange and if we fail to find an attractive trading market, we could face significant material adverse consequences including: * reduced liquidity with respect to our securities; * a determination that our common stock is a "penny stock" which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock; * limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and * a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. OUR INITIAL STOCKHOLDERS, INCLUDING OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS, CONTROL A SUBSTANTIAL INTEREST IN US AND THIS MAY INFLUENCE CERTAIN ACTIONS REQUIRING A STOCKHOLDER VOTE. Our initial stockholders (including all of our officers and directors) will collectively own approximately 22.25% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock (including the purchase of 333,334 units in the private placement).In connection with the vote required for our initial business combination, all of our initial stockholders, including all of our officers and directors, have agreed to vote the shares of common stock owned by them immediately before this offering, as well as any shares of common stock acquired in connection with or following this offering, in accordance with the majority of the shares of common stock voted by the public stockholders. 4 TARGET BUSINESS MAY BE AFFILIATED WITH ONE OR MORE OF THE INITIAL STOCKHOLDERS. We may complete a business combination with a target company with which one or more of the initial stockholders is affiliated or has been affiliated, which may give rise to a conflict of interest. For example, Mr. Wilson is a managing partner at RSTW Partners. RSTW Partners has invested in middle market companies across the United States. We may complete a business combination with a target company in which RSTW Partners has invested, which may give rise to a conflict of interest because Mr. Wilson is affiliated with RSTW Partners. IF THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT WAS NOT CONDUCTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW, THE EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS MAY HAVE THE RIGHT TO RESCIND THEIR UNIT PURCHASES. THE RESCISSION RIGHTS, IF ANY, MAY REQUIRE US TO REFUND AN AGGREGATE OF $2,000,004 TO OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS, THEREBY REDUCING THE AMOUNT IN THE TRUST ACCOUNT AVAILABLE TO US TO CONSUMMATE A BUSINESS COMBINATION, OR, IN THE EVENT WE DO NOT COMPLETE A BUSINESS COMBINATION WITHIN THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED BY THIS OFFERING, THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE TO OUR PUBLIC STOCKHOLDERS UPON OUR LIQUIDATION. Although we believe that we conducted the private placement in accordance with applicable law, there is a risk that the units, and shares and warrants underlying the units, should have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and applicable blue sky laws. Although the existing stockholders have waived their respective rights, if any, to rescind their unit purchases as a remedy to our failure to register these securities, their waiver may not be enforceable in light of the public policy underlying Federal and state securities laws. If the existing stockholders bring a claim against us and successfully assert rescission rights, we may be required to refund an aggregate of $2,000,004, plus interest, to them, thereby reducing the amount in the trust account available to us to consummate a business combination, or, in the event we do not complete a business combination within the period prescribed, the amount available to our public stockholders upon our liquidation. OUR OUTSTANDING WARRANTS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO EFFECT A BUSINESS COMBINATION USING OUR COMMON STOCK AS CONSIDERATION. To the extent we issue shares of common stock to effect a business combination, the potential for the issuance of substantial numbers of additional shares upon exercise of these warrants and the option could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle in the eyes of a target business as such securities, when exercised, will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of our common stock and reduce the value of any shares issued to complete the business combination. Accordingly, our warrants and the option may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of the target business. Additionally, the sale, or even the possibility of sale, of the shares underlying the warrants and the option could have an adverse effect on the market price for our securities or on our ability to obtain future public financing. If and to the extent these warrants and the option are exercised, you may experience dilution to your holdings. IF OUR INITIAL STOCKHOLDERS EXERCISE THEIR REGISTRATION RIGHTS, IT MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND THE EXISTENCE OF THESE RIGHTS MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO EFFECT A BUSINESS COMBINATION. Our initial stockholders are entitled to demand that we register the resale of the 2,958,333 shares of common stock they acquired prior to our initial public offering. Furthermore, they are entitled to demand the registration of the securities underlying the 333,334 units they purchased in the private placement at any time after we announce that we have entered a letter of intent, an agreement in principle or a definitive agreement in connection with a business combination. If our initial stockholders exercise their registration rights with respect to all of their shares of common stock, then there will be an additional 3,291,667 shares of common stock eligible for trading in the public market. The presence of this additional number of shares of common stock eligible for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, the existence of these rights may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of the target business, as the stockholders of the target business may be discouraged from entering into a business combination with us or will request a higher price for their securities as a result of these registration rights and the potential future effect their exercise may have on the trading market for our common stock. IF WE ARE DEEMED TO BE AN INVESTMENT COMPANY, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INSTITUTE BURDENSOME COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS AND OUR ACTIVITIES MAY BE RESTRICTED, WHICH MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO COMPLETE A BUSINESS COMBINATION. 5 If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, our activities may be restricted, including: * restrictions on the nature of our investments; and * restrictions on the issuance of securities, which may make it difficult for us to complete a business combination. In addition, we may have imposed upon us burdensome requirements, including: * registration as an investment company; * adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; * reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy, compliance and disclosure requirements; and * complying with other rules and regulations. We do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act of 1940. To this end, the proceeds held in trust may only be invested by the trust agent in "government securities" (within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940) with specific maturity dates. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend to meet the requirements for the exemption provided in Rule 3a-1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. If we were deemed to be subject to the Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expense that we have not allotted for. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our 2006 fiscal year and that remain unresolved.
