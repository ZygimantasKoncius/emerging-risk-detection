ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Please read Item 7. “Cautionary statement for purposes of the “Safe Harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995” that appears on page 14 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have a history of losses and negative cash flow from operations. We cannot assure you that we will achieve or sustain profitability in the future. We have incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations in recent years. We incurred net losses of approximately $0.8 million and $0.2 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and had net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $0.2 million and $2.3 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Further, we may incur net losses in future reporting periods as we incur expenses associated with the continuation of our business as well as its subsequent development, which development cannot be guaranteed. There is no assurance our future operations will be profitable. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably, we may be forced to cease or suspend operations, or we may be required to raise additional capital to maintain or grow our operations. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise such additional capital. In June 2012 we announced our plans to exit the global retail business and focus solely on growing our OEM business. In connection with exiting the global retail business we also commenced a restructuring of our business and implemented a variable, lower cost sourcing and quality assurance solution through a third party Asia-based sourcing agent. These restructuring plans have been substantially completed. While we believe these measures, along with other steps to be taken, will be sufficient to return the Company to sustainable profitability, there can be no assurance that this will be the case, or that additional steps will not be required. If additional steps are required, there can be no assurance that they will be properly implemented or will be successful, or that we will realize the cost savings and other anticipated benefits from any such additional restructuring steps. Our OEM growth strategy will continue to require additional capital investment. We have recently invested and expect to continue to invest incremental cash resources to execute our OEM growth strategy. While we believe that our existing cash resources are sufficient to support our growth strategy, there can be no assurances that our growth strategy will be successful or that we will earn a return on these investments. Our business remains highly concentrated in our Diabetic Products line, posing risks to our financial condition and results of operations compared to periods when revenue from customers from our two principal product lines were more balanced. If our Diabetic Products line were to suffer the loss of a principal customer or a material decline in or loss of sales, our business would be materially and adversely affected. Sales of Diabetic Products to OEM customers accounted for approximately 79% of net revenues from continuing operations in Fiscal 2014. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations are subject to higher risk from the loss of a major diabetic customer or changes in their business practices, for example, a decision to reduce or eliminate inclusion of cases in box with the electronic device or a decision to focus on insulin pumps instead of insulin by injection. Our business is and has been characterized by a high degree of customer concentration. Our four largest customers accounted for approximately 76% and 75% of net sales from continuing operations in Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013, respectively; the loss of, or material reduction in orders from, any of these customers would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. At present the predominant percentage of our sales revenues is concentrated in four large diabetic customers, including their affiliates and/or their contract manufacturers. The loss of any of these customers, whether as a result of its purchase of its carry solution requirements from another vendor, its decision to manufacture its own carrying cases, its decision to award its orders to one of our competitors, or otherwise, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. 7 If any one or more of our OEM customers elect to reduce or discontinue inclusion of cases in box, our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. The predominant percentage of our revenues is derived from sales of case accessories to our OEM customers who package our cases “in box” with their electronics. During recent years, there have been numerous federal legislative and administrative actions that have affected government programs, including adjustments that have reduced or increased payments to healthcare providers and patients. For example, the federal healthcare reform legislation that was enacted in March 2010 (known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (“ACA”)) may reduce reimbursement for some healthcare providers and patients while increasing reimbursement for others. In addition, ACA mandates the implementation of various programs and value and quality-based reimbursement incentives that may impact the amount of reimbursement for healthcare providers and patients. In addition and more significantly, third-party payers, including governmental health administration authorities, managed care providers and private health insurers, have increasingly challenged the price and examined the cost effectiveness of medical products and services, which has affected the reimbursement of such products to patients. Due to this uncertainty in medical reimbursements, OEMs have experienced reductions in demand and, as a result, have sought continuously to reduce expenses. If one or more of our OEM customers generally begin to reduce or discontinue the practice of including carry case accessories “in box”, we would incur a significant decline in revenues and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. At any time, a significant percentage of our accounts receivable risk may be concentrated in a small number of customers. Four customers accounted for approximately 77% of our accounts receivable at September 30, 2014, and four customers accounted for approximately 73% of our accounts receivable at September 30, 2013, respectively. The failure to receive or collect such amounts when and as due could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. We continue to encounter pressures from our largest OEM customers to maintain or even roll back prices or to supply lower priced carry solutions, and expect such pressure to persist. The effects of such price constraints on our business may be exacerbated by inflationary pressures that affect our costs of supply. During Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013, we experienced significant pricing pressure from our largest OEM customers to maintain or even reduce the prices we charge them. When we are unable to extract comparable concessions from our suppliers on prices they charge us, product sales margins erode. In addition to margin compression from customers in general, we are encountering increased pricing from our Chinese suppliers who are reacting to inflationary increases in materials and labor costs incurred by them. In addition, prices that our Chinese vendors charge to us may reflect appreciation of the Chinese currency against the U.S. dollar, which can be passed through to us in the form of higher U.S. dollar prices. This in turn will tend to reduce gross profit if we are unable to raise prices. See “Item 7. – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Business Overview – Trends and Economic Environment.” We depend on a single exclusive buying agent who, in turn, depends on a limited number of key suppliers. Forward China, our exclusive sourcing agent in the Asia Pacific region, has not made progress in efforts to expand the supplier base during Fiscal 2014. However, there was no contraction of supplier base during Fiscal 2014. Forward China has relied on a limited number of suppliers to supply the component parts and pieces necessary for the production of our carry and protective solutions products. As a result, our ability to effectively push back against rising material costs may diminish. In addition, any inability to obtain supplies from a single or limited number of suppliers may result in difficulty obtaining the supplies necessary for our business and may restrict our ability to produce our carry and protective solutions products. Where practical, we intend to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business. Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain certain components or the failure of one of our suppliers could impair our ability to ship products and generate revenues, which could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships. See also “Note 15, Operating Segment Information—Supplier Concentration” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. In addition, we depend significantly on Forward China as our exclusive buying agent for substantially all of our component parts in the APAC region. As a result, we have limited visibility as to our supplier base, making it difficult to forecast future events and to plan our operations. In addition, if Forward China fails to satisfactorily perform its obligations, including payment obligations, to our suppliers or its duties to us as our exclusive buying agent as a result of financial or other difficulties or for any other reason, we could suffer irreparable harm resulting in reduced profits or, in some cases, significant losses for us. 8 If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and the trading price of our stock. Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. If we cannot maintain effective controls and reliable financial reports, our business and operating results could be harmed. We continue to work on improvements to our internal controls over financial reporting and there can be no assurance that material weaknesses will not occur in the future. Any failure to implement and maintain internal controls over our financial reporting or difficulties encountered in the implementation of improvements in our controls, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Any failure to improve our internal controls over financial reporting or to address identified weaknesses in the future, if they were to occur, could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative impact on the trading price of our stock. Our results of operations are subject to the risks of fluctuations in the values of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Our results of operations are expressed in U.S. dollars. When the U.S. dollar appreciates or depreciates in value against a currency in which all or a significant portion of revenues or other accounts receivable are denominated, such as the Euro, our results of operations can be adversely affected or benefited, respectively. The degree of impact is proportional to the amount of foreign currency expense or revenue, as the case may be, and the fluctuations in exchange rates over the period in which the effect is measured on our financial statements. In addition, such currency fluctuations may affect the comparability of our results of operations between financial periods. Future revenues are difficult to predict and are likely to show significant variability as a consequence of customer concentration. Because our revenues are highly concentrated in a few large customers, and because the volumes of these customers’ order flows to us can fluctuate markedly in a short period of time, our quarterly revenues, and consequently our results of operations, may be highly variable and subject to significant changes over a relatively short period of time. Our largest OEM customers may keep consumer products with which our carry solutions are packaged “in-box” in active promotion for many months, or for a very short period of time, depending on various factors, including sales trends for the product, product development cycles, new product introductions, and our customers' competitors' product offerings. As demand for the consumer product relating to the in-box program matures and decreases, we may be forced to accept significant price and/or volume reductions in customer orders for our carry solutions, which will adversely affect revenue. These factors tend to lead to a high degree of variability in our quarterly revenue levels. Significant, rapid shifts in our operating results may occur if and when one or more of these customers increase or decrease the size(s) of, or eliminate, their orders from us by amounts that are material to our business. Our gross margins, and therefore our profitability, vary considerably by customer and by product, and if the revenue contribution from one or more OEM customers or products changes materially, relative to total revenues, our gross profit percentage may fluctuate. Our gross profit margins on the products we sell can vary widely depending on the product type, customer, and order size. Because of the broad variability in price ranges and product types, we anticipate that gross margins, and accordingly their impact on operating income or loss, may fluctuate depending on the relative revenue contribution from each customer or product. Product manufacture is often outsourced by our OEM customers to contract manufacturing firms in China and in these cases it is the contract manufacturer to which we must look for payment. Such firms are performing manufacturing, assembly, and product packaging functions, including the bundling of our product accessories with the OEM customer's product. As a consequence of this business practice, we often sell our carry solution products to the contract manufacturing firm. This is particularly significant in the case of diabetic product sales to certain customers. In these cases, we invoice the contract manufacturing firm and not the OEM customer. Therefore, it is the contract manufacturing firm to which we must look for payment in such cases and not that of our OEM customer. This may alter the credit profile of our customer base and may involve significant purchase order volumes. Our dependence on foreign manufacturers creates quality control and other risks to our business. From time to time we may experience certain quality control, on-time delivery, cost, or other issues that may jeopardize customer relationships. Our reliance on foreign suppliers, manufacturers and other contractors involves significant risks, including risk of product quality issues and reduced control over quality assurance, manufacturing yields and costs, pricing, timely delivery schedules, the potential lack of adequate manufacturing capacity and availability of product, the lack of capital and potential misappropriation of our designs. 9 Our shipments of products via container may become subject to delays or cancellation due to work stoppages or slowdowns, piracy, damage to port facilities caused by weather or terrorism, and congestion due to inadequacy of port terminal equipment and other causes. To the extent that there are disruptions or delays in loading container cargo in ports of origin or off-loading cargo at ports of destination as a result of labor disputes, work-rules related slowdowns, tariff or World Trade Organization-related disputes, piracy, physical damage to port terminal facilities or equipment caused by severe weather or terrorist incidents, congestion in port terminal facilities, inadequate equipment to load, dock and offload container vessels or energy-related tie-ups or otherwise, or for other reasons, product shipments to our customers will be delayed. In any such case, our customer may cancel or change the terms of its purchase order, resulting in a cancellation or delay of payments to us. A closure or partial closure of port facilities or other causes of delays in the loading, importation, offloading or movement of our products to the shipping destination agreed with our customer could result in increased expenses, as we try to avoid such delays, delayed shipments or cancelled orders, or all of the above. Depending on the severity of such consequences, this may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The OEM carrying solutions business is highly competitive and does not pose significant barriers to entry. There are many competitors in the sale of carry solutions products to OEMs, and competition is intense. Since little or no significant proprietary technology is involved in the design, production or distribution of the types of products we sell, others may enter the business with relative ease and compete against us. Such competition may result in the diminution of our market share or the loss of one or more major OEM customers, thereby adversely affecting our net sales, results of operations, and financial condition. Many of our competitors are larger, better capitalized and more diversified than we are and may be better able to withstand a downturn in the general economy or in the product areas in which we specialize. These competitors may also have less sales concentration than we do and be better able to withstand the loss of a key customer or diminution in its orders. Our business could suffer if the services of key sales personnel we rely on were lost to us. We are highly dependent on the efforts and services of certain key sales representatives who have account responsibility for, and have longstanding relationships with one or more of our largest customers. Our business could be materially and adversely affected if we lost the services of any such individual. If we lost the services of a key sales representative, we might experience a material reduction in orders from his customers, resulting in a loss of revenues, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We do not pay dividends on our common stock. We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock since 1987. The payment in the future of cash dividends by us, if any, will depend upon our results of operations, short-term and long-term cash availability, net working capital, working capital needs and other factors, as determined by our Board of Directors. We do not anticipate that cash dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future. The absence of dividend payments on a common stock might make such stock susceptible to greater market price swings. We have in place anti-takeover measures and charter provisions that may prevent a hostile or unwanted effort to acquire Forward. Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 4,000,000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock, of which 648,846 shares have been issued as 6% convertible preferred stock. Our Board of Directors has the authority, without shareholder approval, to issue such preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the relative rights and preferences thereof including their redemption, dividend and conversion rights. Our ability to issue the authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock could be used to impede takeovers of the Company. Under certain circumstances, the issuance of the preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of Forward, discourage bids for the common stock at a premium, or otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, our certificate of incorporation requires the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the shares outstanding to approve a business combination such as a merger or sale of all or substantially all assets. Such provision and blank check preferred stock may discourage attempts to acquire Forward. Applicable laws that impose restrictions on, or regulate the manner of, a takeover attempt may also have the effect of deterring any such transaction. 10 In addition, on April 26, 2013, our Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan, as set forth in the Rights Agreement dated as of April 26, 2013 (the “Rights Agreement”), between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as Rights Agent, in order to encourage anyone seeking to acquire us to negotiate with our Board of Directors prior to attempting a takeover. While the plan is designed to guard against coercive or unfair tactics to gain control of us, the plan may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying any attempts by others to obtain control of us. See Note 7 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We are not aware of any attempt to acquire Forward. We maintain cash balances in our bank accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limitation. We maintain our cash assets at commercial banks in the U.S. in amounts in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit of $250,000 and in Europe in amounts that may exceed any applicable deposit insurance limits. In the event of a failure at a commercial bank where we maintain our deposits or uninsured losses on money market or other cash equivalents in which we maintain cash balances, we may incur a loss to the extent such loss exceeds the insurance limitation, which could have a material adverse effect upon our financial conditions and our results of operations. Our business could be negatively affected as a result of a potential proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting, and such proxy contest could distract our management, divert our resources and impact the trading value of the Company’s securities. On December 8, 2014, Terence Bernard Wise, a director of the Company, filed a definitive proxy statement nominating five director candidates for election to the Board of Directors at our 2014 annual meeting of shareholders (the “2014 Annual Meeting”). The Company believes Terence Bernard Wise, together with other participants (collectively, the “Wise Group”), failed to properly nominate its alternative slate of director candidates in compliance with the nomination procedures established in the Company’s Amended and Restated By-Laws. As a result, the Company believes that any purported nomination by the Wise Group at the 2014 Annual Meeting is invalid. The Company sought declaratory and injunctive relief from a New York State court to prevent the Wise Group’s invalid and improper solicitation. At a hearing on December 1, 2014, the court denied the Company’s request for preliminary injunctive relief. The Company has filed a Notice of Appeal with respect to the court’s ruling. Since the court determined the Wise Group nomination is valid, it is possible that the Wise-nominated directors could constitute a majority of the Board of Directors following the 2014 Annual Meeting. A proxy contest would require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and the Board of Directors. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan. The perceived uncertainties as to our future direction also could affect the market price and volatility of our securities, result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We face risks related to litigation advanced by a current director and shareholder of ours and our former Chief Financial Officer. On July 15, 2014, Terence Bernard Wise, a director of the Company, filed a derivative complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against directors Frank LaGrange Johnson, Robert Garrett, and John F. Chiste and then-directors (now former directors) Timothy Gordon and Owen P.J. King, also naming the Company as a nominal defendant, alleging breaches of fiduciary duty and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief (both preliminary and final), including a temporary restraining order (TRO), that would have prevented the Board of the Company from voting on proposals to raise capital or engage in any extraordinary transactions. The court rejected Mr. Wises request for a TRO and Mr. Wise then withdrew his request for preliminary injunctive relief. Mr. Wise then amended his complaint to add allegations of breach of fiduciary duties under various provisions of New Yorks Business Corporation Law. On December 4, 2014, Mr. Wise brought a new application to the court, once again seeking a TRO and a preliminary injunction that would enjoin his fellow Company directors from causing the Company to issue any Series B Senior Convertible Preferred Stock (the Preferred Stock), or take any antecedent or preparatory steps to effectuate such issuance, prior to the Companys 2014 annual meeting of shareholders (the 2014 Annual Meeting). The court granted the TRO, in part, by prohibiting the Company from issuingbut not from taking antecedent or preparatory steps to issuesuch Preferred Stock prior to December 8, 2014. At a hearing on December 8, 2014, the court then granted Mr. Wises motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining the Companys issuance of the Preferred Stock prior to the Companys 2014 Annual Meeting. On December 8, 2014, the Company filed a notice of appeal of the courts order to the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, First Department. On December 9, 2014, the Company moved, before such appellate court, to vacate the lower courts injunction, which motion has not yet been decided. The case otherwise remains pending before the lower court. 11 On August 26, 2014, James McKenna, the Company’s former Chief Financial Officer, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and directors Frank LaGrange Johnson, Robert Garrett and John F. Chiste and then-directors (now former directors) Timothy Gordon and Owen P.J. King, alleging purported claims of retaliation for whistleblowing under the Dodd-Frank Act, breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing all as against the Company, and a single claim for tortious interference with contract as against the individual defendants. The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of monetary consequential damages and punitive damages. The case currently is pending before the court. Although we believe the claims to be without merit, our operating results and share price may be negatively impacted due to the negative publicity, expenses incurred in connection with our defense, management distraction, and/or other factors related to this litigation. In addition, litigation of this nature may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain customers and strategic partners, as well as qualified board members and management personnel. One of our current directors is a significant shareholder, which makes it possible for him to have significant influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval and which influence may be alleged to conflict with our interests and the interests of our other shareholders. One of our directors, Terence Bernard Wise, is a significant shareholder who beneficially owns approximately 19.1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of December 1, 2014. Mr. Wise will have substantial influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of our directors and other corporate actions. This influence may be alleged to conflict with our interests and the interests of our other shareholders. Mr. Wise has also launched a proxy contest to elect a different slate of directors than what our Company proposed to shareholders. In addition, such influence by Mr. Wise could have the effect of discouraging potential business partners or create actual or perceived governance instabilities that could adversely affect the price of our common stock. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable.
