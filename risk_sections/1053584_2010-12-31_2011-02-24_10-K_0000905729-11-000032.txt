Risk factors include, but are not limited to, the risk factors described in "Item 1A - Risk Factors" of this report. These and other factors are representative of the risk factors that may emerge and could cause a difference between an ultimate actual outcome and a preceding forward-looking statement. Table of Contents PART I ITEM 1: Business. As used in this report, the terms "we," "us," "our" and "Company" mean Macatawa Bank Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates another meaning. The term "Bank" means Macatawa Bank. Overview Macatawa Bank Corporation is a Michigan corporation and a registered bank holding company. Our business is concentrated in a single industry segment - commercial banking. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Macatawa Bank, we offer a full range of commercial and personal banking services, including checking, savings and certificates of deposit accounts, cash management, safe deposit boxes, trust services and commercial, mortgage and consumer loans through our twenty-six branch offices and a lending and operation service facility in Ottawa County, Kent County and northern Allegan County, Michigan. Other services we offer include ATMs, internet banking, telephone banking and debit cards. The Bank provides various brokerage services, including discount brokerage through Infinex, personal financial planning and consultation regarding mutual funds. The Bank was formed in 1997 and until 2009 our strategy has been to profitably grow our business based upon our mission to attract clients who prefer to conduct business with a locally managed institution that demonstrates an active interest in their business and personal financial affairs, places high priority on local decision-making and contributes financial and employee support to community initiatives. Within the past year, our strategy has been modified as discussed below. At December 31, 2010, we had total assets of $1.58 billion, total deposits of $1.28 billion, approximately 73,000 deposit accounts and shareholders' equity of $67.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we reported operating losses totaling $17.9 million. The last three quarters of 2010 were profitable. Additional information about our consolidated financial condition as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the results of our operations for the two years ended December 31, 2010, may be found throughout this report, including in Item 7 of this report in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and Item 8 of this report in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes, and such information is here incorporated by reference. During 2008 and 2009, we reported operating losses of $38.9 million and $63.6 million, respectively. The losses for 2008 and 2009 were largely attributable to loan losses, lost interest on nonperforming assets and rising costs of administering problem assets associated with the rapid increase in problem loans and other real estate assets. Losses in 2009 included the establishment of a tax valuation allowance and 2008 losses included the write-off of goodwill. The loan and problem asset related losses continued in the first quarter of 2010, as we reported a net loss of $21.1 million. In February 2010, the Bank entered into a Consent Order with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") and the Michigan Office of Financial and Insurance Regulation ("OFIR"), in which the Bank agreed to increase management and board oversight, improve process and controls, limit lending to certain borrowers, obtain regulatory approval of future dividends, and improve regulatory capital ratios. Please see "Consent Order with the Bank and its Regulators" below for more information regarding the Consent Order. In July 2010, Macatawa Bank Corporation entered into a Written Agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago ("FRB"). Among other things, the Written Agreement provides that Macatawa Bank Corporation must take appropriate steps to utilize its financial and managerial resources to serve as a source of strength to the Bank and Macatawa Bank Corporation may not declare or pay any dividends without the prior written consent of the FRB. Please see "Written Agreement with Macatawa Bank Corporation and its Regulator" below for more information regarding the Written Agreement. Our Board of Directors has significantly changed our strategic direction and focus to improve our internal operations and to work out of our problem loans and assets. During the fourth quarter of 2009, our Board of Directors elected a new independent Chairman of the Board. We have since worked closely with the FRB, the FDIC and OFIR to put in place improved controls and procedures. The Board of Directors has implemented more robust corporate governance practices and disciplined business and banking principles, implemented more conservative lending principles that comply with regulatory standards, and appointed experienced and disciplined lending and compliance personnel. The focus of our management team has turned from growth in our business to executing these disciplined business and banking procedures and policies, limiting future losses, preserving capital and improving operational efficiencies. - 1 - Table of Contents As a result of these efforts, we have achieved significantly improved results:  Our three most recently completed quarters were profitable;  Our liquidity has improved dramatically since the end of 2009 primarily through large reductions in volatile funding balances;  The Bank's capital ratios have improved since March 31, 2010; and  We have reduced our level of delinquent and nonperforming loans and have achieved lower levels of loan charge offs for 2010 compared to the preceding two years, allowing for reductions in the provision for loan losses in 2010. During the course of the audit procedures for 2009, our independent registered accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2009, Crowe Horwath LLP, identified certain deficiencies in our credit administration and allowance for loan loss process that we and they determined constituted a "material weakness" in internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2009. Also at December 31, 2009, Crowe Horwath LLP determined that there was substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As discussed above and throughout this document, significant improvements in our processes and our financial results and financial condition occurred during the year ended December 31, 2010. We do not have substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and our independent public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2010, BDO USA LLP, has issued an unqualified report on its audit of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 in Item 8 of this report, and did not include a paragraph in its report expressing substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. We have determined that the improved controls instituted in response to the material weakness identified at December 31, 2009 have remediated the deficiencies and have concluded that there are no material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2010. BDO USA LLP has also issued an unqualified report on its audit of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 in Item 9A of this report, which states that Macatawa Bank Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. We have no material foreign loans, assets or activities. No material part of our business is dependent on a single customer or very few customers. Our headquarters and administrative offices are located at 10753 Macatawa Drive, Holland, Michigan 49424, and our telephone number is (616) 820-1444. Our internet website address is www.macatawabank.com. We make available free of charge through this website our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information on our website address is not incorporated by reference into this report, and the information on the website is not part of this report. Regulatory Developments Consent Order with the Bank and its Regulators On February 22, 2010, the Bank entered into a Consent Order (the "Consent Order") with the FDIC and OFIR, the primary banking regulators of the Bank. The Bank agreed to the terms of the Consent Order without admitting or denying any charges of unsafe or unsound banking practices. The Consent Order imposes no fines or penalties on the Bank. The Consent Order will remain in effect and enforceable until it is modified, terminated, suspended, or set aside by the FDIC and the OFIR. The Bank's customer deposits remain fully insured to the highest limit set by the FDIC. The Board of Directors views the requirements of the Consent Order as necessary components of its efforts to return us to profitability and pursue the long term success of the Company for our shareholders, depositors, and customers. The Consent Order includes the following requirements, among others:  The Consent Order requires the Bank, within 90 days, to have and maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio of at least 8% and a Total Risk Based Capital Ratio of at least 11%. The Bank has not yet met these capital requirements. See further discussion below and in Item 8 of this report in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. - 2 - Table of Contents  The Consent Order requires the Bank to charge off all assets or portions of assets classified "Loss" in the most recent FDIC Report of Examination ("ROE") that have not been previously collected or charged off. This was accomplished subsequent to the examination in October, 2009.  The Consent Order prohibits the Bank from extending additional credit to, or for the benefit of, any borrower who is already obligated to the Bank on any loan that has been charged off by the Bank, so long as the amount charged off remains uncollected. In addition, the Consent Order prohibits the Bank from extending any additional credit to a borrower who has an uncollected loan that has been classified "Substandard" or "Doubtful", unless the Bank's Board of Directors has determined that extending additional credit to the borrower is in the best interest of the Bank. The Bank has adhered with this requirement.  The Consent Order requires the Board of Directors of the Bank upon the issuance of the order and before each quarterly Report of Condition and Income to review the adequacy of the Bank's Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses ("ALLL") and make adjustments needed to provide for an adequate ALLL. The Board has adhered with this requirement.  While the Consent Order is in effect, the Bank may not declare or pay any cash dividend without the prior written consent of the FDIC and the OFIR. The Bank did not pay dividends to Macatawa Bank Corporation during 2009 or 2010. In previous periods, dividends from the Bank to Macatawa Bank Corporation were primarily utilized by it to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock and interest on its trust preferred securities. Macatawa Bank Corporation has suspended payment of dividends on common and preferred stock and has deferred interest payments on its trust preferred securities. The Consent Order also requires the Bank and its Board of Directors to adopt and implement a variety of policies, plans, procedures and practices intended to aid in the safe and sound conduct of the Bank's business. Throughout 2010, the Bank has addressed or taken steps to address the requirements of the Consent Order. We are implementing a capital plan with various alternatives to reach and maintain the capital levels required by the Consent Order. While the Bank was not able to meet the timeline prescribed by the Consent Order for reaching the required capital levels, tangible progress has been made. Through a combination of improving earnings, effective balance sheet management and disciplined administration non performing assets, we have improved the Bank's total risk-based capital ratio since its low-point at March 31, 2010. The amount of additional qualifying capital needed to comply with the Consent Order has been reduced from $43.2 million at March 31, 2010 to $17.2 million at December 31, 2010. Our goal remains to return the Bank to "well-capitalized" status, and we continue to work closely with the Bank's regulators in our efforts to comply with the terms of the Consent Order. Achievement of the required capital levels could be impacted, positively or negatively, as a result of certain uncertainties, including, but not limited to, earnings levels, changing economic conditions, asset quality and property values. On February 2, 2011, the Company filed a Form S-1 Registration Statement to register shares of our common stock that we intend to offer to our shareholders in a shareholder rights offering and to other investors in a public offering. For more information, see below under the heading "Strategies for Complying with the Consent Order - Capital Raising." Written Agreement with Macatawa Bank Corporation and its Regulator Macatawa Bank Corporation has formally entered into a Written Agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago ("FRB") with an effective date of July 23, 2010. Among other things, the Written Agreement provides that Macatawa Bank Corporation: (i) must take appropriate steps to fully utilize its financial and managerial resources to serve as a source of strength to the Bank; (ii) may not declare or pay any dividends without prior FRB approval; (iii) may not take dividends or any other payment representing a reduction in capital from the Bank without prior FRB approval; (iv) may not make any distributions of interest, principal or other sums on subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities without prior FRB approval; (v) may not incur, increase or guarantee any debt without prior FRB approval; (vi) may not purchase or redeem any shares of its stock without prior FRB approval; (vii) must submit a written capital plan to the FRB within 60 days of the Written Agreement; and (viii) may not appoint any new director or senior executive officer, or change the responsibilities of any senior executive officer so that the officer would assume a different senior executive officer position, without prior regulatory approval. Macatawa Bank Corporation requested and received approval from the FRB to make its third and fourth quarter 2010 interest payments on its $1.65 million in outstanding subordinated debt. Macatawa Bank Corporation has requested approval from the FRB to make its first quarter 2011 interest payment on its subordinated debt, but has not yet received approval. Each quarter Macatawa Bank Corporation intends to continue to submit requests for approval from the FRB to make the next quarter's interest payment on its subordinated debt and is continuing to accrue the interest amounts due. Macatawa Bank Corporation submitted a written capital plan to the FRB for approval in November 2010, but has not yet received approval of the plan. - 3 - Table of Contents Deposit Gathering Activities During 2009 the Bank's regulatory capital ratios fell below levels required to be categorized as "well capitalized" under applicable regulatory guidelines. In addition, because the Bank is subject to the Consent Order, the Bank cannot be categorized as "well-capitalized," regardless of actual capital levels. As a result, the Bank is subject to the following restrictions regarding its deposit gathering activities:  Effective January 1, 2010, the interest rate paid for deposits by institutions that are categorized as less than "well capitalized" is limited to 75 basis points above the national rate for similar products unless the institution can support to the FDIC that prevailing rates in its market area exceed the national average. During the first quarter of 2010, the Company received notification from the FDIC that the prevailing rates in our market area exceeded the national average. Accordingly, the interest rates paid for deposits by the Bank are limited to 75 basis points above the average rate for similar products within our market area. Although this may impact our ability to compete for more rate sensitive deposits, we expect to continue to reduce our need to utilize rate sensitive deposits.  The Bank cannot accept, renew or rollover any brokered deposit unless it has applied for and been granted a waiver of this prohibition by the FDIC. The Bank has not accepted or renewed brokered deposits since November of 2008. A maturity table of deposits issued through brokers is included in Item 8 of this report in Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank expects it will be able to fund maturing brokered deposits under its current liquidity contingency program. Strategies for Complying with the Consent Order Our strategies to increase the Bank's capital ratios in order to comply with the capital requirements of the Consent Order include the following:  Earnings improvements. Our steps to reduce and manage our expenses have included:  We reduced staff during 2008 and 2009.  We paid no senior management bonuses for 2007 through 2010.  We have suspended merit pay increases.  We suspended 401(k) plan matching contributions at the beginning of 2010. These steps, along with other expense reduction measures, have resulted in the removal of approximately $9.0 million from our annualized operating costs since 2008. During 2010, controllable noninterest expenses, excluding nonperforming asset costs and FDIC assessments, were at their lowest quarterly levels in over five years. The management team remains active at exploring on-going cost reduction opportunities as we continue to "right-size" our operations.  Suspension of dividends. The Bank did not pay dividends to Macatawa Bank Corporation during 2009 and 2010. In previous periods, dividends from the Bank to Macatawa Bank Corporation were primarily utilized by it to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock and interest on its trust preferred securities. To preserve Bank capital, the Company has suspended dividend payments on its common and preferred stock and the deferral of interest payments on its trust preferred securities.  Risk Management and Improvement of Asset Quality. Despite the strain that a continuing soft economy places on the loan portfolio, the Company is committed to managing risk and mitigating loan losses. Tangible steps have been taken to reduce exposure within certain credit concentrations, establish more conservative lending principles that comply with regulatory standards, implement new lending and compliance policies and procedures, and enhance problem loan identification and resolution plans. These steps include increased Board of Directors oversight, specific plans to reduce substandard assets, Audit Committee oversight of the loan review process, establishment of lender accountability procedures, and enhanced loan policies and procedures.  Asset Reduction. Total assets were reduced by $251.9 million to $1.58 billion at December 31, 2010 from $1.83 billion at December 31, 2009. The decrease in total assets was largely from a reduction in our loan portfolio from efforts to reduce concentration in certain loan types. We are implementing a concentration reduction plan to measure and monitor concentrations of credit on an ongoing basis. Execution of that plan included curtailing the origination of residential land development loans, the portfolio primarily responsible for loan losses in 2008 and 2009. Increased emphasis has been placed on obtaining updated property valuations and "right- sizing" of loan balances either through pay downs or by obtaining additional collateral in order to protect us. We expect further asset reductions in these areas as we continue to execute this plan. - 4 - Table of Contents  Securities Portfolio Changes. During the second quarter of 2010, we completed the disposition of nearly all of the municipal, corporate and U.S. agency securities in our available-for-sale investment portfolio through sales in the open market. The securities were sold for a total of approximately $105.6 million. The sales were executed as part of our overall strategy to increase our regulatory capital ratios and liquidity. The majority of the proceeds have been initially invested in liquid money market balances with money center banks. We intend to ultimately reinvest the proceeds in higher yielding investment securities when market conditions improve.  Capital Raising. We previously increased our capital through the sale of $31.3 million of Series A Preferred Stock in the fourth quarter of 2008. During the second and third quarters of 2009, we increased our capital by $5.9 million through the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock, common stock and the subordinated debt. See Item 8 of this report in Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding these capital raises. We also remain active at exploring alternatives to raise new capital. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we engaged an independent consulting firm to assess the risk in our loan portfolio, an important step in supporting our capital planning efforts. On February 2, 2011, we filed a Form S-1 Registration Statement to register shares of our common stock that we intend to offer to our shareholders in a shareholder rights offering and to other investors in a public offering. We have not yet determined the final terms of the offering, including the number and price of shares that we intend to offer and sell in the offering. This report is not an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy shares of our common stock or any other securities. Offers and sales of common stock issuable in connection with the offering will only be made by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and applicable state securities laws, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in such prospectus. Products and Services Loan Portfolio We have historically offered a broad range of loan products to business customers, including commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans, and to retail customers, including residential mortgage and consumer loans. Given current weak economic conditions and the provisions of the Consent Order, new commercial loan origination activity is significantly lower than it was when economic conditions were stronger. However, select well-managed loan renewal activity for non-real estate loans is taking place. Following is a discussion of our various types of lending activities. Commercial and Industrial Loans Our commercial and industrial lending portfolio contains loans with a variety of purposes and security, including loans to finance operations and equipment. Generally, our commercial and industrial lending has been limited to borrowers headquartered, or doing business, in our primary market area. These credit relationships typically require the satisfaction of appropriate loan covenants and debt formulas, and generally require that the Bank be the primary depository bank of the business. These loan covenants and debt formulas are monitored through periodic, required reporting of accounts receivable aging schedules and financial statements, and in the case of larger business operations, reviews or audits by independent professional firms. Commercial and industrial loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower's business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself, as well as economic conditions. Further, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. Commercial Real Estate Loans Because of the risks associated with this type of lending, combined with the sharp decline in demand for and resulting values of real estate in our market in the last two years, we experienced a significant increase in non-performing loan levels during 2008 and 2009 and the first quarter of 2010 primarily associated with commercial real estate loans. The increase in nonperforming loan balances is more fully discussed in Item 7 of this report under the heading "Loan Portfolio and Asset Quality" included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition." Our commercial real estate loans consist primarily of construction and development loans and multi-family and other non-residential real estate loans. - 5 - Table of Contents Construction and Development Loans. These consist of construction loans to commercial customers for the construction of their business facilities. They also include construction loans to builders and developers for the construction of one- to four-family residences and the development of one- to four-family lots, residential subdivisions, condominium developments and other commercial developments. This portfolio has been particularly adversely affected by job losses, declines in real estate value, declines in home sale volumes, and declines in new home building. Declining real estate values have resulted in sharp increases in losses, particularly in the land development and construction loan portfolios to residential developers. We curtailed this type of lending in 2008. During 2009 and 2010, we also made a significant effort to reduce exposure to residential land development and other construction and development loans. We have also established goals to further reduce this exposure in 2011. Multi-Family and Other Non-Residential Real Estate Loans. These are permanent loans secured by multi-family and other non-residential real estate and include loans secured by apartment buildings, condominiums, small office buildings, small business facilities, medical facilities and other non-residential building properties, substantially all of which are located within our primary market area. Multi-family and other non-residential real estate loans generally present a higher level of risk than loans secured by owner occupied one- to four-family residences. This greater risk is due to several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic conditions on income producing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Furthermore, the repayment of these loans is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate project. For example, if leases are not obtained or renewed, or a bankruptcy court modifies a lease term, or a major tenant is unable to fulfill its lease obligations, cash flow from the project will be reduced. If cash flow from the project is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Retail Loans Our retail loans are loans to consumers and consist primarily of residential mortgage loans and consumer loans. Residential Mortgage Loans. We originate construction loans to individuals for the construction of their residences and owner-occupied residential mortgage loans, which are generally long-term with either fixed or adjustable interest rates. Our general policy is to sell the majority of our fixed rate residential mortgage loans in the secondary market due primarily to the interest rate risk associated with these loans. During 2010, we sold the majority of our loan originations in the secondary market to support our goal of shrinking the loan portfolio and preserving capital. We retained loans representing only approximately 10% of the dollar volume originated. During 2009, our ability to originate and sell mortgages was limited to some extent by disruptions in the secondary market and our loss of business relationships with certain companies that have historically purchased our mortgages. However, relationships were established with new investors in 2010, allowing us to continue our historical practice of originating and selling most of our fixed rate mortgage loan volume. Our borrowers generally qualify and are underwritten using industry standards for quality residential mortgage loans. We do not originate loans that are considered "sub-prime". Residential mortgage loan originations derive from a number of sources, including advertising, direct solicitation, real estate broker referrals, existing borrowers and depositors, builders and walk-in customers. Loan applications are accepted at most of our offices. The substantial majority of these loans are secured by one-to-four family properties in our market area. Consumer Loans. We originate a variety of different types of consumer loans, including automobile loans, home equity lines of credit and installment loans, home improvement loans, deposit account loans and other loans for household and personal purposes. We also originate home equity lines of credit utilizing the same underwriting standards as for home equity installment loans. Home equity lines of credit are revolving line of credit loans. The majority of our existing home equity line of credit portfolio has variable rates with floors and ceilings, interest only payments and a maximum maturity of ten years. The underwriting standards that we employ for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant's payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount. Consumer loans may entail greater credit risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans which are unsecured or are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation. In addition, consumer loan - 6 - Table of Contents collections are dependent on the borrower's continuing financial stability, and are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans.

Interest income totaling $2.7 million was recorded in 2010 on loans that were on a non-accrual status or classified as restructured as of December 31, 2010. Additional interest income of $2.8 million would have been recorded during 2010 on these loans had they been current in accordance with their original terms. The elevated levels of nonperforming loan balances in 2010 and 2009 and information about our policy for placing loans on non-accrual status may be found in Item 7 of this report under the heading "Loan Portfolio and Asset Quality" included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition." Loans at December 31, 2010 that were classified as substandard or worse per our internal risk rating system not included in the nonperforming assets table above that would cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms are discussed in Item 7 of this report under the heading "Loan Portfolio and Asset Quality" included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition." At December 31, 2010, there were no other interest-bearing assets that would be required to be disclosed under Industry Guide 3, Item III, C. 1. or 2. if such assets were loans. Loan Loss Experience The following is a summary of our loan balances at the end of each period and the daily average balances of these loans. It also includes changes in the allowance for loan losses arising from loans charged-off and recoveries on loans previously charged-off, and additions to the allowance which we have expensed.

Transaction accounts and savings and time certificates are tailored to the principal market area at rates competitive with those offered in the area. All deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC up to the maximum amount permitted by law. We solicit deposit services from individuals, businesses, associations, churches, nonprofit organizations, financial institutions and government authorities. Deposits are gathered primarily from the communities we serve through our network of 26 branches. We offer business and consumer checking accounts, regular and money market savings accounts, and certificates of deposit with many term options. We operate in a competitive environment, competing with other local banks similar in size and with significantly larger regional banks. We monitor rates at other financial institutions in the area to ascertain that our rates are competitive with the market. We also attempt to offer a wide variety of products to meet the needs of our customers. We set our deposit pricing to be competitive with other banks in our market area. - 9 - Table of Contents We have also utilized alternative funding sources as needed, including short-term borrowings, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis or the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, securities sold under agreements to repurchase ("repo borrowings") and certificates of deposit purchased from brokers. Before November of 2008, we purchased brokered deposits to supplement funding needs from time to time. These are time accounts originated outside of our local market area. Brokered deposits comprised approximately 4% of total deposits at December 31, 2010 and approximately 15% at December 31, 2009. The Bank has not accepted or renewed brokered deposits since November of 2008. Additional information about the restrictions on the Bank's deposit gathering activities may be found in this Item 1 under the heading "Regulatory Developments - Deposits and Other Funding Activities," and is here incorporated by reference.

Securities Portfolio Our securities portfolio is classified as either "available for sale" or "held to maturity." Securities classified as "available for sale" may be sold prior to maturity due to changes in interest rates, prepayment risks, and availability of alternative investments, or to meet our liquidity needs. The primary objective of our investing activities is to provide for the safety of the principal invested. Our secondary considerations include the maximization of earnings, liquidity and to help decrease our overall exposure to changes in interest rates. We have generally invested in bonds with lower credit risk; primarily those secured by government agencies or insured municipalities, to assist in the diversification of credit risk within our asset base. We have not experienced any credit losses within our investment portfolio. The following table reflects the composition of our securities portfolio as of the dates indicated.

Trust Services We began offering trust services in January 1999 to further provide for the financial needs of our customers. As of December 31, 2010, the Trust Department managed assets of approximately $599.4 million. Our types of service include both personal trust and retirement plan services. Our personal trust services include financial planning, investment management services, trust and estate administration and custodial services. As of December 31, 2010, personal trust assets under management totaled approximately $433.6 million. Our retirement plan services provide all types of qualified retirement plans, including profit sharing, 401(k) and pension plans. As of December 31, 2010, retirement plan assets under management totaled approximately $165.8 million. Market Area Our primary market area includes Ottawa, Kent and northern Allegan Counties, all located in Western Michigan. This area includes two mid-sized cities, Grand Rapids and Holland, and rural areas. Grand Rapids is the second largest city in Michigan. Holland is the largest city in Ottawa County. Both cities and surrounding areas have a solid and diverse economic base, which includes health and life sciences, tourism, office and home furniture, automotive components and assemblies, pharmaceutical, transportation, equipment, food and construction supplies. Grand Valley State University, a 24,000-student regional university with nearly 2,000 employees, has its three main campuses in our market area. GVSU and several smaller colleges and university affiliates located in our market area help stabilize the local economy because they are not as sensitive to the fluctuations of the broader economy. Companies operating in the market area include the Van Andel Institute, Steelcase, Herman Miller, Alticor, Gentex, Spectrum Health, Haworth, Johnson Controls, General Motors, Gerber, SPX, Magna, and Meijer. Competition There are many bank, thrift, credit union and other financial institution offices located within our market area. Most are branches of larger financial institutions. We also face competition from finance companies, insurance companies, mortgage companies, securities brokerage firms, money market funds and other providers of financial services. Many of our competitors have been in business a number of years, have established customer bases, are larger and have higher lending limits than we do. We compete for loans, deposits and other financial services based on our ability to communicate effectively with our customers, to understand and meet their needs and to provide high quality customer service. Our management believes that our personal service philosophy, our local decision-making and diverse delivery channels enhances our ability to compete favorably in attracting individuals and small businesses. We actively solicit customers by offering our customers personal attention, professional service, and competitive interest rates. - 11 - Table of Contents Employees As of December 31, 2010, we had 382 full-time equivalent employees consisting of 327 full-time and 95 part-time employees. We have assembled a staff of experienced, dedicated and qualified professionals whose goal is to meet the financial needs of our customers while providing outstanding service. The majority of our management team has at least 10 years of banking experience, and several key personnel have more than 20 years of banking experience. None of our employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements with us. SUPERVISION AND REGULATION The following is a summary of certain statutes and regulations affecting Macatawa Bank Corporation and Macatawa Bank. This summary is qualified in its entirety by such statutes and regulations. A change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on us and our business. General Financial institutions and their holding companies are extensively regulated under federal and state law. Consequently, our growth and earnings performance can be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the statutes administered by, and the regulations and policies of, various governmental regulatory authorities. Those authorities include, but are not limited to, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board"), the FDIC, OFIR, the Internal Revenue Service, and state taxing authorities. The effect of such statutes, regulations and policies can be significant, and cannot be predicted with a high degree of certainty. Federal and state laws and regulations generally applicable to financial institutions and their holding companies regulate, among other things, the scope of business, investments, reserves against deposits, capital levels relative to operations, lending activities and practices, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, mergers, consolidations and dividends. The system of supervision and regulation applicable to us and our bank establishes a comprehensive framework for our respective operations and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC's deposit insurance fund, our depositors, and the public, rather than our shareholders. Federal law and regulations establish supervisory standards applicable to our lending activities, including internal controls, credit underwriting, loan documentation and loan-to-value ratios for loans secured by real property. Recent Developments Dodd-Frank Act: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ("Dodd-Frank Act"), was signed into law by President Obama on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States, establishes the new federal Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection ("BCFP"), and will require the BCFP and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations. At this time, it is difficult to predict the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act or the resulting rules and regulations will impact the Company's business. Compliance with these new laws and regulations will likely result in additional costs, which could be significant and could adversely impact the Company's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Deposit Insurance: The FDIC has finalized changes to its deposit insurance assessment base effective April 1, 2011, which will use average assets as the base instead of quarterly deposits. Additional information about these changes may be found in this Item 1 below under the heading "Macatawa Bank - Deposit Insurance." As a result of provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, all funds in a "noninterest-bearing transaction account" are insured in full by the FDIC from December 31, 2010, through December 31, 2012. This temporary unlimited coverage is in addition to, and separate from, the general FDIC deposit insurance coverage of up to $250,000 available to depositors. The increase in maximum deposit insurance coverage to $250,000 was made permanent under the Dodd-Frank Act. Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing: The Federal Reserve Board on December 16, 2010 issued a proposal to implement a provision in the Dodd-Frank Act that requires it to set debit-card interchange fees so they are "reasonable and proportional" to the cost of the transaction. If finalized as proposed, the rule could result in a significant reduction in banks' debit-card interchange revenue. Though the rule technically does not apply to institutions with less than $10 billion, there is concern that the price controls will harm community banks, such as Macatawa Bank, which will be pressured by the marketplace to lower their own interchange rates. - 12 - Table of Contents Macatawa Bank Corporation General. Macatawa Bank Corporation is registered with, and subject to regulation by, the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act, as amended (the "BHCA"). Under the BHCA, Macatawa Bank Corporation is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve Board, and is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board periodic reports of our operations and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require. In accordance with Federal Reserve Board policy, Macatawa Bank Corporation is expected to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank in circumstances where we might not do so absent such policy. In addition, if the OFIR deems the Bank's capital to be impaired, the OFIR may require the Bank to restore its capital by a special assessment upon Macatawa Bank Corporation as the Bank's sole shareholder. If Macatawa Bank Corporation were to fail to pay any such assessment, the directors of the Bank would be required, under Michigan law, to sell the shares of the Bank's stock owned by Macatawa Bank Corporation to the highest bidder at either a public or private auction and use the proceeds of the sale to restore the Bank's capital. As discussed in this Item 1 under the heading "Regulatory Developments," Macatawa Bank Corporation has formally entered into a Written Agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago with an effective date of July 23, 2010. This information is here incorporated by reference. Investments and Activities. In general, any direct or indirect acquisition by us of any voting shares of any bank which would result in our direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares of such bank, and any merger or consolidation between us and another financial holding company or bank holding company, will require the prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA. No Federal Reserve Board approval is required for us to acquire a company, other than a bank holding company or bank, engaged in activities that are financial in nature as determined by the Federal Reserve Board. The merger or consolidation of the Bank with another bank, or the acquisition by the Bank of assets of another bank, or the assumption of liability by the Bank to pay any deposits of another bank, will require the prior written approval of the responsible federal depository institution regulatory agency under the Bank Merger Act. In addition, in certain such cases, an application to, and the prior approval of, the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA or the OFIR under the Michigan Banking Code, may be required. Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve Board uses capital adequacy guidelines in its examination and regulation of bank holding companies. If capital falls below minimum guidelines, a bank holding company may, among other items, be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non-bank businesses. Additional information on our capital ratios may be found in Item 7 of this report under the heading "Capital Resources" included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and in Item 8 of this report in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and is here incorporated by reference. Dividends. Macatawa Bank Corporation is a corporation separate and distinct from the Bank. Most of our revenues are dividends paid by the Bank. Thus, Macatawa Bank Corporation's ability to pay dividends to our shareholders is indirectly limited by restrictions on the Bank's ability to pay dividends described below. Further, in a policy statement, the Federal Reserve Board has expressed its view that a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends if its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends, its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition, or it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. The Federal Reserve Board also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies. Similar enforcement powers over our bank are possessed by the FDIC. The "prompt corrective action" provisions of federal law and regulation authorizes the FDIC to restrict the payment of dividends to Macatawa Bank Corporation by our bank if it fails to meet specified capital levels. In addition, the Michigan Business Corporation Act provides that dividends may be legally declared or paid only if after the distribution a corporation, like Macatawa Bank Corporation, can pay its debts as they come due in the usual course of business and its total assets equal or exceed the sum of its liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of any holders of preferred stock whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution. - 13 - Table of Contents Macatawa Bank Corporation previously suspended the payment of dividends on common and preferred stock and deferred interest payments on trust preferred securities. Additional information regarding the suspension of dividends and deferral of interest payments may be found in Item 5 of this report, Item 7 of this report under the heading "Capital Resources" included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and in Item 8 of this report in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and is here incorporated by reference. Changes in Directors and Senior Executive Officers. Macatawa Bank Corporation and the Bank have each been advised by their federal bank regulators that they are deemed to be in troubled condition. As a result, Macatawa Bank Corporation and the Bank must each (i) provide their federal bank regulator with at least 30 days' prior notice before appointing any new director or senior executive officer or changing the responsibilities of any senior executive officer; and (ii) obtain the approval of their federal bank regulator before making (or agreeing to make) any severance payments (except pursuant to a qualified pension or retirement plan and certain other employee benefit plans). These regulatory requirements could make it more difficult for us to retain and hire qualified senior management. Federal Securities Regulation. Our common stock is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). We are subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading and other restrictions and requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act. We are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which imposes numerous reporting, accounting, corporate governance and business practices on companies, as well as financial and other professionals who have involvement with the U.S. public markets. We are generally subject to these requirements and applicable SEC rules and regulations. Macatawa Bank General. Macatawa Bank is a Michigan banking corporation, and its deposit accounts are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (the "DIF") of the FDIC. As a DIF-insured Michigan-chartered bank, the Bank is subject to the examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement requirements of the OFIR, as the chartering authority for Michigan banks, and the FDIC, as administrator of DIF. These agencies and the federal and state laws applicable to the Bank and its operations, extensively regulate various aspects of the banking business including, among other things, permissible types and amounts of loans, investments and other activities, capital adequacy, branching, interest rates on loans and on deposits, the maintenance of non-interest bearing reserves on deposit accounts, and the safety and soundness of banking practices. On February 22, 2010, the Bank entered into a Consent Order with the FDIC and OFIR. Additional information regarding the Consent Order may be found in this Item 1 of the report under the heading "Regulatory Developments," and is here incorporated by reference. Deposit Insurance. As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system under which all insured depository institutions are placed into one of four categories and assessed insurance premiums, based upon their respective levels of capital and results of supervisory evaluation. Institutions categorized as well-capitalized (as defined by the FDIC) and considered healthy pay the lowest premium while institutions that are categorized as less than adequately capitalized (as defined by the FDIC) and considered of substantial supervisory concern pay the highest premium. Risk classification of all insured institutions is made by the FDIC for each semi-annual assessment period. The FDIC is required to establish assessment rates for insured depository institutions at levels that will maintain the DIF at a Designated Reserve Ratio (DRR) selected by the FDIC within a range of 1.15% to 1.50%. The FDIC is allowed to manage the pace at which the reserve ratio varies within this range. Due to recent disruptions in the financial markets and the large numbers of bank failures in the last year, the DRR has fallen below 1.15%. The FDIC has adopted an Amended Restoration Plan which established the time within which the reserve ratio must be returned to 1.15% to seven years. The FDIC imposed a special assessment on all insured depository institutions that was collected on September 30, 2009. The FDIC may impose additional special assessments under certain circumstances. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2009, insured institutions were required to prepay their estimated risk-based assessments for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012 based on a 5% annual growth rate. Effective January 1, 2011, annual assessment rates will uniformly increase by 3 basis points. Effective April 1, 2009, most well-capitalized banks pay 12 to 16 basis points annually, increasing to 45 basis points for banks that pose significant supervisory concerns. This base rate may be adjusted based upon the level of unsecured debt, secured liabilities or brokered deposits, as defined, resulting in adjusted rates ranging from 7 to 24 basis points annually for most well capitalized banks and 40 to 77.5 basis points annually for banks that pose significant supervisory concerns. We estimate our annual assessment rate for the first quarter of 2011 to be 32 basis points. - 14 - Table of Contents The FDIC has finalized changes to its deposit insurance assessment base effective April 1, 2011, which will use average assets as the base instead of quarterly deposits. Under this new calculation, most well capitalized banks will pay 5 to 9 basis points annually, increasing to 35 basis points for banks that post significant supervisory concerns. This base rate may be adjusted for the level of unsecured debt and brokered deposits, resulting in adjusted rates ranging from 2.5 to 9 basis points annually for most well capitalized banks to 30 to 45 basis points for banks that pose significant supervisory concerns. We estimate our annual assessment rate under these new guidelines to be 23 basis points. FICO Assessments. The Bank, as a member of the DIF, is subject to assessments to cover the payments on outstanding obligations of the Financing Corporation ("FICO"). From now until the maturity of the outstanding FICO obligations in 2019, DIF members will share the cost of the interest on the FICO bonds on a pro rata basis. It is estimated that FICO assessments during this period will be less than 0.025% of deposits. Capital Requirements. The FDIC has established the following minimum capital standards for state-chartered, FDIC insured non-member banks, such as the Bank: a leverage requirement consisting of a ratio of Tier 1 capital to total average assets and a risk-based capital requirement consisting of a ratio of total capital to total risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital consists principally of shareholders' equity. Federal law provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The extent of the regulators' powers depends on whether the institution in question is "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized," or "critically undercapitalized." Federal regulations define these capital categories as follows: Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio Leverage Ratio Well capitalized 10% or above 6% or above 5% or above Adequately capitalized 8% or above 4% or above 4% or above Undercapitalized Less than 8% Less than 4% Less than 4% Significantly undercapitalized Less than 6% Less than 3% Less than 3% Critically undercapitalized -- -- A ratio of tangible equity to total assets of 2% or less Depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned, the regulators' corrective powers include: requiring the submission of a capital restoration plan; placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities; requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) or to be acquired; restricting transactions with affiliates; restricting the interest rate the institution may pay on deposits; ordering a new election of directors of the institution; requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed; prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries; prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; and ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution. In general, a depository institution may be reclassified to a lower category than is indicated by its capital levels if the appropriate federal depository institution regulatory agency determines the institution to be otherwise in an unsafe or unsound condition or to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice. This could include a failure by the institution, following receipt of a less-than-satisfactory rating on its most recent examination report, to correct the deficiency. Higher capital levels will be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual institutions. As long as the Bank is subject to the Consent Order, the Bank cannot be categorized as "well-capitalized" regardless of actual capital levels. As of the date of this report, the Bank was categorized as "adequately capitalized." The Consent Order requires the Bank, to have and maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio of at least 8% and a Total Risk Based Capital Ratio of at least 11%. Additional information regarding our ability to achieve these capital levels may be found in this Item 1 under the heading "Regulatory Developments," and is here incorporated by reference. Additional information on our capital ratios may be found in Item 8 of this report in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and is here incorporated by reference. Dividends. Under Michigan law, the Bank is restricted as to the maximum amount of dividends it may pay on its common stock. The Bank may not pay dividends except out of net income after deducting its losses and bad debts. A Michigan state bank may not declare or pay a dividend unless the bank will have surplus amounting to at least 20% of its capital after the payment of the dividend. - 15 - Table of Contents Federal law generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. The FDIC may prevent an insured bank from paying dividends if the bank is in default of payment of any assessment due to the FDIC. In addition, the FDIC may prohibit the payment of dividends by our bank, if such payment is determined to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Additional information about restrictions on payment of dividends by the Bank may be found in this Item 1 under the heading "Regulatory Developments" and in Item 8 of this report in Notes 1 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and is here incorporated by reference. Insider Transactions. The Bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on any extensions of credit to us or our subsidiaries, on investments in the stock or other securities of our or our subsidiaries and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of us or our subsidiaries as collateral for loans. Certain limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by our bank to its directors and officers, to our directors and officers, the directors and officers of our bank, to our principal shareholders and to "related interests" of such directors, officers and principal shareholders. In addition, federal law and regulations may affect the terms upon which any person becoming a director or officer of our company or one of its subsidiaries or a principal shareholder in our company may obtain credit from banks with which our bank maintains a correspondent relationship. Safety and Soundness Standards. The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines to promote the safety and soundness of federally insured depository institutions. These guidelines establish standards for internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality and earnings. Investments and Other Activities. Under federal law and FDIC regulations, FDIC insured state banks are prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from making or retaining equity investments of a type, or in an amount, that are not permissible for a national bank. Federal law, as implemented by FDIC regulations, also prohibits FDIC insured state banks and their subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, from engaging as principal in any activity that is not permitted for a national bank or its subsidiary, respectively, unless the bank meets, and continues to meet, its minimum regulatory capital requirements and the FDIC determines the activity would not pose a significant risk to the deposit insurance fund of which the bank is a member. Impermissible investments and activities must be divested or discontinued within certain time frames set by the FDIC in accordance with federal law. These restrictions are not currently expected to have a material impact on the operations of our bank. Consumer Protection Laws. The Bank's business includes making a variety of types of loans to individuals. In making these loans, we are subject to State usury and regulatory laws and to various federal statutes, including the privacy of consumer financial information provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and regulations promulgated there under, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the regulations promulgated there under, which prohibit discrimination, specify disclosures to be made to borrowers regarding credit and settlement costs, and regulate the mortgage loan servicing activities of the Bank, including the maintenance and operation of escrow accounts and the transfer of mortgage loan servicing. In receiving deposits, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation under State and federal law and regulations, including the Truth in Savings Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Violation of these laws could result in the imposition of significant damages and fines upon the Bank and its directors and officers. Branching Authority. Michigan banks have the authority under Michigan law to establish branches anywhere in the State of Michigan, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals. Banks may establish interstate branch networks through acquisitions of other banks. The establishment of de novo interstate branches or the acquisition of individual branches of a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) is allowed only if specifically authorized by state law. Michigan permits both U.S. and non-U.S. banks to establish branch offices in Michigan. The Michigan Banking Code permits, in appropriate circumstances and with the approval of OFIR, (1) acquisition of Michigan banks by FDIC-insured banks, savings banks or savings and loan associations located in other states, (2) sale by a Michigan bank of branches to an FDIC-insured bank, savings bank or savings and loan association located in a state in which a Michigan bank could purchase branches of the purchasing entity, (3) consolidation of Michigan banks and FDIC-insured banks, savings banks or savings and loan associations located in other states having laws permitting such consolidation, (4) establishment of branches in Michigan by FDIC-insured banks located in other states, the District of Columbia or U.S. territories or protectorates having laws permitting a Michigan bank to establish a branch in such jurisdiction, and (5) establishment by foreign banks of branches located in Michigan. A Michigan bank holding company may acquire a non-Michigan bank and a non-Michigan bank holding company may acquire a Michigan bank. - 16 - Table of Contents ITEM 1A: Risk Factors. Risks related to the our Business Other than the last three quarters of 2010, our results of operations have not been profitable in recent periods and we may incur additional losses during 2011. We were profitable in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2010, but we had posted a high net consolidated loss in each of the preceding six consecutive quarters, and a total consolidated net loss during that time period of $123.5 million. Net income for the second quarter of 2010 was largely due to a $2.7 million gain on the sale of securities. Net income for the fourth quarter was impacted by a $574,000 gain on the sale of a bank owned property. The last three quarters of 2010 were positively affected by reductions in the allowance for loan losses. Total nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2010 remained high and related costs were elevated as well. There is no assurance that our results of operations will stay profitable in the short term or at all. We have recorded provisions for loan losses of $22.5 million and $74.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Costs associated with the administration and disposition of nonperforming assets were $15.4 million and $11.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. In light of the current economic environment, significant additional provisions for loan losses and nonperforming asset costs may yet be necessary. As a result, we may incur significant additional credit costs in 2011 or beyond, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and the value of our common stock. Our past operating results may not be indicative of its future operating results. Our strategic direction and focus has turned from growth to improving our internal operations, including complying with the Bank's Consent Order, working out of our problem loans and assets and returning to profitable operations. We will not be able to achieve the historical rate of growth we experienced prior to the 2008 economic downturn, may not even be able to grow our business at all and may be forced to continue to shrink assets to maintain regulatory capital ratios. Various factors, many of which are discussed in more detail in the risk factors below, that may impede or prohibit our ability to grow include the impact of elevated levels of nonperforming assets, the inability to maintain or access additional capital and liquidity sources, economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations and competition. If we experience a significant decrease in our size, the our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected due to the percentage of our operating costs being fixed expenses. Our elevated level of nonperforming assets and other problem loans could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our nonperforming assets were approximately $133.4 million (which includes non-accrual loans, foreclosed properties and other accruing loans past due 90 days or more at December 31, 2010). These elevated levels could continue to negatively impact operating results through higher loan losses, lost interest and higher costs to administer problem assets. Until these elevated levels of problem assets are reduced, we could continue to record operating losses that further materially deteriorate the our financial condition and reduce capital levels, further exposing us to additional risk factors discussed below. National, state and local economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The results of operations for financial institutions, including our Bank, may be materially and adversely affected by changes in prevailing national, state and local economic conditions. Our profitability is heavily influenced by the quality of our loan portfolio and the stability of our deposits. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in Ottawa, Kent and Allegan Counties of Western Michigan. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services, as well as the ability of the our customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of the our deposit funding sources. A significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences, unemployment, changes in securities, financial, or credit markets or other factors could impact national as well as these local economic conditions and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. - 17 - Table of Contents Our credit losses could increase and our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses. The risk of nonpayment of loans is inherent in all lending activities and nonpayment of loans may have a material adverse effect on our earnings and overall financial condition, as well as the value of our common stock. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for potential losses based on a number of factors. If our assumptions are wrong, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover our losses, which could have an adverse affect on our operating results, and may cause us to increase the allowance in the future. The actual amount of future provisions for loan losses cannot now be determined and may exceed the amounts of past provisions. Federal banking regulators, as an integral part of their supervisory function, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. These regulatory agencies may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may be different from ours. Any increase in the allowance for loan losses could have a negative effect on our regulatory capital ratios, net income, financial condition and results of operations. Macatawa Bank Corporation has only limited cash and cash equivalents available at the holding company level. If its cash and cash equivalents are exhausted and it is unable to access additional funds through capital raising efforts or other funding sources, it could be unable to meet its financial obligations as they came due rendering the Company insolvent. At December 31, 2010, Macatawa Bank Corporation held at the holding company level cash and cash equivalents of $579,000 compared to $1,143,000 at December 31, 2009. As of the date of this report, Macatawa Bank Corporation anticipates that its cash and cash equivalents could be exhausted, unless it is able to access additional funds through capital raising efforts or other funding sources. If Macatawa Bank Corporation's cash and cash equivalents are exhausted, it would be unable to meet its financial obligations as they came due rendering Macatawa Bank Corporation insolvent. If Macatawa Bank Corporation were to become insolvent, it could be subject to voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or similar insolvency proceedings and its business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. If the condition of the Bank's loan portfolio worsens, its ability to borrow funds from the Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank could be adversely affected, which could materially adversely affect the Bank's liquidity position. As part of its liquidity management, the Bank borrows funds from the Federal Home Loan Bank and has the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank. The borrowed funds are collateralized by certain investment securities and qualifying residential and commercial real estate loans. The Bank is permitted to borrow an amount of funds up to a certain percentage of the total investment securities and loans pledged as collateral. The Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank will not accept as collateral any loan that is rated as a 5 or worse on our internal loan grading system. If the quality of the Bank's loan portfolio worsens, the Bank could have fewer loans eligible to be pledged as collateral for borrowed funds, reducing the total amount of available funds that the Bank is permitted to borrow. A reduction in the total amount of the available funds that the Bank is permitted to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank could materially adversely affect the Bank's liquidity position. The Bank cannot accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits without a waiver from the FDIC, which could materially adversely affect the Bank's liquidity position. Because the Bank is subject to a Consent Order, the Bank cannot be categorized as "well-capitalized," regardless of actual capital levels. As of the date of this report, the Bank was categorized as "adequately capitalized." As a result, the Bank cannot accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless it has applied for and been granted a waiver of this prohibition by the FDIC. It is not likely that the Bank will be granted a waiver of this prohibition. At December 31, 2010, the Bank's brokered deposits totaled $48.2 million and represented 4% of deposits. If the Bank is not able to replace the funding required for maturing brokered deposits, the Bank's liquidity position could be materially adversely affected. We are subject to liquidity risk in our operations, which could adversely affect our ability to fund various obligations. Liquidity risk is the possibility of being unable to meet obligations as they come due, pay deposits when withdrawn, and fund loan and investment opportunities as they arise because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit obligations to borrowers, mortgage originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of debt, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Liquidity of the Bank is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and retention, principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities, net cash provided from operation and access to other funding sources. Liquidity is essential to our business. We must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale or pledging as collateral of loans and other assets could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. An inability to retain the current level of deposits, including the loss of one or more of the Bank's larger deposit relationships, could have a material adverse effect on the Bank's liquidity. Our access to funding sources - 18 - Table of Contents in amounts adequate to finance activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of the business activity due to a market down turn or regulatory action that limits or eliminates access to alternate funding sources, including brokered deposits discussed above. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are nonspecific to the Company, such as severe disruption of the financial markets or negative expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole, as evidenced by recent turmoil in the domestic and worldwide credit markets. We are not in compliance with the Consent Order. This could result in enforcement action against us. The Bank is subject to a Consent Order with the FDIC and OFIR. The Bank is required to have and maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio of at least 8% and a Total Risk Based Capital Ratio of at least 11%. The Bank was not in compliance with these capital ratios at December 31, 2010. We are evaluating alternatives to reach and maintain the capital levels required by the Consent Order. Achievement of these capital levels could be impacted, positively or negatively, as a result of certain uncertainties, including, but not limited to, earnings levels, changing economic conditions, asset quality and property values. A failure to raise additional capital to satisfy the capital levels required by the Consent Order could materially adversely affect our ability to maintain our current level of assets and to further expand our operations through organic growth. In addition, the Bank could become subject to an enforcement action, which could result in removal of directors, officers, employees and institution affiliated parties, and the imposition of civil money penalties and even ultimately closure of the Bank. Failure to comply with the Written Agreement could result in enforcement proceedings. Macatawa Bank Corporation is subject to a Written Agreement with the FRB. The failure to comply with the terms of the Written Agreement could result in proceedings to enforce the Written Agreement. Such proceedings could result in removal of directors, officers, employees and institution affiliated parties, and the imposition of civil money penalties. A pending SEC investigation may subject us to significant costs and could divert management attention. We have been fully cooperating with the SEC, which is conducting a non-public fact-finding investigation into the circumstances surrounding the Company's restatement of earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 and our decision to revise its previously announced financial results for the quarter ending June 30, 2009. The SEC has not provided us with notice asserting that any violations of the securities laws have occurred, but there can be no assurance as to the outcome of its investigation. We have already incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant legal expenses arising from the investigation. If the SEC were to institute legal action, we could face fines and penalties in an amount that could be material and we could be required to take remedial actions determined by the SEC or a court. Our construction and development lending has exposed us to significant risks and has resulted in a disproportionate amount of the increase in our provision for loan losses in recent periods. Construction and development loans consist of loans to commercial customers for the construction of their business facilities. They also include construction loans to builders and developers for the construction of one- to four-family residences and the development of one- to four-family lots, residential subdivisions, condominium developments and other commercial developments. This portfolio has been particularly adversely affected by job losses, declines in real estate value, declines in home sale volumes, and declines in new home building. Declining real estate values have resulted in sharp increases in losses, particularly in the land development and construction loan portfolios to residential developers. This type of lending is generally considered to have more complex credit risks than traditional single-family residential lending because the principal is concentrated in a limited number of loans with repayment dependent on the successful completion and sales of the related real estate project. Consequently, these loans are often more sensitive to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general economy than other real estate loans. These loans are generally less predictable and more difficult to evaluate and monitor and collateral may be difficult to dispose of in a market decline. Additionally, we may experience significant construction loan losses if independent appraisers or project engineers inaccurately estimate the cost and value of construction loan projects. The Company curtailed this type of lending in 2008. During 2009 and 2010, we also made a significant effort to reduce our exposure to residential land development and other construction and development loans. Construction and development loans have contributed disproportionately to the increase in our provisions for loan losses in recent periods. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $95.7 million in loans to residential developers, or approximately 7.8% of our loan portfolio. Approximately $28.9 million, or 49.8%, of our net charge-offs during 2009 and approximately $9.2 million, or 31.0%, of our net charge-offs during 2010 were attributable to construction and development loans. Further deterioration in our construction and development loan portfolio could result in additional increases in the provision for loan losses and an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. - 19 - Table of Contents We have significant exposure to risks associated with commercial and residential real estate. A substantial portion of our loan portfolio consists of commercial and residential real estate-related loans, including real estate development, construction and residential and commercial mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $669.2 million of commercial real estate loans outstanding, which represented approximately 55% of our loan portfolio. As of that same date, we had approximately $135.2 million in residential real estate loans outstanding, or approximately 11% of our loan portfolio. Consequently, real estate-related credit risks are a significant concern for us. The adverse consequences from real estate-related credit risks tend to be cyclical and are often driven by national economic developments that are not controllable or entirely foreseeable by us or our borrowers. General difficulties in our real estate markets have recently contributed to significant increases in our nonperforming loans, charge-offs, and decreases in our income. Commercial loans may expose us to greater financial and credit risk than other loans. Our commercial loan portfolio, including commercial mortgages, was approximately $933.9 million at December 31, 2010, comprising approximately 77% of our total loan portfolio. Commercial loans generally carry larger loan balances and can involve a greater degree of financial and credit risk than other loans. Any significant failure to pay on time by our customers would hurt our earnings. The increased financial and credit risk associated with these types of loans are a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the size of loan balances, the effects of general economic conditions on income-producing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. In addition, when underwriting a commercial or industrial loan, we may take a security interest in commercial real estate, and, in some instances upon a default by the borrower, we may foreclose on and take title to the property, which may lead to potential financial risks for us under applicable environmental laws. If hazardous substances were discovered on any of these properties, we may be liable to governmental agencies or third parties for the costs of remediation of the hazard, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Many environmental laws can impose liability regardless of whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the contamination. Our loan portfolio has and will continue to be affected by the on-going correction in residential real estate prices and reduced levels of home sales. Loans to residential developers involved in the development or sale of 1-4 family residential properties were approximately $95.7 million and $153.3 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009. There continues to be a general slowdown in the housing market in our market area, reflecting declining prices and excess inventories of houses to be sold. As a result, home builders have shown signs of financial deterioration. We expect the home builder market to continue to be volatile and anticipate continued pressure on the home builder segment. As we continue our on-going portfolio monitoring, we will make credit and reserve decisions based on the current conditions of the borrower or project combined with our expectations for the future. If the deterioration in the housing market continues, we could experience higher charge-offs and delinquencies in this portfolio. We may face increasing pressure from historical purchasers of our residential mortgage loans to repurchase those loans or reimburse purchasers for losses related to those loans. We generally sell the fixed rate long-term residential mortgage loans we originate on the secondary market and retain adjustable rate mortgage loans for our portfolios. In response to the financial crisis, we believe that purchasers of residential mortgage loans, such as government sponsored entities, are increasing their efforts to seek to require sellers of residential mortgage loans to either repurchase loans previously sold or reimburse purchasers for losses related to loans previously sold when losses are incurred on a loan previously sold due to actual or alleged failure to strictly conform to the purchaser's purchase criteria. As a result, while we have not yet been required to repurchase such loans, we may face increasing pressure from historical purchasers of our residential mortgage loans to repurchase those loans or reimburse purchasers for losses related to those loans and we may face increasing expenses to defend against such claims. If we are required in the future to repurchase loans previously sold, reimburse purchasers for losses related to loans previously sold, or if we incur increasing expenses to defend against such claims, our financial condition and results of operations would be negatively affected, and would lower our capital ratios as a result of increasing assets and lowering income through expenses and any loss incurred. Changes in interest rates may negatively affect our earnings and the value of our assets. Our earnings and cash flows depend substantially upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earnings assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, competition and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the policies of the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could - 20 - Table of Contents influence not only the interest we receive on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest they pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect: (i) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits; (ii) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, including our securities portfolio; and (iii) the average duration of our interest-earning assets. This also includes the risk that interest-earning assets may be more responsive to changes in interest rates than interest-bearing liabilities, or vice versa (repricing risk), the risk that the individual interest rates or rates indices underlying various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may not change in the same degree over a given time period (basis risk), and the risk of changing interest rate relationships across the spectrum of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability maturities (yield curve risk), including a prolonged flat or inverted yield curve environment. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations. The Dodd-Frank Act may adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), was signed into law by President Obama. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States, establishes the new federal Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (the "BCFP"), and will require the BCFP and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations. At this time, it is difficult to predict the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act or the resulting rules and regulations will impact the Company's and the Bank's business. Compliance with these new laws and regulations will likely result in additional costs, which could be significant, and could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. We are subject to significant government regulation, and any regulatory changes may adversely affect us. The banking industry is heavily regulated under both federal and state law. These regulations are primarily intended to protect customers, not our creditors or shareholders. We are subject to extensive regulation by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and OFIR, in addition to other regulatory and self-regulatory organizations. Regulations affecting banks and financial services companies undergo continuous change, and we cannot predict the ultimate effect of such changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability or financial condition. We could be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions, including defaults by larger financial institutions. Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships between financial institutions. We have exposure to multiple counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by the Bank or by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as "systemic risk" and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges, with which we interact on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect us. The Bank may be required to pay additional insurance premiums to the FDIC, which could negatively impact earnings. Recent insured institution failures, as well as deterioration in banking and economic conditions, have significantly increased FDIC loss provisions, resulting in a decline in the designated reserve ratio to historical lows. The reserve ratio may continue to decline in the future. In addition, the limit on FDIC coverage has been increased to $250,000. These developments have caused the premiums assessed to the Bank by the FDIC to increase. Further, depending upon any future losses that the FDIC insurance fund may suffer, there can be no assurance that there will not be additional premium increases in order to replenish the fund. The FDIC may need to set a higher base rate schedule or impose special assessments due to future financial institution failures and updated failure and loss projections. Potentially higher FDIC assessment rates could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. The proposed offering of our common stock may increase the risk of an "ownership change" for purposes of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which may materially impair our ability to use our deferred tax assets. On February 2, 2011, we filed a Form S-1 Registration Statement to register shares of our common stock that we intend to offer to our shareholders in a shareholder rights offering and to other investors in a public offering. For more information, see above under the heading "Strategies for Complying with the Consent Order - Capital Raising." - 21 - Table of Contents At December 31, 2010, our net deferred tax asset was $25.6 million (before valuation allowance). Our ability to use our deferred tax assets to offset future taxable income will be limited if we experience an "ownership change" as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in our ownership by "5-percent shareholders" (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. A corporation that experiences an ownership change will generally be subject to an annual limitation on the use of its pre-ownership change deferred tax assets equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate, which is currently 4.47% for ownership changes occurring in February 2011. The offering could cause us to experience an "ownership change" as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Even if the offering does not cause us to experience an "ownership change," the issuance of our shares of common stock in the offering materially increases the risk that we could experience an "ownership change" in the future. As a result, issuances or sales of common stock or other securities in the future, or certain other direct or indirect changes in ownership, could result in an "ownership change" under Section 382 of the Code. In the event an "ownership change" were to occur, we could realize a permanent loss of a significant portion of our U.S. federal deferred tax assets (related to net operating loss carryforwards) and lose certain built-in losses that have not been recognized for tax purposes. The amount of the permanent loss would depend on the size of the annual limitation (which is in part a function of our market capitalization at the time of an "ownership change") and the remaining carry forward period (U.S. federal net operating losses generally may be carried forward for a period of 20 years). Due to the losses incurred in recent years and in the first quarter of 2010, we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our entire deferred tax asset. If an "ownership change" had occurred on December 31, 2010, there would have been no direct financial impact because the asset is fully reserved, however, the ownership change would have affected the amount of valuation allowance we may be able to reverse in the future. We rely heavily on our management and other key personnel, and the loss of any of them may adversely affect our operations. We are and will continue to be dependent upon the services of our management team and other key personnel. Losing the services of one or more key members of our management team could adversely affect our operations. Our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented. Management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. If we fail to identify and remediate control deficiencies, it is possible that a material misstatement of interim or annual financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In addition, any failure or circumvention of our other controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may be a defendant in a variety of litigation and other actions, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation arising out of our business. Our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation or cause us to incur unexpected expenses, which could be material in amount. Should the ultimate expenses, judgments or settlements in any litigation exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may it be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms, if at all. Our future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry. We face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors. Our future growth and success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive environment. We compete for deposits, loans and other financial services with numerous Michigan-based and out-of-state banks, thrifts, credit unions and other financial institutions as well as other entities which provide financial services. Some of the financial institutions and financial services organizations with which we compete are not subject to the same degree of regulation as we are. Most of our competitors have been in business for many years, have established customer bases, are larger, and have substantially higher - 22 - Table of Contents lending limits than we do. The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. Evaluation of investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment involves subjective determinations and could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition. The evaluation of impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings. The risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer's financial condition or future recovery prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period. Estimating future cash flows involves incorporating information received from third-party sources and making internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral and assessing the probability that an adverse change in future cash flows has occurred. The determination of the amount of other-than-temporary impairments is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Our management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses reasonable judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery. Inherent in management's evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Impairments to the carrying value of our investment securities may need to be taken in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We depend upon the accuracy and completeness of information about customers. In deciding whether to extend credit to customers, we may rely on information provided to it by its customers, including financial statements and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of customers as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. Our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent that we extend credit in reliance on financial statements or other information provided by customers that is false or misleading. We continually encounter technological change, and we may have fewer resources than our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements. The banking industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to our customers. Risks associated with the Company's stock Our ability to pay dividends is limited and we may be unable to pay future dividends. We have suspended payment of dividends on our preferred and common stock in order to preserve capital and we do not expect to resume payment of dividends in the near term. Our ability to pay dividends is limited by regulatory restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient regulatory capital. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends to Macatawa Bank Corporation is limited by its obligation to maintain sufficient capital and by other general restrictions on dividends that are applicable to us. Under Michigan law, the Bank is restricted from paying dividends to the Company until its deficit retained earnings has been restored. The Bank had a retained deficit of approximately $39.8 million at December 31, 2010. Additional information on restrictions on payments of dividends by us may be found in Item 1 of this report under the headings "Regulatory Developments" and "Supervision and Regulation," in Item 7 of this report under the under the heading "Capital Resources" included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and in Item 8 of this report in Notes 1 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and is here incorporated by reference. The market price of our common stock can be volatile, which may make it more difficult to resell our common stock at a desired time and price. Stock price volatility may make it more difficult for a shareholder to resell our common stock when a shareholder wants to and at prices a shareholder finds attractive or at all. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, regardless of operating results. These factors include, among other things: - 23 - Table of Contents  Variations in our anticipated or actual operating results or the results of our competitors;  Changes in investors' or analysts' perceptions of the risks and conditions of our business;  The size of the public float of our common stock;  Regulatory developments;  Interest rate changes or credit loss trends;  Trading volume in our common stock;  Market conditions; and  General economic conditions. We may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future, which could dilute a shareholder's ownership of common stock. Our articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors, without shareholder approval, to, among other things, issue additional shares of common or preferred stock. The issuance of any additional shares of common or preferred stock could be dilutive to a shareholder's ownership of Company common stock. To the extent that we issue options or warrants to purchase common stock in the future and the options or warrants are exercised, our shareholders may experience further dilution. Holders of shares of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, shareholders may not be permitted to invest in future issuances of our common or preferred stock. Because of our capital requirements, we may find it necessary to sell common stock to raise capital under circumstances and at prices which result in extreme dilution. Although publicly traded, our common stock has substantially less liquidity than the average liquidity of stocks listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Although our common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, our common stock has substantially less liquidity than the average liquidity for companies listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This marketplace depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. This limited market may affect a shareholder's ability to sell shares on short notice, and the sale of a large number of shares at one time could temporarily depress the market price of our common stock. For these reasons, our common stock should not be viewed as a short-term investment. Our common stock is not insured by any governmental entity. Our common stock is not a deposit account or other obligation of any bank and is not insured by the FDIC or any other governmental entity. Investment in our common stock is subject to risk, including possible loss. We may issue debt and equity securities that are senior to our common stock as to distributions and in liquidation, which could negatively affect the value of our common stock. We have in the past and may in the future increase its capital by entering into debt or debt-like financing or issuing debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of senior notes, subordinated notes, preferred stock or common stock. In the event of the Company's liquidation, its lenders and holders of its debt securities would receive a distribution of the Company's available assets before distributions to the holders of Company common stock. The Company's decision to incur debt and issue securities in future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond its control. The Company cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of its future offerings and debt financings. Future offerings could reduce the value of shares of Company common stock and dilute a shareholder's interest in the Company. Exercise of our outstanding Warrants to purchase common stock or conversion of our outstanding preferred stock could substantially dilute a shareholder's ownership of common stock. We have issued Warrants to purchase a total of 1,478,811 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $9.00 per share. We have outstanding 31,290 shares of Class A Preferred Stock, which are convertible into approximately 3,496,032 shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $8.95 per share. We have outstanding 2,350 shares of Class B Preferred Stock, which are convertible into approximately 391,675 shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $6.00 per share. - 24 - Table of Contents Additional information about the Warrants and the preferred stock may be found in Item 8 of this report in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is here incorporated by reference. The exercise or conversion, in whole or in part, of these securities into shares of our common stock could substantially dilute a shareholder's ownership of common stock. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws and Michigan laws contain certain provisions that could make a takeover more difficult. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, and the laws of Michigan, include provisions which are designed to provide our Board of Directors with time to consider whether a hostile takeover offer is in our best interest and the best interests of our shareholders. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control. The provisions also could diminish the opportunities for a holder of our common stock to participate in tender offers, including tender offers at a price above the then-current price for our common stock. These provisions could also prevent transactions in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices, and may limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. The Michigan Business Corporation Act contains provisions intended to protect shareholders and prohibit or discourage certain types of hostile takeover activities. In addition to these provisions and the provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws, Federal law requires the Federal Reserve Board's approval prior to acquisition of "control" of a bank holding company. All of these provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control at the company level without action by our shareholders, and therefore, could adversely affect the price of our common stock. If an entity holds as little as a 5% interest in our outstanding securities, that entity could, under certain circumstances, be subject to regulation as a "bank holding company." Any entity, including a "group" composed of natural persons, owning or controlling with the power to vote 25% or more of our outstanding securities, or 5% or more if the holder otherwise exercises a "controlling influence" over us, may be subject to regulation as a "bank holding company" in accordance with the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC Act"). In addition, (i) any bank holding company or foreign bank with a U.S. presence may be required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board under the BHC Act to acquire or retain 5% or more of our outstanding securities and (ii) any person not otherwise defined as a company by the BHC Act and its implementing regulations may be required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board under the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, to acquire or retain 10% or more of our outstanding securities. Becoming a bank holding company imposes statutory and regulatory restrictions and obligations, such as providing managerial and financial strength for its bank subsidiaries. Regulation as a bank holding company could require the holder to divest all or a portion of the holder's investment in our securities or those nonbanking investments that may be deemed impermissible or incompatible with bank holding company status, such as a material investment in a company unrelated to banking.
