Item 1A. Risk Factors The risks described below could materially affect TRH’s business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. The occurrence of severe catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on TRH’s financial condition, results of operations and operating cash flows. Because TRH underwrites property and casualty reinsurance and has large aggregate exposures to natural and man-made disasters, TRH expects that its loss experience will from time to time include infrequent events of great severity. The frequency and severity of catastrophe losses are inherently unpredictable. Consequently, the occurrence of losses from a severe catastrophe or series of catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on TRH’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Increases in the values and geographic concentrations of insured property and the effects of inflation have historically resulted in increased severity of industry losses in recent years, and TRH expects that those factors will increase the severity of catastrophe losses in the future. If TRH is required to increase its liabilities for loss reserves, TRH’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected. Significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to the ceding company and the reinsurer, and the ceding company’s payment of that loss and subsequent payments to the ceding company by the reinsurer. TRH is required by applicable insurance laws and regulations and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) to establish liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet for payment of losses and LAE that will arise in the future from its reinsurance products for losses that have occurred as of the balance sheet date. Under GAAP, TRH is not permitted to establish liabilities until an event occurs that may give rise to a loss. Once such an event occurs, liabilities are established in TRH’s financial statements for TRH’s losses, based upon estimates of losses incurred by the ceding companies. As a result, only liabilities applicable to losses incurred up to the reporting date may be established, with no allowance for the provision of a contingency reserve to account for unexpected future losses. Losses arising from future events will be estimated and recognized at the time the loss occurs. At any time, these liabilities may prove to be inadequate to cover TRH’s actual losses and LAE. To the extent these liabilities may be insufficient to cover actual losses or LAE, TRH will have to add to these liabilities and incur a charge to its earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on TRH’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. (See MD&A for further discussion of the risks and uncertainties related to loss reserves.) 20 If TRH’s risk management methods and pricing models are not effective, TRH’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. TRH’s property and casualty reinsurance contracts cover unpredictable events such as hurricanes, windstorms, hailstorms, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, fires, industrial explosions, freezes, riots, floods and other natural or man-made disasters, including those that may result from terrorist activity. TRH is also exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence that have the potential to accumulate to material amounts and affect multiple risks/programs and classes of business. TRH uses modeling techniques to manage certain of such risks to acceptable limits, although current techniques used to estimate the exposure may not accurately predict the probability of such an event nor the extent of resulting losses. In addition, TRH may purchase retrocession protection designed to limit the amount of losses that TRH may incur. Retrocession arrangements do not relieve TRH from its obligations to the insurers and reinsurers from whom it assumes business, and the failure of retrocessionnaires to honor their obligations could result in losses to TRH. Moreover, from time to time, market conditions may limit and in some cases prevent reinsurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance that they consider adequate for their risk management. It is likely that TRH will face more difficulty than in the past to obtain certain retrocession protection, and will also be required to pay higher prices for such protections than in the recent past. If TRH is unable to obtain retrocessional coverage in the amounts it desires or on acceptable terms, TRH’s capacity and appetite for risk could change, and TRH’s financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Various provisions of TRH’s contracts, such as limitations to or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum, may not be enforceable in the manner TRH intends, due to, among other things, disputes relating to coverage and choice of legal forum. Underwriting is a matter of judgment, involving important assumptions about matters that are inherently difficult to predict and beyond TRH’s control, and for which historical experience and probability analysis may not provide sufficient guidance. One or more catastrophic or other events could result in claims that substantially exceed TRH’s expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on TRH’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Increased competition could adversely affect TRH’s profitability. The property and casualty reinsurance industry is highly competitive in virtually all lines. TRH faces competition from new market entrants and from existing market participants that devote increasing amounts of capital to the types of business written by TRH. Over the past few years, generally increased market capacity, domestic and international merger and acquisition activity, and Lloyd’s of London, which has strengthened its capital base, and limited catastrophe activity in 2006, have added to competitive pressures. As a result of certain 2005 catastrophe events, namely, Hurricane Katrina, the insurance industry’s largest natural catastrophe loss ever, and two subsequent substantial hurricanes, existing insurers and reinsurers have been raising new capital and significant investments have been made in new insurance and reinsurance companies in Bermuda. The ultimate impact on the market of these events is uncertain. Competition in the types of reinsurance in which TRH is engaged is based on many factors, including the perceived overall financial strength of the reinsurer, the ratings of Best, S&P and Moody’s, the states or other jurisdictions where the reinsurer is licensed, accredited, authorized or can serve as a reinsurer, capacity and coverages offered, premiums charged, specific terms and conditions of the reinsurance offered, services offered, speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines of business underwritten. TRH competes in the United States and international reinsurance markets with numerous major international reinsurance companies and numerous domestic reinsurance companies, some of which have greater financial and other resources than TRH has. TRH’s competitors include independent reinsurance companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies, reinsurance departments of certain primary insurance companies, domestic and European underwriting syndicates and in some instances with government owned or subsidized facilities. Certain of these competitors have been operating for substantially longer than TRH has and have established long-term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry, which can be a significant competitive advantage. 21 Traditional reinsurers as well as capital market participants from time to time produce alternative products or reinsurance vehicles (such as reinsurance securitizations, catastrophe bonds, various derivatives such as swaps, and sidecars) that may compete with certain types of reinsurance, such as property catastrophe. Capital markets, including hedge funds, have become more active in assuming more reinsurance risk other than from investing in various companies. Numerous hedge funds have provided both pro rata and excess-of-loss reinsurance and retrocessional protections through captive companies or other alternative transactions on a fully collateralized basis for property and energy catastrophe business. Over time, these numerous initiatives could significantly affect supply, pricing and competition in the reinsurance industry. In December 2006, the Florida legislature adopted legislation, since signed into law, which directed the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund to more than double its catastrophe reinsurance fund limit. The rate for this coverage is mandated to be significantly below the prevailing market rate. The same law froze current property insurance rates and imposed a moratorium on policy non-renewals. Several other Southeast states have publicly indicated that they are considering similar proposals. While it is too early to make a prediction of the full impact of this law, given TRH’s historical participation in this market, TRH does not presently expect the impact of this legislation to materially reduce its premiums assumed as a result of the loss of some catastrophe excess-of-loss premiums covering Florida risks. However, this measure will likely reduce the demand for catastrophe reinsurance within the Florida market and may compel current market participants to seek greater participation and thus increase competition in other regions such as Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Coastal Mid-Atlantic and New England states. The property and casualty reinsurance business is historically cyclical, and TRH expects to experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable pricing. Historically, property and casualty reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results. Demand for reinsurance is influenced significantly by underwriting results of primary insurers and prevailing general economic and market conditions, all of which affect ceding companies’ decisions as to the amount or portion of risk that they retain for their own accounts and consequently reinsurance premium rates. The supply of reinsurance is related to prevailing prices, the levels of insured losses, and levels of industry surplus, among other factors, that, in turn, may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being earned in the reinsurance industry. In addition, the supply of reinsurance is affected by a reinsurer’s confidence in its ability to accurately assess the probability of expected underwriting outcomes, particularly as respects catastrophe losses. As a result, the property and casualty reinsurance business historically has been a cyclical industry, characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted favorable pricing. The cyclical trends in the industry and the industry’s profitability can also be affected significantly by volatile and unpredictable developments, including what TRH believes to be a trend of courts to grant increasingly larger awards for certain damages, changes in the political, social or economic environment, natural disasters (such as catastrophic hurricanes, windstorms, tornadoes, earthquakes and floods), man-made disasters (such as those arising from terrorist activities), fluctuations in interest rates, changes in the investment environment that affect market prices of and returns on investments and inflationary pressures that may tend to affect the size of losses experienced by primary insurers. TRH cannot predict whether market conditions will improve, remain constant or deteriorate. A return to unfavorable market conditions may affect TRH’s ability to write reinsurance at rates that it considers appropriate relative to the risk assumed. If TRH cannot write property and casualty reinsurance at appropriate rates, its ability to transact reinsurance business would be significantly and adversely affected. A downgrade in the ratings assigned to TRH’s operating subsidiaries could adversely affect TRH’s ability to write new business and may adversely impact TRH’s existing agreements. Best, S&P and Moody’s are generally considered to be significant rating agencies with respect to the evaluation of insurance and reinsurance companies. Ratings are used by ceding companies and reinsurance intermediaries as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of reinsurers. These ratings are subject to periodic review at the discretion of each respective rating agency 22 and may be revised downward or revoked at their sole discretion. Rating agencies also may increase their scrutiny of rated companies, revise their rating standards or take other action. In addition, a ceding company’s own rating may be adversely affected by a downgrade in the rating of its reinsurer or an affiliated company. Therefore, a downgrade of TRH’s rating may dissuade a ceding company from reinsuring with TRH and may influence a ceding company to reinsure with a competitor of TRH that has a higher financial strength rating. Best maintains a financial strength rating of A+ (Superior) and issuer credit ratings of aa on the Company’s major operating subsidiaries, TRC, Putnam and TRZ. The outlook for these ratings is stable. These financial strength ratings represent the second highest rating level and these issuer credit ratings represent the fourth highest rating level. S&P maintains counterparty credit and insurer financial strength ratings on each of TRC, Putnam and TRZ of AA (Very Strong). This rating is the fourth highest rating level. The outlook for the AA rating is presently negative, due to S&P’s view that Transatlantic’s operating performance has produced lower returns in recent years than would be expected at the AA rating level. While also describing the conditions that would contribute to a revision back to a stable outlook, S&P commented that if TRH’s operating results remain below S&P’s expectations, the group could be reviewed for possible downgrade. Moody’s maintains an insurance financial strength rating of Aa3 (Excellent) on TRC. The outlook for the rating is stable. This rating is the fourth highest rating level. The Company’s 5.75% senior notes due in 2015 are presently rated A2 by Moody’s and A- by S&P. The outlook for the Moody’s rating is stable and the outlook for the S&P rating is currently negative for the same reason discussed earlier. If these debt ratings were lowered, future borrowing costs, if any, may increase. Approximately 35% of TRH’s in-force treaty contracts as of December 31, 2006 permit the ceding company to cancel the contract if TRH is downgraded below a certain rating level, generally A-. Treaty business accounted for approximately 95% of TRH’s net premiums written in 2006. In addition, 11% of TRH’s in-force treaty contracts as of December 31, 2006 permit the ceding company to cancel the contract in the event of a significant decline in the statutory surplus of TRH’s principal operating subsidiary, TRC, generally of at least 20%. Contracts may contain one or both of the aforementioned contractual provisions, certain other cancellation triggers or other stipulations, such as a requirement to post collateral for all or a portion of TRH’s obligations under the contract. The two most significant reasons for contract cancellations are discussed in more detail above. Whether a ceding company would exercise any of these cancellation rights would depend on, among other factors, the reason and extent of such downgrade or surplus reduction, the prevailing market conditions and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage, among other factors. When a contract is cancelled on a “cut-off” basis, as opposed to a “run-off” basis, the liability of the reinsurer under policies which became effective under the treaty prior to the cancellation date of such treaty ceases with respect to losses resulting from events taking place on and after said cancellation date. Accordingly, unearned premiums on that business as of the cut-off date are returned to the ceding company, net of a proportionate share of the original ceding commission. In the accounting period of the cancellation effective date, the amount of unearned premiums returned would be recorded as a reduction of gross premiums written with a like reduction in gross unearned premiums with no effect on gross premiums earned. Thus, the canceling of a contract generally has future implications to TRH’s business but rarely affects premiums already earned. TRH cannot predict in advance the extent to which these cancellation rights would be exercised, if at all, or what effect such cancellations would have on TRH’s financial condition or future operations, but such effect potentially could be material. TRH may secure its obligations under its various reinsurance contracts using trusts and letters of credit. TRH may enter into agreements with ceding companies that require TRH to provide collateral for its obligations under certain reinsurance contracts with these ceding companies under various circumstances, including where TRH’s obligations to these ceding companies exceed negotiated thresholds. These thresholds may vary depending on TRH’s ratings and a downgrade of TRH’s ratings 23 or a failure to achieve a certain rating may increase the amount of collateral TRH is required to provide. TRH may provide the collateral by delivering letters of credit to the ceding company, depositing assets into trust for the benefit of the ceding company or permitting the ceding company to withhold funds that would otherwise be delivered to TRH under the reinsurance contract. The amount of collateral TRH is required to provide typically represents all or a portion of the obligations TRH may owe the ceding company, often including estimates made by the ceding company of IBNR claims. Since TRH may be required to provide collateral based on the ceding company’s estimate, TRH may be obligated to provide collateral that exceeds its estimates of the ultimate liability to the ceding company. These financial strength ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. As such, they may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances, including TRH’s relationship with AIG. Ratings may also be withdrawn at the request of TRH’s management. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The current investigations into certain non-traditional, or loss mitigation, insurance products and other legal matters could have a material adverse effect on TRH’s financial condition or results of operations. Various regulators including the United States Department of Justice (the “DOJ”), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the Office of the New York State Attorney General (the “NYAG”) and the NYS ID have been conducting investigations relating to certain insurance and reinsurance business practices, non-traditional insurance products and assumed reinsurance transactions within the industry and at AIG. In connection with these investigations, AIG requested that TRH, as a subsidiary of AIG, review its documents and practices, and TRH has cooperated with AIG in all such requests. On February 9, 2006, AIG announced that it has reached a resolution of claims and matters under investigation by the DOJ, SEC, NYAG and NYS ID. AIG stated that the settlements resolved investigations conducted by the SEC, NYAG and NYS ID against AIG and conclude negotiations with these authorities and the DOJ in connection with the accounting, financial reporting and insurance brokerage practices of AIG and its subsidiaries, as well as claims relating to the underpayment of certain workers compensation premium taxes and other assessments. As part of these settlements, AIG has agreed to retain, for a period of three years, an Independent Consultant who will conduct a review that will include, among other things, the adequacy of AIG’s internal controls over financial reporting, the policies, procedures and effectiveness of AIG’s regulatory, compliance and legal functions and the remediation plan that AIG has implemented as a result of its own internal review. TRH, as a subsidiary of AIG, will cooperate with the terms of the settlements that are applicable to TRH. In April 2005, TRH received subpoenas from the Insurance Departments of Florida and Georgia seeking information relating to finite insurance and reinsurance transactions. In addition, TRH has received a subpoena from the NYS ID seeking information relating to TRC’s relationship and transactions with Sunrise Professional Indemnity, Ltd., a foreign reinsurer providing reinsurance to TRC, and Gallagher Healthcare Insurance Services, Inc., a provider of insurance and risk management services to healthcare providers and a wholly owned subsidiary of Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., Inc. TRH has responded to these subpoenas and continues to cooperate with these regulatory requests. There have been no further inquiries concerning the matters raised by the subpoenas received from the States of Florida and Georgia. From time to time, TRH is contacted by regulators from states and other jurisdictions who have commenced investigations and/or inquiries into insurance and reinsurance industry practices as well as insurance brokerage practices. TRH has cooperated, and will continue to cooperate, with all these investigations, including by producing documents and other information in response to subpoenas. While TRH does not believe that any of these inquiries will have a material impact on TRH’s business or financial results, it is not possible to predict with any certainty at this time what impact, if any, these inquiries may have on TRH’s business or financial results. 24 TRH’s businesses are heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may reduce TRH’s profitability and limit its growth. The Company’s reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. This regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, as opposed to reinsurers and their stockholders and other investors, and relates to authorization to transact certain lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, investment limitations, underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of an insurance company’s business. In recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework in the U.S. has come under increased federal scrutiny, and some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance and reinsurance companies and insurance holding companies. Further, the NAIC and state insurance regulators are re-examining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to holding company regulations, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws. Any proposed or future legislation or NAIC initiatives may be more restrictive than current regulatory requirements or may result in higher costs. In October 2005, the European Council of Ministers, in an effort to create a uniform scheme of regulation for European domiciled reinsurers, adopted the Directive. The Directive is scheduled to be fully implemented by all EU member countries no later than October 2008. TRH operates in Europe by means of licensed branches and will not necessarily be impacted the same way as EU domiciled reinsurers. At the present time, it is not clear how the Directive will impact non-EU companies that operate in the European Market. It is possible that implementation, as respects non-EU reinsurers, will vary in each EU country and may manifest itself in the form of increased administrative costs and fees, organizational expenses related to required changes to operating structure and/or increased collateralization requirements. TRH’s offices that operate in jurisdictions outside the United States are subject to certain limitations and risks that are unique to foreign operations. In addition to licensing requirements, TRH’s international operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of local investment and other matters. International operations and assets held abroad may be adversely affected by political and other developments in foreign countries, including possibilities of tax changes, nationalization and changes in regulatory policy, as well as by consequences of hostilities and unrest. The risks of such occurrences and their overall effect upon TRH vary from country to country and cannot easily be predicted. In addition, TRH’s results of operations and net unrealized currency translation gain or loss (a component of accumulated other comprehensive income) are subject to volatility as the value of the foreign currencies fluctuate relative to the U.S. dollar. Regulations governing constitution of technical reserves and remittance balances in some countries may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets. TRH may be adversely affected by the impact of market volatility and interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation on its invested assets. TRH’s principal invested assets are fixed maturity investments, which are subject to the market risk of potential losses from adverse changes in interest rates and may also be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Depending on TRH’s classification of its investments as available- for-sale, trading or other, changes in the fair value of TRH’s securities are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and/or Statement of Operations. TRH’s investment portfolio is also subject to credit risk resulting from adverse changes in the issuers’ ability to repay the debt. These risks could materially adversely affect TRH’s results of operations and/or financial condition. A principal exposure to foreign currency risk is TRH’s obligation to settle claims in foreign currencies. The possibility exists that TRH may incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses as TRH ultimately settles claims required to be paid in foreign currencies. To mitigate this risk, TRH also maintains investments denominated in certain of the same major foreign currencies in which the claims payments will be made. To the extent TRH does not seek to hedge its foreign currency risk or hedges 25 prove ineffective, the resulting impact of a movement in foreign currency exchange rate could materially adversely affect TRH’s results of operations.
