DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Overview Current Technology Corporation (Current Technology or the Company) was incorporated as 310086 B.C. Ltd. under the Company Act of British Columbia on June 3, 1986, and began operations on April 21, 1987. On June 27, 2003 our shareholders approved a transfer in the Companys jurisdiction from British Columbia to the Federal Jurisdiction under the Canada Business Corporations Act. The continuance of the Company to the Canadian Business Corporations Act was completed May 13, 2004 under the name Current Technology Corporation/Corporation Technologie Au Courant. Our corporate offices are located at 1430 - 800 West Pender Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6C 2V6. Our phone number is 604-684-2727 and out website is: www.current-technology.com. As a result of our acquisition of our equity interest in Celevoke Inc. (Celevoke) (described below) at the end of our first fiscal quarter in 2008, we determined that we no longer qualified as a foreign private issuer under the rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. As such during our 2008 fiscal year we became subject to the full reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. For the past several years the Company has focused on the development and distribution of electrotherapeutic products. Specifically the Company has focused on ElectroTrichoGenesis (ETG or ETG Treatment) and CosmeticTrichoGenesis (CTG or CTG Mark 5) and collectively referred to as TrichoGenesis. The Company owns patents relating to the technology, methodology and design of its TrichoGenesis products. The Company has developed a patented electrotherapeutic device which reduces excessive hair loss and can also stimulate hair regrowth in those who suffer from androgenetic alopecia (common baldness). ElectroTrichoGenesis, or ETG Treatment, the regrowth of hair by means of electrical stimulation, is believed to promote the healing of hair follicles that are dormant, but not dead. Research has been conducted to expand the indications for ETG. For example, a single center pilot trial to assess the efficacy of ETG in the reduction of hair loss in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy has been completed with encouraging results. Psycho-Oncology, a peer reviewed medical journal, published the results in the May/June 2002 edition (p. 244-248). As described below, the Company has entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with an entity based in the United States for the placement on a revenue sharing basis of its TrichoGenesis platform products in the United States, Canada, South America (excluding Brazil), Europe and Russia. The Company is working in concert with its United States based distributor to attempt to lower the cost of ETG devices and CTG units by having non-proprietary components of the chair and hood manufactured in China. However, ETG treatments are presently available in a number of countries throughout the world, although it is not currently available in the United States. On January 31, 2008, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Celevoke. Under the agreement we were obligated to purchase 102 shares of Celevoke common stock in five installments for an aggregate purchase price of $2.5 million. We completed the acquisition on May 23, 2008 by making the final 4 installment payment. Through the end of our 2008 fiscal year we purchased an additional 55 shares of Celevoke common stock through various purchases, and as of December 31, 2008 our ownership interest in the voting stock of Celevoke was 61%. Subsequent to the end of our 2008 fiscal year we purchased an additional six shares of Celevoke common stock, and as of the date of this annual report the Company owns 62% of Celevokes voting stock. Celevoke is a non-exclusive distributor of a proprietary global positioning system (GPS) based asset tracking system developed by LunarEYE. The technology utilizes the integrated use of telecommunications and informatics to enable users to remotely monitor, track, control and protect a wide variety of asset classes such as, automobiles, and other motorized vehicles, shipping containers, covert vehicles used for law enforcement, and even people. This technology is referred to as Telematics. We believe that Celevoke has a number of attributes that may lead to success in the marketplace, subject to the Companys ability to continue to fund ongoing operations. These attributes include its technology and products, its non-exclusive worldwide license with the patent holder, a functioning network operations center and established relation ships with a number of channels of distribution. However, to date these attributes have not resulted in meaningful revenue and the Company operates at a significant loss. Going forward we expect that the Company will primarily focus on developing and promoting the GPS asset-tracking technology and products through Celevoke. However, the Company plans to continue efforts to develop and promote our TrichoGenesis products and technologies primarily through its relationship with the US based distributor. Ongoing Initiative  Hair Envy The Company has granted exclusive distribution rights in the United States for the TrichoGenesis platform products to Hair Envy, LLC (Hair Envy), located in Carpinteria, California. During Phase One, it was originally intended that a total of 10 CTG units would be delivered to selected salons and spas located primarily in the corridor between Santa Barbara and San Diego, California. The first five CTG units were delivered to a storage facility in Los Angeles, California during March 2007. Subsequent to crossing the US border, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed an administrative hold on the five units. The FDA released the administrative hold in June 2007 and Hair Envy placed four of the units in selected locations. The fifth unit was shipped to a manufacturer in China. Revenue for the first five CTGs was recognized during Q2 of 2007, after the units were released by the FDA.< /P> The agreement with Hair Envy is based on a revenue sharing model. The Company sells its units to Hair Envy at cost and they are placed in selected locations with retail revenue split three ways: the Company, Hair Envy and the retailer, normally a salon or spa. Working in concert with Hair Envy, the Company uses its proprietary communication technology, which is included in all operating units, to monitor usage. The revenue sharing model reduces revenue and gross profits in the short run (because the units are sold at cost), but may result in more revenue generation in the long run as utilization and therefore shared revenue grows over time. Under the revenue sharing model, both the Company and Hair Envy benefit from a lower manufacturing price, because more units can be placed into operation for the same capital investment. Therefore, the Company and Hair Envy concluded the appointment of an offshore manufacturer to manufacture all but the proprietary components of the TrichoGenesis platform products would be mutually beneficial. To that end, rather than purchase the second five units from the Company in Phase One, it was agreed multiple manufacturers prototypes would be built in China, with the objective of reducing significantly the cost of manufacturing all such products. The second round of prototype manufacturing is complete, and in June 2008 the Company inspected and approved the prototype. The next step prior to commencement of ongoing manufacturing in China was factory inspection conducted by Canadian Standards Association International as part of its certification process. The factory inspection and certification process was completed during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008. Now that the certification process is completed, we believe Hair Envy may order up to 200 units and roll out CTG nationally in the United States. However, the Company has no control over if or when such order may be placed. 5 The Company has contributed $17,000 of the revenue generated from the sale of the first five units to this prototyping process being conducted in China. In return, the Company has the right to purchase inventory from the manufacturer (at a price equal to cost plus fifteen percent) and sell that inventory in jurisdictions not covered by Hair Envys distribution agreement (which will initiate and pay for directly the manufacturing process in China). During the first fiscal quarter of 2009, the Company purchased three such units from Hair envy and sold them to its distributor in Korea. Hair Envy has paid the Company a balance of $20,500 for the first five units, pursuant to its agreement. On July 30, 2007, recognizing that Hair Envy is negotiating with a number of companies in the salon and spa space that have significant international operations, the Company granted Hair Envy exclusive distribution rights to Canada, South America (excluding Brazil), Europe and Russia. The expanded relationship is based on the United States revenue sharing agreement, with certain adjustments to reflect the more complex nature of international operations. As a result of the expanded territory granted to Hair Envy, the Company is no longer seeking financing for its wholly owned subsidiary Current Technology (UK) Ltd., which has not commenced material operations. On February 12, 2007, the Company issued warrants to Hair Envy to purchase 2,500,000 common shares, exercisable at $0.125 per share for five years, with the following vesting provisions: 750,000 upon issuance; 750,000 upon payment of the tenth unit; and 1,000,000 upon ordering of 200 units. The warrants have a cashless exercise provision; 750,000 warrants are vested to date; 750,000 have been exercised; and 1 million are non-vested. The exercise price of the remaining warrants is $0.10 per share. On-Going Initiatives  TrichoGenesis Products TrichoGenesis platforms are operating in 13 countries around the world: Canada, United States*, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand Poland, Cyprus, Turkey and Kuwait. [* Denotes CosmeticTrichoGenesis units; the balance are ElectroTrichoGenesis devices] As noted above, the Company has granted Hair Envy exclusive distribution rights to Canada, South America (excluding Brazil), Europe and Russia. Although Hair Envy advises there are ongoing negotiations with organizations in the salon and spa space with international reach, its primary focus has been preliminary introduction of CTG in California and working with a manufacturer in China to dramatically reduce the capital cost of the units. Therefore there has been no meaningful commercial activity resulting in revenue to the Company from areas outside of the United States which are a part of Hair Envys exclusive territory. With respect to areas outside of Hair Envys territory, the Company continued to work reasonably effectively with its distributor in Turkey. Although no additional territory was granted, the distributor continues to express the desire to expand its reach into the Gulf St ates, Eastern Mediterranean and the stan countries in the Caspian Sea region. The Korean Food and Drug Administration approval process has been completed, at the expense of a Korean distributor of cosmetic and medical devices. The distributor in Mexico continues to operate at a reasonably steady pace. Activity in the other countries can only be described as modest at best. The formal medical approval process is also underway in Argentina. 6 On-going Initiatives  Spy-N-Tell On April 26, 2007 the Company announced the formation of its Security and Safety Products Division (the Division) and the launching by way of a 50-50 joint venture (the JV) with the Real Security Company Ltd. (TRSC), a private company located in Kelowna, British Columbia, of the Divisions first product, Spy-N-TellTM. The product has not generated the level of market acceptance originally anticipated, and the Company has no plans to expend further resources on the project. The Company issued TRSC warrants to purchase up to 5 million common shares of the Company at $0.12 per share (market price at the time of issuance) subject to certain amended vesting provisions. The Company must earn $11.5 million from the JV in order for the 5 million warrants to be fully vested. The Company does not believe any of the warrants will be vested. New Initiative  Celevoke On January 31, 2008, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with Celevoke, of Liberty, Texas. Under the agreement, the Company was obligated to purchase 102 shares of Celevoke common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $2,500,000. The 102 shares were to be purchased in four installments of 20 shares each and a fifth installment of 22 shares. On May 23, 2008, the Company purchased the final installment of 22 shares and became the owner of 51% of the voting stock of Celevoke. As described above, through additional purchases of Celevoke common stock as of December 31, 2008 we owned 61% of the voting stock of Celevoke, and as of the date of this annual report we now own 62% of Celevokes voting stock. The Company issued the three principals of Celevoke performance based options an aggregate of 50 million Company shares at $0.14 per share, subject to the following vesting provisions (12.5 million vested on closing of the securities purchase agreement): Cumulative Net Pre-Tax Profit of Celevoke up to and including June 30, 2010 Cumulative Options to be Vested $1,000,000 3,750,000 $2,000,000 7,500,000 $3,000,000 11,250,000 $4,000,000 15,000,000 $5,000,000 18,750,000 $6,000,000 22,500,000 $7,000,000 26,250,000 $8,000,000 30,000,000 $9,000,000 33,750,000 $10,000,000 37,500,000 7 To facilitate the Celevoke transaction, on January 10, 2008 we entered into a securities purchase agreement with MSGI Securities Solutions Inc. ("MSGI") whereby MSGI agreed to purchase 25 million Company units at a price of $0.10 per unit for a total of $2.5 million, payable at the rate of $500,000 agreed upon installment dates. Each unit consisted of one share of Company common stock and one warrant to acquire one share of Company common stock. As partial consideration for the $2.5 million investment which was to be paid on a pre-determined time line, we agreed to negotiate additional agreements to outsource 25% of the GPS asset-tracking business to MSGI for a period of three years and for Celevoke to grant MSGI a non-exclusive worldwide license. None of these ancillary agreements were negotiated and the last $500,000 payment was not made by MSGI. As a result on May 22, 2008, the Company informed MSGI that it believed MSGI lost any right to purchase the final 5.0 million units, and also lost certain other benefits it was to obtain when it entered into the MSGI agreement. On May 23, 2008, the Company raised $500,000 through a separate third party and used the funds to make the final $500,000 payment to complete the Companys acquisition of the initial 51% interest in Celevoke. Celevoke has integrated Telematics and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) with sensing technology. This proprietary suite of hardware and software products enables users to remotely monitor, track, control and protect a wide variety of asset classes. Examples include people, automobiles and trucks, shipping containers and covert vehicles used for law enforcement and intelligence gathering in a global marketplace. Celevoke operates a Network Operations Center in California management believes is capable of handling millions of customers. Celevoke has entered into a non-exclusive worldwide license with LunarEYE, Inc. (LunarEYE), giving Celevoke the right to manufacture, market and sell its proprietary suite of Telematics products. Chuck Allen is CEO of both LunarEYE and Celevoke. Historically, LunarEYE sold its products into the marketplace. However, Chuck Allen has confirmed LunarEYE is now focused on its role as a patent holder, and is no longer directly manufacturing, marketing or selling its products. Relationships with prior and potential customers are, therefore, being exploited by Celevoke. During fiscal 2008 the Company focused primarily on developing and promoting the GPS based asset-tracking technology and products offered through Celevoke. The Company expects the business conducted by and through Celevoke may be our primary focus going forward, subject to the Companys ability to fund ongoing operations. However as described above, during fiscal 2008 the Company did continue its efforts to develop and promote our TrichoGenesis products and technologies. During fiscal 2008 the Company through Celevoke engaged in a range of activities to promote, develop and distribute Celevokes GPS based asset-tracking technology and products, including: · Working on initiatives with major insurance companies and credit unions to incorporate and utilize Celevokes asset tracking and control systems. · On May 5, 2008, Celevoke, acquired 521 common shares of Star One Telematica S/A (Star One), a company incorporated under the laws of Brazil to immediately market and sell Celevoke's proprietary Telematics solutions to the automotive market in Brazil. Star One is 51% owned by Celevoke and 49% owned by Templar Investment & Acquisitions B.V. (Templar). During the 2008 fiscal year StarOne engaged in a range of activities to try to develop and promote asset tracking products and technologies in Brazil and entered into certain agreements for the sale of such products. However, subsequent to December 31, 2008 Celevoke indefinitely discontinued supporting StarOnes operations as a result of an inability to adequately fund it. The major retail rollout previously announced in December 2008 has been indefinitely suspended. In a further development, a recent Supreme Court decision i n Brazil brings into question the governments ability to force new vehicle owners to employ tracking systems. This decision has the potential to dramatically alter the original business case for involvement in Brazil. That is, if the government cannot force new vehicle owners to employ tracking systems, the perceived value and potential of the Brazilian market may be dramatically reduced. 8 · The appointment of distribution channel partners. · In September 2008, Celevoke expanded its management team and appointed new persons to serve in management and senior level sales, marketing and business development positions. Unfortunately, the level of sales activity actually generated has been extremely low. In fairness it must be recognized the negative state of the economy leading to a reduction in the level of business activity, and in particular the dramatic reductions in automobile sales, was a contributing factor. However, given the anticipated performance of the team, actual results were unsatisfactory. Therefore, in April 2009, in order to reduce costs Celevoke initiated material layoffs of both management and sales personnel. While the initial plan was to build a management and sales infrastructure ultimately capable of supporting a national rollout in the United States, the revised post-layoff plan is to focus on Celevokes home market of Texas with particular emphasis on Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth and San Antonio/Austin. Under the supervision of CEO Chuck Allen, the newly streamlined team is making direct calls on automobile dealerships presenting Celevokes proprietary technology as a new profit center. Initial results are encouraging, and management believes the new approach may represent a meaningful first step along the path to Celevoke achieving a break even position. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2008, Celevoke continued the development of its previously announced NextGen Tracking System. Celevoke has been working with world class partners on the joint development of an advanced next generation anti-theft device and tracking system which management believes is superior to anything available in the market today. With components supplied by Trimble and Wavecom, the fully automotive grade product features an extremely low power draw which we believe will be of significant interest to manufacturers of powersports equipment, including motorcycles. Management further believes the new product may provide Celevoke access to the OEM market in the United States and other parts of the world. The Company began to recognize revenues through Celevoke in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Going forward the Company is hopeful it can continue to grow the business operations and revenues through Celevoke, subject to the Companys ability to fund ongoing operations. However, it must be recognized the Companys lack of cash resources and possible loss of continuity with existing customers and channel partners, including insurance companies, credit unions and others is potentially problematic. There can be no assurance that Celevokes business operations will ultimately be successful or generate sufficient revenues by a given time, given the lack of funding, results to date and state of the financial markets. Competition With regard to its TrichoGenesis products the Company potentially competes with a number of products within the industry in the form of lasers, lotions, creams, pills, surgical intervention(hair transplants) and hair replacement systems (wigs and toupees). These products are produced by a range of companies from major pharmaceutical companies with greater resources than the Company such as Merck Co. Inc. (Propecia™) and Pharmacia & Upjohn International (Rogaine™) to local purveyors of folk remedies. With regard to the GPS products produced by and through Celevoke the Company competes with existing companies that produce asset tracking technology and products, many of whom such as LoJack Corporation, have significantly greater resources than the Company. Patents, trademarks, and licenses We own and maintain a portfolio of intellectual property assets which we hope to continue to build. We believe that our intellectual property assets create great value to the Company and therefore we are taking steps to protect those assets through trademark, copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws of the United States and through contractual agreements. In addition to 4 issued patents in the United States, there are 6 issued in 6 countries including Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The Company is most reliant upon its United States patents for future growth. Design patents and/or industrial design registrations have been granted in 12 countries including the 9 United States and European countries, amongst others. Trademarks protecting both the stylized CTC and ETG logos have been granted in 26 countries. Further Trademarks protecting ElectroTrichoGenesis, CosmeticTrichoGenesis and the CTG logo have been granted in Japan and the European Union (25 countries) with CosmeticTrichoGenesis being granted in the United States. As described above effective as of December 31, 2006 Celevoke entered into a non-exclusive worldwide license with LunarEYE giving Celevoke the right to manufacture, market and sell its proprietary suite of Telematics products. This agreement is for an initial eight year term. As the Company focuses on developing and promoting the GPS asset-tracking technology and products through Celevoke, we will be dependent on this license agreement. Effect of existing or probable government regulations on the Companys business. The FDA and the FTC regulate the form, content and dissemination of labeling, advertising and promotional materials of pharmaceutical or medical device companies, including direct-to-consumer prescription drug and medical device advertising. The FTC regulates over-the-counter drug advertising and, in some cases, medical device advertising. Generally, based on FDA requirements, companies must limit advertising materials to discussions of FDA-approved uses and claims. The marketing of the Companys TrichoGenesis is subject to regulatory authorities in the United States, including but not limited to the FDA and FTC. In July 1994, the FDA advised that on the basis of its review of the PMA, certain deficiencies existed which caused the FDA to determine its review could not continue. The Company believed that it could address the majority of the deficiencies, but it could not provide the further data to support safety and efficacy for prolonged use within the response period required by the FDA. As a result the Company elected to voluntarily withdraw the PMA. No ETG sales or marketing can take place in the US unless and until FDA approval is obtained. The Company has no current plans to commence the formal FDA approval process. In January 1995 the Company was advised by Health Canada (Health Protection Branch) that it was satisfied with the notification materials submitted for the ETG device. Health Canada's acceptance of notification materials is the final regulatory procedural step required for marketing a medical device in Canada. The notification materials include Device Monograph, Directions for Use, Labels and Operator's Manual. In addition to clearing the way for marketing in Canada, the Canadian Health Protection Branch acceptance is assisting in obtaining health regulatory approvals in other jurisdictions. Amongst others, the health regulatory authorities in Mexico, Chile, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Korea and Turkey have cleared the ETG device for sale as a medical device. In addition, the CE Marking of Conformity Medical Devices provides coverage in Europe and many other countries around the world with the exception of the United States. The CTG Mark 5 has been issued the following: i) CSA International Certificate of Compliance as a Class 3872 81 Hygiene and Cosmetic Appliance certified to US standards. Date of reissue November 6, 2008. ii) CSA International CB Test Certificate under IEC 60335-1. Date of reissue February 6, 2009. 10 Manufacturing: ElectroTrichoGenesis Mark 1 The ETG Mark 1 has been issued the following: i) KEMA Quality B.V. CE Marking of Conformity Medical Devices. The certificate is valid until February 2012 and the Company successfully completed a renewal audit March 20, 2008. ii) CSA International Certificate of Compliance as Class 8750 01 and Class 8750 81 medical electrical equipment. Date of issue October 17, 2008. iii) CSA International CB Test Certificate under IEC 60601-1. Date of issue December 3, 2008. iv) KEMA  Registered Quality Inc. ISO 13485:2003. The certificate is valid until February 25, 2012. Health Regulatory: ElectroTrichoGenesis Mark 1 The ETG Mark 1 has been approved as a medical device in the following countries: Canada, New Zealand, Mexico, Chile, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Korea and Turkey. In addition, the CE Marking of Conformity Medical Devices provides coverage in the European Community and many other countries around the world, with the exception of the United States. The formal medical approval process is underway in Argentina, at the expense of the in country operators. Research and Development During the last two fiscal years research and development expenses for our TrichoGenesis platform products were as set forth in the following table: Year ended December 31, Research and development expenses 2008 $37,339 2007 $56,987 Significant Customers The Companys major operations currently relate to the sales of GPS Telematics devices and services as well as sales and royalties charged on TrichoGenesis platform products. The Companys revenue by region is as follows: 2008 2007 Asia Pacific $98,185 $23,511 Europe 13,793 158,787 The Americas 395,176 94,282 $507,154 $276,580 The Company had three major customers which in aggregate accounted for approximately 64% of our 2008 revenue. These customers accounted for 18%, 19% and 27% of the Companys total revenues during 11 fiscal 2008 respectively. Two of these customers (representing 19% and 27 of our total revenues) were customers through Celevoke, whereas one customer (representing 18% of our total 2008 revenues) purchased a significant portion of our remaining TrichoGenesis products. We do not expect the customer who purchased the significant amount of our TrichoGenesis products in fiscal 2008 to purchase a significant amount of products from the Company during fiscal 2009. However, a significant reduction in sales to any of the large Celevoke customers would have a material adverse effect on the Company by reducing our revenues. Present or future customers could terminate their purchasing patterns with us or significantly change, reduce or delay the amount of products or services ordered from us. Employees As of April 15, 2009 we have five employees, four of which are full time. As of April 15, 2009 Celevoke had four employees, three of which are full time. ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS Our securities are highly speculative and involve a high degree of risk, including among other items the risk factors described below. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS Due to Our History of Operating Losses, We are Uncertain That We Will Be Able to Maintain Sufficient Cash to Accomplish Our Business Objectives. The Company incurred a net loss of $8,812,744 for the year ended December 31, 2008 (2007:$1,548,152). The Company has reported recurring losses since inception which have resulted in an accumulated deficit of $37,473,039 at December 31, 2008 (2007:$ 28,660,295). The Company has relied, and will likely continue to rely, on debt and/or equity financing and/or the sale of certain rights for consideration including cash. There is no certainty that additional debt and/or equity financing and/or arrangements for the sale of rights will be available on reasonable terms or at all. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the receipt of additional financing and /or proceeds on the sale of assets and ultimately its ability to generate sufficient cash from operations and financing sources to meet obligations as they come due. Any inability to obtain additional financing when needed and/or the loss of a material contract would have a material adverse effect on the Company, including possibly requiring the Company to significantly reduce or possibly cease its operations. If the Company was unable to continue as a going concern, material adjustments would be required to the carrying value of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and the balance sheet classifications used. There is no certainty that our key project will be operationally successful or profitable. Going forward we will be highly dependent upon the success of the promotion and distribution of products utilizing the GPS asset-tracking technology distributed by Celevoke. Although we believe that there may be a large demand for this technology, if that demand does not materialize to the extent that we project or we are not successful in promoting and distributing our technology this will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial results. Currently, we are unable to proceed with our original Celevoke business plan due to a lack of funding and lack of sales. Celevoke is proceeding with a Texas-based, rather than national, strategy having significantly reduced staff and ultimately overhead. The objective is to grow organically and achieve breakeven as quickly as possible. If this new strategy is not successful, the Celevoke business plan is in jeopardy of failing. 12 Disruptions in the Global Financial and Capital Markets May Impact Our Ability to Obtain Financing. The global financial and capital markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption, including the failures of financial services companies and the related liquidity crisis. We can not meet our near term liquidity needs with our working capital on hand. Therefore, we will continue to need further funding to achieve our business objectives. In the past, the issuance of equity securities has been the major source of capital and liquidity for us. The extraordinary conditions in the global financial and capital markets have currently limited the availability of this funding. If the disruptions in the global financial and capital markets continue, debt or equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to fund future operations by way of financing, including public or private offerings of equity or debt securities, our business, financial condition and results of opera tions will be adversely impacted. We identified material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management to assess our internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) pursuant to a defined framework. In making that assessment, management identified a material weakness in our disclosure controls as a result of several material weaknesses identified in our ICFR as described in Item 9A below. There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control, and accordingly, even effective ICFR can provide only reasonable assurance with respect of financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Material weaknesses make it more likely that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. In addition, effective ICFR at any point in time may become ineffective in future periods because of changes in conditions or due to deter ioration in the degree of compliance with our established policies and procedures. Our current business plan contemplates significant expansion, which we may be unable to manage. To the extent that we are successful in implementing our business strategy, we may experience periods of rapid expansion in the future. If demand for any of our products grows suddenly, we may lack the resources to meet demand or we may be required to increase our capital spending significantly. Our ability to manage growth effectively will require us to continue to implement and improve our management, operational and financial information systems, and will require us to develop the management skills of our personnel and to train, motivate and manage our employees. Our failure to effectively manage growth could increase our costs of operations and reduce our margins and liquidity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 13 Our growth depends in part on the development, production and market acceptance of new products which we cannot assure will happen successfully. To become and remain competitive in our industries we must support and enhance our existing products and develop new products in response to market demands. Product development involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty due to unforeseen difficulties and costs. We may not be successful in developing, marketing and releasing new products that we believe are necessary to respond to technological developments, evolving industry standards or changing customer requirements. In addition, our new product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. If the release date of any future products or enhancements is delayed, or if these products or enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance when released, our revenue may decrease, we may not be able to recover our costs and our competitive position may be harmed. Any negative impact on the sales, licensing and marketing efforts of our products would adversely affect our business and results of operations. Going forward we believe our business will primarily depend on the sale, licensing and market acceptance of GPS tracking-related products and technologies distributed through Celevoke, which is now more difficult given the lack of sales by Celevoke and the necessity to write-off its investment in Brazil. Because going forward our revenue will primarily be dependent on the success of these products and technologies, and any factor affecting their marketability could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Factors that could harm the successful sale and licensing of the products and services include, among others: · If automobile dealers, equipment manufacturers and owners, insurance carriers, do not purchase, incorporate, or emphasize our products; · If we are unable to establish a market for our products and technologies in certain countries; · If our foreign licensees are unable to establish a market for our products and technologies in their jurisdictions; · If we are unable to develop enhancements to our products and technologies as required by market demand; · If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights; · If one or more of our competitors introduces a product or system that makes our products and technologies obsolete or ineffective; or · If third parties are able to locate or impair the function of Celevokes products and technologies in vehicles and other equipment that adversely affects the functionality or purpose of the technology and products. If our competitors or manufacturers develop products, systems or technologies that make our products less competitive or obsolete, our business would be harmed. In recent years, the number of companies developing and marketing wireless communications and GPS products that have security applications used directly in vehicles and other equipment has expanded considerably. We compete with other makers of stolen vehicle and item recovery devices. We believe we also face competition from all products which are sold by automobile dealers and others manufacturers in the after-market space, including makers of vehicle and equipment security devices, GPS products and navigation systems. 14 Several competitors or potential competitors are marketing, or have announced the development of, competitive vehicle recovery systems and products aimed at our target market. In addition, we believe that new market entrants may attempt to develop a system of theft detection or recovery that may be directly competitive with our products. Some of our existing or potential competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, service and support resources than we have and, as a result, are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their systems and products than we are able to devote to our systems and products. Competitive pressures could cause us to lose market share and require us to reduce our prices, which could reduce profit margins. This could cause a decline in our revenue and adversely affect our operating results. We cannot ensure that we will be able to compete successfully against existing companies or new entrants to the marketplace. We operate in new and rapidly evolving markets where rapid technological change can quickly make products, including those that we offer, obsolete. The markets we operate in are subject to rapid advances in technology, continuously evolving industry standards and regulatory requirements, and ever-shifting customer requirements. The machine to machine (M2M) wireless data communications field, in particular, is currently undergoing profound and rapid technological change. To become and remain competitive, we support research and development efforts intended to bring new products to the markets that we serve. However, those efforts may be capital intensive. If we are unable to adequately fund our research and development efforts, we may not be successful in keeping our product line current with advances in technology and evolving customer requirements. Even with adequate funding, our development efforts may not yield any appreciable short-term results and may never result in products that produce revenues over and above our cumulative development costs or that gain traction in the marketplace, causing us to either lose market share or fail to increase and forego increased sales and revenues as a result. We are dependent on a number of third party network service providers, manufacturers and suppliers of our products and product components, the loss of any one of which could adversely impact our ability to service or supply our customers. The loss or disruption of key telecommunications infrastructure services and key wireless network services supplied to the Company would unfavorably impact our business model and ability to adequately service our customers. We outsource the manufacturing of our products to independent companies and do not have internal manufacturing capabilities to meet the demands of our customers. Any delay, interruption, or termination of the manufacture of our products could harm our ability to provide our products to our customers and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. The manufacture of our products requires specialized know-how and capabilities possessed by a limited number of enterprises. Consequently, we are reliant on suppliers for the manufacture of key products and product components. If a key supplier experiences production problems or financial difficulties, we may not be able to obtain enough units to meet demand, which could result in failure to meet our contractual commitments to our customers, further causing us to lose sales and generate less revenue. If any of our products or product components contain significant manufacturing defects that the existing manufacturer or supplier is unable to resolve, we could also have difficulty locating a suitable alternative manufacturer or supplier. Related efforts to design replacement products or product components could also take longer and prove costlier than planned, resulting in lost sales and reduced. 15 We operate internationally, which subjects us to international regulation and business uncertainties that create additional risk for us. We are currently doing business in, or have done business in, a range of countries including Canada, the United States, Mexico and Brazil. Accordingly, we are subject to additional risks, such as: · Export control requirements, including restrictions on the export of technology and products; · Currency exchange fluctuations; · Potentially longer receivable collection periods and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; · Trade restrictions and tariffs; and · Difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. In addition, the laws of certain countries do not protect our hardware as much as the laws of the United States, which may lead to the potential loss of our proprietary technology through theft, piracy or a failure to protect our rights. The combination of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and, consequently, on our business and results of operations. Certain of our products are subject to regulatory approval and if we fail to obtain FDA approval, we cannot market certain products in the United States. The Company has commenced marketing its cosmetic product CTG in the United States. The marketing of CTG is subject to regulatory authorities in the United States, including but not limited to the FDA and FTC. These agencies may seek to limit or deny the Company the ability to market CTG as a cosmetic product. The Company must also receive regulatory approval to market its medical product ETG in the United States. The Company has not applied, and does not intend to apply, for such regulatory approval in the United States. Consequently, there can be no guarantee as to either if, or when, such approval may be obtained. Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our brand image and harm our business and our operating results. The Companys success will partially depend on its ability to obtain and enforce patents relating to the technology and to protect trade secrets. Further patents may not be available. In addition, third parties may challenge, narrow, invalidate or circumvent the Companys patents. The patent position of medical device companies is generally highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has recently been the subject of much litigation. Neither the U.S. Patent Office nor the courts have a consistent policy regarding breadth of claims allowed or the degree of protection afforded under many device patents. 16 In an effort to protect its unpatented proprietary technology, processes and know-how, the Companys employees and consultants are often required to execute confidentiality agreements. However, these agreements may not provide adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information. These agreements may be breached, and the Company may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, in some situations, these agreements may conflict, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom employees or consultants have previous employment or consulting relationships. Also, others may independently develop substantial proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to the Companys trade secrets. The Company intends to market its products in many different countries. In some of those, patents may not be held nor applied for. Different countries have different patent rules and the Company may sell in countries that do not honor patents and in which the risk of product copying would be greater. We risk exposing ourselves product liability claims, which could adversely affect our working capital, shareholders equity and profitability. The Companys business exposes it to potential product liability risks, which are inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of medical and/or cosmetic products. While the Company will take precautions it deems to be appropriate to avoid product liability suits against it, there can be no assurance that it will be able to avoid significant product liability exposure. Product liability insurance is generally expensive to the extent it is available at all. The Company has not yet obtained product liability coverage. There can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such coverage on acceptable terms, or that any insurance policy will provide adequate protection against potential claims. A successful product liability claim brought against the Company may exceed any insurance coverage secured by the Company, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results or ability to continue marketing its products. TrichoGenesis products have historically been negatively perceived by the general public. Historically, consumers held negative perceptions for hair restoration products or processes. While the Company has developed a reasonable strategy for responding to this perception, there can be no assurance that widespread acceptance of the Companys technology can be achieved. We are dependent on our key personnel, and the loss of any could adversely affect our business. We depend on the continued performance of the members of our management team, particularly Robert Kramer. If we lose the services of Mr. Kramer, and are unable to locate suitable replacement(s) for Mr. Kramer in a timely manner, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not have, and we do not expect to obtain, key man life insurance for any members of management in the foreseeable future. RISKS RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES We will require additional capital in the future and we cannot assure you that capital will be available on reasonable terms, if at all, or on terms that would not cause substantial dilution to your stock holdings. 17 We have a history of operating losses and have depended on funds raised through the sale of equity and debt securities to maintain our operations. We will need to raise additional funds to continue our operations. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any sale of a substantial number of additional shares may cause dilution to your investment and could also cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We do not plan to pay dividends on our common stock. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends to the holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, investors in our common stock must rely upon subsequent sales after price appreciation as the sole method to realize a gain on an investment in our common stock. There are no assurances that the price of our common stock will ever appreciate in value particularly if we continue to sustain operating losses. Investors seeking cash dividends should not buy our common stock. We currently have a limited trading market as there is limited liquidity on the OTC Bulletin Board which may impact your ability to sell your shares. Currently our shares of our Common Stock are traded on the NASD  OTC Bulletin Board. However, there is limited trading volume in our shares. When fewer shares of a security are traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, price volatility may increase and price movement may outpace the ability of the OTC Bulletin Board to deliver accurate quote information. If low trading volumes in our common stock continue, there may be a lower likelihood of orders for shares of our common stock being executed, and current prices may differ significantly from prices quoted by the OTC Bulletin Board at the time of order entry. Our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules which will limit the market for our common stock and increase the cost of sale because of additional broker compensation. Because our stock is traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, if the market price of the common stock is less than $5.00 per share, the common stock is classified as a penny stock. SEC Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that recommend the purchase or sale of penny stocks to persons other than those who qualify as an established customer or an accredited investor. This includes the requirement that a broker-dealer must make a determination that investments in penny stocks are suitable for the customer and must make special disclosures to the customers concerning the risk of penny stocks. Many broker-dealers decline to participate in penny stock transactions because of the extra requirements imposed on penny stock transactions. Application of the penny stock rules to our common stock reduces the market liquidity of our shares, which in turn affec ts the ability of holders of our common stock to resell the shares they purchase, and they may not be able to resell at prices at or above the prices they paid. There may be a greater risk of fraud on the NASD-OTC Bulletin Board. OTC Bulletin Board securities are frequently targets for fraud or market manipulation because they are not regulated as closely as securities listed on exchanges. Dealers may dominate the market and set prices that are not based on competitive forces. Individuals or groups may create fraudulent markets and control the sudden, sharp increase of price and trading volume and the equally sudden collapse of market prices. While there is regulation of the NASD-OTC Bulletin Board, it is not as comprehensive as the regulation of the listed exchange. If this should occur, the value of an investment in our common stock could decline significantly. 18 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not Applicable.
