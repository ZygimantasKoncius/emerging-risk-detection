RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this report on Form 10-K. An investment in our common stock is very risky. If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. In such an event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment. We are a company engaged exclusively in research and development activities, focusing primarily on human biology and medicine. When used in these risk factors, the terms "we" or "our" refer to Mymetics Corporation and its subsidiaries. Our strategy was crafted in part to minimize the risks usually associated with clinical trials, regulatory approvals and marketing, which we would expect to be borne by our future partner(s). WE HISTORICALLY HAVE LOST MONEY AND EXPECT LOSSES TO CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, WHICH MEANS THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS UNLESS WE OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FUNDING. i We historically have lost money. In the year ended December 31, 2005, we sustained net losses of approximately E1,939,000. In the years ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, we sustained net losses of approximately E 2,202,000 and E 2,786,000, respectively. We currently are engaged in research and development activities and do not have any commercially marketable products. The product research and development process requires significant capital expenditures, and we do not have any other sources of revenue to off-set such expenditures. Accordingly, we expect to generate additional operating losses at least until such time as we are able to generate significant revenues. If we are unable to draw down on the Standby Equity Distribution Agreement provided by Cornell Capital or find alternative financing on commercially reasonable terms or generate revenue from the sale of products, we could be forced to curtail or cease our operations. At December 31, 2005, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately E14,087,000. Total cash disbursed since 1990 for operating activities, including Research and Development, is E 8,901,000. In order to become profitable, we will need to generate revenues to off-set our operating costs, including our general and administrative expenses. We may not achieve or sustain our revenue or profit objectives, and our losses may increase in the future, and, ultimately, we may have to cease operations. Our operating results are impossible to predict, because we have not begun selling any products. As a result, we cannot determine if we will be successful in our proposed plan of operation. Accordingly, we cannot determine what the future holds for our proposed plan of business. As such, an investment in our business is extremely risky and could result in the entire loss of your investment. OUR LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE OR PREDICT OUR FUTURE BUSINESS PROSPECTS. We have no operating history. We are in the development stage, and our proposed operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in establishing a new business enterprise. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays frequently encountered in connection with the formation of a new business, the development of new technology, and the competitive and regulatory environment in which we will operate. We have made no material sales to date and have accumulated a net deficit from inception through December 31, 2006 of approximately Euro 14 million. It is likely that additional losses will be incurred in the future. See "Description of the Business" and "Plan of Operations." IF WE CANNOT DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS, WE CANNOT COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN THE MARKETPLACE. Our key products still are in the development stage. See "Business - Where Are We and Where Are We Going?". While we are pleased about the progress made to date on these products, we cannot be sure that these products in development will be completed or, if completed, will be commercially viable. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST CURRENT AND FUTURE COMPETITORS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR FUTURE SALES OF PRODUCTS. A few companies currently compete with us in the market for our products. Some of these companies have far greater capital, marketing, and other resources than we do. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that these or other firms will not develop new or enhanced products that are more effective than any that we currently have or will develop in the future. ii We have no certainty as to the availability and terms of future financing. We believe that we will have sufficient working capital available through lines of credit and the proceeds of future offerings to finance our activities through at least June 2006. We anticipate, however, that such funds will not be sufficient to meet our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Therefore, we expect that we will be required to seek additional financing in the future. We cannot be sure that such financing will be available or available on attractive terms, or that such financing would not result in a substantial dilution of shareholders' interest. If we cannot obtain financing when we need it or on terms that are commercially reasonable to us, we will not be able to pursue our business plan as we currently anticipate. See "Use of Proceeds", "Plan of Operations", "Management's Discussion and Analysis", and "Projections." ALTHOUGH WE HAVE RESTRUCTURED OUR EXISTING DEBT, WE HAVE NOT ALLEVIATED OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS. We need to address our working capital needs by the end of June 2006 to allow us to continue devoting our efforts to development of the business instead of raising needed capital. NEITHER CHRISTIAN ROCHET, OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, NOR ERNST LUEBKE, OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, ARE FULLY PAID FOR THEIR EFFORTS. Finding people of comparable talent and dedication to our business would be difficult given our inability to pay management for their work. ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT BELIEVE EITHER SYLVAIN FLEURY, OUR CHIEF SCIENTIFIC OFFICER OR MARC GIRARD, AN IMPORTANT SCIENTIFIC CONSULTANT, HEAD OF OUR VACCINE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, ARE PLANNING TO LEAVE US, REPLACING EITHER OF THESE MEMBERS OF OUR SCIENTIFIC TEAM WOULD BE DIFFICULT. If we are unable to pay Sylvain Fleury's salary, he may soon lose his Swiss residency permit. Dr Fleury has been following, and associated with, our AIDS vaccine project since 1998 and we believe that replacing him as CSO on time for successfully prosecuting our pending patent applications would be next to impossible. We are therefore exposed to the risk of losing our pending patent applications. OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS PREDICATED ON OUR BELIEF THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ENGAGE LARGE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO PARTNER WITH US IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS. Our failure to succeed in this endeavor will dramatically change our financial needs and ability to successfully sell any products that we develop. INDUSTRY RISKS. Like any other bio-technology company, we also face the risk that any results that we achieve in animal tests will not be replicated in human patients. We also work in an extremely competitive industry where patent protection is vital to the long-term success of our company. OUR PRINCIPAL OFFICES ARE LOCATED IN SWITZERLAND AND IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO ENFORCE JUDGMENTS AGAINST US OR OUR DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. Although we are a company incorporated under the laws of Delaware, all our officers and directors are located outside of the United States. A substantial portion of our assets now are, and in the future we expect will be, located outside the U.S. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process on those persons in the U.S. or to enforce in the U.S. judgments iii obtained in U.S. courts against us or those persons based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws. It may be difficult and costly for an investor to get a court in Switzerland to enforce a judgment obtained in other jurisdictions, including the U.S., against us or our directors or officers under the securities laws of the United States WE HAVE ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS IN OUR BYLAWS THAT MAY DISCOURAGE A CHANGE OF CONTROL. Our bylaws contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions - - limit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; - - provide for a staggered board; - - provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal the bylaws; and - - establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. iv TABLE OF CONTENTS PART I ITEM 1.
