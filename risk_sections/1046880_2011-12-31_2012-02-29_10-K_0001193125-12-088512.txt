Risk Factors. Risks Related to Our Business We operate in highly competitive industries, and competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business. The alcoholic beverages production and distribution industries in our region are intensely competitive. The principal competitive factors in these industries include product range, pricing, distribution capabilities and responsiveness to consumer preferences, with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the market and the product. In Poland, we have seen significant growth of sales through the key account and discounters channels. These channels tend to operate on lower price levels from producers such as us and therefore can contribute to lower gross and operating profit margins. In Russia, hypermarket and large retail chains continue to grow their share of the trade. Traditional trade outlets typically provide us with higher margins from sales as compared to hypermarkets and large retail chains. There is a risk that the expansion of hypermarkets and large retail chains will continue to occur in the future, thus reducing the margins that we may derive from sales to wholesalers that primarily serve the traditional trade. Additionally as our discount structure is a percent of our sales price to the customers as our prices increase to offset higher excise taxes the amount of rebate paid to our customers may continue to grow greater than what we can recover from the price increase if we cannot get the full price increase in place to offset this. As a manufacturer of vodka in Poland and Russia, we face competition from other local producers. We compete with other alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages for consumer purchases in general, as well as shelf space in retail stores, restaurant presence and distributor attention. In addition, we compete for customers on the basis of the brand strength of our products relative to our competitors products. Our success depends on maintaining the strength of our consumer brands by continuously improving our offerings and appealing to the changing needs and preferences of our customers and consumers. While we devote significant resources to the continuous improvement of our products and marketing strategies, it is possible that competitors may make similar improvements more rapidly or effectively, thereby adversely affecting our sales, margins and profitability. Our results are linked to economic conditions and shifts in consumer preferences, including a reduction in the consumption of alcoholic beverages. Our results of operations are affected by the overall economic trends in Poland, Russia, Hungary and Ukraine, the level of consumer spending, the rate of taxes levied on alcoholic beverages and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. The current negative economic conditions and outlook, including volatility in energy costs, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, falling equity market values, weakened consumer confidence, falling consumer demand, declining real wages and increased unemployment rates, have contributed to a global recession. The effects of the global recession in many countries, including Poland, Russia, Hungary and Ukraine have been quite severe and it is possible that an economic recovery in those countries will take longer to develop. During the current period of economic slowdown, reduced consumer confidence and spending may result in reduced demand for our products and may limit our ability to increase prices and finance marketing and promotional activities. A continued recessionary environment would likely make it more difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments, and a major shift in consumer preferences or a large reduction in sales of alcoholic beverages could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in the prices of supplies and raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business. Prices for raw materials used for vodka production may take place in the future, and our inability to pass on these increases to our customers could reduce our margins and profits and have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot assure you that the price of raw spirits will not continue to increase and cannot assure you that we will not lose the ability to maintain our inventory of raw spirits, either of which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as we may not be able to pass this cost on to the consumers. Over the last two years spirit prices have increased annually on average by 35% in Poland and 41% in Russia resulting in approximately $26.0 million of higher annual cost of goods sold. Reliance on single source suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial results. In Russia, because we purchase spirits primarily from a single source that effectively controls pricing on the market, we have increased risks for supply disruptions and price increases. If we experience supply disruptions, we may not be able to develop 14 Table of Contents alternative sourcing in a timely manner. Any disruption of our production schedule caused by a shortage of raw materials could adversely affect our business. If raw material suppliers increase prices, we may not be able to find an economically feasible alternative. Any increased cost caused by an increase in raw materials could adversely affect our financial results. If we are not able to hire and retain managers with the experience we need to run our businesses, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have a management team that is limited in size, and in the event our financial condition does not improve or we default on our indebtedness, we may not have sufficient expertise or depth to address the issues that may arise in a timely matter or at all. In addition, we are seeking to fill important management vacancies in our Russian operations and we cannot assure you that we will be able to hire and retain managers and executives with the requisite experience and skills. Our inability to retain key management or fill important management vacancies, or to possess or obtain the requisite depth and experience necessary to confront the challenges we may face, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to run our business and execute our business plan. We are exposed to exchange rate and interest rate movements that could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and comparability of our results between financial periods. Our functional currencies are the Polish zloty, Russian ruble and Hungarian forint. Our reporting currency, however, is the U.S. dollar, and the translation effects of fluctuations in exchange rates of our functional currencies into U.S. dollars may materially impact our financial condition and net income and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods. In addition, our senior secured notes and our convertible senior notes are denominated in euros and U.S. dollars and the proceeds of the note issuances have been on-lent to certain of our operating subsidiaries that have the Polish zloty and Russian ruble as their functional currency. Movements in the exchange rate of the euro and U.S. dollar to Polish zloty and Russian ruble could therefore increase the amount of cash, in Polish zloty and Russian ruble, that must be generated in order to pay principal and interest on our notes. The impact of translation of our notes could have a material adverse effect on our reported earnings. The table below summarizes the pre-tax impact of a one percent movement in each of the exchange rates which could result in a significant impact in the results of our operations as of December 31, 2011. Exchange Rate Value of notional amount Pre-tax impact of a 1%movement in exchange rate USD-Polish zloty $426 million $4.3 million gain/loss USD-Russian ruble $264 million $2.6 million gain/loss EUR-Polish zloty 430 million or approximately $556 million $5.6 million gain/loss Foreign exchange rates may be influenced by various factors, including changing supply and demand for a particular currency; government monetary policies (including exchange control programs, restrictions on local exchanges or markets and limitations on foreign investment in a country or on investment by residents of a country in other countries); changes in trade balances; trade restrictions; and currency devaluations and revaluations. Additionally, governments from time to time intervene in currency markets, directly or by regulation, in order to influence prices. These events and actions are unpredictable and could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Weather conditions may have a material adverse effect on our sales or on the price of grain used to produce spirits. We operate in an industry where performance is affected by the weather. Extreme changes in weather conditions may result in lower consumption of vodka and other alcoholic beverages. In particular, unusually cold spells in winter or high temperatures in the summer can result in temporary shifts in customer preferences and impact demand for the alcoholic beverages we produce and distribute. Similar weather conditions in the future may have a material adverse effect on our sales which could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, inclement weather may affect the availability of grain used to produce raw spirit, which could result in a rise in raw spirit pricing that could negatively affect margins and sales. We are subject to extensive government regulation and are required to obtain and renew various permits and licenses; changes in or violations of laws or regulations or failure to obtain or renew permits and licenses could materially adversely affect our business and profitability. Our business of producing, importing and distributing alcoholic beverages in Poland and Hungary is subject to regulation by national and local governmental agencies and European Union authorities. In addition, our business in Russia is subject to 15 Table of Contents extensive regulation by Russian authorities. These regulations and laws address such matters as licensing and permit requirements, regarding the production, storage and import of alcoholic products; competition and anti-trust matters; trade and pricing practices; taxes; distribution methods and relationships; required labeling and packaging; advertising; sales promotion; and relations with wholesalers and retailers. Loss of production capacity due to regulatory issues can negatively affect our sales and increase our operating costs as we attempt to increase production at other facilities during that time to offset the lost production. It is possible that we could have similar issues in the future that will adversely impact our sales and operating costs. Additionally, new or revised regulations or requirements or increases in excise taxes, customs duties, income taxes, or sales taxes could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to numerous environmental and occupational, health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. We may incur significant costs to maintain compliance with evolving environmental and occupational, health and safety requirements, to comply with more stringent enforcement of existing applicable requirements or to defend against challenges or investigations, even those without merit. Future legal or regulatory challenges to the industry in which we operate or our business practices and arrangements could give rise to liability and fines, or cause us to change our practices or arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on us, our revenues and our profitability. Governmental regulation and supervision as well as future changes in laws, regulations or government policy (or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations) that affect us, our competitors or our industry generally, strongly influence our viability and how we operate our business. Complying with existing laws, regulations and government policy is burdensome, and future changes may increase our operational and administrative expenses and limit our revenues. Additionally, governmental regulatory and tax authorities have a high degree of discretion and may at times exercise this discretion in a manner contrary to law or established practice. Such conduct can be more prevalent in jurisdictions with less developed or evolving regulatory systems like Russia. Our business would be materially and adversely affected if there were any adverse changes in relevant laws or regulations or in their interpretation or enforcement. Our ability to introduce new products and services may also be affected if we cannot predict how existing or future laws, regulations or policies would apply to such products or services. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights. We own and license trademarks (for, among other things, our product names and packaging) and other intellectual property rights that are important to our business and competitive position, and we endeavor to protect them. However, we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken or will take will be sufficient to protect our intellectual property rights or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate our trademarks or block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others. In addition, we cannot assure you that third parties will not infringe on or misappropriate our rights, imitate our products, or assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of ours or in marks that are similar to ours or marks that we license and/or market. In some cases, there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to our marks or to similar marks. Moreover, Russia generally offers less intellectual property protection than in Western Europe or North America. We are currently involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to trademarks similar to some of our brands and other proceedings, both in the Poland and elsewhere. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights against infringement or misappropriation, or if others assert rights in or seek to invalidate our intellectual property rights, this could materially harm our future financial results and our ability to develop our business. We have incurred, and may in the future incur, impairment charges on our other trademarks and goodwill At December 31, 2011, the Company had goodwill and other intangible assets of $1,130.5 million which constituted 55% of our total assets. While we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that future impairment charges will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur, especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe, or if acquisitions made by the Company fail to achieve expected returns. We have incurred impairment charges in 2011 and each of the preceding two years. Additional impairment charges related to our goodwill and other intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Our import contracts may be terminated. As a leading importer of major international brands of alcoholic beverages in Poland and Hungary, we have been working with the same suppliers in those countries for many years and either have verbal understandings or written distribution agreements with them. In addition, we have distribution contracts in Russia through Whitehall. Where a written agreement is in place, it is usually valid for between one and five years and is terminable by either party on three to six months notice. 16 Table of Contents Although we believe we are currently in compliance with the terms and conditions of our import and distribution agreements, there is no assurance that all our import agreements will continue to be renewed on a regular basis, or that, if they are terminated, we will be able to replace them with alternative arrangements with other suppliers. Moreover, our ability to continue to distribute imported products on an exclusive basis depends on some factors which are out of our control, such as ongoing consolidation in the wine, beer and spirit industry worldwide, or producers decisions from time to time to change their distribution channels, including in the markets in which we operate. Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate. At any particular time, we may be in various stages of assessment, discussion and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions, not all of which will be consummated. We make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations. Acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties. If we complete one or more acquisitions, our results of operations and financial condition may be affected by a number of factors, including: the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the financial results we have projected in either the near or long term; the assumption of unknown liabilities; the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed; the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls; the challenges of preparing and consolidating financial statements of acquired companies in a timely manner; the difficulties in integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies; and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions. In addition, we may acquire a significant, but non-controlling, stake in a business, which could expose us to the risk of decisions taken by the acquired business controlling shareholder. Acquisitions in developing economies, such as Russia, involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned above, including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks and the particular economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. We have acquired businesses in Russia and have experienced some of these risks, including difficulties in obtaining relevant financial information, hiring and retaining key management, and incurring significant losses and impairment charges. We cannot assure you that we will not experience the same or similar issues in the future. Future acquisitions or mergers may result in a need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability. Sustained periods of high inflation in Russia may materially adversely affect our business . Russia has experienced periods of high levels of inflation since the early 1990s. Despite the fact that inflation has remained relatively stable in Russia during the past few years, our profit margins from our Russian business could be adversely affected if we are unable to sufficiently increase our prices to offset any significant future increase in the inflation rate. The developing legal system in Russia creates a number of uncertainties that could have a materially adverse effect on our business. Russia is still developing the legal framework required to support a market economy, which creates uncertainty relating to our Russian business. We have limited experience operating in Russia, which could increase our vulnerability to the risks relating to these uncertainties. Risks related to the developing legal system in Russia include:  inconsistencies between and among the Constitution, federal and regional laws, presidential decrees and governmental, ministerial and local orders, decisions, resolutions and other acts;  conflicting local, regional and federal rules and regulations;  the lack of judicial and administrative guidance on interpreting legislation;  the relative inexperience of judges and courts in interpreting legislation;  the lack of an independent judiciary;  a high degree of discretion on the part of governmental authorities, which could result in arbitrary or selective actions against us, including suspension or termination of licenses we need to operate in Russia;  poorly developed bankruptcy procedures that are subject to abuse; and  incidents or periods of high crime or corruption that could disrupt our ability to conduct our business effectively. 17 Table of Contents The recent nature of much of Russian legislation, the lack of consensus about the scope, content and pace of economic and political reform and the rapid evolution of this legal system in ways that may not always coincide with market developments place the enforceability and underlying constitutionality of laws in doubt and result in ambiguities, inconsistencies and anomalies. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our Russian business. An unpredictable tax system in Russia gives rise to significant uncertainties and risks that complicate our tax planning and decisions relating to our Russian business. The tax system in Russia is unpredictable and gives rise to significant uncertainties, which complicate our tax planning and decisions relating to our Russian businesses. Tax laws in Russia have been in force for a relatively short period of time as compared to tax laws in more developed market economies and we have less experience operating under Russian tax regulations than those of other countries. Russian companies are subject to a broad range of taxes imposed at the federal, regional and local levels, including but not limited to value added tax, excise duties, profit tax, payroll-related taxes, property taxes, taxes or other liabilities related to transfer pricing and other taxes. Russias federal and local tax laws and regulations are subject to frequent change, varying interpretations and inconsistent or unclear enforcement. During the peak of our 2010 Christmas production season, we were unable to obtain excise stamps from Russian authorities to be used at our largest production plant in Russia due to an administrative issue, over usage of old stamps, that blocked us from obtaining new excise stamps. Excise stamps are typically purchased every two to three weeks from the Russian authorities and are required to be purchased prior to the production of any vodka. Without these stamps, which must be affixed to each container of an alcoholic beverage exceeding 9% alcohol by volume produced in Russia, this plant was unable produce vodka during the peak of our production season. This loss of production capacity negatively affected our sales and increased our costs as we attempted to increase production at other facilities to offset the lost production. It is possible that we could have similar issues in the future that will adversely impact our sales and costs. In addition, it is not uncommon for differing opinions regarding legal interpretation to exist between companies subject to such taxes and the ministries and organizations of the Russian government and between different branches of the Russian government such as the Federal Tax Service and its various local tax inspectorates, resulting in uncertainties and areas of conflict. Tax declarations are subject to review and investigation by a number of tax authorities, which are enabled by law to impose penalties and interest charges. The fact that a tax declaration has been audited by tax authorities does not bar that declaration, or any other tax declaration applicable to that year, from a further tax review by a superior tax authority during a three-year period. As previous audits do not exclude subsequent claims relating to the audited period, the statute of limitations is not entirely effective. In some instances, even though it may potentially be considered unconstitutional, Russian tax authorities have applied certain taxes retroactively. Within the past few years the Russian tax authorities appear to be taking a more aggressive position in their interpretation of the legislation and assessments, and it is possible that transactions and activities that have not been challenged in the past may be challenged. As a result, significant additional taxes, penalties and interest may be assessed. In addition, our Russian business is and will be subject to periodic tax inspections that may result in tax assessments and additional amounts owed by us for prior tax periods. Uncertainty relating to Russian transfer pricing rules could lead tax authorities to impose significant additional tax liabilities as a result of transfer pricing adjustments or other similar claims, and could have a material adverse effect on our Russian businesses and our company as a whole. The Company and certain of its officers and directors were named as parties in a class action lawsuit which could be costly, protracted and divert managements attention, and harm our business. On October 24, 2011, a class action complaint titled Steamfitters Local 449 Pension Fund vs. Central European Distribution Corporation, et al., was filed in the United States District Court, District of New Jersey on behalf of a putative class of all purchasers of our common stock from August 5, 2010 through February 28, 2011 against us and certain of our officers. The complaint seeks unspecified money damages and alleges violations of federal securities law in connection with alleged materially false and misleading statements and/or omissions regarding our business, financial results and prospects in our public statements and public filings with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission for the second and third quarters of 2010, relating to declines in our vodka portfolio, our need to take an impairment charge relating to the deterioration in fair value of certain of our brands in Poland and negative financial results from the launch of Żubrówka Biała, a new vodka product. Subsequent to the above complaint, a second, substantially identical class action complaint titled Tim Schuler v. Central European Distribution Corporation, et al., was filed in the same court. Motions to consolidate the two cases and for the appointment of lead plaintiff and lead counsel have been filed and are awaiting decision. As a result, no response to the complaints has yet been filed. The Company intends to mount a vigorous defense to the claims asserted. On November 11, 2011, a purported shareholder derivative action, titled Ying Yeung v. William V. Carey, et al., was filed in the United States District Court, District of New Jersey against the current members of our board of directors (and against the 18 Table of Contents Company as the nominal defendant), seeking unspecified damages on behalf of the Company. A second, substantially identical shareholder derivative complaint, titled Russell Partch v. William V. Carey, et al., was subsequently filed in the same court. Plaintiff alleges that our directors breached their fiduciary duties of care, good faith and loyalty to the Company by failing to establish and maintain adequate internal controls and by failing to exercise proper oversight over management, which would have prevented the Company from disseminating the allegedly false and misleading statements to shareholders that are the subject of the securities class action litigation described above. The derivative actions are at a very preliminary stage, and no response to the complaints has yet been filed. Although we believe the allegations in the class and derivative complaints are without merit, these types of lawsuits can be protracted, time-consuming, distracting to management and expensive and, whether or not the claims are ultimately successful, could ultimately have an adverse effect on our business. Our results are linked to economic conditions and shifts in consumer preferences, including a reduction in the consumption of alcoholic beverages, could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. Our results of operations are affected by the overall economic trends in Poland, Russia, Hungary and other regions in which we operate and sell our products, including the level of consumer spending, the rate of taxes levied on alcoholic beverages and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. The current market environment including consumer trends, raw spirit price increases, excise increase, volatility in energy costs, diminished liquidity and credit availability, weakened consumer confidence and falling consumer demand, have contributed to lower levels of consumer spending, including consumption of alcoholic beverages. The effects of the global recession in many countries, including Russia and Hungary, have been quite severe, and it is possible that an economic recovery in those countries, and a related increase in consumer spending, will take longer to develop. While Polands GDP has increased in each of the last two years and is forecasted to grow again in 2012, the Polish economy as well as the global economy continues to be volatile and forecasted growth in Poland may fail to materialize. During the current period of volatility, reduced consumer confidence and spending may result in continued reduced demand for our products and may limit our ability to increase prices and finance marketing and promotional activities. These factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, the Company continued to observe an overall market environment of declining vodka consumption and significant price sensitivities in its core markets of Poland and Russia. Additionally the Company experienced other key changes in market conditions, including changing of sales channel and product mix and market disruptions from relicensing in Russia. As such the Company updated its goodwill impairment testing during the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2011 and took a charge of $930.1 million for goodwill impairment in Poland and Russia for the year. We also experienced the related underperformance of certain brands in Poland, primarily Bols Vodka, due to among other factors the movement of consumer purchasing from the sub-premium sector, where Bols Vodka is the leading brand, to the mainstream sector. As a result, the Company also took an impairment charge for certain Polish and Russian trademarks during the third quarter of 2011 of $127.7 million. Also for example, due to the continued lower performance of certain brands as compared to our expectations in 2010, primarily Absolwent and Bols, we determined that the fair value of the trademarks related to these brands had deteriorated and recorded an impairment charge of $131.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2010 that included an impairment to the carrying values of our trademarks related predominantly to the Absolwent and Bols brand in Poland and an impairment charge of $20.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 related to the Bols brand in Poland. We cannot assure you that we will not recognize further asset impairments or experience declines in our financial performance in connection with continued market instability. A continued recessionary environment would likely make it more difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments, and a major shift in consumer preferences or a large reduction in sales of alcoholic beverages could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business is subject to seasonality that may affect our quarterly operating results and impact the market price of our common stock. Our business is dependent on weather conditions and subject to seasonality. Lower demand for vodka occurs during the first three fiscal quarters, which can result in seasonal financial results in certain markets in which we operate. Historically, sales in the fourth quarter have been significantly higher than in the other quarters of the year due to higher demand for vodka during the Christmas season. Results of a single financial quarter might therefore not be a reliable basis for the expectations of a full fiscal year and may not be comparable with the results in the other financial quarters. Seasonality effects may also increase our working capital requirements. In addition, any interruptions during our peak production season, such as those interruptions we experienced 19 Table of Contents in the fourth quarter of 2010 in obtaining excise stamps from Russian authorities to produce and sell our product in Russia for a 14-day period, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations if they occur with unusual intensity or last for an extended period of time. Continued significant increases in excise tax in Russia may either reduce overall demand for vodka and/or reduce our margins In January 2012, excise taxes in Russia were increased by 10%. Excise taxes are scheduled to be increased by an additional 18% in July 2012. Excise tax increases require us to raise prices which could in turn reduce demand for our products as price-sensitive consumers shift to lower cost products. In addition, because our rebates to customers are based on a percentage of gross sales revenue, an increase in excise tax without a corresponding price increase will negatively impact our gross margins. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. As a result of managements recently completed assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, management concluded that there were two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which give rise to a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. While we have identified two material weaknesses, we believe that our consolidated audited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. While we will take action to remediate our identified material weaknesses, the decentralized nature of our operations and the manual nature of many of our controls increases our risk of control deficiencies. No evaluation can provide complete assurance that our internal controls will detect or uncover all failures of persons within our company to disclose material information otherwise required to be reported. The effectiveness of our controls and procedures could also be limited by simple errors or faulty judgments. We may in the future identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in connection with our internal controls over financial reporting. Any future material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Moreover, any future disclosures of additional material weaknesses, or errors as a result of those weaknesses, could result in a negative reaction in the financial markets if there is a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting. Management continues to devote significant time and attention to improving our internal controls, and we will continue to incur costs associated with implementing appropriate processes, which could include fees for additional audit and consulting services, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results. Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness We may not be able to make the required payments upon maturity of our Convertible Senior Notes due March 15, 2013, and our auditors have expressed a view that there is substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Our Convertible Senior Notes are due and payable on March 15, 2013. Our current cash on hand, estimated expected cash from operations and amounts available under our existing credit facilities will not be sufficient to make the required payments upon maturity of our Convertible Senior Notes and we may default on the Convertible Senior Notes. The Companys cash flow forecasts include the assumption that certain credit and factoring facilities that are coming due in 2012 will be renewed to manage the working capital needs. Moreover, the Company had a net loss and significant impairment charges in 2011. As a result of these conditions, the Companys auditors report for the year ended December 31, 2011, included herein, expresses substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Further, the Company may not be able to raise finance in the capital markets to repay principal on its 2013 Notes. A failure to pay amounts owed under these convertible notes would constitute a default under those notes and the Companys 9.125% Senior Secured Notes and 8.875% Senior Secured Notes, each due 2016, and other indebtedness. The Company is evaluating several plans to handle this issue to repay the Convertible Senior Notes; however, we can provide no assurance as to whether or on what terms we would be able to consummate any such plans, or as to whether additional financing will be available or that the terms of such additional financing, if available, will be acceptable to us. Any future 20 Table of Contents financings we may seek through equity investments may be dilutive to existing stockholders. Also, the terms of securities we may issue in future capital transactions may be more favorable for our new investors. Newly issued securities may include preferences, superior voting rights, warrants or other convertible features, which will have additional dilutive effects. Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital and/or financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. If we are not successful in our plans to mitigate the risk of default under our indebtedness, we could be forced to curtail our business operations, reduce our investments, decrease or eliminate capital expenditures and delay the execution of our business plan, including, without limitation, all aspects of our operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. If we are not successful in consummating such plans, we may determine that it is necessary or appropriate to seek protection under U.S. federal or other bankruptcy laws. Seeking relief under bankruptcy laws, even if we are able to emerge from bankruptcy protection, which is not certain, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys relationships with its existing and potential customers, employers, vendors and others. Local insolvency laws may be unpredictable in their application to a global company such as ours and we can give no assurance that the results of an insolvency, restructuring or liquidation proceeding in any relevant jurisdiction would be similar to the expected results in a proceeding conducted in a U.S. federal bankruptcy court. Further, if we are unable to successfully implement a plan of reorganization, we could be forced to liquidate our assets. Our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, contemplate that we will continue as a going concern and do not contain any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue planned business operations. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, it would have a material adverse effect on the value of an investment in the Company. We require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness. Our ability to make payments on or repay our indebtedness will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors discussed in these Risk factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities, or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due or to fund our other financing needs. As we disclose above and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, the Companys current cash on hand, estimated cash from operations and available credit facilities will not be sufficient to repay the Convertible Senior Notes when they become due on March 15, 2013, and our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:  reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;  sell assets;  obtain additional debt or equity capital; or  restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including our notes, on or before maturity or seek protection under U.S. federal or other bankruptcy laws. The above factors all contain an inherent execution risk. In addition, the terms of the indentures governing our notes limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. If we obtain additional debt financing, the related risks we now face would intensify. Furthermore, significant changes in market liquidity conditions resulting in a tightening in the credit markets and a reduction in the availability of debt and equity capital have adversely impacted our access to funding and the cost thereof, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain and manage liquidity, to obtain additional capital and to restructure or refinance any of our existing debt. Our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations thereunder. We are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2011 our indebtedness under our notes, other credit facilities and capital leases amounted to approximately $1,324.8 million. Our indebtedness includes Convertible 21 Table of Contents Senior Notes in the aggregate amount of $310 million that become due on March 15, 2013 and Senior Secured Notes in the aggregate amounts of $380 million and 430 million that become due in 2016. Our substantial debt could have important consequences. For example, it could:  make it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our notes and for the guarantors of our notes to satisfy their obligations with respect to the guarantees;  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt, which will reduce our cash flow available to fund capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate purposes;  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt than we do;  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes to our industry;  increase our vulnerability, and reduce our flexibility to respond, to general and industry specific adverse economic conditions; and  limit our ability to borrow additional funds, increase the cost of any such borrowing and/or limit our ability to raise equity funding. We may incur additional debt in the future. The terms of the indentures governing our notes restrict our ability to incur, but will not prohibit us from incurring, additional debt. If we were to incur additional debt, the related risks we now face could become greater. A significant portion of our indebtedness, including our Senior Secured Notes due 2016, is secured by assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. Substantially all of our operating assets are located in Poland, Hungary and Russia. In addition, our subsidiaries are organized under the laws of Poland, Hungary, Russia, Cyprus, the Cayman Islands, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. In the event that we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy and, as a result, are unable to continue as a going concern, local insolvency and other laws may be unpredictable in their application to a global company such as ours and the security interests and guarantees granted by us and our subsidiaries, and may restrict our ability to restructure our indebtedness in an orderly fashion or at all. This could materially negatively impact any potential recovery of our creditors and/or shareholders. We can give no assurance that the results of an insolvency, restructuring or liquidation proceeding in any relevant jurisdiction would be similar to the expected results in a proceeding conducted in a U.S. federal bankruptcy court. In addition, there is uncertainty regarding the extent to which a court in one relevant jurisdiction will respect or enforce the insolvency or security-related judgments of a court in another relevant jurisdiction. We must rely on payments from our subsidiaries to make cash payments on our notes, and our subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions on making such payments. We are a holding company and hold most of our assets at, and conduct most of our operations through, direct and indirect subsidiaries. In order to make payments on our notes or to meet our other obligations, we depend upon receiving payments from our subsidiaries. In particular, we may be dependent on dividends and other payments by our direct and indirect subsidiaries to service our obligations. Investors in our notes will not have any direct claim on the cash flow or assets of our non-guarantor operating subsidiaries and our non-guarantor operating subsidiaries have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under our notes or the subsidiary guarantees, or to make funds available to us for those payments. In addition, the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments, loans or advances to us may be limited by the laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which such subsidiaries are organized or located. Any of the situations described above could make it more difficult for a subsidiary guarantor to service its obligations and therefore adversely affect our ability to service our obligations in respect of our notes. If payments are not made to us by our subsidiaries, we may not have any other sources of funds available that would permit us to make payments on our notes. Covenant restrictions under the indentures governing our notes impose significant limitations on us and may limit our flexibility in operating our business and consequently to make payments on our indebtedness. The indentures governing our notes contain, and other financing arrangements that we may enter into in the future may contain, covenants that may restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to take advantage of other business opportunities that may be in our interest. These covenants impose limitations on our ability to, among other things:  incur additional indebtedness;  make certain restricted payments;  transfer or sell assets; 22 Table of Contents  enter into transactions with affiliates;  create certain liens;  create restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or other payments;  issue guarantees of indebtedness by restricted subsidiaries;  enter into sale and leaseback transactions;  merge, consolidate, amalgamate or combine with other entities;  designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and  engage in any business other than a permitted business. Risks Related to Our Common Stock The price of our common stock historically has been volatile. This volatility may affect the price at which you could sell your common stock. The sale price for our common stock has varied between a high of $26.25 and a low of $2.75 in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2011. This volatility may affect the price at which you could sell the common stock and the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the other factors discussed in Risks related to our business and in the documents we have incorporated by reference into this report; variations in our quarterly operating results from our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors; downward revisions in securities analysts estimates; and announcement by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments. Delaware law and provisions in our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could cause the market price of our shares to decline. We are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our board of directors has the power, without stockholder approval, to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock. On September 6, 2011, our board of directors implemented a Shareholder Rights Plan. The Shareholder Rights Plan, the ability of our board of directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock, and certain provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock. See Description of capital stock. We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the next few years. Enforcing legal liability against us and our directors and officers might be difficult. We are organized under the laws of the State of Delaware of the United States. Therefore, investors are able to effect service of process in the United States upon us and may be able to effect service of process upon our directors and executive officers. We are a holding company, however, and substantially all of our operating assets are located in Poland, Hungary and Russia. Further, most of our directors and executive officers, and those of most of our subsidiaries, are non-residents of the United States, and our assets and the assets of our directors and executive officers are located outside the United States. As a result, you may not be able to enforce against our assets (or those of certain of our directors or executive officers) judgments of United States courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of United States laws, including federal securities laws of the United States. In addition, awards of punitive damages in actions brought in the United States or elsewhere may not be enforceable in Poland or Russia.
