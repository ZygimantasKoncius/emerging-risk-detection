ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in our securities is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. Please carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the possibility of the loss of your entire investment, before deciding to invest in our securities. Risk Factors Related to our Former Gaming Business Due to our history of operating losses our auditors are uncertain that we will be able to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. Due to our continuing operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations, the report of our auditors issued in connection with our financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2013, contains an explanatory paragraph indicating that the foregoing matters raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue as a going concern We will require additional capital and have no commitments for funding. Our operations consist solely of the Bull Durham casino. We believe this operation can be self-sustaining. However, it is not expected to be sufficiently profitable to fund the capital resource needs of the parent company. These conditions make it unlikely that we could take advantage of future opportunities without a significant capital infusion. We will have to obtain such additional capital through borrowings or from additional equity financing. Additional future equity financing may occur through the sale of either unregistered common stock in exempt offerings or through the public offering of registered stock. In any case, such additional equity financing may result in additional dilution to investors. There can be no assurance that any additional capital, funding or revenues can satisfactorily be arranged. We have no arrangements for the acquisition of additional capital. We have leveraged our assets to secure repayment of debt. If we default in the repayment of the debt, we could forfeit our productive assets. All of our assets have been pledged as security for the repayment of debt in the approximate amount of $1.3 million. If we are unable to pay any of the debt, our assets would be subject to foreclosure by the creditor. Should foreclosure occur, it is likely that we would be forced to discontinue operations and our interest in the assets could be forfeited. These debts are currently due and we do not have the resources to retire the obligations. If the debt holders demand payment we could be forced to seek bankruptcy protection or be forced to liquidate the assets to satisfy the debts. We are currently engaged in discussions with both our existing lenders as well as new lenders to refinance the debt. While we have no agreement or commitments, we are optimistic that a refinance can be accomplished on reasonable terms. 19 Risks Related to our Gaming Operations If we fail to comply with gaming regulations, we could lose our gaming license or be subject to substantial fines. The operation of a casino gaming facility in Colorado requires a Colorado Limited Gaming License. A Colorado gaming license is a non-transferable, revocable privilege in which the licensee acquires no vested interest. The Colorado Gaming Commission could choose not to renew that license if it has concerns about our management, operations, business practices or associations. Additionally, any violation of gaming laws or regulations could result in the assessment of substantial fines against us and the persons involved. The suspension, revocation or non-renewal of any of our licenses or the levy on us of substantial fines could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Holders of our stock are subject to investigation by the Colorado Gaming Commission. The Colorado Gaming Commission requires that any beneficial owner of five percent or more of our securities, including holders of our common stock, file an application for a finding of suitability. The gaming authority has the power to investigate an owner's suitability and the owner must pay all costs of the investigation. If the owner is found unsuitable, then the owner may be required by law to dispose of our securities. The Colorado Division of Gaming is currently requiring certain of our shareholders to file an application for finding of suitability. If they are found by the division to be unsuitable, they could be required to divest their share positions. Changes in regulatory environment could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. From time to time, legislators and special interest groups have proposed legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations or which may otherwise adversely impact our operations. Any expansion of gaming or restriction on or prohibition of our gaming operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We face substantial competition from other gaming operations and other forms of gaming that could have a material adverse effect on our future operations. We operate in a very competitive environment. Casinos offering hotel accommodations for overnight stays may have a competitive advantage over our casino. In addition, many of the casinos in Black Hawk and Central City are operated by large companies with multi-state operations and substantial resources. Our casinos also indirectly face competition from other forms of gaming, including the Colorado state-run lottery, multi-state lottery, online computer gaming, charitable bingo and horse and dog racing, as well as other forms of entertainment. Additional legalization of gaming in Colorado could adversely affect our business. Additional legalization of gaming in or near any area from which our casino draws customers would adversely affect our business. Colorado law requires statewide voter approval for any expansion of limited gaming into additional locations and depending on the authorization approved by the statewide vote, may also require voter approval from the locality in question. Several attempts have been made by various parties in recent years to expand gaming in Colorado. However, to date none 20 of this legislation has passed. However, there can be no assurance that such legislation will not be implemented in Colorado. If such legislation is approved by the Colorado legislature or Colorado voters, it would likely have a material adverse impact on our future operating results. Construction of a new roadway from Interstate 70 to Central City has not had a material beneficial impact on our business. In November 2004, Central City completed a new four-lane road from Interstate 70 at Hidden Valley directly into downtown Central City. This roadway allows drivers to reach Central City without driving through Clear Creek Canyon and Black Hawk. While there was an initial increase in business following the opening of the highway, for the past several years that business has been waning, and we do not believe that it will have any lasting positive impact on Doc Holliday operations. We may face difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified employees for our casinos. The operation of our casinos requires qualified executives, managers and skilled employees with gaming industry experience and qualifications to obtain the requisite licenses. Currently, there is a shortage of skilled labor in the gaming industry. We believe this shortage will make it increasingly difficult and expensive for the manager of our casino to attract and retain qualified employees. Increasing competition in Black Hawk, Central City and competing markets may lead to higher costs in order to retain and attract qualified employees. We may incur higher labor costs in order for the casino management to attract qualified employees from existing gaming facilities. While we believe that we will be able to attract and retain qualified employees, we may have difficulty attracting a satisfactory number, and we may incur higher costs than expected as a result. Adverse weather, road conditions and infrastructure limitations affect our ability to attract customers. The location of our casinos in the Rocky Mountains creates a risk that it will be subject to inclement weather, particularly snow. Severe weather conditions could cause significant physical damage to the casino or result in reduced hours of operation or access to the casinos. Black Hawk and Central City are served by winding mountain roads that require cautious driving, particularly in bad weather, and are subject to driving restrictions and closure. Congestion on the roads leading to Black Hawk and Central City is common during the peak summer season, holidays and other times and may discourage potential customers from traveling to the casinos, particularly if road construction is in process. Because we are dependent on our casinos for all of our cash flow, local economic conditions and other local conditions and circumstances beyond our control could adversely affect our business. We are entirely dependent upon our casinos for all of our cash flow. Therefore, we are subject to greater risks than a geographically diversified gaming company. These greater risks include those caused by any of the risks described in this section, including: - local economic and competitive conditions; - inaccessibility due to road construction or closure on primary access routes; - changes in local and state governmental laws and regulations; - natural and other disasters; - a decline in the number of residents near or visitors to Black Hawk and Central City; or - a decrease in gaming activities in Black Hawk and Central City. Any of the factors outlined above could adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to continue to operate our casino. A recession or economic slowdown could cause a reduction in visitation to the casino, which would adversely affect our operating results. Increases in the price of gasoline has had a material adverse impact on the gaming industry. Black Hawk and Central City are only accessible by auto or bus. As a result, sharp increases in the price of gasoline has had a material adverse impact on our operations, inasmuch as the primary demographic of our customers is retired persons on fixed incomes. It is unlikely that we will be able to offset the effects of increased transportation costs with marketing and other incentives. We are subject to environmental laws and potential exposure to environmental liabilities, which could be costly. We are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, we could be held liable for the costs of remediating contaminated soil or groundwater on or from our property without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the contamination, as well as incur liability to third parties impacted by such contamination. The presence of contamination, or failure to remediate it properly, may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent such property. Our casino is located within the geographic footprint of the Clear Creek/Central City Superfund Site, a large area of historic mining activity, which is the subject of state and federal clean-up actions. Although we have not been named a potentially responsible party for this Superfund Site, it is possible that as a result of our ownership and operation of our property (on which mining may have occurred in the past) we may incur costs related to this matter in the future. To date, none of these matters of other matters arising under environmental laws has had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such matters will not have such an effect in the future. The rate of taxation on gaming profits may increase in the future. The Colorado Constitution permits a gaming tax of up to 40% on adjusted gross gaming proceeds. The Colorado Gaming Commission has the authority to set gaming tax rates and the current rate structure is a progressive scale with a maximum tax of 20%. The cities of Black Hawk and Central City have imposed an annual device fee of $857 and $1,325, respectively, per gaming device and it revises the same from time to time. The Colorado Gaming Commission has eliminated its annual device fee for gaming machines. The Colorado Gaming Commission may revise the gaming tax or re-impose the state device fee at any time and has been conducting annual reviews to reconsider and reevaluate the gaming taxes on or about July 1st of each year. We cannot assure you that the tax rates applicable to the casino will not be increased in the future by either the Colorado Gaming 22 Commission or the cities of Black Hawk or Central City. Additionally, from time to time, certain federal legislators have proposed the imposition of a federal tax on gaming revenues. Any such tax could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Energy and fuel price increases may adversely affect our costs of operations and our revenues. Our casino property uses significant amounts of electricity, natural gas and other forms of energy. While no shortages of energy have been experienced, the recent substantial increases in the cost of electricity in the United States may negatively affect our results of operations. The extent of the impact is subject to the magnitude and duration of the energy and fuel price increases. We experience quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations. Our quarterly operating results fluctuate because of seasonality and other factors. We typically generate the best operating profits in our fourth and first fiscal quarters, which end in June and September, respectively. These seasonal trends may impact our financial condition to the extent we need more funds during periods of slower activity in the future. We have not paid dividends and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all future earnings and other cash resources for the future operation and development of our business. Except for dividends payable on our outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock, we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account many factors, including our operating results, financial condition, current and anticipated cash needs, and other factors. The existence of outstanding convertible securities, options and warrants may impair our ability to raise capital. At June 30, 2013, there were 700,000 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of convertible preferred stock, 1,105,000 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants issued in the private placement sale of 8% convertible notes at an exercise price of $0.50 per share, 60,000 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants issued in the private placement of loan participation interests, shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of 5% convertible notes, and shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the 8% convertible notes. Subsequent to June 30, 2013, the outstanding 5% Notes were converted into an aggregate of 393,154 shares of common stock and the 8% Notes were converted into an aggregate of 2,804,462 shares of common stock plus an additional 85,000 shares issued as a fee to the placement agent. During the life of the preferred stock, options and warrants, the holders are given an opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock with a resulting dilution in the interest of the other shareholders. Our ability to obtain additional financing during the period the warrants and options are outstanding may be adversely affected and the existence of the warrants and options may have an effect on the price of our common stock. The holders of the warrants may be expected to exercise them at a time when we would, in all likelihood, be able to obtain any needed capital by a new offering of securities on terms more favorable than those provided by the warrants. 23 There are trading risks for low priced stocks. Our common stock is currently traded in the over-the-counter market on the "Electronic Bulletin Board" of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. As a consequence, an investor could find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the price of, our securities. The Securities Enforcement and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 requires additional disclosure, relating to the market for penny stocks, in connection with trades in any stock defined as a penny stock. The Commission recently adopted regulations that generally define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Such exceptions include any equity security listed on NASDAQ and any equity security issued by an issuer that has (i) net tangible assets of at least $2,000,000, if such issuer has been in continuous operation for three (3) years, (ii) net tangible assets of at least $5,000,000, if such issuer has been in continuous operation for less than three (3) years, or (iii) average annual revenue of at least $6,000,000, if such issuer has been in continuous operation for less than three (3) years. Unless an exception is available, the regulations require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated therewith. If our securities are not quoted on NASDAQ, or we do not have $2,000,000 in net tangible assets, trading in our securities will be covered by Rules 15-g-1 through 15-g-6 promulgated under the Exchange Act for non-NASDAQ and non-exchange listed securities. Under such rules, broker-dealers who recommend such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must make a special written suitability determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to this transaction. Securities are exempt from these rules if the market price of the common stock is at least $5.00 per share. The market price of our securities could be adversely affected by sales of restricted securities. Actual sales or the prospect of future sales of shares of our common stock under Rule 144 may have a depressive effect upon the price of, and market for, our common stock. As of June 30, 2013, there were 7,246,978 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. Approximately 2,204,472 of these shares are "restricted securities" and under some circumstances may, in the future, be under a registration under the Securities Act or in compliance with Rule 144 adopted under the Securities Act. Subsequent to June 30, 2013, we issued an additional 3,282,616 shares of common stock pursuant to the conversion of outstanding debt, all of which shares are also restricted securities. We cannot predict what effect, if any, that sales of shares of common stock, or the availability of these shares for sale, will have on the market prices prevailing from time-to-time. Nevertheless, the possibility that substantial amounts of common stock may be sold in the public market may adversely effect prevailing prices for our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital in the future through the sale of equity securities. Our ability to issue additional securities without shareholder approval could have substantial dilutive and other adverse effects on existing stockholders and investors in this offering. We have the authority to issue additional shares of common stock and to issue options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock without shareholder approval. Future issuance of common 24 stock could be at values substantially below the exercise price of the warrants, and therefore could represent further substantial dilution to you as an investor in this offering. In addition, we could issue large blocks of voting stock to fend off unwanted tender offers or hostile takeovers without further shareholder approval. Our corporate charter makes certain limitations on director liability. Our Articles of Incorporation provide, as permitted by Utah law, that our directors shall not be personally liable to the corporation or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, with certain exceptions. These provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing suit against a director for breach of fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation brought by stockholders on behalf of us against directors. In addition, our Articles of Incorporation and bylaws provide for mandatory indemnification of directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Utah law. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide financial reports or prevent fraud, our business reputation and operating results could be harmed. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. Members of our management have conflicts of interest. Our directors, are, or may become in their individual capacity, officers, and directors, controlling shareholders and/or partners of other entities engaged in a variety of businesses. Thus, they may develop conflicts of interest including, among other things, time, effort, and corporate opportunity, involved in participation with such other business entities. The amount of time that our directors will devote to our business will be limited. 25 Current difficult conditions in the financial services markets may materially and adversely impact our business Dramatic declines in the values of, among other things, various derivative instruments, credit default swaps and the housing market during the prior years, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment, have resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks. Many lenders and institutional investors have reduced, and in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers, including other financial institutions. This market turmoil and tightening of credit have also led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence, increased market volatility and possibly a general reduction of business activity. A continuation of these conditions could have, among other things, the following potential negative effects: 1. A reduction in discretionary spending by consumers could significantly impact the customer traffic and revenues of our casino operations; and 2. While we do not depend on credit from the financial markets to finance our operations, most of our long-term debt has matured and must be refinanced. As of the date of this report, junior mortgage debt totaling $241,064 at June 30, 2013 had matured on September 19, 2009 and April 1, 2013, and efforts to refinance or modify the terms of these notes with the noteholders have not been successful. Since 2008, the financial markets have experienced disruption that has had a dramatic impact on the availability and cost of capital and credit. Our ability to re-finance our matured long-term debt will likely be affected by the current financial market conditions. If we are successful in obtaining financing of our long-term debt, there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate rates and terms similar to those we currently have, and such negotiated rates could be significantly higher than those currently existing on our long-term debt. Risks Related to General Economic Conditions Current economic conditions and in the global economy generally, including ongoing disruptions in the debt and equity capital markets, may adversely affect our business and results of operations, and our ability to obtain financing. The global economic environment is currently volatile and uncertain, and the future economic environment may continue to be less favorable than that of recent years. The retail industry has experienced and may continue to experience significant downturns in connection with, or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions. The current economic environment has been characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, leading to lowered demand for products and resulting in fewer customers visiting, and customers spending less, which could adversely affect our revenues. In addition, further declines in consumer and commercial spending may drive us and our competitors to reduce pricing, which would have a negative impact on our gross profit. We are unable to predict the timing, duration, and severity of any disruptions in debt and equity capital markets and adverse economic conditions in the United States and other countries, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, in part because we are dependent upon customer behavior and the impact on consumer spending that market disruptions may have. 26 The global stock and credit markets have recently experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective and outstanding debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings materially less attractive, and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing. This volatility and illiquidity has negatively affected a broad range of mortgage and asset-backed and other fixed income securities. As a result, the market for fixed income securities has experienced decreased liquidity, increased price volatility, credit downgrade events, and increased defaults. Global equity markets have also been experiencing heightened volatility and turmoil, with issuers exposed to the credit markets particularly affected. These factors and the continuing market disruption have an adverse effect on us, in part because we, like many companies, from time to time may need to raise capital in debt and equity capital markets including in the asset-backed securities markets. In addition, continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively affect our ability to access additional short-term and long-term financing, including future securitization transactions, on reasonable terms or at all, which would negatively impact our liquidity and financial condition. In addition, if one or more of the financial institutions that support our future credit facilities fails, we may not be able to find a replacement, which would negatively impact our ability to borrow under the credit facilities. These disruptions in the financial markets also may adversely affect our credit rating and the market value of our common stock. If the current pressures on credit continue or worsen, we may not be able to refinance, if necessary, our outstanding debt when due, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If our operating results worsen significantly and our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates increase significantly, we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. A worsening of the United States economy could materially adversely affect our business. The success of our business operations depends significantly on consumer confidence and spending, which have deteriorated as a result of the worldwide economic downturn. This economic downturn and decrease in consumer spending adversely impacted our revenue, and it may continue to adversely impact our revenue, ability to market our products, build customer loyalty, or otherwise implement our business strategy. If the current economic situation persists, or deteriorates significantly, our business could be negatively impacted. 27 BUSINESS DESCRIPTION FOLLOWING THE SPLIT-OFF AND ACQUISITION OF WEST PACES FERRY HEALTHCARE REIT, INC. Business Overview Given that the Split-Off and Stock Purchase Agreements are effective, Global will invest primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the United States. We plan to acquire, develop, lease, manage and dispose of healthcare real estate, and provide financing to healthcare providers. Our portfolio will be comprised of investments in the following five healthcare segments: (i) senior housing, (ii) life science, (iii) medical office, (iv) post-acute/skilled nursing and (v) hospital. We will make investments within our healthcare segments using the following five investment products: (i) properties under lease, (ii) debt investments, (iii) developments and redevelopments, (iv) investment management and (v) RIDEA, which represents investments in senior housing operations utilizing the structure permitted by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. The delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and, as a result, tenants and operators depend on real estate, in part, to maintain and grow their businesses. We believe that the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the following: Compelling demographics driving the demand for healthcare services; Specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing; and Ongoing consolidation of a fragmented healthcare real estate sector. Acquisition of Middle Georgia Nursing Home Effective July 1, 2012, Georgia REIT consummated its first acquisition: the Middle Georgia Nursing Home. Middle Georgia Nursing Home located at 556 Chester Highway, Eastman, Georgia (Middle Georgia or the Facility). The Facility was acquired through Dodge NH, LLC, a limited liability company formed for the purpose of acquiring Middle Georgia that was initially wholly-owned by Georgia REIT. There was formed and organized a financing entity, Dodge Investors, LLC to raise $1.1 million in funding to complete the financing required to complete the acquisition, as more fully described below. The terms of the acquisition of Middle Georgia were as follows: The purchase price was $5.0 million, of which $4.0 million was paid with the proceeds of a commercial mortgage with Colony Bank, as senior lender, which accrues interest at 6.25% per annum; and the balance of $1.0 million was provided by Dodge Investors, LLC. Dodge Investors funded Dodge NH, LLC with $1.1 million in consideration of 13% unsecured notes and a carried 35% membership interest in Dodge NH, LLC. Of the $1.1 million raised by Dodge Investors, LLC, $125,000 was invested by REIT using a portion of the Loan proceeds from the Company, representing a 4% membership interest of the total 35% membership interest held by Dodge Investors, LLC. The Dodge NH, LLC notes purchased by Dodge Investors, LLC accrue interest at the rate of 13% per annum, interest payable monthly, with the outstanding balance of principal and accrued and unpaid interest due July 1, 2014. The 35% membership interest of Dodge Investors, LLC will continue as a carried interest after the repayment of the notes. 28 Dodge NH, LLC has an operating lease agreement with Trent Tolbert, a professional skilled nursing facility operator, having an initial term of five years with an option to renew for an additional five-year period. The rent begins at $45,000 per month and increases by $1,000 per month each year during the initial term. Effective March 15, 2013, Georgia REIT conveyed its entire 65% membership interest in Dodge NH to West Paces. Healthcare Industry Healthcare is the single largest industry in the U.S. based on Gross Domestic Product ("GDP"). According to the National Health Expenditures report by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"): (i) national health expenditures are projected to grow 4.3% in 2012; (ii) the average compounded annual growth rate for national health expenditures, over the projection period of 2010 through 2020, is anticipated to be 5.8%; and (iii) the healthcare industry is projected to represent 17.6% of U.S. GDP in 2012. Senior citizens are the largest consumers of healthcare services. According to CMS, on a per capita basis, the 75-year and older segment of the population spends 76% more on healthcare than the 65 to 74-year-old segment and over 200% more than the population average. Business Strategy Our primary goal is to increase shareholder value through profitable growth. Our investment strategy to achieve this goal is based on three principles: (i) opportunistic investing, (ii) portfolio diversification and (iii) conservative financing. Opportunistic Investing We will make investment decisions that are expected to drive profitable growth and create shareholder value. We will attempt to position ourselves to create and take advantage of situations to meet our goals and investment criteria. Portfolio Diversification We believe in maintaining a portfolio of healthcare investments diversified by segment, geography, operator, tenant and investment product. Diversification reduces the likelihood that a single event would materially harm our business and allows us to take advantage of opportunities in different markets based on individual market dynamics. While pursuing our strategy of diversification, we will monitor, but will not limit, our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type, investment product, geographic location, the number of properties which we may lease to a single operator or tenant, or loans we may make to a single borrower. With investments in multiple segments and investment products, we can focus on opportunities with the most attractive risk/reward profile for the portfolio as a whole. We may structure transactions as master leases, require operator or tenant insurance and indemnifications, obtain credit enhancements in the form of guarantees, letters of credit or security deposits, and take other measures to mitigate risk. 29 Conservative Financing We believe a conservative balance sheet is important to our ability to execute our opportunistic investing approach. We will strive to maintain a conservative balance sheet by actively managing our debt-to-equity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity, such as our revolving line of credit facility, access to capital markets and secured debt lenders, relationships with current and prospective institutional joint venture partners, and our ability to divest of assets. Our debt obligations will be primarily fixed rate with staggered maturities, which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations. We plan to finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding. For short-term purposes, we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or arrange for other short-term borrowings from banks or other sources. We arrange for longer-term financing through offerings of equity and debt securities, placement of mortgage debt and capital from other institutional lenders and equity investors. Competition Investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive. We will face competition from other REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, healthcare operators, lenders, developers and other institutional investors, some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do. Increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives. Our ability to compete may also be impacted by national and local economic trends, availability of investment alternatives, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, existing laws and regulations, new legislation and population trends. Income from our facilities is dependent on the ability of our operators and tenants to compete with other companies on a number of different levels, including: the quality of care provided, reputation, the physical appearance of a facility, price and range of services offered, alternatives for healthcare delivery, the supply of competing properties, physicians, staff, referral sources, location, the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas, and the financial condition of our tenants and operators. Private, federal and state payment programs as well as the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of our tenants and operators. For a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions affecting our business, see "Risk Factors". Healthcare Segments Senior housing. Senior housing facilities include assisted living facilities ("ALFs"), independent living facilities ("ILFs") and continuing care retirement communities ("CCRCs"), which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their needs. Services provided by our operators or tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. Senior housing property types are further described below: • Assisted Living Facilities. ALFs are licensed care facilities that provide personal care services, support and housing for those who need help with activities of daily living ("ADL") yet require limited medical care. The programs and services may include transportation, 30 social activities, exercise and fitness programs, beauty or barber shop access, hobby and craft activities, community excursions, meals in a dining room setting and other activities sought by residents. These facilities are often in apartment-like buildings with private residences ranging from single rooms to large apartments. Certain ALFs may offer higher levels of personal assistance for residents with Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. Levels of personal assistance are based in part on local regulations. • Independent Living Facilities. ILFs are designed to meet the needs of seniors who choose to live in an environment surrounded by their peers with services such as housekeeping, meals and activities. These residents generally do not need assistance with ADL, such as bathing, eating and dressing. However, residents have the option to contract for these services. • Continuing Care Retirement Communities. CCRCs provide housing and health-related services under long-term contracts. This alternative is appealing to residents as it eliminates the need for relocating when health and medical needs change, thus allowing residents to "age in place." Some CCRCs require a substantial entry or buy-in fee and most also charge monthly maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit, meals and some health services. CCRCs typically require the individual to be in relatively good health and independent upon entry. Post-acute/skilled nursing. SNFs offer restorative, rehabilitative and custodial nursing care for people not requiring the more extensive and sophisticated treatment available at hospitals. Ancillary revenues and revenues from sub-acute care services are derived from providing services to residents beyond room and board and include occupational, physical, speech, respiratory and intravenous therapy, wound care, oncology treatment, brain injury care and orthopedic therapy as well as sales of pharmaceutical products and other services. Certain SNFs provide some of the foregoing services on an out-patient basis. Post-acute/skilled nursing services provided by our operators and tenants in these facilities will be primarily paid for either by private sources or through the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Life science. These properties contain laboratory and office space primarily for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, scientific research institutions, government agencies and other organizations involved in the life science industry. While these properties contain similar characteristics to commercial office buildings, they generally contain more advanced electrical, mechanical, and heating, ventilating, and air conditioning ("HVAC") systems. The facilities generally have equipment including emergency generators, fume hoods, lab bench tops and related amenities. In many instances, life science tenants make significant investments to improve their leased space, in addition to landlord improvements, to accommodate biology, chemistry or medical device research initiatives. Medical office. Medical office buildings ("MOBs") typically contain physicians' offices and examination rooms, and may also include pharmacies, hospital ancillary service space and outpatient services such as diagnostic centers, rehabilitation clinics and day-surgery operating rooms. While these facilities are similar to commercial office buildings, they require additional plumbing, electrical and mechanical systems to accommodate multiple exam rooms that may require sinks in every room, and special equipment such as x-ray machines. In addition, MOBs are often built to accommodate higher structural loads for certain equipment and may contain "vaults" or other specialized construction. We expect our MOBs will be typically multi-tenant properties leased to healthcare providers (hospitals and physician practices). 31 Hospital. Services provided by our operators and tenants in these facilities are paid for by private sources, third-party payors (e.g., insurance and Health Maintenance Organizations or "HMOs"), or through the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Hospital property types include acute care, long-term acute care, and specialty and rehabilitation hospitals. Investment Products Properties under lease. We plan to primarily generate revenue by leasing properties under long-term leases. Most of our rents and other earned income from leases will be received under triple-net leases or leases that provide for a substantial recovery of operating expenses. However, some of our MOBs and life science facility rents will be structured under gross or modified gross leases. Accordingly, for such gross or modified gross leases, we may incur certain property operating expenses, such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, property management fees, utilities and insurance. Our ability to grow income from properties under lease depends, in part, on our ability to (i) increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing rental rates and occupancy levels, (ii) maximize tenant recoveries and (iii) control non-recoverable operating expenses. Most of our leases will include contractual annual base rent escalation clauses that are either predetermined fixed increases and/or are a function of an inflation index. Debt investments. Our mezzanine loans will generally be secured by a pledge of ownership interests of an entity or entities, which directly or indirectly own properties, and are subordinate to more senior debt, including mortgages and more senior mezzanine loans. Our interest in mortgages and construction financing will typically be issued by healthcare providers and will generally be secured by healthcare real estate. Borrowers of our interests in mortgage and construction loans will typically be healthcare providers and healthcare real estate generally secures these loans. Developments and redevelopments. We will generally commit to development projects that are at least 50% pre-leased or when we believe that market conditions will support speculative construction. We will work closely with our local real estate service providers, including brokerage, property management, project management and construction management companies to assist us in evaluating development proposals and completing developments. Our development and redevelopment investments will likely be in the life science and medical office segments. Redevelopments are properties that require significant capital expenditures (generally more than 25% of acquisition cost or existing basis) to achieve property stabilization or to change the primary use of the properties. Investment management. We may co-invest in real estate properties with institutional investors through joint ventures structured as partnerships or limited liability companies. We may target institutional investors with long-term investment horizons who seek to benefit from our expertise in healthcare real estate. Predominantly, we plan to retain noncontrolling interests in the joint ventures ranging from 20% to 30% and serve as the managing member. These ventures generally allow us to earn acquisition and asset management fees, and have the potential for promoted interests or incentive distributions based on performance of the joint venture. Operating properties ("RIDEA"). We may enter into contracts with healthcare operators to manage communities that are placed in a structure permitted by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (commonly referred to as "RIDEA"). Under the provisions of RIDEA, a REIT may lease 32 "qualified health care properties" on an arm's length basis to a taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS") if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an "eligible independent contractor." We view RIDEA as a structure primarily to be used on properties that present attractive valuation entry points, where repositioning with a new operator that is aligned with HCP can bring scale, operating efficiencies, and/or ancillary services to drive growth. Government Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement Overview Our tenants and operators will typically be subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse practices, government reimbursement, licensure and certificate of need and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities, and we expect that the healthcare industry, in general, will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse, cost control, healthcare management and provision of services, among others. These regulations are wide-ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil, criminal and administrative sanctions. Affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties will be subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another. Changes in laws and regulations and reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory non-compliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition, which in turn may adversely impact us, as detailed below and set forth under "Risk Factors". We will seek to mitigate the risk to us resulting from the significant healthcare regulatory risks faced by our tenants and operators by diversifying our portfolio among property types and geographical areas, diversifying our tenant and operator base to limit our exposure to any single entity, and seeking tenants and operators who are not largely dependent on Medicaid reimbursement for their revenues. The following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators, and in certain cases, to us. Fraud and Abuse Enforcement There are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers' relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers. These laws include (i) federal and state false claims acts, which, among other things, prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs, (ii) federal and state anti-kickback and fee-splitting statutes, including the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute, which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services, (iii) federal and state physician self-referral laws (commonly referred to as the "Stark Law"), which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship, (iv) the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and (v) federal and state privacy laws, including the privacy and security rules contained in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which provide for 33 the privacy and security of personal health information. Violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil, criminal and administrative sanctions, including punitive sanctions, monetary penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs. These laws are enforced by a variety of federal, state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through, among other things, federal and state false claims acts, which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or "whistleblower" actions. Many of our operators and tenants are subject to these laws, and some of them may in the future become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws. Reimbursement Sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators will include, among other sources, governmental healthcare programs, such as the federal Medicare program and state Medicaid programs, and non-governmental payors, such as insurance carriers and HMOs. As federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives, and as many states face significant budget deficits, efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue, which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators. Healthcare Licensure and Certificate of Need Certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio will be subject to extensive federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection laws and regulations. In addition, various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and operate equipment. Many states require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need, which requires prior approval for the construction, expansion and closure of certain healthcare facilities. The approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants' and operators' abilities to expand or change their businesses. Life Science Facilities While certain of our life science tenants may include some well-established companies, other such tenants may be less established and, in some cases, may not yet have a product approved by the Food and Drug Administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale. Creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and money, in part, because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry; it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance. 34 Senior Housing Entrance Fee Communities Certain of the senior housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us may be operated as entrance fee communities. Generally, an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident, a portion of which may be refundable, in exchange for some form of long-term benefit. Some of the entrance fee communities will be subject to significant state regulatory oversight, including, for example, oversight of each facility's financial condition, establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions, the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time, lien rights in favor of the residents, restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters. Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA") Our properties must comply with the ADA and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" as defined in those statutes. The ADA may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. To date, we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ADA that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ADA concerns. Should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties, we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities ADA-compliant. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ADA is an ongoing one, and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect. Environmental Matters A wide variety of federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations. These complex federal and state statutes, and their enforcement, involve a myriad of regulations, many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender. Some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property or a secured lender, such as us, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property). The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and the owner's or secured lender's liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property, and/or the assets of the owner or secured lender. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner's ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which, in turn, could reduce our revenues. Taxation Federal Income Tax Considerations The following summary of the taxation of the Company and the material federal tax consequences to the holders of our debt and equity securities is for general information only and is not tax advice. This summary does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to certain types of holders 35 of stock or securities (including, but not limited to, insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, financial institutions or broker-dealers, persons holding shares of common stock as part of a hedging, integrated conversion, or constructive sale transaction or a straddle, traders in securities that use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, investors in pass-through entities and foreign corporations and persons who are not citizens or residents of the United States). This summary does not discuss all of the aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to you in light of your particular investment or other circumstances. In addition, this summary does not discuss any state or local income taxation or foreign income taxation or other tax consequences. This summary is based on current U.S. federal income tax law. Subsequent developments in U.S. federal income tax law, including changes in law or differing interpretations, which may be applied retroactively, could have a material effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of our securities as set forth in this summary. Before you purchase our securities, you should consult your own tax advisor regarding the particular U.S. federal, state, local, foreign and other tax consequences of acquiring, owning and selling our securities. General We will elect to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (a REIT) commencing with our first taxable year following consummation of the Reorganization. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT, but there is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for subsequent years. Qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet a variety of qualification tests imposed under federal income tax law with respect to income, assets, distribution level and diversity of share ownership as discussed below under  Qualification as a REIT. There can be no assurance that we will be owned and organized and will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified. In any year in which we qualify as a REIT, in general, we will not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders. We may, however, be subject to tax at normal corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not distributed. If we elect to retain and pay income tax on our net long-term capital gain, stockholders are required to include their proportionate share of our undistributed long-term capital gain in income, but they will receive a refundable credit for their share of any taxes paid by us on such gain. Despite the REIT election, we may be subject to federal income and excise tax as follows: • To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our REIT taxable income, as adjusted, we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates; • We may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (the AMT) on certain tax preference items to the extent that the AMT exceeds our regular tax; • If we have net income from the sale or other disposition of foreclosure property that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or other non-qualifying income from foreclosure property, such income will be taxed at the highest corporate rate; • Any net income from prohibited transactions (which are, in general, sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of 36 business, other than dispositions of foreclosure property and dispositions of property due to an involuntary conversion) will be subject to a 100% tax; • If we fail to satisfy either the 75% or 95% gross income tests (as discussed below), but nonetheless maintain our qualification as a REIT because certain other requirements are met, we will be subject to a 100% tax on an amount equal to (1) the gross income attributable to the greater of (i) 75% of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75% gross income test (discussed below) or (ii) 95% of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95% gross income test (discussed below) multiplied by (2) a fraction intended to reflect our profitability; • If we fail to distribute during each year at least the sum of (1) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for the year, (2) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for such year (other than capital gain that we elect to retain and pay tax on) and (3) any undistributed taxable income from preceding periods, we will be subject to a 4% excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over amounts actually distributed; and • We will be subject to a 100% tax on the amount of any rents from real property, deductions or excess interest paid to us by any of our taxable REIT subsidiaries that would be reduced through reallocation under certain federal income tax principles in order to more clearly reflect income of the taxable REIT subsidiary. See  Qualification as a REIT  Investments in Taxable REIT Subsidiaries. • We may be subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax on any items of tax preference, including any deductions of net operating losses. If we acquire any assets from a corporation, which is or has been a C corporation, in a carryover basis transaction, we could be liable for specified liabilities that are inherited from the C corporation. A C corporation is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay full corporate level federal income tax. If we recognize gain on the disposition of the assets during the ten-year period beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us, then, to the extent of the assets built-in gain (i.e., the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the adjusted tax basis in the asset, in each case determined as of the beginning of the ten-year period), we will be subject to tax on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable. The results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of built-in gain assume that the built-in gain assets, at the time the built-in gain assets were subject to a conversion transaction (either where a C corporation elected REIT status or a REIT acquired the assets from a C corporation), were not treated as sold to an unrelated party and gain recognized. For those properties that are subject to the built-in-gains tax, if triggered by a sale within the ten-year period beginning on the date on which the properties were acquired by us, then the potential amount of built-in-gains tax will be an additional factor when considering a possible sale of the properties. Qualification as a REIT A REIT is defined as a corporation, trust or association: (1) which is managed by one or more trustees or directors; (2) the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest; (3) which would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for the federal income tax law relating to REITs; (4) which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company; 37 (5) the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons in each taxable year of the REIT except for its first taxable year; (6) not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned during the last half of each taxable year, excluding its first taxable year, directly or indirectly, by or for five or fewer individuals (which includes certain entities) (the Five or Fewer Requirement); and (7) which meets certain income and asset tests described below. Conditions (1) to (4), inclusive, must be met during the entire taxable year and condition (5) must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months. For purposes of conditions (5) and (6), pension funds and certain other tax-exempt entities are treated as individuals, subject to a look-through exception in the case of condition (6). We may own a number of properties through wholly owned subsidiaries. A corporation will qualify as a qualified REIT subsidiary if 100% of its stock is owned by a REIT, and the REIT does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable REIT subsidiary. A qualified REIT subsidiary will not be treated as a separate corporation, and all assets, liabilities and items of income, deductions and credits of a qualified REIT subsidiary will be treated as assets, liabilities and items (as the case may be) of the REIT. A qualified REIT subsidiary is not subject to federal income tax, and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified REIT subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than 10% of the value or total voting power of such issuer or more than 5% of the value of our total assets, as described below under  Asset Tests. If we invest in a partnership, a limited liability company or a trust taxed as a partnership or as a disregarded entity, we will be deemed to own a proportionate share of the partnerships, limited liability companys or trusts assets. Likewise, we will be treated as receiving our share of the income and loss of the partnership, limited liability company or trust, and the gross income will retain the same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the partnership, limited liability company or trust. These look-through rules apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests described below. Income Tests. There are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we must satisfy for each taxable year. • At least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale) must be directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from rents from real property, other income from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or certain income from qualified temporary investments. • At least 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale) must be directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from any of the sources qualifying for the 75% gross income test and from dividends (including dividends from taxable REIT subsidiaries) and interest. As to transactions entered into in taxable years beginning after October 22, 2004, any of our income from a clearly identified hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business, directly or indirectly, to manage the risk of interest rate movements, price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us, or 38 such other risks that are prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, is excluded from the 95% gross income test. Any of our income from a clearly identified hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business, directly or indirectly, to manage the risk of interest rate movements, price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us is excluded from the 95% and 75% gross income tests. Any of our income from a clearly identified hedging transaction entered into by us primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that is included in gross income in the 95% and 75% gross income tests is excluded from the 95% and 75% gross income tests. In general, a hedging transaction is clearly identified if (1) the transaction is identified as a hedging transaction before the end of the day on which it is entered into and (2) the items or risks being hedged are identified substantially contemporaneously with the hedging transaction. An identification is not substantially contemporaneous if it is made more than 35 days after entering into the hedging transaction. Passive foreign exchange gain for any taxable year will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 95% gross income test and real estate foreign exchange gain for any taxable year will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75% gross income test. Real estate foreign exchange gain is foreign currency gain (as defined in Internal Revenue Code section 988(b)(1)) which is attributable to: (i) any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 75% gross income test; (ii) the acquisition or ownership of obligations secured by mortgages on real property or interests in real property; or (iii) becoming or being the obligor under obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property. Real estate foreign exchange gain also includes Internal Revenue Code section 987 gain attributable to a qualified business unit (a QBU) of a REIT if the QBU itself meets the 75% income test for the taxable year and the 75% asset test at the close of each quarter that the REIT has directly or indirectly held the QBU. Real estate foreign exchange gain also includes any other foreign currency gain as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. Passive foreign exchange gain includes all real estate foreign exchange gain and foreign currency gain which is attributable to: (i) any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 95% gross income test; (ii) the acquisition or ownership of obligations; (iii) becoming or being the obligor under obligations; and (iv) any other foreign currency gain as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. Generally, other than income from clearly identified hedging transactions entered into by us in the normal course of business, any foreign currency gain derived by us from dealing, or engaging in substantial and regular trading, in securities will constitute gross income which does not qualify under the 95% or 75% gross income tests. Rents received by us will qualify as rents from real property for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a REIT only if several conditions are met: • The amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person, although rents generally will not be excluded merely because they are based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales. • Rents received from a tenant will not qualify as rents from real property if the REIT, or an owner of 10% or more of the REIT, also directly or constructively owns 10% or more 39 of the tenant, unless the tenant is our taxable REIT subsidiary and certain other requirements are met with respect to the real property being rented. • If rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property is greater than 15% of the total rent received under the lease, then the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as rents from real property. • For rents to qualify as rents from real property, we generally must not furnish or render services to tenants, other than through a taxable REIT subsidiary or an independent contractor from whom we derive no income, except that we may directly provide services that are usually or customarily rendered in the geographic area in which the property is located in connection with the rental of real property for occupancy only, or are not otherwise considered rendered to the occupant for his convenience. • The REIT may lease qualified health care properties on an arms-length basis to a taxable REIT subsidiary if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an independent contractor and who is, or is related to a person who is, actively engaged in the trade or business of operating health care facilities for any person unrelated to us or our taxable REIT subsidiary, an eligible independent contractor. Generally, the rent that the REIT receives from the taxable REIT subsidiary will be treated as rents from real property. A qualified health care property includes any real property and any personal property that is, or is necessary or incidental to the use of, a hospital, nursing facility, assisted living facility, congregate care facility, qualified continuing care facility, or other licensed facility which extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients and which is operated by a provider of such services which is eligible for participation in the Medicare program with respect to such facility. A REIT is permitted to render a de minimis amount of impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect to that property as rent from real property. The amount received or accrued by the REIT during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a property may not exceed 1% of all amounts received or accrued by the REIT directly or indirectly from the property. The amount received for any service or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150% of the direct cost of the REIT in furnishing or rendering the service or providing the management or operation. Furthermore, impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable REIT subsidiary subject to certain conditions, and we may still treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from real property. The term interest generally does not include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person, although an amount generally will not be excluded from the term interest solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage of receipts or sales. If we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless qualify as a REIT for such year if we are eligible for relief. These relief provisions generally will be available if (1) following our identification of the failure, we file a schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross income, and (2) the failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. It is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions. If these relief provisions apply, a 100% tax is imposed on an amount equal to (a) the gross income attributable to (1) 75% of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75% income test and (2) 95% of our gross income over the amount 40 of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95% income test, multiplied by (b) a fraction intended to reflect our profitability. The Secretary of the Treasury is given broad authority to determine whether particular items of income or gain qualify or not under the 75% and 95% gross income tests, or are to be excluded from the measure of gross income for such purposes. Asset Tests. Within 30 days after the close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must also satisfy several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. At least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets, cash, cash items (including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation), government securities and qualified temporary investments. Although the remaining 25% of our assets generally may be invested without restriction, we are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10% of either the vote (the 10% vote test) or value (the 10% value test) of the outstanding securities of any issuer other than a qualified REIT subsidiary, another REIT or a taxable REIT subsidiary. Further, no more than 25% of the total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (the 25% asset test) and no more than 5% of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any non-governmental issuer other than a qualified REIT subsidiary (the 5% asset test), another REIT or a taxable REIT subsidiary. Each of the 10% vote test, the 10% value test and the 25% and 5% asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each quarter. There are special rules which provide relief if the value related tests are not satisfied due to changes in the value of the assets of a REIT. Certain items are excluded from the 10% value test, including: (1) straight debt securities of an issuer (including straight debt that provides certain contingent payments); (2) any loan to an individual or an estate; (3) any rental agreement described in Section 467 of the Internal Revenue Code, other than with a related person; (4) any obligation to pay rents from real property; (5) certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision thereof, the District of Columbia, a foreign government, or any political subdivision thereof, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; (6) any security issued by a REIT; and (7) any other arrangement that, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, is excepted from the definition of security (excluded securities). Special rules apply to straight debt securities issued by corporations and entities taxable as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. If a REIT, or its taxable REIT subsidiary, holds (1) straight debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and (2) securities of such issuer that are not excluded securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1% of such issuers outstanding securities, the straight debt securities will be included in the 10% value test. A REITs interest as a partner in a partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10% value test to securities issued by the partnership. Further, any debt instrument issued by a partnership will not be a security for purposes of applying the 10% value test (1) to the extent of the REITs interest as a partner in the partnership and (2) if at least 75% of the partnerships gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) would qualify for the 75% gross income test. For purposes of the 10% value test, a REITs interest in a partnerships assets is determined by the REITs proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership (other than the excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph). If the REIT or its QBU uses a foreign currency as its functional currency, the term cash includes such foreign currency, but only to the extent such foreign currency is (i) held for use in the normal course of the activities of the REIT or QBU which give rise to items of income or gain that 41 are included in the 95% and 75% gross income tests or are directly related to acquiring or holding assets qualifying under the 75% asset test, and (ii) not held in connection with dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities. With respect to corrections of failures as to violations of the 10% vote test, the 10% value test or the 5% asset test, a REIT may avoid disqualification as a REIT by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation that does not exceed the lesser of 1% of the REITs assets at the end of the relevant quarter or $10,000,000, provided that the disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the quarter in which the REIT first identified the assets. For violations of any of the REIT asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that exceed the thresholds described in the preceding sentence, a REIT can avoid disqualification as a REIT after the close of a taxable quarter by taking certain steps, including disposition of sufficient assets within the six month period described above to meet the applicable asset test, paying a tax equal to the greater of $50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the non-qualifying assets during the period of time that the assets were held as non-qualifying assets and filing a schedule with the Internal Revenue Service that describes the non-qualifying assets. Investments in taxable REIT subsidiaries. REITs may own more than 10% of the voting power and value of securities in taxable REIT subsidiaries. We and any taxable corporate entity in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to treat such entity as a taxable REIT subsidiary. Certain of our subsidiaries have elected to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. Taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to full corporate level federal taxation on their earnings but are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot be performed directly by REITs without jeopardizing their REIT status. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes, but there can be no assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize taxes will be successful. To the extent our taxable REIT subsidiaries are required to pay federal, state or local taxes, the cash available for distribution as dividends to us from our taxable REIT subsidiaries will be reduced. The amount of interest on related-party debt that a taxable REIT subsidiary may deduct is limited. Further, a 100% tax applies to any interest payments by a taxable REIT subsidiary to its affiliated REIT to the extent the interest rate is not commercially reasonable. A taxable REIT subsidiary is permitted to deduct interest payments to unrelated parties without any of these restrictions. The Internal Revenue Service may reallocate costs between a REIT and its taxable REIT subsidiary where there is a lack of arms-length dealing between the parties. Any deductible expenses allocated away from a taxable REIT subsidiary would increase its tax liability. Further, any amount by which a REIT understates its deductions and overstates those of its taxable REIT subsidiary will, subject to certain exceptions, be subject to a 100% tax. Additional taxable REIT subsidiary elections may be made in the future for additional entities in which we own an interest. Annual distribution requirements. In order to avoid being taxed as a regular corporation, we are required to make distributions (other than capital gain distributions) to our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to (1) the sum of (i) 90% of our REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and (ii) 90% of the after-tax net income, if any, from foreclosure property, minus (2) a portion of certain items of non-cash income. These distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that 42 year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after such declaration. The amount distributed must not be preferential. This means that every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class, and no class of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a class. To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our REIT taxable income, as adjusted, we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates. Finally, as discussed above, we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements. We intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements. It is possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement, or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, due to, among other things, (1) timing differences between (i) the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and (ii) the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income, or (2) the payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us. In the event that timing differences occur, we may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or, if possible, pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement. Under certain circumstances, in the event of a deficiency determined by the Internal Revenue Service, we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying deficiency dividends to stockholders in a later year, which may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year. Thus, we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends; however, we will be required to pay applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividend distributions. Failure to Qualify as a REIT If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be required to be made in any year. All distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and, subject to certain limitations, will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate stockholders. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we also will be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost. It is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief. Failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities. In addition to the relief described above under  Income Tests and  Asset Tests, relief is available in the event that we violate a provision of the Internal Revenue Code that would result in our failure to qualify as a REIT if: (1) the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect; (2) we pay a penalty of $50,000 for each failure to satisfy the provision; and (3) the violation does not include a violation described under  Income Tests or  Asset Tests above. It is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions. 43 Federal Income Taxation of Holders of Our Stock Treatment of taxable U.S. stockholders. The following summary applies to you only if you are a U.S. stockholder. A U.S. stockholder is a holder of shares of stock who, for United States federal income tax purposes, is: • a citizen or resident of the United States; • a corporation, partnership or other entity classified as a corporation or partnership for these purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any political subdivision of the United States, including any state; • an estate, the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or • a trust, if, in general, a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the trusts administration and one or more U.S. persons, within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code, has the authority to control all of the trusts substantial decisions. So long as we qualify for taxation as a REIT, distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions (and not designated as capital gain dividends) will be includable as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes. None of these distributions will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for U.S. corporate stockholders. Generally, for the taxable year ending December 31, 2012, the maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 15%. Except in limited circumstances, this tax rate will not apply to dividends paid to you by us on our shares, because generally we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our REIT taxable income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders. The reduced maximum federal income tax rate will apply to that portion, if any, of dividends received by you with respect to our shares that are attributable to: (1) dividends received by us from non-REIT corporations or other taxable REIT subsidiaries; (2) income from the prior year with respect to which we were required to pay federal corporate income tax during the prior year (if, for example, we did not distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income for the prior year); or (3) the amount of any earnings and profits that were distributed by us and accumulated in a non-REIT year. Distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as long-term capital gains (to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year), without regard to the period for which you held our stock. However, if you are a corporation, you may be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income. If we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net long-term capital gain, you would include in income, as long-term capital gain, your proportionate share of this net long-term capital gain. You would also receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains, and you would have an increase in the basis of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid. You may not include in your federal income tax return any of our net operating losses or capital losses. Federal income tax rules may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be apportioned to you. In addition, any distribution declared by us in October, November 44 or December of any year on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by you on December 31 of that year, provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than January 31 of the following year. We will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4% excise tax discussed under  General and  Qualification as a REIT  Annual Distribution Requirements above. As a result, you may be required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions that would otherwise result in a tax-free return of capital. Moreover, any deficiency dividend will be treated as a dividend (an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend, as the case may be), regardless of our earnings and profits. Any other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to you to the extent these distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our stock. You will be required to reduce the tax basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero, after which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain, if the shares of our stock are held as capital assets. The tax basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain or loss, if any, realized upon sale of the shares of our stock. Any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which were held for six months or less (after application of certain holding period rules) will generally be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain distributions with respect to these shares of our stock. Upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our stock (whether actually or constructively owned) with us, you will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock. This gain will be capital gain if you held these shares of our stock as a capital asset. If we redeem any of your shares in us, the treatment can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of redemption. In general, you will recognize gain or loss (as opposed to dividend income) equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption: (1) results in a complete termination of your interest in all classes of our equity securities; (2) is a substantially disproportionate redemption; or (3) is not essentially equivalent to a dividend with respect to you. In applying these tests, you must take into account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities (e.g., common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants). You also must take into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively owned by you. If, as a result of a redemption by us of your shares, you no longer own (either actually or constructively) any of our equity securities or only own (actually and constructively) an insubstantial percentage of our equity securities, then it is probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered not essentially equivalent to a dividend and, thus, would result in gain or loss to you. However, whether a distribution is not essentially equivalent to a dividend depends on all of the facts and circumstances, and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption, you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to the particular situation. Generally, if the redemption does not meet the tests described above, then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits. If the redemption is taxed as a dividend, your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will be transferred to any other 45 shareholdings in us that you own. If you own no other shareholdings in us, under certain circumstances, such basis may be transferred to a related person, or it may be lost entirely. Gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is generally taxed at a maximum long-term capital gain rate. Pursuant to Internal Revenue Service guidance, we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends as gains eligible for the long-term capital gains rate or as gain taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25%. Capital losses recognized by a stockholder upon the disposition of our shares held for more than one year at the time of disposition will be considered long term capital losses, and are generally available only to offset capital gain income of the stockholder but not ordinary income (except in the case of individuals, who may offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year). On March 30, 2010, the President signed into law the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which requires U.S. stockholders who meet certain requirements and are individuals, estates or certain trusts to pay an additional 3.8% tax on, among other things, dividends on and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of stock for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012. U.S. stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this legislation on their ownership and disposition of shares of our stock. Treatment of tax-exempt U.S. stockholders. Tax-exempt entities, including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts (Exempt Organizations), generally are exempt from federal income taxation. However, they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income (UBTI). The Internal Revenue Service has issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a REIT to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute UBTI, provided that the shares of the REIT are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust. Based on this ruling, amounts distributed by us to Exempt Organizations generally should not constitute UBTI. However, if an Exempt Organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with debt, a portion of its income from us will constitute UBTI pursuant to the debt financed property rules. Likewise, a portion of the Exempt Organizations income from us would constitute UBTI if we held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit. In addition, in certain circumstances, a pension trust that owns more than 10% of our stock is required to treat a percentage of our dividends as UBTI. This rule applies to a pension trust holding more than 10% of our stock only if: (1) the percentage of our income that is UBTI (determined as if we were a pension trust) is at least 5%; (2) we qualify as a REIT by reason of the modification of the Five or Fewer Requirement that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension trust; and (3) either (i) one pension trust owns more than 25% of the value of our stock, or (ii) a group of pension trusts individually holding more than 10% of the value of our stock collectively own more than 50% of the value of our stock. Backup withholding and information reporting. Under certain circumstances, you may be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments made with respect to, or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of, shares of our stock. Backup withholding will apply only if you: (1) fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number, which if you are an individual, is ordinarily your social security number; (2) furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number; (3) are notified by the Internal Revenue Service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends; or (4) fail to certify, under penalties of perjury, that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification 46 number and that the Internal Revenue Service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding. Backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients, such as corporations and tax-exempt organizations. You should consult with a tax advisor regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding, and the procedure for obtaining an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a stockholder will be allowed as a credit against such stockholders United States federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund, provided that the required information is provided to the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made to stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to certify their non-foreign status. Taxation of foreign stockholders. The following summary applies to you only if you are a foreign person. The federal taxation of foreign persons is a highly complex matter that may be affected by many considerations. Except as discussed below, distributions to you of cash generated by our real estate operations in the form of ordinary dividends, but not by the sale or exchange of our capital assets, generally will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a rate of 30%, unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that tax and you file with us the required form evidencing the lower rate. In general, you will be subject to United States federal income tax on a graduated rate basis rather than withholding with respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States. A corporate foreign stockholder that receives income that is, or is treated as, effectively connected with a United States trade or business may also be subject to the branch profits tax, which is payable in addition to regular United States corporate income tax. The following discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose investment in us is not so effectively connected. We expect to withhold United States income tax, as described below, on the gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless (1) you file an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI with us claiming that the distribution is effectively connected or (2) certain other exceptions apply. Distributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a United States real property interest will be taxed to you under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (FIRPTA) as if these distributions were gains effectively connected with a United States trade or business. Accordingly, you will be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a U.S. stockholder on these amounts, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals. Distributions subject to FIRPTA may also be subject to a branch profits tax in the hands of a corporate foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty exemption. We will be required to withhold from distributions subject to FIRPTA, and remit to the Internal Revenue Service, 35% of designated capital gain dividends, or, if greater, 35% of the amount of any distributions that could be designated as capital gain dividends. In addition, if we designate prior distributions as capital gain dividends, subsequent distributions, up to the amount of the prior distributions not withheld against, will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding. 47 Any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign stockholder did not own more than 5% of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year. Foreign stockholders generally will not be required to report distributions received from us on U.S. federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (including any such capital gain dividends) will be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax (unless reduced under an applicable income tax treaty) as discussed above. In addition, the branch profits tax will not apply to such distributions. Unless our shares constitute a United States real property interest within the meaning of FIRPTA or are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, a sale of our shares by you generally will not be subject to United States taxation. Our shares will not constitute a United States real property interest if we qualify as a domestically controlled REIT. We believe that we, and expect to continue to, qualify as a domestically controlled REIT. A domestically controlled REIT is a REIT in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50% in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by foreign stockholders. However, if you are a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions apply, you will be subject to a 30% tax on such capital gains. In any event, a purchaser of our shares from you will not be required under FIRPTA to withhold on the purchase price if the purchased shares are regularly traded on an established securities market or if we are a domestically controlled REIT. Otherwise, under FIRPTA, the purchaser may be required to withhold 10% of the purchase price and remit such amount to the Internal Revenue Service. Backup withholding tax and information reporting will generally not apply to distributions paid to you outside the United States that are treated as: (1) dividends to which the 30% or lower treaty rate withholding tax discussed above applies; (2) capital gains dividends; or (3) distributions attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by us of U.S. real property interests. Payment of the proceeds of a sale of stock within the United States or conducted through certain U.S. related financial intermediaries is subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that he or she is not a U.S. person (and the payor does not have actual knowledge that the beneficial owner is a U.S. person) or otherwise established an exemption. You may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the Internal Revenue Service. Recently enacted legislation will impose U.S. withholding tax at a rate of 30% after December 31, 2013 on dividends in respect of, and after December 31, 2014 on gross proceeds from the sale of, shares of our stock held by or through certain foreign financial institutions (including investment funds), unless such institution enters into an agreement with the Secretary of the Treasury to report, on an annual basis, information with respect to shares in the institution held by certain U.S. persons and by certain non-U.S. entities that are wholly or partially owned by U.S. persons, and to withhold on certain payments. Accordingly, the entity through which shares of stock is held will affect the determination of whether such withholding is required. Similarly, dividends in respect of, and gross proceeds from the sale of, shares of our stock held by an investor that is a non-financial non-U.S. entity will be subject to withholding at a rate of 30%, unless such entity either (i) certifies to us that such entity does not have any "substantial United States owners" or (ii) provides certain information regarding the entity's "substantial United States owners," which we will in turn provide to the Secretary of the Treasury. If payment of withholding taxes is required, stockholders that are otherwise eligible for an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. withholding taxes with respect to such dividends and proceeds will be required to seek a refund from the Internal Revenue Service to 48 obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction. We will not pay any additional amounts to any stockholders in respect of any amounts withheld. Foreign persons are encouraged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of the legislation on their investment in shares of our stock. 49 Risks Related to Our Transition to a REIT As part of the Reorganization, we simultaneously (i) disposed of our gaming assets and (ii) acquired West Paces as a new wholly-owned subsidiary and (iii) started to focus future operations on the acquisition and maintenance of healthcare facilities. The Company now operates as a REIT under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). The following are some risk factors related to our REIT operations. The section below discusses the most significant risk factors that may materially adversely affect our proposed business, results of operations and financial condition. As set forth below, we believe that the risks facing our company generally fall into the following three categories: • Risks related to our business; • Risks related to tax matters, including REIT-related risks; and • Risks related to our legal organizational structure. Risks Related to Our Proposed Business as a REIT Volatility or disruption in the financial markets may impair our ability to raise capital, obtain new financing or refinance existing obligations and fund real estate and development activities. The global financial markets recently have undergone and may continue to experience pervasive and fundamental disruptions. While the capital markets have shown signs of improvement, the sustainability of an economic recovery is uncertain and additional levels of market disruption and volatility could materially adversely impact our ability to raise capital, obtain new financing or refinance our existing obligations as they mature and fund real estate and development activities. Market volatility could also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation of our investments and those of our joint ventures, that may result in a substantial decrease in the value of our properties and those of our joint ventures. As a result, we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of such investments and the associated goodwill, if any, which may require us to recognize impairment charges in earnings. We will rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs and limitations on our access to such capital could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments as they become due or make future investments necessary to grow our business. We may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations. If we are unable to obtain enough internal capital, we may need to rely on external sources of capital (including debt and equity financing) to fulfill our capital requirements. If we cannot access these external sources of capital, we may not be able to make the investments needed to grow our business and to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors, some of which we have little or no control over, including but not limited to: • general availability of credit and market conditions, including rising interest rates and increased borrowing cost; 50 • the market price of the shares of our equity securities and the credit ratings of our debt and preferred securities; • the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; • our degree of financial leverage and operational flexibility; • the financial integrity of our lenders, which might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us, and our inability to replace the financing commitment of any such lender on favorable terms, or at all; • the stability in the market value of our properties; • the financial performance of our operators, tenants and borrowers; and • issues facing the healthcare industry, including, but not limited to, healthcare reform and changes in government reimbursement policies. If our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors, it could have a material adverse impact on our ability to refinance our debt obligations, fund dividend payments, acquire properties and fund operations and development activities. Adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, and negatively impact the market price of our securities, including our common stock. The credit ratings of our debt and equity securities are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us. Our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event that our current credit ratings deteriorate, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments. Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments. Our level of indebtedness may increase and materially adversely affect our future operations. We plan to incur substantial indebtedness in the future, including in connection with the development or acquisition of assets, which may be substantial. Any significant additional indebtedness could negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness. Greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends, conduct development activities, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, or carry out other aspects of our business strategy. Increased indebtedness can also limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions, make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels. Increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility, including our ability to finance or refinance our properties, contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed. 51 Covenants related to our indebtedness limit our operational flexibility and breaches of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our credit facilities will likely require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining certain levels of debt service coverage and leverage ratio, tangible net worth requirements and maintaining REIT status. Our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general will be subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants, which limit our operational flexibility. For example, mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability, without the consent of the lender, to further encumber or sell the applicable properties, or to replace the applicable tenant or operator. Breaches of certain covenants may result in defaults under the mortgages on our properties and cross-defaults under certain of our other indebtedness, even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee. Additionally, defaults under the leases or operating agreements related to mortgaged properties, including defaults associated with the bankruptcy of the applicable tenant or operator, may result in a default under the underlying mortgage and cross-defaults under certain of our other indebtedness. Covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults under our debt instruments could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. An increase in interest rates could increase interest cost on new debt, and could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell assets and limit our acquisition, investment and development activities. If interest rates increase, so could our interest costs for any new debt. This increased cost could make the financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly. Rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures, or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. Unfavorable resolution of litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. We may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operators and tenants in which such operators and tenants have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses. An unfavorable resolution of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management. There can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, litigation. In addition, litigation, government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations. We may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estate-related loans and, even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts, we may be unable to successfully 52 operate, occupy or reposition the underlying real estate, which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments. If an operator or tenant defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans, we may have to foreclose on the loan or protect our interest by acquiring title to the collateral and thereafter making substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the property's investment potential. In some cases, as noted above, the collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property or interests in operating facilities and, accordingly, we may not have full recourse to assets of that entity. Operators, tenants or borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies and/or bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations. Foreclosure-related costs, high loan-to-value ratios or declines in the value of the facility may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan upon foreclosure, and we may be required to record valuation allowance for such losses. Even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estate-related loans, we may inherit properties for which we may be unable to expeditiously seek tenants or operators, if at all, which would adversely affect our ability to fully recover our investment. Required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our healthcare facilities. Transfers of healthcare facilities to successor tenants or operators may be subject to regulatory approvals or ratifications, including, but not limited to, change of ownership approvals under certificate of need laws and Medicare and Medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate. The replacement of any tenant or operator could be delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal, state or local government agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility. If we are unable to find a suitable replacement tenant or operator upon favorable terms, or at all, we may take possession of a facility, which might expose us to successor liability or require us to indemnify subsequent operators to whom we might transfer the operating rights and licenses, all of which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase or develop suitable healthcare facilities to grow our investment portfolio. We face significant competition from other REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, healthcare operators, lenders, developers and other institutional investors, some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do. Increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell, thereby impeding our investment, acquisition and development activities. If we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline, identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices or if we are unable to finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. 53 We may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make certain of our healthcare properties suitable for other operators and tenants. Healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to non-healthcare-related uses. The improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use, such as upgrading electrical, gas and plumbing infrastructure, are costly and at times tenant-specific. A new or replacement operator or tenant may require different features in a property, depending on that operator's or tenant's particular operations. If a current operator or tenant is unable to pay rent and vacates a property, we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property before we are able to secure another operator or tenant. Also, if the property needs to be renovated to accommodate multiple operators or tenants, we may incur substantial expenditures before we are able to re-lease the space. These expenditures or renovations may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We face additional risks associated with property development that can render a project less profitable or not profitable at all and, under certain circumstances, prevent completion of development activities once undertaken. Large-scale, ground-up development of healthcare properties presents additional risks for us, including risks that: • a development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources resulting in the loss of deposits or failure to recover expenses already incurred; • the development and construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates due to increased interest rates and higher materials, transportation, labor, leasing or other costs, which could make the completion of the development project less profitable; • construction and/or permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all; • the project may not be completed on schedule, which can result in increases in construction costs and debt service expenses as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond our control, including natural disasters, labor conditions, material shortages, regulatory hurdles, civil unrest and acts of war; and • occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not meet expected levels and could be insufficient to make the property profitable. These risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and, under certain circumstances, could prevent completion of development activities once undertaken, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments. We may develop and/or acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures. Our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership, including: • we could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decision-making authority, which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes, including litigation or arbitration; 54 • our joint venture partners could have investment goals that are not consistent with our investment objectives, including the timing, terms and strategies for any investments; • our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted; • our joint venture partners might become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner, which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital; and • our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues. From time to time, we may acquire other companies and if we are unable to successfully integrate these operations, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently. Successful integration of the operations of these companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations, systems, procedures, properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs. We may encounter difficulties in these integrations. Potential difficulties associated with acquisitions include the loss of key employees, the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity, possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies and the assumption of unexpected liabilities, including: • liabilities relating to the clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; • unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the seller; • liabilities, claims and litigation, whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business, relating to periods prior to our acquisition; • claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the seller; and • liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition. In addition, the acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected, including in respect of estimated cost savings. Inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues. Similarly, we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use. If we have difficulties with any of these areas, or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies, we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect from our acquisitions, and this may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. From time to time we may seek to make one or more material acquisitions which may involve the expenditure of significant funds. We regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize shareholder value and believe that currently there are available a number of acquisition opportunities that would be complementary to our business, given the recent industry consolidation trend. In connection with our review of such transactions, we regularly engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates, some of which are material. Any future acquisitions could require the issuance of securities, the incurrence of debt, assumption of contingent liabilities or incurrence of significant expenditures, any of which could 55 materially adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the financing required for such acquisitions may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all. Loss of our key personnel could temporarily disrupt our operations and adversely affect us. We are dependent on the efforts of our executive officers, and competition for these individuals is intense. Although our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief investment officer and general counsel have employment agreements with us, we cannot assure you that they will remain employed with us. The loss or limited availability of the services of any of our executive officers, or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could, at least temporarily, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and be negatively perceived in the capital markets. Our principal executive officer holds other positions that create potential conflicts of interest. We will rely primarily on the services of our principal executive officer, Christopher Brogdon. Mr. Brogdon has extensive experience in acquiring and operating properties dedicated to the healthcare industry. In addition, Mr. Brogdon is currently a director of AdCare Health Systems, Inc., (NYSE MKT, LLC: ADK, AdCare). Under the terms of an employment agreement, with AdCare, Mr. Brogdon is contractually obligated to offer all healthcare related property acquisition opportunities first to AdCare under a right of first refusal. Only if AdCare declines the opportunity could Mr. Brogdon then offer the acquisition to us. This contractual right of first refusal could limit the number and quality of properties that Mr. Brogdon can offer to us. We may experience uninsured or underinsured losses which could result in a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property, decrease anticipated future revenues or cause us to incur unanticipated expense. We will maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage, and we continually review the insurance maintained by us. However, a number of our properties may be located in areas exposed to earthquake, windstorm, flood and other natural disasters and may be subject to other losses. In particular, our life science portfolio is concentrated in areas known to be subject to earthquake activity. While we will purchase insurance for earthquake, windstorm, flood and other natural disasters that we believe is adequate in light of current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants, there is no assurance that such insurance will fully cover such losses. These losses can decrease our anticipated revenues from a property and result in the loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property. The insurance market for such exposures can be very volatile and we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis in the future. In addition, there are certain exposures where insurance is not purchased as we do not believe it is economically feasible to do so or where there is no viable insurance market. Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estate related investments may materially impair the value of those investments. Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, as a current or previous owner of real estate, we may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic 56 substances or petroleum released at a property, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by the third parties in connection with the contamination. In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. Although we (i) currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount and subject to deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable, and (ii) generally require our operators and tenants to undertake to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause, such liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance, the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may materially adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. As the owner of a site, we may also be held liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site. Although we are generally indemnified by the current operators or tenants of our properties for contamination caused by them, these indemnities may not adequately cover all environmental costs. We may also experience environmental liabilities arising from conditions not known to us. The bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major operators or tenants may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We will likely lease our properties directly to operators in most cases, and in certain other cases, we will lease to third-party tenants who enter into long-term management agreements with operators to manage the properties. Although our leases, financing arrangements and other agreements with our tenants and operators generally provide us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease, evict an operator or tenant, or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable, or at the least, delay our ability to pursue such remedies. For example, we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing. A debtor has the right to assume, or to assume and assign to a third party, or to reject its unexpired contracts in a bankruptcy proceeding. If a debtor were to reject its leases with us, our claim against the debtor for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease. In addition, the inability of our tenants or operators to make payments or comply with certain other lease obligations may affect our compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt securities, credit facilities and the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such tenants and operators. In addition, under certain conditions, defaults under the underlying mortgages may result in cross-default under our other indebtedness. Although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements in those circumstances, the bankruptcy of an applicable operator or tenant may potentially result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available, delays in the availability of funding or other material adverse consequences. In addition, many of our facilities are leased to health care providers who provide long-term custodial care to the elderly; evicting such operators for failure to pay rent while the facility is occupied may be a difficult and slow process and may not be successful. 57 The current U.S. housing market may adversely affect our operators' and tenants' abilities to increase or maintain occupancy levels at, and rental income from, our senior housing facilities. Our tenants and operators may have relatively flat or declining occupancy levels in the near-term due to falling home prices, declining incomes, stagnant home sales and other economic factors. Seniors may choose to postpone their plans to move into senior housing facilities rather than sell their homes at a loss, or for a profit below their expectations. Moreover, tightening lending standards have made it more difficult for potential buyers to obtain mortgage financing, all of which have contributed to the declining home sales. In addition, the senior housing segment may continue to experience a decline in occupancy associated with private pay residents choosing to move out of the facilities to be cared for at home by relatives due to the weak economy. A material decline in our tenants' and operators' occupancy levels and revenues may make it more difficult for them to meet their financial obligations to us, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Operators and tenants that fail to comply with the requirements of governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid, may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us. Our operators and tenants are affected by an extremely complex set of federal, state and local laws and regulations that are subject to frequent and substantial changes (sometimes applied retroactively) resulting from legislation, adoption of rules and regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law. For example, to the extent that any of our operators or tenants receives a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such revenues may be subject to: • statutory and regulatory changes; • retroactive rate adjustments; • recovery of program overpayments or set-offs; • administrative rulings; • policy interpretations; • payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers; • government funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to specific facilities); and • interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such property. In recent years, governmental payors have frozen or reduced payments to healthcare providers due to budgetary pressures. Healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of significant importance to federal and state authorities. We cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future legislative reforms may have on our operators' and tenants' costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other third-party payors. The failure of any of our operators or tenants to comply with these laws, requirements and regulations could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us. 58 Operators and tenants that fail to comply with federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection laws and regulations may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us. Certain of our operators and tenants are subject to extensive federal, state, local and industry-related licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations and standards. Our operators' or tenants' failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations or standards could result in loss of accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension or decertification from federal and state healthcare programs, loss of license or closure of the facility. For example, certain of our properties may require a license, registration and/or certificate of need to operate. Failure of any operator or tenant to obtain a license, registration or certificate of need, or loss of a required license, registration or certificate of need, would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by such operator or tenant. Additionally, failure of our operators and tenants to generally comply with applicable laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on facilities owned by or mortgaged to us, and therefore may materially adversely impact us. The impact that the comprehensive healthcare regulation enacted in 2010 may have on us, as well as our operators and tenants, cannot be accurately predicted. Legislative proposals are introduced or proposed in Congress and in some state legislatures each year that would affect major changes in the healthcare system, either nationally or at the state level. Notably, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, along with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the "Affordable Care Act"). The passage of the Affordable Care Act has resulted in comprehensive reform legislation that is expected to expand health care coverage to millions of currently uninsured people beginning in 2014 and provide for significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system over the next ten years. To help fund this expansion, the Affordable Care Act outlines certain reductions in Medicare reimbursement rates for various healthcare providers, including long-term acute care hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, as well as certain other changes to Medicare payment methodologies. This comprehensive health care legislation provides for extensive future rulemaking by regulatory authorities, and also may be altered or amended. We cannot accurately predict whether any legislative proposals will be adopted or, if adopted, what effect, if any, these proposals would have on our operators and tenants and, thus, our business. Similarly, while we can anticipate that some of the rulemaking that will be promulgated by regulatory authorities will affect our operators and tenants and the manner in which they are reimbursed by the federal health care programs, we cannot accurately predict today the impact of those regulations on our operators and tenants and thus on our business. Increased competition, as well as an inability to grow revenues as originally forecast, have resulted and may further result in lower net revenues for some of our operators and tenants and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us. The healthcare industry is highly competitive and can become more competitive in the future. The occupancy levels at, and rental income from, our facilities is dependent on our ability and the ability of our operators and tenants to maintain and increase such levels and income and to compete with entities that have substantial capital resources. These entities compete with other operators and tenants on a number of different levels, including the quality of care provided, reputation, the physical appearance of a facility, price, the range of services offered, family preference, alternatives for healthcare delivery, the supply of competing properties, physicians, staff, referral sources, 59 location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area. Private, federal and state payment programs and the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of the properties and their tenants. Our operators and tenants also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies, life care at home, community-based service programs, retirement communities and convalescent centers. Such competition, which has intensified due to overbuilding in some segments in which we invest, has caused the occupancy rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease. We cannot be certain that the operators and tenants of all of our facilities will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us. Further, many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our operators and tenants. Thus, our operators and tenants may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their businesses which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us, potentially decreasing our revenues, impairing our assets, and increasing our collection and dispute costs. Our operators and tenants may not procure the necessary insurance to adequately insure against losses. Our leases generally require our tenants and operators to secure and maintain comprehensive liability and property insurance that covers us, as well as the tenants and operators. Some types of losses may not be adequately insured by our tenants and operators. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could incur liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property. In such an event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. We continually review the insurance maintained by our tenants and operators and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry. However, we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses, or losses in excess of insurance proceeds, will not occur in the future. Our operators and tenants are faced with litigation and may experience rising liability and insurance costs. In some states, advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities and these groups have brought litigation against the operators and tenants of such facilities. Also, in several instances, private litigation by patients has succeeded in winning large damage awards for alleged abuses. The effect of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our operators and tenants for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance. In addition, their cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase so long as the present healthcare litigation environment continues. Cost increases could cause our operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance, potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs. In addition, as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities, we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits allegedly arising from the actions of our operators or tenants, for which claims such operators and tenants have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against, but which may require unanticipated expenditures on our part. 60 Tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation, expense and uncertainty. Should we have life science tenants in the future, particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products, are subject to certain unique risks, as follows: • some of our tenants require significant outlays of funds for the research, development and clinical testing of their products and technologies. If private investors, the government or other sources of funding are unavailable to support such activities, a tenant's business may be adversely affected or fail; • the research, development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants' products require federal, state and foreign regulatory approvals which may be costly or difficult to obtain; • even after a life science tenant gains regulatory approval and market acceptance, the product may still present significant regulatory and liability risks, including, among others, the possible later discovery of safety concerns, competition from new products, and ultimately the expiration of patent protection for the product; • our tenants with marketable products may be adversely affected by healthcare reform and the reimbursement policies of government or private healthcare payors; and • our tenants may be unable to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent, copyright or trade secret laws. We cannot assure you that our life science tenants will be successful in their businesses. If our tenants' businesses are adversely affected, they may have difficulty making payments to us, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks Related to General Economic Conditions Current economic conditions in the global economy, including ongoing disruptions in the debt and equity capital markets, may adversely affect our business, our results of operations, and our ability to obtain financing. The global economic environment is currently volatile and uncertain, and the future economic environment may continue to be less favorable than that of recent years. The retail industry has experienced and may continue to experience significant downturns in connection with, or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions. The current economic environment has been characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, leading to lowered demand for products and resulting in fewer customers visiting, and customers spending less, which could adversely affect our revenues. In addition, further declines in consumer and commercial spending may drive us and our competitors to reduce pricing, which would have a negative impact on our gross profit. We are unable to predict the timing, duration, and severity of any disruptions in debt and equity capital markets and adverse economic conditions in the United States and other countries, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, in part because we are dependent upon customer behavior and the impact on consumer spending that market disruptions may have. The global stock and credit markets have recently experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective and outstanding debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for 61 certain financings materially less attractive, and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing. This volatility and illiquidity has negatively affected a broad range of mortgage and asset-backed and other fixed income securities. As a result, the market for fixed income securities has experienced decreased liquidity, increased price volatility, credit downgrade events, and increased defaults. Global equity markets have also been experiencing heightened volatility and turmoil, with issuers exposed to the credit markets particularly affected. These factors and the continuing market disruption have an adverse effect on us, in part because we, like many companies, from time to time may need to raise capital in debt and equity capital markets including in the asset-backed securities markets. In addition, continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively affect our ability to access additional short-term and long-term financing, including future securitization transactions, on reasonable terms or at all, which would negatively impact our liquidity and financial condition. In addition, if one or more of the financial institutions that support our future credit facilities fails, we may not be able to find a replacement, which would negatively impact our ability to borrow under the credit facilities. These disruptions in the financial markets also may adversely affect our credit rating and the market value of our common stock. If the current pressures on credit continue or worsen, we may not be able to refinance, if necessary, our outstanding debt when due, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If our operating results worsen significantly and our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates increase significantly, we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. A worsening of the United States economy could materially adversely affect our business. The success of our business operations depends significantly on consumer confidence and spending, which have deteriorated as a result of the worldwide economic downturn. This economic downturn and decrease in consumer spending adversely impacted our revenue, and it may continue to adversely impact our revenue, ability to market our products, build customer loyalty, or otherwise implement our business strategy. If the current economic situation persists, or deteriorates significantly, our business could be negatively impacted. Risks Related to our Qualification as a REIT To qualify as a REIT and Pass-Through Status, we must comply with all the requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify as a REIT, we must comply with each of the following requirements: • be structured as a corporation, business trust or similar association; • be managed by a board of directors or trustees; • offer fully transferable shares; • have at least 100 shareholders; • pay dividends of at least 90 percent of the REITs taxable income; • have no more than 50% of our shares held by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year; • hold at least 75% of total investment assets in real estate; • have no more than 20% of our assets consist of securities in taxable REIT 62 subsidiaries; and • derive at least 75% of gross income from rents or mortgage interest. At least 95% of a REITs gross income must come from financial investments. These include rents, dividends, interest and capital gains (the 95% income test). In addition, at least 75% of its income must come from certain real estate sources (the 75% income test) including rents from real property, gains from the sale or other disposition of real property, and income and gain derived from foreclosure of property. Our Articles of Incorporation will be amended to limit the amount of shares that can be beneficially owned by any single shareholder. In order to ensure that the Company does not inadvertently violate the REIT requirement that no more than 50% of our shares are owned by five or fewer individuals, our Articles of Incorporation will be amended to limit the shareholdings of any shareholder to no more than 9.8% of our issued and outstanding shares. If a shareholder violates this limitation, the Company is authorized to redeem the excess shares at market value. Until so redeemed, the excess shares cannot exercise voting rights, are not considered outstanding for purposes of determining a quorum at shareholder meetings, and distributions on excess shares are quarantined into an escrow account until the shareholder reduces their ownership to 9.8% or less. We might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT. We intend to operate as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a manner. If we lose our status as a REIT, we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders because: • we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates; • we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and • unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified. Since REIT qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them, and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of U.S. federal and other income taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders. If we do not qualify as a REIT, we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a non-REIT is not required to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain REIT status or avoid an excise tax. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, all distributions to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction, and individual 63 stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to long-term capital gains (currently at a maximum rate of 15%) with respect to distributions. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT. Although we believe that we qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The 90% annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions. To comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to REITs and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement, or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. This may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. In addition, non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. In the event that timing differences occur, or we deem it appropriate to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in another transaction intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. This may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations. The amount of additional indebtedness we may incur is limited by the terms of our line of credit arrangement and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes. In addition, adverse economic conditions may impact the availability of additional funds or could cause the terms on which we are able to borrow additional funds to become unfavorable. In those circumstances, we may be required to raise additional equity in the capital markets. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control, including rising interest rates, inflation and other general market conditions and the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of the shares of our capital stock. We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature. The lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to special requirements. We may lease certain qualified health care properties we acquire to taxable REIT subsidiaries (or limited liability companies of which the taxable REIT subsidiaries are members), which lessees 64 contract with managers (or related parties) to manage the health care operations at these properties. The rents from this taxable REIT subsidiary lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if (1) they are paid pursuant to an arms-length lease of a qualified health care property with a taxable REIT subsidiary and (2) the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor. If any of these conditions are not satisfied, then the rents will not be qualifying rents. If certain sale-leaseback transactions are not characterized by the Internal Revenue Service as true leases, we may be subject to adverse tax consequences. We may purchase certain properties and lease them back to the sellers of such properties. We intend for any such sale-leaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease will be characterized as a true lease, thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, depending on the terms of any specific transaction, the Internal Revenue Service might take the position that the transaction is not a true lease but is more properly treated in some other manner. In the event any sale-leaseback transaction is challenged and successfully re-characterized by the Internal Revenue Service, we would not be entitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and cost recovery generally available to an owner of property. Furthermore, if a sale-leaseback transaction were so re-characterized, we might fail to satisfy the REIT asset tests or income tests and, consequently, could lose our REIT status effective with the year of re-characterization. Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxable income could be recalculated, which may cause us to fail to meet the REIT annual distribution requirements for a taxable year. 65 ITEM 1B.
