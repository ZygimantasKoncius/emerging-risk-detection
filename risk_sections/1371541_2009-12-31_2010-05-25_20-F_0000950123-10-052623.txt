D. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Company and Our Industry Demand for our PV products has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the current economic and credit environment. Demand for our PV products has been affected by recent global economic conditions, capital markets fluctuations and credit disruptions. Beginning in the second half of 2008, many of our key markets, including Germany, Spain and the United States, and other national economies have experienced a period of economic contraction or significantly slower economic growth. The global financial crisis, weak consumer confidence and diminished consumer and business spending have contributed to a significant slowdown in the market demand for PV products due to decreased energy requirements. Near-term economic recovery remains uncertain. We cannot provide assurance that when an economic recovery does occur, the demand for our PV products will increase. 5 Table of Contents In addition, many of our customers and many end-users of our PV products depend on debt financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to purchase our PV products. Due to the global credit crisis, many of our customers and many end-users of our PV products have experienced difficulties in obtaining financing, and even if they have been able to obtain financing, the cost of such financing has increased and they may change their decision or change the timing of their decision to purchase our PV products. Furthermore, interest rates have fluctuated recently, which could increase the cost of financing. Given the current credit environment, in particular the tightening of the credit markets, there can be no assurance that our customers or end-users will be able to obtain financing on a timely basis or on reasonable terms, which could have a negative impact on their demand for our products. Rising interest rates may also make certain alternative investments more attractive to investors, and therefore lead to a decline in demand for our PV products. A protracted disruption in the ability of our customers to obtain financing could lead to a significant reduction in future orders for our PV products, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As silicon supply increases, the corresponding increase in the global supply of PV modules may cause substantial downward pressure on the price of PV products and reduce our revenues and net income. Silicon is an essential raw material used in the production of solar cells and modules. Prior to mid-2008, there was an industry-wide shortage of silicon. Increases in the price of silicon have in the past increased our production costs, and any significant price increase in the future may adversely impact our business and results of operations. Due to the historical scarcity of silicon, supply chain management and financial strength were the key barriers to entry. In late 2008 and 2009, however, newly available silicon capacity has resulted in an increased supply of silicon, which resulted in downward pressure on the price of silicon. However, we cannot assure you that the price of silicon will continue to decline or remain at its current levels, especially if the global solar power market regains its growth momentum. As the shortage of silicon eases, industry barriers to entry become less significant and PV module production may increase globally. A decrease in silicon prices and an increase in PV module production may result in substantial downward pressure on the price of PV modules. Such price reductions could have a negative impact on our revenues and net income, and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our ability to adjust our raw material costs may be limited as a result of our entering into multi-year supply agreements with many of our silicon and silicon wafer suppliers, and it may be difficult for us to respond in a timely manner to rapidly changing market conditions, which could materially and adversely affect our cost of revenues and profitability. Prior to mid-2008, there was an industry-wide shortage of silicon and silicon wafers, which resulted in significant increases in the prices of these raw materials. To secure an adequate and timely supply of silicon and silicon wafers during the earlier periods of supply shortage, we entered into a number of multi-year supply agreements. The prices in these agreements were generally pre-determined, but some of these agreements provided for adjustments in subsequent years to reflect changes in market conditions or through mutual agreement. Since the fourth quarter of 2008, the market prices for silicon and silicon wafers have been decreasing significantly. Spot market prices of silicon and silicon wafers have fallen below the prices we have contracted for with our long-term suppliers and continued to decline in 2009. The rapid declines in the prices of silicon and silicon wafers coupled with decreases in demand for PV products have hampered our ability to pass on to our customers the cost of our raw materials which were procured at higher prices during the earlier periods of supply shortage. Our write-down of inventories increased from RMB0.8 million in 2007 to RMB282.6 million (US$41.4 million) in 2009. 6 Table of Contents Due to the significant decrease in prices of silicon and silicon wafers, we re-negotiated most of our existing multi-year supply agreements. Currently, the pricing terms of these multi-year agreements are generally subject to review either periodically or upon significant changes in prices on the spot market. While we have obtained reduced prices and other concessions from our suppliers, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain reduced prices from all of our suppliers in the future. If the prices of silicon and silicon wafers continue to decrease in the future and we are unable to re-negotiate the prices of our existing multi-year supply agreements, we may not be able to adjust our materials costs, and our cost of revenues would be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, other PV module manufacturers may be able to purchase silicon and silicon wafers on the spot market at lower prices than those we have contracted for with our suppliers. We expect our commitments in connection with our multi-year supply agreements will continue to be significant. In the event we are unable to re-negotiate or fulfill our obligations under our supply agreements, we may be subject to significant inventory build-up and may be required to make further inventory write-downs and provision for these commitments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If the prices we pay for silicon and silicon wafers are significantly higher than the prices paid by our competitors, our competitive cost advantage of producing modules could decrease. Our inability to reduce a key manufacturing cost to the same degree as our competitors could adversely affect our ability to price our products competitively and generate favorable profit margins. We may be subject to legal, administrative or other proceedings in connection with the multi-year supply agreements we entered into previously and such proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our management personnel. We may be subject to legal, administrative or other proceedings in connection with the multi-year supply agreements we entered into previously. For example, on June 8, 2009, Jiangxi LDK Solar Hi-Tech Co., Ltd., or LDK, one of our suppliers of silicon wafers, submitted an arbitration request to the Shanghai Arbitration Commission, alleging that we had failed to perform under the terms of a long-term supply agreement, seeking to enforce our performance and claiming for monetary relief. We are in arbitration with respect to the alleged breaches. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully defend or resolve such legal or administrative proceedings in the near future or at all. Such legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our management personnel. Prepayments we have provided to our silicon and silicon wafer suppliers expose us to the credit risks of such suppliers and may increase our costs and expenses, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Most of our multi-year supply agreements that we entered into during the earlier periods of supply shortage required us to make prepayments of a portion of the total contract price to our suppliers without receiving collateral for such prepayments. As of December 2007, 2008 and 2009, we had advanced RMB640.1 million, RMB1,145.6 million and RMB979.8 million (US$143.5 million), respectively, to our suppliers. In 2009, we recorded a provision of RMB234.7 million (US$34.4 million) for doubtful collection of advances to suppliers due to non-performance by some of our suppliers, which resulted in the prepayments we made to these suppliers being categorized as unrecoverable. Our claims for such payments are unsecured claims, which expose us to the credit risks of our suppliers in the event of their insolvency or bankruptcy. Our claims against the defaulting suppliers would rank below those of secured creditors, which would undermine our chances of obtaining the return of our prepayments. If such suppliers fail to fulfill their delivery obligations under the contracts, our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. 7 Table of Contents The average selling price of our PV products may continue to decrease. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, demand for PV products has decreased as a result of the global financial crisis, but the supply of PV products has increased significantly as many manufacturers of PV products worldwide, including our company, have engaged in significant production capacity expansion in recent years. As a result, this state of over-supply has resulted in reductions in the prevailing market prices of PV products as manufacturers have reduced their average selling prices in an attempt to obtain sales. The average selling price of our PV modules per watt decreased from RMB28.20 in 2007 to RMB26.77 in 2008 and to RMB15.27 (US$2.24) in 2009. Our net profit margin decreased from a positive margin of 6.2% in 2007 to a negative margin of 5.7% in 2008 and to a negative margin of 3.8% in 2009. This trend may continue, which could cause our sales and/or our profit margins to decline and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Evaluating our business and prospects may be difficult because of our limited operating history, and our past results may not be indicative of our future performance. There is limited historical information available about our company upon which you can base your evaluation of our business and prospects. We began operations in August 2004 and shipped our first PV modules and our first PV cells in February 2005 and November 2005, respectively. With the rapid growth of the PV industry prior to the fourth quarter of 2008, our business has grown and evolved at a rapid rate. As a result, our historical operating results may not provide a meaningful basis for evaluating our business, financial performance and prospects and we may not be able to achieve a similar growth rate in future periods, particularly in light of the significant economic volatility in recent months in our target markets. Therefore, you should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks, expenses and challenges that we will face as a company with a relatively short operating history in a competitive industry seeking to develop and manufacture new products in a rapidly growing market, and you should not rely on our past results or our historic rate of growth as an indication of our future performance. Our future success substantially depends on our ability to manage our production effectively and to reduce our manufacturing costs. Our ability to achieve such goals is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Our future success depends on our ability to manage our production and facilities effectively and to reduce our manufacturing costs. Our efforts to reduce our manufacturing costs include lowering our silicon and auxiliary material costs, improving manufacturing productivity and processes, and improving product quality. If we are unable to achieve these goals, we may be unable to decrease our costs per watt, to maintain our competitive position or to improve our profitability. Our ability to achieve such goals is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including:  our ability to re-negotiate our existing multi-year supply agreements;  our ability to maintain our quality level and keep pace with changes in technology;  our ability to adjust inventory levels to respond to rapidly changing market demand;  delays in obtaining or denial of required approvals by relevant government authorities; and  diversion of significant management attention and other resources to other matters. 8 Table of Contents If we are unable to establish or successfully make improvements to our manufacturing facilities or to reduce our manufacturing costs, or if we encounter any of the risks described above, we may be unable to improve our business as planned. We depend on a limited number of customers for a high percentage of our revenue and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, any of these customers, if not immediately replaced, would significantly reduce our revenue and decrease our profitability. We currently sell a substantial portion of our PV products to a limited number of customers. Our five largest customers accounted for an aggregate of 43.0%, 53.2% and 65.7% of our net revenues in 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. Our largest customer in 2007, 2008 and 2009 accounted for 12.6%, 22.2% and 40.6% of our net revenues of the respective year. Most of our large customers are located in Europe, particularly in Germany, Spain and Italy. The loss of sales to any one of these customers would have a significant negative impact on our business. Sales to our customers are mostly made through non-exclusive arrangements. Due to our dependence on a limited number of customers, any one of the following events may cause material fluctuations or declines in our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations:  reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from one or more of our significant customers;  selection by one or more of our significant distributor customers of our competitors products;  loss of one or more of our significant customers and our failure to identify additional or replacement customers;  any adverse change in the bilateral or multilateral trade relationships between China and European countries, particularly Germany; and  failure of any of our significant customers to make timely payment for our products. We expect our operating results to continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers for a high percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future, as well as the ability of these customers to sell PV products that incorporate our PV products. With certain significant customers, we enter into framework agreements that set forth our customers purchase goals and the general conditions under which our sales are to be made. However, such framework agreements are only binding to the extent a purchase order for a specific amount of our products is issued. In addition, certain sales terms of the framework agreements may be adjusted from time to time. In addition, we have in the past had disagreements with our customers relating to the volumes, delivery schedules and pricing terms contained in such framework contracts that have required us to re-negotiate these contracts. However, re-negotiation of our framework contracts may not always be in our best interests and disagreements on terms could escalate into formal disputes that could cause us to experience order cancellations or harm our reputation. Furthermore, our customer relationships have been developed over a short period of time and are generally in preliminary stages. We cannot be certain that these customers will generate significant revenue for us in the future or if these customer relationships will continue to develop. If our relationships with customers do not continue to develop, we may not be able to expand our customer base or maintain or increase our customers and revenue. Moreover, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are affected by competition in the market for the end products manufactured by our customers, and any decline in their business could materially harm our revenue and profitability. 9 Table of Contents Our dependence on a limited number of suppliers for a substantial majority of silicon and silicon wafers could prevent us from delivering our products in a timely manner to our customers in the required quantities, which could result in order cancellations, decreased revenue and loss of market share. In 2007, 2008 and 2009, our five largest suppliers supplied in the aggregate 59.0%, 42.0% and 51.6%, respectively, of our total silicon and silicon wafer purchases. If we fail to develop or maintain our relationships with these or our other suppliers, we may be unable to manufacture our products, our products may only be available at a higher cost or after a long delay, or we could be prevented from delivering our products to our customers in the required quantities, at competitive prices and on acceptable terms of delivery. Problems of this kind could cause us to experience order cancellations, increased manufacturing costs, decreased revenue and loss of market share. In general, the failure of a supplier to supply materials and components that meet our quality, quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner due to lack of supplies or other reasons could impair our ability to manufacture our products or could increase our costs, particularly if we are unable to obtain these materials and components from alternative sources in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms. Allegations have been made and may be made in the future regarding the quality of our suppliers inventories. In addition, some of our suppliers have a limited operating history and limited financial resources, and the contracts we entered into with these suppliers do not clearly provide for adequate remedies to us in the event any of these suppliers is not able to, or otherwise does not, deliver, in a timely manner or at all, any materials it is contractually obligated to deliver. Some of our major silicon wafer suppliers failed to fully perform in the past on their silicon wafer supply commitments to us, and we consequently did not receive all of the contractually agreed quantities of silicon wafers from these suppliers. We cannot assure you that we will not experience similar or additional shortfalls of silicon or silicon wafers from our suppliers in the future or that, in the event of such shortfalls, we will be able to find other silicon suppliers to satisfy our production needs. Any disruption in the supply of silicon wafers to us may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Until mid-2008, there was an industry-wide shortage of silicon and silicon wafers. If we again experience an industry-wide shortage of silicon and silicon wafers, our failure to obtain sufficient quantities of silicon and silicon wafers in a timely manner could disrupt our operations, prevent us from operating at full capacity or limit our ability to expand as planned, which would reduce, and limit the growth of, our manufacturing output and revenue. We depend on the timely delivery by our suppliers of silicon and silicon wafers in sufficient volumes. Until mid-2008, there was an industry-wide shortage of silicon and silicon wafers, subjecting us to the risk that our suppliers might fail to supply sufficient silicon and silicon wafers to us. While we do not believe an industry-wide shortage of silicon and silicon wafers will re-occur in the short term because of current market conditions and the expansion of silicon and silicon wafer manufacturing capacity in recent years, we cannot assure you that market conditions will not again rapidly change. We may experience actual shortages of silicon and silicon wafers or late or failed delivery for the following reasons:  the terms of our silicon and silicon wafer contracts with, or purchase orders to, our suppliers may be altered or cancelled as a result of our ongoing re-negotiations with them;  there are a limited number of silicon and silicon wafer suppliers, and many of our competitors also purchase silicon and silicon wafers from these suppliers;  our competitors may have longer and stronger relationship with these suppliers than we do;  some of our silicon and silicon wafer suppliers do not manufacture silicon themselves, but instead purchase their requirements from other vendors. It is possible that these suppliers will not be able to obtain sufficient silicon or silicon wafers to satisfy their contractual obligations to us; 10 Table of Contents  we do not have a long history with our silicon and silicon wafer suppliers and there can be no assurance that they will be able to meet our production needs consistently or on a timely basis; and  our purchase of silicon and silicon wafers is subject to the business risk of our suppliers, one or more of which may go out of business for any one of a number of reasons beyond our control in the current economic environment. If we fail to obtain delivery of silicon and silicon wafers in amounts and according to time schedules that we expect, we may be forced to reduce production, which will adversely affect our revenues. Our failure to obtain the required amounts of silicon and silicon wafers on time and at commercially reasonable prices can substantially limit our ability to meet our contractual obligations to deliver PV products to our customers. Any failure by us to meet such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, retention of customers, market share, business and results of operations and may subject us to claims from our customers and other disputes. We currently have a significant amount of debt outstanding. Our substantial indebtedness may limit our future financing capabilities and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The principal amount of our total bank borrowings outstanding was RMB874.8 million (US$128.2 million), of which RMB404.8 million (US$59.3 million) was short-term bank borrowings, as of December 31, 2009. In addition, we had US$172.5 million principal amount of convertible bonds, with fair value of RMB658.7 million (US$96.5 million), outstanding as of December 31, 2009. Our debt could have a significant impact on our future operations and cash flow, including:  making it more difficult for us to fulfill payment and other obligations under our outstanding debt, including repayment of our long- and short-term credit facilities should we be unable to obtain extensions for any such facilities before they mature, as well as our obligations under our convertible bonds;  triggering an event of default if we fail to comply with any of our payment or other obligations contained in our debt agreements, which could result in cross-defaults causing all or a substantial portion of our debt to become immediately due and payable;  reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and adversely affecting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;  potentially increasing the cost of any additional financing; and  putting pressure on our ADS price due to concerns of our inability to repay our debt and making it more difficult for us to conduct equity financings in the capital markets. Our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under our outstanding debt depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future or to refinance such debt. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to meet our obligations under our outstanding debt and to fund other liquidity needs. The global liquidity and credit crisis has had a significant negative impact on our company. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet such obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, to sell our assets, to reduce or delay our capital investments, or to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our ADS holders. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased interest rate risk and debt service obligations, and could result in operating and financing covenants that would further restrict our operations. In addition, the level of our indebtedness and the amount of our interest payments could limit our ability to obtain the financing required to fund future capital expenditures and working capital. A shortage of such funds could in turn impose limitations on our ability to plan for, or react effectively to, changing market conditions. We cannot assure you that future financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 11 Table of Contents We require a significant amount of cash to fund our operations as well as meet future capital requirements. If we cannot obtain additional capital when we need it, our growth prospects and future profitability may be materially and adversely affected. We typically require a significant amount of cash to fund our operations. We also require cash generally to meet future capital requirements, which are difficult to plan in the rapidly changing PV industry. The principal amount of our total bank borrowings outstanding was RMB874.8 million (US$128.2 million) as of December 31, 2009. We cannot assure you that future financing will be available on satisfactory terms, or at all. Our ability to obtain external financing in the future is subject to a variety of uncertainties, including:  our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows;  general market conditions for financing activities by manufacturers of PV and related products; and  economic, political and other conditions in the PRC and elsewhere. If we are unable to obtain necessary financing in a timely manner or on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, our growth prospects and future profitability may decrease materially. We face risks associated with the marketing, distribution and sale of our PV products internationally, and if we are unable to effectively manage these risks, they could impair our ability to expand our business abroad. In 2007, 2008 and 2009, a substantial majority of our revenue was generated by sales to customers outside of China. The marketing, distribution and sale of our PV products overseas expose us to a number of risks, including:  fluctuations in currency exchange rates of the U.S. dollar, Euro and other foreign currencies against the Renminbi;  difficulty in engaging and retaining distributors and agents who are knowledgeable about, and can function effectively in, overseas markets;  increased costs associated with maintaining marketing and sales activities in various countries;  difficulty and costs relating to compliance with different commercial and legal requirements in the jurisdictions in which we offer our products;  inability to obtain, maintain or enforce intellectual property rights; and  trade barriers, such as export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and expenses, which could increase the prices of our products and make us less competitive in some countries. If we are unable to effectively manage these risks, our ability to conduct or expand our business abroad would be impaired, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 12 Table of Contents If we are unable to compete in the highly competitive PV market, our revenue and profits may decrease and we may lose market share. The PV market is very competitive. We face competition from a number of sources, including domestic, foreign and multinational corporations. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets for our products are:  manufacturing capacity;  power efficiency;  range and quality of products;  price;  strength of supply chain and distribution network;  after-sales inquiry; and  brand image. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, access to larger customer bases and resources and significantly greater economies of scale, and financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical and other resources than we do. In particular, many of our competitors are developing and manufacturing solar energy products based on new technologies that may ultimately have costs similar to, or lower than, our projected costs. In addition, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to changing customer demands or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sales of their products than we can. Furthermore, competitors with more diversified product offerings may be better positioned to withstand a decline in the demand for PV products. Some of our competitors have also become vertically integrated, with businesses ranging from upstream silicon wafer manufacturing to solar power system integration, and we may also face competition from semiconductor manufacturers, several of which have already announced their intention to commence production of PV cells and PV modules. It is possible that new competitors or alliances among existing competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share, which would harm our business. If we fail to compete successfully, our business would suffer and we may lose or be unable to gain market share and our financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the PV market in general competes with other sources of renewable energy as well as conventional power generation. If prices for conventional and other renewable energy resources decline, or if these resources enjoy greater policy support than solar power, the PV market and our business and prospects could suffer. Our profitability depends on our ability to respond to rapid market changes in the PV industry, including by developing new technologies and offering additional products and services. The PV industry is characterized by rapid increases in the diversity and complexity of technologies, products and services. In particular, the ongoing evolution of technological standards requires products with improved features, such as more efficient and higher power output and improved aesthetics. As a result, we expect that we will need to constantly offer more sophisticated products and services in order to respond to competitive industry conditions and customer demands. If we fail to develop, or obtain access to, advances in technologies, or if we are not able to offer more sophisticated products and services, we may become less competitive and less profitable. In addition, advances in technologies typically lead to declining average selling prices for products using older technologies. As a result, if we are not able to reduce the costs associated with our products, the profitability of any given product, and our overall profitability, may decrease over time. Furthermore, technologies developed by our competitors may provide more advantages than ours for the commercialization of PV products, and to the extent we are not able to refine our technologies and develop new PV products, our existing products may become uncompetitive and obsolete. 13 Table of Contents In addition, we will need to invest significant financial resources in research and development to maintain our competitiveness and keep pace with technological advances in the PV industry. However, commercial acceptance by customers of new products we offer may not occur at the rate or level expected, and we may not be able to successfully adapt existing products to effectively and economically meet customer demands, thus impairing the return from our investments. We may also be required under the applicable accounting standards to recognize a charge for the impairment of assets to the extent our existing products become uncompetitive or obsolete, or if any new products fail to achieve commercial acceptance. Any such charge may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, in response to the rapidly evolving conditions in the PV industry, we plan to expand our business downstream to provide system integration products and services. This expansion requires significant investment and management attention from us, and we are likely to face intense competition from companies that have extensive experience and well-established businesses and customer bases in the system integration sector. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in expanding our business downstream. If we are not able to bring quality products and services to market in a timely and cost-effective manner and successfully market and sell these products and services, our ability to continue penetrating the PV market, as well as our results of operations and profitability, will be materially and adversely affected. Our future success also depends on our ability to make strategic acquisitions and investments and to establish and maintain strategic alliances, and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our market penetration, revenue growth and profitability. In addition, such strategic acquisitions, alliances and investments themselves entail significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our business. We are pursuing expansion into PV system integration services through our wholly owned subsidiary, Shanghai Linyang Solar Technology Co., Ltd., or Shanghai Linyang, and we may pursue upstream silicon feedstock sourcing through strategic partnerships and investments in the future. We may also establish strategic alliances with third parties in the PV industry to develop new technologies and to expand our marketing channels. These types of transactions could require that our management develop expertise in new areas, make significant investments in research and development, manage new business relationships and attract new types of customers and may require significant attention from our management, and the diversion of our managements attention could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business. We may also experience difficulties integrating acquisitions and investments into our existing business and operations and retaining key technical and managerial personnel of acquired companies. We may assume unknown liabilities or other unanticipated events or circumstances through acquisitions and investments. Furthermore, we may not be able to successfully make such strategic acquisitions and investments or to establish strategic alliances with third parties that will prove to be effective or beneficial for our business. Any difficulty we face in this regard could have a material adverse effect on our market penetration, our results of operations and our profitability. Strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances with third parties could subject us to a number of risks, including risks associated with sharing proprietary information and loss of control of operations that are material to our business. Moreover, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances may be expensive to implement and subject us to the risk of non-performance by a counterparty, which may in turn lead to monetary losses that materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, changes in government policies, both domestically and internationally, that are not favorable to the development of the PV industry, may also have a material adverse effect on the success of our strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. 14 Table of Contents Problems with product quality or product performance could result in a decrease in customers and revenue, unexpected expenses and loss of market share. In addition, product liability claims against us could result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages. Our PV modules are typically sold with a two to five-year warranty for technical defects, a 10-year limited warranty against declines of greater than 10%, and a 20 to 25-year limited warranty against declines of greater than 20%, in their initial power generation capacity. Since our products have been in use for only a relatively short period, our assumptions regarding the durability and reliability of our products may not be accurate. We consider various factors when determining the likelihood of product defects, including an evaluation of our quality controls, technical analysis, industry information on comparable companies and our own experience. As of December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, our accrued warranty costs for the two to five-year warranty against technical defects totaled RMB21.0 million, RMB48.6 million and RMB73.5 million (US$10.8 million), respectively. Any increase in the defect rate of our products would increase the amount of our warranty costs and we may not have adequate warranty provision to cover such warranty costs, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. In addition, as we purchase the silicon and silicon wafers and other components that we use in our products from third parties. Unlike PV modules, which are subject to certain uniform international standards, silicon and silicon wafers generally do not have uniform international standards, and it is often difficult to determine whether product defects are a result of the silicon or silicon wafers or other components or reasons. Furthermore, the silicon and silicon wafers and other components that we purchase from third-party suppliers are typically sold to us with no or only limited warranties. The possibility of future product failures could cause us to incur substantial expense to provide refunds or resolve disputes with regard to warranty claims through litigation, arbitration or other means. Product failures and related adverse publicity may also damage our market reputation and cause our sales to decline. As with other PV product manufacturers, we are exposed to risks associated with product liability claims if the use of the PV products we sell results in injury, death or damage to property. We cannot predict at this time whether product liability claims will be brought against us in the future or the effect of any resulting negative publicity on our business. In addition, we have not made provisions for potential product liability claims and we may not have adequate resources to satisfy a judgment if a successful claim is brought against us. Moreover, the successful assertion of product liability claims against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages and require us to make significant payments and incur substantial legal expenses. Even if a product liability claim is not successfully pursued to judgment by a claimant, we may still incur substantial legal expenses defending against such a claim. If PV technology is not suitable for widespread adoption, or sufficient demand for PV products does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipated, our sales may not continue to increase or may even decline, and our revenue and profitability would be reduced. The PV market is at a relatively early stage of development and the extent to which PV products will be widely adopted is uncertain. Furthermore, market data in the PV industry are not as readily available as those in other more established industries, where trends can be assessed more reliably from data gathered over a longer period of time. If PV technology, in particular the type of PV technology that we have adopted, proves unsuitable for widespread adoption or if demand for PV products fails to 15 Table of Contents develop sufficiently, we may not be able to grow our business or generate sufficient revenue to sustain our profitability. In addition, demand for PV products in our targeted markets, including China, may not develop or may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipated. Many factors may affect the viability of widespread adoption of PV technology and demand for PV products, including:  cost-effectiveness of PV products compared to conventional and other non-solar energy sources and products;  performance and reliability of PV products compared to conventional and other non-solar energy sources and products;  availability of government subsidies and incentives to support the development of the PV industry or other energy resource industries;  success of other alternative energy generation technologies, such as fuel cells, wind power and biomass;  fluctuations in economic and market conditions that affect the viability of conventional and non-solar alternative energy sources, such as increases or decreases in the prices of oil and other fossil fuels;  capital expenditures by end users of PV products, which tend to decrease when the overall economy slows down; and  deregulation of the electric power industry and the broader energy industry. Existing regulations and policies governing the electricity utility industry, as well as changes to these regulations and policies, may adversely affect demand for our products and materially reduce our revenue and profits. The electric utility industry is subject to extensive regulation, and the market for PV products, is heavily influenced by these regulations as well as the policies promulgated by electric utilities. These regulations and policies often affect electricity pricing and technical interconnection of end-user power generation. As the market for solar and other alternative energy sources continue to evolve, these regulations and policies are being modified and may continue to be modified. Customer purchases of, or further investment in research and development of, solar and other alternative energy sources may be significantly affected by these regulations and policies, which could significantly reduce demand for our products and materially reduce our revenue and profits. Moreover, we expect that our PV products and their installation will be subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes, safety, environmental protection, utility interconnection and metering and related matters in various countries. We also have to comply with the requirements of individual localities and design equipment to comply with varying standards applicable in the jurisdictions where we conduct business. Any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our PV products may result in significant additional expenses to us, our distributors and end users and, as a result, could cause a significant reduction in demand for our PV products, as well as materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The reduction or elimination of government subsidies and economic incentives for on-grid solar energy applications could have a materially adverse effect on our business and prospects. We believe that the near-term growth of the market for on-grid applications, where solar energy is used to supplement a customers electricity purchased from the electric utility, depends in large part on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives. As a portion of our sales is in the on-grid market, the reduction or elimination of government subsidies and economic incentives may hinder the growth of this market or result in increased price competition, which could decrease demand for our products and reduce our revenue. 16 Table of Contents The cost of solar energy currently exceeds the cost of power furnished by the electric utility grid in many locations. As a result, federal, state and local governmental bodies in many countries, most notably Germany, Spain, Italy, the United States, Australia, Korea, France and the Czech Republic, have provided subsidies and economic incentives in the form of rebates, tax credits and other incentives to end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of PV products to promote the use of solar energy in on-grid applications and to reduce dependency on other forms of energy. Certain of these government economic incentives are set to be reduced and may be reduced further, or eliminated. For instance, in 2009, the German government reduced solar feed-in tariffs by 9%. In June 2010, Germany adopted a further reduction in solar feed-in tariffs effective on July 1, 2010, which may result in a significant decrease in the price of and demand for PV products in Germany. In 2007, 2008 and 2009, Germany accounted for 49.9%, 53.3% and 70.6% of our net revenues, respectively. In addition, political changes in a particular country could result in significant reductions or eliminations of subsidies or economic incentives. Electric utility companies that have significant political lobbying powers may also seek changes in the relevant legislation in their markets that may adversely affect the development and commercial acceptance of solar energy. The reduction or elimination of government subsidies and economic incentives for on-grid solar energy applications, especially those in our target markets, could cause demand for our products and our revenue to decline, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The lack or inaccessibility of financing for off-grid solar energy applications could cause our sales to decline. Our products are used for off-grid solar energy applications in developed and developing countries, where solar energy is provided to end users independent of an electricity transmission grid. In some countries, government agencies and the private sector have, from time to time, provided subsidies or financing on preferred terms for rural electrification programs. We believe that the availability of financing could have a significant effect on the level of sales of off-grid solar energy applications, particularly in developing countries where users may not have sufficient resources or credit to otherwise acquire PV systems. If existing financing programs for off-grid solar energy applications are eliminated or if financing becomes inaccessible, the growth of the market for off-grid solar energy applications may be materially and adversely affected, which could cause our sales to decline. In addition, rising interest rates could render existing financings more expensive, as well as serve as an obstacle for potential financings that would otherwise spur the growth of the PV industry. Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position, and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights may be costly. We rely primarily on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property. Nevertheless, these afford only limited protection and the actions we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate. In particular, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary technologies can be difficult and expensive. In addition, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. We also cannot assure you that the outcome of any such litigation would be in our favor. Furthermore, any such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention as well as expend our other resources away from our business. An adverse determination in any such litigation will impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business, prospects and reputation. In addition, we have no insurance coverage against litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 17 Table of Contents Implementation of PRC intellectual property-related laws has historically been lacking, primarily because of ambiguities in the PRC laws and difficulties in enforcement. Accordingly, intellectual property rights and confidentiality protections in China may not be as effective as in the United States or other countries. We may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties, particularly in jurisdictions outside China which, if determined adversely against us, could disrupt our business and subject us to significant liability to third parties, as well as have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to use and develop our technologies and know-how without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties. As we continue to market and sell our products internationally, and as litigation becomes more common in the PRC, we face a higher risk of being the subject of claims for intellectual property infringement, as well as having indemnification relating to other parties proprietary rights held to be invalid. Our current or potential competitors, many of which have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies, may have or may obtain patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products in the European Union, the PRC or other countries. The validity and scope of claims relating to PV technology patents involve complex, scientific, legal and factual questions and analysis and, therefore, may be highly uncertain. In addition, the defense of intellectual property claims, including patent infringement suits, and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming, and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel. Furthermore, an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceeding to which we may become a party could cause us to:  pay damage awards;  seek licenses from third parties;  pay ongoing royalties;  redesign our products; or  be restricted by injunctions, each of which could effectively prevent us from pursuing some or all of our business and result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to obtain sufficient patent protection on the technologies embodied in the PV products we currently manufacture and sell, which could reduce our competitiveness and increase our expenses. Although we rely primarily on trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect the technologies in the PV cells and PV modules we currently manufacture and sell, our success and ability to compete in the future may also depend to a significant degree on obtaining patent protection for our proprietary technologies. As of April 30, 2010, we had 11 patents and 13 pending patent applications in the PRC. We do not have, and have not applied for, any patents for our proprietary technologies outside the PRC. As the protections afforded by our patents are effective only in the PRC, our competitors and other companies may independently develop substantially equivalent technologies or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technologies, and obtain patents for such technologies in other jurisdictions, including the countries in which we sell our products. Moreover, our patent applications in the PRC may not result in issued patents, and even if they do result in issued patents, the patents may not have claims of the scope we seek. In addition, any issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or declared unenforceable. As a result, our present and future patents may provide only limited protection for our technologies, and may not be sufficient to provide competitive advantages to us. 18 Table of Contents We depend on our key personnel, and our business and growth may be severely disrupted if we lose their services. Our future success depends substantially on the continued services of some of our directors and key executives. In particular, we are highly dependent upon our directors and officers, including Mr. Yonghua Lu, chairman of our board of directors. If we lose the services of one or more of our current directors and executive officers, we may not be able to replace them readily, if at all, with suitable or qualified candidates, and may incur additional expenses to recruit and retain new directors and officers, particularly those with a significant mix of both international and China-based PV industry experience similar to our current directors and officers, which could severely disrupt our business and growth. In addition, if any of our directors or executives joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose some of our customers. Each of these directors and executive officers has entered into an employment agreement with us, which contains confidentiality and non-competition provisions. However, if any disputes arise between these directors or executive officers and us, it is not clear, in light of uncertainties associated with the PRC legal system, the extent to which any of these agreements could be enforced in China, where all of these directors and executive officers reside and hold some of their assets. See  Risks Related to Doing Business in China  Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, as we expect to continue to expand our operations and develop new products, we will need to continue attracting and retaining experienced management and key research and development personnel. Competition for personnel in the PV industry in China is intense, and the availability of suitable and qualified candidates is limited. In particular, we compete to attract and retain qualified research and development personnel with other PV technology companies, universities and research institutions. Competition for these individuals could cause us to offer higher compensation and other benefits in order to attract and retain them, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may also be unable to attract or retain the personnel necessary to achieve our business objectives, and any failure in this regard could severely disrupt our business and growth. Any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and the market price of our ADSs. The SEC, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, adopted rules requiring most public companies to include a management report on such companys internal control over financial reporting in its annual report, which contains managements assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. In addition, when a company meets the SECs criteria, an independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. 19 Table of Contents Our management and independent registered public accounting firm have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 was effective. However, we cannot assure you that in the future our management or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify material weakness during the Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act audit process or for other reasons. In addition, because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result, if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or should we be unable to prevent or detect material misstatements due to error or fraud on a timely basis, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business, results of operations and negatively impact the market price of our ADSs, and harm our reputation. Furthermore, we have incurred and expected to continue to incur considerable costs and to use significant management time and other resources in an effort to comply with Section 404 and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have limited insurance coverage and may incur losses resulting from product liability claims or business interruptions. We are subject to risk of explosion and fires, as highly flammable gases, such as silane and nitrogen gas, are generated in our manufacturing processes. While we have not experienced to date any explosion or fire, the risks associated with these gases cannot be completely eliminated. In addition, a natural disaster such as floods or earthquakes, or other unanticipated catastrophic events, including power interruption, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, explosions, fires, break-ins, terrorist attacks or acts or wars, could significantly disrupt our ability to manufacture our products and to operate our business. If any of our production facilities or material equipment were to experience any significant damage or downtime, we might be unable to meet our production targets and our business could suffer. As the insurance industry in China is still in an early stage of development, business interruption insurance available in China offers limited coverage compared to that offered in many other countries. Although we have obtained business interruption insurance, any business disruption or natural disaster could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. We are also exposed to risks associated with product liability claims in the event that the use of the PV products we sell results in injury. Due to limited historical experience, we are unable to predict whether product liability claims will be brought against us in the future or the effect of any resulting adverse publicity on our business. Moreover, we only have limited product liability insurance and may not have adequate resources to satisfy a judgment in the event of a successful claim against us. The successful assertion of product liability claims against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages and require us to make significant payments, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any environmental claims or failure to comply with any present or future environmental regulations may require us to spend additional funds and may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of chemical by-products of, and water used in, our manufacturing operations and research and development activities, including toxic, volatile and otherwise hazardous chemicals and wastes. We are in compliance with current environmental regulations to conduct our business as it is presently conducted. Although we have not suffered material environmental claims in the past, the failure to comply with any present or future regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, suspension of production or a cessation of our operations. New regulations could also require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses. Any failure by us to control the use of, or to adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances could subject us to potentially significant monetary damages and fines or suspension of our business, as well as our financial condition and results of operations. 20 Table of Contents The use of certain hazardous substances, such as lead, in various products is also coming under increasingly stringent governmental regulation. Increased environmental regulation in this area could adversely impact the manufacture and sale of solar modules that contain lead and could require us to make unanticipated environmental expenditures. For example, the European Union Directive 2002/96/EC on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment, or the WEEE Directive, requires manufacturers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to be financially responsible for the collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of specified products placed on the market in the European Union. In addition, European Union Directive 2002/95/EC on the Restriction of the use of Hazardous Substances in electrical and electronic equipment, or the RoHS Directive, restricts the use of certain hazardous substances, including lead, in specified products. Other jurisdictions are considering adopting similar legislation. Currently, we are not required under the WEEE or RoHS Directives to collect, recycle or dispose any of our products. However, the Directives allow for future amendments subjecting additional products to the Directives requirements. If, in the future, our solar modules become subject to such requirements, we may be required to apply for an exemption. If we were unable to obtain an exemption, we would be required to redesign our solar modules in order to continue to offer them for sale within the European Union, which would be impractical. Failure to comply with the Directives could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the inability to sell our solar modules in the European Union, competitive disadvantages and loss of net sales, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business benefits from certain PRC government incentives. Expiration of, or changes to, these incentives could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. On March 16, 2007, the PRC government promulgated the Law of the Peoples Republic of China on the Enterprise Income Tax, or the EIT, which took effect on January 1, 2008. Under the EIT, domestically owned enterprises and foreign-invested enterprises, or FIEs, are subject to a uniform tax rate of 25%. While the EIT equalizes the tax rates for FIEs and domestically owned enterprises, preferential tax treatment continues to be granted to companies in certain encouraged sectors, and entities classified as high and new technology enterprises are entitled to a 15% enterprise income tax rate, whether domestically owned enterprises or FIEs. The EIT also provides a five-year transition period starting from its effective date for those enterprises which were established before the promulgation date of the EIT and which were entitled to a preferential lower tax rate or tax holiday under the then effective tax laws or regulations. The tax rate of such enterprises will transition to the uniform tax rate within a five-year transition period and the tax holiday, which has been enjoyed by such enterprises before the effective date of the EIT, may continue to be enjoyed until the end of the holiday. Jiangsu Linyang Solarfun Co., Ltd., or Linyang China, our wholly owned operating subsidiary in China, was approved to be qualified as a high and new technology enterprise on October 21, 2008. The high and new technology enterprise status will be valid for a period of three years from the date of issuance of the certificate. If there are significant changes in the business operations, manufacturing technologies or other criteria that cause the enterprise to no longer meet the criteria as a high and new technology enterprise, such status will be terminated from the year of such change. If Linyang China fails to qualify as a high and new technology enterprise in future periods, our income tax expenses would increase, which could have a material and adverse effect on our net income and results of operations. In accordance with the former PRC Income Tax Law for Enterprises with Foreign Investment and Foreign Enterprises, or the FIE Tax Law, the EIT and the related implementing rules, Linyang China was exempted from enterprise income tax in 2005 and 2006, was taxed at a reduced rate of 12% in 2007, 12.5% in 2008 and 12.5% in 2009, and is being taxed at a reduced rate of 15% in 2010. From 2005 until the end of 2009, Linyang China is also exempted from the 3% local income tax. Furthermore, Linyang China was entitled to a two-year income tax exemption for 2006 and 2007 and is entitled to a reduced tax rate of 12.5% for the following three years on income generated from additional investment in the production capacity of Linyang China resulting from the funds we received through the issuances of our series A convertible preference shares in June and August 2006. 21 Table of Contents Any reduction or elimination of the preferential tax treatments currently enjoyed by us may significantly increase our income tax expenses and materially reduce our net income, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Under the EIT, we may be classified as a Resident Enterprise of the PRC. Such classification would likely result in negative tax consequences to us and could result in negative tax consequences to our non-PRC enterprise shareholders and ADS holders. Under the EIT, enterprises established under the laws of non-PRC jurisdictions but whose de facto management body is located in the PRC are considered resident enterprises for PRC tax purposes and are subject to the EIT. According to the Implementation Regulations for the EIT of the PRC issued by the State Council on December 6, 2007, de facto management body is defined as an establishment that exerts substantial and comprehensive management and control over the business operations, staff, accounting, assets and other aspects of the enterprise. Substantially all of our operational management is currently based in the PRC and our operating subsidiaries are located in the PRC. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded an unrecognized tax benefit of approximately RMB27.4 million (US$4.0 million) because based on our judgment, Solarfun Power Hong Kong Limited, or Solarfun Hong Kong, our wholly owned subsidiary, may be deemed as a PRC tax resident pursuant to the EIT. If Solarfun Power Holdings Co., Ltd., or Solarfun, our holding company, or any of its non-PRC subsidiaries is treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes, Solarfun or such subsidiary will be subject to PRC income tax on worldwide income at a uniform tax rate of 25%, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, although the EIT provides that dividend income between qualified resident enterprises is exempted from the 10% withholding tax, it is still not free of doubt whether we will be considered to be a qualified resident enterprise under the EIT. If we are considered a non-resident enterprise, dividends paid to us by our subsidiaries in the PRC (through our holding company structure) may be subject to the 10% withholding tax. If we are deemed by the PRC tax authorities as a resident enterprise and declare dividends, under the existing implementation rules of the EIT, dividends paid by us to our ultimate shareholders, which are non- resident enterprises and do not have an establishment or place in the PRC, or which have such an establishment or place but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place, might be subject to PRC withholding tax at 10% or a lower treaty rate. Fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our business as well as result in foreign currency exchange losses. Our financial statements are expressed in, and our functional currency is Renminbi. The change in value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar, Euro and other currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in Chinas political and economic conditions. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi to the U.S. dollar. Under the new policy, the Renminbi is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. This change in policy has resulted in a more than 17.5% appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. The PRC government may decide to adopt an even more flexible currency policy in the future, which could result in a further and more significant appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. An appreciation of the Renminbi relative to other foreign currencies could decrease the per unit revenue generated from our international sales. If we increased our pricing to compensate for the reduced purchasing power of foreign currencies, we may decrease the market competitiveness, on a price basis, of our products. This could result in a decrease in our international sales and materially and adversely affect our business. 22 Table of Contents A substantial portion of our sales is denominated in U.S. dollars and Euros, while a substantial portion of our costs and expenses is denominated in Renminbi. As a result, the revaluation of the Renminbi in July 2005 has increased, and further revaluations could further increase, our costs. The value of, and any dividends payable on, our ADSs in foreign currency terms will also be affected. Conversely, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our ordinary shares or ADSs or for other business purposes, an appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us. Fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly among the U.S. dollar, Renminbi and Euro, also affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in fluctuations in foreign exchange and operating gains and losses. We incurred net foreign currency losses of RMB25.6 million, RMB35.2 million and RMB23.8 million (US$3.5 million) in 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. Since December 2009, the Euro has depreciated, and may continue to depreciate against the Renminbi. As a result, we may incur foreign exchange losses. Such foreign exchange losses may have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Such depreciation of the Euro may also have a negative impact on the selling prices of our products in Renminbi terms. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our financial condition and results of operations, and we may incur net foreign currency losses in the future. While we started to enter into economic hedging transactions in 2008 to minimize the impact of short-term foreign currency fluctuations on our revenues that are denominated in a currency other than Renminbi, the effectiveness of these transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge all of our exposure. Our estimates of future revenues that are denominated in foreign currencies may not be accurate, which could result in foreign exchange losses. Any default by the counterparties to these transactions could also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert Renminbi into foreign currencies. Two of our existing shareholders have substantial influence over our company and their interests may not be aligned with the interests of our other shareholders. As of April 30, 2010, Mr. Yonghua Lu, chairman of our board of directors, and Good Energies II LP owned 13.29% and 30.33%, respectively, of our outstanding share capital. Mr. Lu and Good Energies II LP have substantial influence over our business, including decisions regarding mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, election of directors and other significant corporate actions. This concentration of ownership may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and might reduce the price of our ADSs. In addition, without the consent of Mr. Lu and Good Energies II LP, we could be prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us. Mr. Lu and Good Energies II LP may cause us to take actions that are opposed by other shareholders as their interests may differ from those of other shareholders. Risks Related to Doing Business in China Adverse changes in political and economic policies of the PRC government could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China, which could reduce the demand for our products and materially and adversely affect our competitive position. Substantially all of our operations are conducted in China and some of our sales are made in China. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are affected significantly by economic, political and legal developments in China. The PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including:  the amount of government involvement;  the level of development;  the growth rate;  the control of foreign exchange; and  the allocation of resources. 23 Table of Contents While the PRC economy has grown significantly since the late 1970s, the growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures benefit the overall PRC economy, but may also have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us. The PRC economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy. Although the PRC government has in recent years implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of sound corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of the productive assets in China is still owned by the PRC government. The continued control of these assets and other aspects of the national economy by the PRC government could materially and adversely affect our business. The PRC government also exercises significant control over economic growth in China through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Efforts by the PRC government to slow the pace of growth of the PRC economy could result in decreased capital expenditure by solar energy users, which in turn could reduce demand for our products. Any adverse change in the economic conditions or government policies in China could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth and the level of renewable energy investments and expenditures in China, which in turn could lead to a reduction in demand for our products and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. In particular, the PRC government has, in recent years, promulgated certain laws and regulations and initiated certain government-sponsored programs to encourage the utilization of new forms of energy, including solar energy. We cannot assure you that the implementation of these laws, regulations and government programs will be beneficial to us. In particular, any adverse change in the PRC governments policies towards the PV industry may have a material adverse effect on our operations as well as on our plans to expand our business into downstream system integration services. Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could have a material adverse effect on us. We conduct substantially all of our business through our operating subsidiary in the PRC, Linyang China, a Chinese wholly foreign-owned enterprise. Linyang China is generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China and, in particular, laws applicable to wholly foreign-owned enterprises. The PRC legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, PRC legislation and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, since these laws and regulations are relatively new and the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involve uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to us. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. 24 Table of Contents Limitations on the ability of our operating subsidiary to pay dividends or other distributions to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. We are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our business through our operating subsidiary, Linyang China, which is a limited liability company established in China. The payment of dividends by entities organized in China is subject to limitations. In particular, regulations in the PRC currently permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Linyang China is also required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year to its general reserves until the accumulative amount of such reserves reaches 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. In addition, Linyang China is required to allocate a portion of its after-tax profit to its staff welfare and bonus fund at the discretion of its board of directors. Moreover, if Linyang China incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. Restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our revenue effectively. A portion of our revenue and a substantial portion of our expenses are denominated in Renminbi. The Renminbi is currently convertible under the current account, which includes dividends, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the capital account, which includes foreign direct investment and loans. Currently, Linyang China may purchase foreign currencies for settlement of current account transactions, including payments of dividends to us, without the approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE. However, the relevant PRC government authorities may limit or eliminate our ability to purchase foreign currencies in the future. Since a significant amount of our future revenue will be denominated in Renminbi, any existing and future restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize revenue generated in Renminbi to fund our business activities outside China that are denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign exchange transactions by Linyang China under the capital account continue to be subject to significant foreign exchange controls and require the approval of or need to register with PRC governmental authorities, including SAFE. In particular, if Linyang China borrows foreign currency loans from us or other foreign lenders, these loans must be registered with SAFE, and if we finance Linyang China by means of additional capital contributions, these capital contributions must be approved by certain government authorities, including the National Development and Reform Commission, or the NDRC, the Ministry of Commerce or their respective local counterparts. These limitations could affect the ability of Linyang China to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financing. PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident shareholders to personal liability and limit our ability to acquire PRC companies or to inject capital into our PRC subsidiary, limit our PRC subsidiarys ability to distribute profits to us, or otherwise materially and adversely affect us. SAFE issued a public notice in October 2005, or the SAFE notice, requiring PRC residents, including both legal persons and natural persons, to register with the competent local SAFE branch before establishing or controlling any company outside of China, referred to as an offshore special purpose company, for the purpose of acquiring any assets of or equity interest in PRC companies and raising fund from overseas. In addition, any PRC resident that is the shareholder of an offshore special purpose company is required to amend its SAFE registration with the local SAFE branch, with respect to that offshore special purpose company in connection with any increase or decrease of capital, transfer of shares, merger, division, equity investment or creation of any security interest over any assets located in China. If any PRC shareholder of any offshore special purpose company fails to make the required SAFE registration and amendment, the PRC subsidiaries of that offshore special purpose company may be prohibited from distributing their profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the offshore special purpose company. Moreover, failure to comply with the SAFE registration and amendment requirements described above could result in liability under PRC laws for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions. Our current beneficial owners who are PRC residents have registered with the local SAFE branch as required under the SAFE notice. The failure of these beneficial owners to amend their SAFE registrations in a timely manner pursuant to the SAFE notice or the failure of future beneficial owners of our company who are PRC residents to comply with the registration procedures 25 Table of Contents set forth in the SAFE notice may subject such beneficial owners to fines and legal sanctions and may also result in a restriction on our PRC subsidiarys ability to distribute profits to us or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, the NDRC promulgated a rule in October 2004, or the NDRC Rule, which requires NDRC approvals for overseas investment projects made by PRC entities. The NDRC Rule also provides that approval procedures for overseas investment projects of PRC individuals shall be implemented with reference to this rule. However, there exist extensive uncertainties in terms of interpretation of the NDRC Rule with respect to its application to a PRC individuals overseas investment, and in practice, we are not aware of any precedents that a PRC individuals overseas investment has been approved by the NDRC or challenged by the NDRC based on the absence of NDRC approval. Our current beneficial owners who are PRC individuals did not apply for NDRC approval for investment in us. We cannot predict how and to what extent this will affect our business operations or future strategy. For example, the failure of our shareholders who are PRC individuals to comply with the NDRC Rule may subject these persons or our PRC subsidiary to certain liabilities under PRC laws, which could adversely affect our business. New labor laws in the PRC may adversely affect our results of operations. On June 29, 2007, the PRC government promulgated the Labor Contract Law of the PRC, or the New Labor Contract Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008. The New Labor Contract Law imposes greater liabilities on employers and significantly impacts the cost of an employers decision to reduce its workforce. Further, it requires certain terminations to be based upon seniority and not merit. In the event we decide to significantly change or decrease our workforce, the New Labor Contract Law could adversely affect our ability to enact such changes in a manner that is most advantageous to our business or in a timely and cost effective manner, thus materially and adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. We face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks. Adverse public health epidemics or pandemics could disrupt business and the economics of the PRC and other countries where we do business. From December 2002 to June 2003, China and other countries experienced an outbreak of a highly contagious form of atypical pneumonia now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. Some Asian countries, including China, encountered incidents of the H5N1 strain of bird flu, or avian flu in 2007 and early 2008. From April 2009, there have been outbreaks of swine flu, caused by H1N1 virus, in certain regions of the world, including China. Any future outbreak of SARS, avian flu, swine flu or other similar adverse public developments may, among other things, significantly disrupt our business, including limiting our ability to travel or ship our products within or outside China and forcing us to temporary close our manufacturing facilities. Furthermore, an outbreak may severely restrict the level of economic activity in affected areas, which may in turn materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We have not adopted any written preventive measures or contingency plans to combat any future outbreak of swine flu, avian flu, SARS or any other epidemic. Risks Related to Our Ordinary Shares and ADSs The market price of our ADSs may be volatile. The market price of our ADSs experienced, and may continue to experience, significant volatility. For the period from December 20, 2006 to May 24, 2010, the trading price of our ADSs on the Nasdaq Global Market has ranged from a low of US$2.30 per ADS to a high of US$37.64 per ADS. 26 Table of Contents Numerous factors, including many over which we have no control, may have a significant impact on the market price of our ADSs, including, among other things:  announcements of technological or competitive developments;  regulatory developments in our target markets affecting us, our customers or our competitors;  announcements regarding patent litigation or the issuance of patents to us or our competitors;  announcements of studies and reports relating to the conversion efficiencies of our products or those of our competitors;  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;  changes in financial estimates or other material comments by securities analysts relating to us, our competitors or our industry in general;  announcements by other companies in our industry relating to their operations, strategic initiatives, financial condition or financial performance or to our industry in general;  announcements of acquisitions or consolidations involving industry competitors or industry suppliers;  changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other PV technology companies;  addition or departure of our executive officers and key research personnel; and  sales or perceived sales of additional ordinary shares or ADSs. In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our ADSs, regardless of our operating performance. Our articles of association contain anti-takeover provisions that could have a material adverse effect on the rights of holders of our ordinary shares and ADSs. Our amended and restated articles of association limit the ability of others to acquire control of our company or cause us to engage in change-of-control transactions. These provisions could have the effect of depriving our shareholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices by discouraging third parties from seeking to obtain control of our company in a tender offer or similar transaction. For example, our board of directors has the authority, without further action by our shareholders, to issue preferred shares in one or more series and to fix their designations, powers, preferences, privileges, and relative participating, optional or special rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption and liquidation preferences, any or all of which may be greater than the rights associated with our ordinary shares, in the form of ADS or otherwise, provided that, where any issue of shares is proposed and such shares proposed to be issued are equal to or exceed 20% by par value of the par value of all then issued shares (including ordinary shares and any preferred shares and, in the case of any preferred shares, where appropriate whether considering such preferred shares before or after any conversion of such preferred shares to ordinary shares in accordance with their terms), then the prior approval by ordinary resolution of the holders of the ordinary shares, voting together as one class, shall be required. Preferred shares could be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult. If our board of directors decides to issue preferred shares, the price of our ADSs may fall and the voting and other rights of the holders of our ordinary shares and ADSs may be materially and adversely affected. 27 Table of Contents Holders of ADSs have fewer rights than shareholders and must act through the depositary to exercise those rights. Holders of ADSs do not have the same rights as our shareholders and may only exercise the voting rights with respect to the underlying ordinary shares in accordance with the provisions of the deposit agreement. Under our amended and restated articles of association, the minimum notice period required to convene an annual general meeting or any extraordinary general meeting calling for the passing of a special resolution is 20 days and the minimum notice period required to convene any other extraordinary general meeting is 14 days. When a general meeting is convened, you may not receive sufficient notice of a shareholders meeting to permit you to withdraw your ordinary shares to allow you to cast your vote with respect to any specific matter. If requested in writing by us, the depositary will mail a notice of such a meeting to you. In addition, the depositary and its agents may not be able to send voting instructions to you or carry out your voting instructions in a timely manner. We will make all reasonable efforts to cause the depositary to extend voting rights to you in a timely manner, but you may not receive the voting materials in time to ensure that you can instruct the depositary to vote your ADSs. Furthermore, the depositary and its agents will not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instructions to vote, for the manner in which any vote is cast or for the effect of any such vote. As a result, you may not be able to exercise your right to vote and you may lack recourse if your ADSs are not voted as you requested. In addition, in your capacity as an ADS holder, you will not be able to call a shareholders meeting. You may be subject to limitations on transfers of your ADSs. Your ADSs are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary may close its transfer books at any time or from time to time when it deems expedient in connection with the performance of its duties. In addition, the depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of ADSs generally when our books or the books of the depositary are closed, or at any time if we or the depositary deem it advisable to do so because of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body, or under any provision of the deposit agreement, or for any other reason. Your right to participate in any future rights offerings may be limited, which may cause dilution to your holdings, and you may not receive distributions with respect to the underlying ordinary shares if it is impractical to make them available to you. We may from time to time distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire our securities. However, we cannot make rights available to you in the United States unless we register the rights and the securities to which the rights relate under the Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements is available. Also, under the deposit agreement, the depositary will not make rights available to you unless the distribution to ADS holders of both the rights and any related securities are either registered under the Securities Act, or exempted from registration under the Securities Act. We are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or securities or to endeavor to cause such a registration statement to be declared effective. Moreover, we may not be able to establish an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Accordingly, in the event we conduct any rights offering in the future, the depositary may not make such rights available to you or may dispose of such rights and make the net proceeds available to you. As a result, you may be unable to participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution in your holdings. 28 Table of Contents In addition, the depositary of our ADSs has agreed to pay to you the cash dividends or other distributions it or the custodian receives on our ordinary shares or other deposited securities after deducting its fees and expenses. You will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of ordinary shares your ADSs represent. However, the depositary may, at its discretion, decide that it is inequitable or impractical to make a distribution available to any holders of ADSs. As a result, the depositary may decide not to make the distribution and you will not receive such distribution. We are a Cayman Islands company and, because judicial precedent regarding the rights of shareholders is more limited under Cayman Islands law than under U.S. law, you may have less protection for your shareholder rights than you would under U.S. law. Our corporate affairs are governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association as may be amended from time to time, the Cayman Islands Companies Law (as amended) and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as that from English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a less developed body of securities laws than the United States. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in a federal court of the United States. There is also uncertainty as to whether the courts of the Cayman Islands would:  recognize or enforce against us or our directors, judgments of courts of the United States based on certain civil liability provisions of U.S. securities laws; and  entertain original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, based on certain civil liability provisions of U.S. securities laws that are penal in nature. There is no statutory recognition in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, although the courts of the Cayman Islands will generally recognize and enforce a non-penal judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits. As a result of all of the above, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken against management, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as shareholders of a U.S. public company. You may have difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us. We are a Cayman Islands company and substantially all of our assets are located outside of the United States. Substantially all of our current operations are conducted in the PRC. In addition, most of our directors and officers are nationals and residents of countries other than the United States. A substantial portion of the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons. It may also be difficult for you to enforce in U.S. courts judgments obtained in U.S. courts based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors, most of whom are not residents in the United States and the substantial majority of whose assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the Cayman Islands or the PRC would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts. 29 Table of Contents
