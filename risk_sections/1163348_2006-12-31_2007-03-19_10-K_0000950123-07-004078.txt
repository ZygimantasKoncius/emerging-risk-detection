Item 1A. Risk Factors. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC include the following: Risks Related to Our Company Downgrades or the revocation of our financial strength ratings would affect our standing among brokers and customers and may cause our premiums and earnings to decrease. Ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies. Each of our principal operating insurance subsidiaries has been assigned a financial strength rating of A (Excellent) from A.M Best and A− (Strong) from Standard & Poors. Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd and our U.S. operating insurance subsidiaries are rated A2 (Good) by Moodys. Each rating is subject to periodic review by, and may be revised downward or revoked at the sole discretion of, the rating agency. If the rating of any of our subsidiaries is revised downward or revoked, our competitive position in the insurance and reinsurance industry may suffer, and it may be more difficult for us to market our products. Specifically, any revision or revocation of this kind could result in a significant reduction in the number of insurance and reinsurance contracts we write and in a substantial loss of business as customers and brokers that place this business move to competitors with higher financial strength ratings. Additionally, it is increasingly common for our reinsurance contracts to contain terms that would allow the ceding companies to cancel the contract for the portion of our obligations if our insurance subsidiaries are downgraded below an A− by A.M. Best. Whether a ceding company would exercise this cancellation right would depend, among other factors, on the reason for such downgrade, the extent of the downgrade, the prevailing market conditions and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage. Therefore, we cannot predict in advance the extent to which this cancellation right would be exercised, if at all, or what effect any such cancellations would have on our financial condition or future operations, but such effect could be material. We also cannot assure you that A.M. Best, Standard & Poors or Moodys will not downgrade our insurance subsidiaries. 30 Table of Contents Actual claims may exceed our reserves for losses and loss expenses. Our success depends on our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses that we insure and reinsure. We establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to the policies we write. Loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, loss reserves are estimates of what we expect the ultimate resolution and administration of claims will cost. These estimates are based on actuarial and statistical projections and on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. Loss reserve estimates are refined as experience develops and claims are reported and resolved. Establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process. It is therefore possible that our reserves at any given time will prove to be inadequate. To the extent we determine that actual losses or loss expenses exceed our expectations and reserves reflected in our financial statements, we will be required to increase our reserves to reflect our changed expectations. This could cause a material increase in our liabilities and a reduction in our profitability, including operating losses and a reduction of capital. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2006 included $135.9 million and $25.2 million of favorable and adverse development, respectively, of reserves relating to losses incurred for prior accident years. In comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2005, our results included $72.1 million of adverse development of reserves (which included $62.5 million of adverse development from 2004 catastrophes) and $121.1 million of favorable development relating to losses incurred for prior accident years. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2004 included $81.7 million of favorable development and $2.3 million of adverse reserve development. We have estimated our net losses from catastrophes based on actuarial analysis of claims information received to date, industry modeling and discussions with individual insureds and reinsureds. Accordingly, actual losses may vary from those estimated and will be adjusted in the period in which further information becomes available. Based on our current estimate of losses related to Hurricane Katrina, we believe we have exhausted our $135 million of property catastrophe reinsurance protection with respect to this event, leaving us with more limited reinsurance coverage available pursuant to our two remaining property quota share treaties should our Hurricane Katrina losses prove to be greater than currently estimated. Under the two remaining quota share treaties, we ceded 45% of our general property policies and 66% of our energy-related property policies. As of December 31, 2006, we had estimated gross losses related to Hurricane Katrina of $559 million. Losses ceded related to Hurricane Katrina were $135 million under the property catastrophe reinsurance protection and approximately $153 million under the property quota share treaties. The impact of investigations of possible anti-competitive practices by the company may impact our results of operations, financial condition and financial strength ratings. On or about November 8, 2005, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the Antitrust and Civil Medicaid Fraud Division of the Office of the Attorney General of Texas, relating to an investigation into (1) the possibility of restraint of trade in one or more markets within the State of Texas arising out of our business relationships with AIG and Chubb, and (2) certain insurance and insurance brokerage practices, including those relating to contingent commissions and false quotes, which are also the subject of industry-wide investigations and class action litigation. Specifically, the CID seeks information concerning our relationship with our investors, and in particular, AIG and Chubb, including their role in our business, sharing of business information and any agreements not to compete. The CID also seeks information regarding (i) contingent commission, placement service or other agreements that we may have had with brokers or producers, and (ii) the possibility of the provision of any non-competitive bids by us in connection with the placement of insurance. We are cooperating in this ongoing investigation, and we have produced documents and other information in response to the CID. Based on our discussions with representatives of the Attorney General of Texas, the investigation is currently expected to proceed to a settlement. This is likely to result in certain payments that would be adverse to us. Based on our discussions, we have reserved $2.1 million for settlement payments to be made to the State of Texas. The outcome of the investigation may form a basis for investigations, civil litigation or enforcement proceedings by other state regulators, by policyholders or by other private parties, or other settlements that could have a negative effect on us. 31 Table of Contents We cannot assure you that we will be able to settle this matter with the Attorney General of the State of Texas or, if we do settle, that it will not be for a greater amount than what we have reserved. A complaint filed against our Bermuda insurance subsidiary could, if adversely determined or resolved, subject us to a material loss. On April 4, 2006, a complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta Division) by a group of several corporations and certain of their related entities in an action entitled New Cingular Wireless Headquarters, LLC et al, as plaintiffs, against certain defendants, including Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Marsh Inc. and Aon Corporation, in their capacities as insurance brokers, and 78 insurers, including our insurance subsidiary in Bermuda, Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd. The action generally relates to broker defendants placement of insurance contracts for plaintiffs with the 78 insurer defendants. Plaintiffs maintain that the defendants used a variety of illegal schemes and practices designed to, among other things, allocate customers, rig bids for insurance products and raise the prices of insurance products paid by the plaintiffs. In addition, plaintiffs allege that the broker defendants steered policyholders business to preferred insurer defendants. Plaintiffs claim that as a result of these practices, policyholders either paid more for insurance products or received less beneficial terms than the competitive market would have charged. The eight counts in the complaint allege, among other things, (i) unreasonable restraints of trade and conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Act, (ii) violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, (iii) that broker defendants breached their fiduciary duties to plaintiffs, (iv) that insurer defendants participated in and induced this alleged breach of fiduciary duty, (v) unjust enrichment, (vi) common law fraud by broker defendants and (vii) statutory and consumer fraud under the laws of certain U.S. states. Plaintiffs seek equitable and legal remedies, including injunctive relief, unquantified consequential and punitive damages, and treble damages under the Sherman Act and RICO. No specific amount of damages is claimed. On October 16, 2006, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered that the litigation be transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey for inclusion in the coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings occurring in that court. Neither Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd nor any of the other defendants have responded to the complaint. Written discovery has begun but has not been completed. While this matter is in an early stage, and it is not possible to predict its outcome, the company does not currently believe that the outcome will have a material adverse effect on the companys operations or financial position. Government authorities are continuing to investigate the insurance industry, which may adversely affect our business. The attorneys general for multiple states and other insurance regulatory authorities have been investigating a number of issues and practices within the insurance industry, and in particular insurance brokerage practices. These investigations of the insurance industry in general, whether involving the company specifically or not, together with any legal or regulatory proceedings, related settlements and industry reform or other changes arising therefrom, may materially adversely affect our business and future prospects. When we act as a property insurer and reinsurer, we are particularly vulnerable to losses from catastrophes. Our direct property insurance and reinsurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes. Catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable events, including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, windstorms, hailstorms, severe winter weather, floods, fires, tornadoes, explosions and other natural or man-made disasters. Over the past several years, changing weather patterns and climactic conditions such as global warming have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters in certain parts of the world and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. In addition, some experts have attributed the recent high incidence of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean to a permanent change in weather patterns resulting from rising ocean temperature in the region. The international geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposure from natural events occurring in a number of areas throughout the world, including windstorms in Europe, hurricanes and windstorms in Florida, the Gulf Coast and the Atlantic coast regions of the United States, typhoons and earthquakes in Japan and Taiwan and earthquakes in California and parts of the 32 Table of Contents Midwestern United States known as the New Madrid zone. The loss experience of catastrophe insurers and reinsurers has historically been characterized as low frequency but high severity in nature. In recent years, the frequency of major catastrophes appears to have increased. Increases in the values and concentrations of insured property and the effects of inflation have resulted in increased severity of losses to the industry in recent years, and we expect this trend to continue. In the event we experience further losses from catastrophes that have already occurred, there is a possibility that loss reserves for such catastrophes will be inadequate to cover the losses. In addition, because U.S. GAAP does not permit insurers and reinsurers to reserve for catastrophes until they occur, claims from these events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We could face losses from terrorism and political unrest. We have exposure to losses resulting from acts of terrorism and political instability. Although we generally exclude acts of terrorism from our property insurance policies and reinsurance treaties where practicable, we provide coverage in circumstances where we believe we are adequately compensated for assuming those risks. Moreover, even in cases where we seek to exclude coverage, we may not be able to completely eliminate our exposure to terrorist acts. It is impossible to predict the timing or severity of these acts with statistical certainty or to estimate the amount of loss that any given occurrence will generate. To the extent we suffer losses from these risks, such losses could be significant. The failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We seek to limit our loss exposure by adhering to maximum limitations on policies written in defined geographical zones (which limits our exposure to losses in any one geographic area), limiting program size for each client (which limits our exposure to losses with respect to any one client), adjusting retention levels and establishing per risk and per occurrence limitations for each event and prudent underwriting guidelines for each insurance program written (all of which limit our liability on any one policy). Most of our direct liability insurance policies include maximum aggregate limitations. We cannot assure you that any of these loss limitation methods will be effective. In particular, geographic zone limitations involve significant underwriting judgments, including the determination of the areas of the zones and whether a policy falls within particular zone limits. Disputes relating to coverage and choice of legal forum may also arise. As a result, various provisions of our policies that are designed to limit our risks, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage (which limit the range and amount of liability to which we are exposed on a policy) or choice of forum (which provides us with a predictable set of laws to govern our policies and the ability to lower costs by retaining legal counsel in fewer jurisdictions), may not be enforceable in the manner we intend and some or all of our other loss limitation methods may prove to be ineffective. One or more catastrophic or other events could result in claims and expenses that substantially exceed our expectations and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For our reinsurance business, we depend on the policies, procedures and expertise of ceding companies; these companies may fail to accurately assess the risks they underwrite which may lead us to inaccurately assess the risks we assume. Because we participate in reinsurance markets, the success of our reinsurance underwriting efforts depends in part on the policies, procedures and expertise of the ceding companies making the original underwriting decisions (when an insurer transfers some or all of its risk to a reinsurer, the insurer is sometimes referred to as a ceding company). Underwriting is a matter of judgment, involving important assumptions about matters that are inherently unpredictable and beyond the ceding companies control and for which historical experience and statistical analysis may not provide sufficient guidance. We face the risk that the ceding companies may fail to accurately assess the risks they underwrite, which, in turn, may lead us to inaccurately assess the risks we assume as reinsurance; if this occurs, the premiums that are ceded to us may not adequately compensate us and we could face significant losses on these reinsurance contracts. 33 Table of Contents The availability and cost of security arrangements for reinsurance transactions may materially impact our ability to provide reinsurance to insurers domiciled in the United States. Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd is neither licensed nor admitted as an insurer, nor is it accredited as a reinsurer, in any jurisdiction in the United States. As a result, it is required to post collateral security with respect to any reinsurance liabilities it assumes from ceding insurers domiciled in the United States in order for U.S. ceding companies to obtain credit on their U.S. statutory financial statements with respect to the insurance liabilities ceded to them. Under applicable statutory provisions, the security arrangements may be in the form of letters of credit, reinsurance trusts maintained by trustees or funds-withheld arrangements where assets are held by the ceding company. Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd uses trust accounts and has access to up to $1 billion in letters of credit under two letter of credit facilities. The letter of credit facilities impose restrictive covenants, including restrictions on asset sales, limitations on the incurrence of certain liens and required collateral and financial strength levels. Violations of these or other covenants could result in the suspension of access to letters of credit or such letters of credit becoming due and payable. If these letter of credit facilities are not sufficient or drawable or if Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd is unable to renew either or both of these facilities or to arrange for trust accounts or other types of security on commercially acceptable terms, its ability to provide reinsurance to U.S.-domiciled insurers may be severely limited. In addition, security arrangements with ceding insurers may subject our assets to security interests or may require that a portion of our assets be pledged to, or otherwise held by, third parties. Although the investment income derived from our assets while held in trust typically accrues to our benefit, the investment of these assets is governed by the terms of the letter of credit facilities and the investment regulations of the state of domicile of the ceding insurer, which generally regulate the amount and quality of investments permitted and which may be more restrictive than the investment regulations applicable to us under Bermuda law. These restrictions may result in lower investment yields on these assets, which could adversely affect our profitability. We depend on a small number of brokers for a large portion of our revenues. The loss of business provided by any one of them could adversely affect us. We market our insurance and reinsurance products worldwide through insurance and reinsurance brokers. In 2006, our top four brokers represented approximately 68% of our gross premiums written. Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Aon Corporation and Willis Group Holdings Ltd were responsible for the distribution of approximately 32%, 19% and 10%, respectively, of our gross premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2006. Loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by any one of those brokers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our reliance on brokers subjects us to their credit risk. In accordance with industry practice, we frequently pay amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts to brokers, and these brokers, in turn, pay these amounts to the customers that have purchased insurance or reinsurance from us. If a broker fails to make such a payment, it is likely that, in most cases, we will be liable to the client for the deficiency because of local laws or contractual obligations. Likewise, when a customer pays premiums for policies written by us to a broker for further payment to us, these premiums are generally considered to have been paid and, in most cases, the client will no longer be liable to us for those amounts, whether or not we actually receive the premiums. Consequently, we assume a degree of credit risk associated with the brokers we use with respect to our insurance and reinsurance business. We may be unable to purchase reinsurance for our own account on commercially acceptable terms or to collect under any reinsurance we have purchased. We acquire reinsurance purchased for our own account to mitigate the effects of large or multiple losses on our financial condition. From time to time, market conditions have limited, and in some cases prevented, insurers and reinsurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance they consider adequate for their business needs. For example, following the events of September 11, 2001, terms and conditions in the reinsurance markets generally became less attractive to buyers of such coverage. Similar conditions may occur at any time in the future, and we 34 Table of Contents may not be able to purchase reinsurance in the areas and for the amounts required or desired. Even if reinsurance is generally available, we may not be able to negotiate terms that we deem appropriate or acceptable or to obtain coverage from entities with satisfactory financial resources. In addition, a reinsurers insolvency, or inability or refusal to make payments under a reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance agreement with us, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations because we remain liable to the insured under the corresponding coverages written by us. Our investment performance may adversely affect our financial performance and ability to conduct business. We derive a significant portion of our income from our invested assets. As a result, our operating results depend in part on the performance of our investment portfolio. Our investment performance is subject to a variety of risks, including risks related to general economic conditions, market volatility and interest rate fluctuations, liquidity risk, and credit and default risk. Additionally, with respect to some of our investments, we are subject to pre-payment or reinvestment risk. As authorized by our board of directors, we have invested $200 million of our shareholders equity in hedge funds. As a result, we may be subject to restrictions on redemption, which may limit our ability to withdraw funds for some period of time after our initial investment. The values of, and returns on, such investments may also be more volatile. Because of the unpredictable nature of losses that may arise under insurance or reinsurance policies written by us, our liquidity needs could be substantial and may arise at any time. To the extent we are unsuccessful in correlating our investment portfolio with our expected liabilities, we may be forced to liquidate our investments at times and prices that are not optimal. This could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our investment portfolio. If our liquidity needs or general liability profile unexpectedly change, we may not be successful in continuing to structure our investment portfolio in its current manner. Any increase in interest rates could result in significant losses in the fair value of our investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio contains interest-rate-sensitive instruments that may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. Fluctuations in interest rates affect our returns on fixed income investments. Generally, investment income will be reduced during sustained periods of lower interest rates as higher-yielding fixed income securities are called, mature or are sold and the proceeds reinvested at lower rates. During periods of rising interest rates, prices of fixed income securities tend to fall and realized gains upon their sale are reduced. In addition, we are exposed to changes in the level or volatility of equity prices that affect the value of securities or instruments that derive their value from a particular equity security, a basket of equity securities or a stock index. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Although we attempt to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to effectively mitigate interest rate sensitivity. In particular, a significant increase in interest rates could result in significant losses, realized or unrealized, in the fair value of our investment portfolio and, consequently, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, our investment portfolio includes mortgage-backed securities. As of December 31, 2006, mortgage-backed securities constituted approximately 30.6% of the fair market value of our aggregate invested assets. Aggregate invested assets include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, fixed-maturity securities, a fund consisting of global high-yield fixed-income securities, four hedge funds, balances receivable on sale of investments and balances due on purchase of investments. As with other fixed income investments, the fair market value of these securities fluctuates depending on market and other general economic conditions and the interest rate environment. Changes in interest rates can expose us to prepayment risks on these investments. In periods of declining interest rates, mortgage prepayments generally increase and mortgage-backed securities are prepaid more quickly, requiring us to reinvest the proceeds at the then current market rates. 35 Table of Contents We may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The U.S. dollar is our reporting currency and the functional currency of all of our operating subsidiaries. We enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts where the premiums receivable and losses payable are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, we maintain a portion of our investments and liabilities in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Assets in non-U.S. currencies are generally converted into U.S. dollars at the time of receipt. When we incur a liability in a non-U.S. currency, we carry such liability on our books in the original currency. These liabilities are converted from the non-U.S. currency to U.S. dollars at the time of payment. We may incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses as we ultimately receive premiums and settle claims required to be paid in foreign currencies. We have currency hedges in place that seek to alleviate our potential exposure to volatility in foreign exchange rates and intend to consider the use of additional hedges when we are advised of known or probable significant losses that will be paid in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent that we do not seek to hedge our foreign currency risk or our hedges prove ineffective, the impact of a movement in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our operating results. We may require additional capital in the future that may not be available to us on commercially favorable terms. Our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses. To the extent that the funds generated by insurance premiums received and sale proceeds and income from our investment portfolio are insufficient to fund future operating requirements and cover losses and loss expenses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth and reduce our assets. Any future financing, if available at all, may be on terms that are not favorable to us. In the case of equity financings, dilution to our shareholders could result, and the securities issued may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior or otherwise superior to those of our common shares. Conflicts of interests may arise because affiliates of some of our principal shareholders have continuing agreements and business relationships with us, and also may compete with us in several of our business lines. Affiliates of some of our principal shareholders engage in transactions with our company. Subsidiaries of AIG provided limited administrative services to our company through 2006. Affiliates of the Goldman Sachs Funds serve as investment managers for our entire investment portfolio, except for that portion invested in the AIG Select Hedge Fund Ltd., which is managed by a subsidiary of AIG. An affiliate of Chubb provides surplus lines services to our U.S. subsidiaries. The interests of these affiliates of our principal shareholders may conflict with the interests of our company. Affiliates of our principal shareholders, AIG, Chubb and Securitas Capital Fund, are also customers of our company. Furthermore, affiliates of AIG, Chubb, Swiss Re and the Goldman Sachs Funds may from time to time compete with us, including by assisting or investing in the formation of other entities engaged in the insurance and reinsurance business. Conflicts of interest could also arise with respect to business opportunities that could be advantageous to AIG, Chubb, Swiss Re, the Goldman Sachs Funds or other existing shareholders or any of their affiliates, on the one hand, and us, on the other hand. AIG, Chubb, Swiss Re and the Goldman Sachs Funds either directly or through affiliates, also maintain business relationships with numerous companies that may directly compete with us. In general, these affiliates could pursue business interests or exercise their voting power as shareholders in ways that are detrimental to us, but beneficial to themselves or to other companies in which they invest or with whom they have a material relationship. Our business could be adversely affected if we lose any member of our management team or are unable to attract and retain our personnel. Our success depends in substantial part on our ability to attract and retain our employees who generate and service our business. We rely substantially on the services of our executive management team. If we lose the 36 Table of Contents services of any member of our executive management team, our business could be adversely affected. If we are unable to attract and retain other talented personnel, the further implementation of our business strategy could be impeded. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business. The location of our global headquarters in Bermuda may also impede our ability to attract and retain talented employees. We currently have written employment agreements with our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel and Chief Corporate Actuary and certain other members of our executive management team. We do not maintain key man life insurance policies for any of our employees. Risks Related to the Insurance and Reinsurance Business The insurance and reinsurance business is historically cyclical and we expect to experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates and policy terms and conditions. Historically, insurers and reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to competition, frequency of occurrence or severity of catastrophic events, levels of underwriting capacity, general economic conditions and other factors. The supply of insurance and reinsurance is related to prevailing prices, the level of insured losses and the level of industry surplus which, in turn, may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being earned in the insurance and reinsurance industry. As a result, the insurance and reinsurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense competition on price and policy terms due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permit favorable premium rates and policy terms and conditions. Because premium levels for many products have increased over the past several years, the supply of insurance and reinsurance has increased and is likely to increase further, either as a result of capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of additional capital by existing insurers or reinsurers. Continued increases in the supply of insurance and reinsurance may have consequences for us, including fewer contracts written, lower premium rates, increased expenses for customer acquisition and retention, and less favorable policy terms and conditions. Increased competition in the insurance and reinsurance markets in which we operate could adversely impact our operating margins. The insurance and reinsurance industries are highly competitive. We compete with major U.S. and non-U.S. insurers and reinsurers, including other Bermuda-based insurers and reinsurers, on an international and regional basis. Many of our competitors have greater financial, marketing and management resources. Since September 2001, a number of new Bermuda-based insurance and reinsurance companies have been formed and some of those companies compete in the same market segments in which we operate. Some of these companies have more capital than us. As a result of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the insurance industrys largest natural catastrophe loss, and two subsequent substantial hurricanes (Rita and Wilma), existing insurers and reinsurers raised new capital and significant investments were made in new insurance and reinsurance companies in Bermuda. In addition, risk-linked securities and derivative and other non-traditional risk transfer mechanisms and vehicles are being developed and offered by other parties, including entities other than insurance and reinsurance companies. The availability of these non-traditional products could reduce the demand for traditional insurance and reinsurance. A number of new, proposed or potential industry or legislative developments could further increase competition in our industry. These developments include:  legislative mandates for insurers to provide specified types of coverage in areas where we or our ceding clients do business, such as the terrorism coverage mandated in the TRIA and the TRIA Extension, could eliminate or reduce opportunities for us to write those coverages; and  programs in which state-sponsored entities provide property insurance or reinsurance in catastrophe prone areas, such as recent legislative enactments passed in the State of Florida, or other alternative market types of coverage could eliminate or reduce opportunities for us to write those coverages. New competition from these developments could result in fewer contracts written, lower premium rates, increased expenses for customer acquisition and retention and less favorable policy terms and conditions. 37 Table of Contents The effects of emerging claims and coverage issues on our business are uncertain. As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance and reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued. Examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include:  larger settlements and jury awards in cases involving professionals and corporate directors and officers covered by professional liability and directors and officers liability insurance; and  a trend of plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers in class action litigation related to claims handling, insurance sales practices and other practices related to the conduct of our business. Risks Related to Laws and Regulations Applicable to Us Compliance by our insurance subsidiaries with the legal and regulatory requirements to which they are subject is expensive. Any failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our insurance subsidiaries are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations applicable to insurance or reinsurance companies, both in the jurisdictions in which they are organized and where they sell their insurance and reinsurance products. The insurance and regulatory environment, in particular for offshore insurance and reinsurance companies, has become subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions, including the United States, various states within the United States and the United Kingdom. In the past, there have been Congressional and other initiatives in the United States regarding increased supervision and regulation of the insurance industry, including proposals to supervise and regulate offshore reinsurers. It is not possible to predict the future impact of changes in laws and regulations on our operations. The cost of complying with any new legal requirements affecting our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our subsidiaries may not always be able to obtain or maintain necessary licenses, permits, authorizations or accreditations. They also may not be able to fully comply with, or to obtain appropriate exemptions from, the laws and regulations applicable to them. Any failure to comply with applicable law or to obtain appropriate exemptions could result in restrictions on either the ability of the company in question, as well as potentially its affiliates, to do business in one or more of the jurisdictions in which they operate or on brokers on which we rely to produce business for us. In addition, any such failure to comply with applicable laws or to obtain appropriate exemptions could result in the imposition of fines or other sanctions. Any of these sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our principal insurance subsidiary, Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd, is registered as a Class 4 Bermuda insurance and reinsurance company and is subject to regulation and supervision in Bermuda. The applicable Bermudian statutes and regulations generally are designed to protect insureds and ceding insurance companies rather than shareholders. Among other things, those statutes and regulations:  require Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd to maintain minimum levels of capital and surplus,  impose liquidity requirements which restrict the amount and type of investments it may hold,  prescribe solvency standards that it must meet and  restrict payments of dividends and reductions of capital and provide for the performance of periodic examinations of Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd and its financial condition. These statutes and regulations may, in effect, restrict the ability of Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd to write new business. Although it conducts its operations from Bermuda, Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd is not authorized to directly underwrite local risks in Bermuda. 38 Table of Contents Allied World Assurance Company (U.S.) Inc., a Delaware domiciled insurer, and Newmarket Underwriters Insurance Company, a New Hampshire domiciled insurer, are both subject to the statutes and regulations of their relevant state of domicile as well as any other state in the United States where they conduct business. In the 15 states where the companies are admitted, the companies must comply with all insurance laws and regulations, including insurance rate and form requirements. Insurance laws and regulations may vary significantly from state to state. In those states where the companies act as surplus lines carriers, the states regulation focuses mainly on the companys solvency. Allied World Assurance Company (Europe) Limited, an Irish domiciled insurer, operates within the European Union non-life insurance legal and regulatory framework as established under the Non-Life Directive. Allied World Assurance Company (Europe) Limited is required to operate in accordance with the provisions of the Irish Insurance Acts and Regulations and the requirements of the Irish Financial Regulator. Allied World Assurance Company (Reinsurance) Limited, an Irish domiciled reinsurer, is also authorized by the Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom and is subject to the reinsurance regulations promulgated by the Financial Services Authority. Prior to the adoption of the European Union Reinsurance Directive in December 2005, there was no common European Union framework for the authorization and regulation of reinsurance undertakings  reinsurance undertakings operated according to the legal and regulatory requirements of individual European Union member states. With the adoption of the European Union Reinsurance Directive in December 2005, reinsurance undertakings may, subject to the satisfaction of certain formalities, carry on reinsurance business in other European Union member states either directly from the home member state (on a services basis) or through local branches (by way of permanent establishment). The European Union Reinsurance Directive was transposed into Irish law in July 2006. Our Bermudian entities could become subject to regulation in the United States. Neither Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, Ltd, Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd nor Allied World Assurance Holdings (Ireland) Ltd is licensed or admitted as an insurer, nor is any of them accredited as a reinsurer, in any jurisdiction in the United States. More than 85% of the gross premiums written by Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd, however, are derived from insurance or reinsurance contracts entered into with entities domiciled in the United States. The insurance laws of each state in the United States regulate the sale of insurance and reinsurance within the states jurisdiction by foreign insurers. Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd conducts its business through its offices in Bermuda and does not maintain an office, and its personnel do not solicit insurance business, resolve claims or conduct other insurance business, in the United States. While Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd does not believe it is in violation of insurance laws of any jurisdiction in the United States, we cannot be certain that inquiries or challenges to our insurance and reinsurance activities will not be raised in the future. It is possible that, if Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd were to become subject to any laws of this type at any time in the future, we would not be in compliance with the requirements of those laws. Our holding company structure and regulatory and other constraints affect our ability to pay dividends and make other payments. Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, Ltd is a holding company, and as such has no substantial operations of its own. It does not have any significant assets other than its ownership of the shares of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd, Allied World Assurance Holdings (Ireland) Ltd, Allied World Assurance Company (Europe) Limited, Allied World Assurance Company (U.S.) Inc., Newmarket Underwriters Insurance Company, Allied World Assurance Company (Reinsurance) Limited and Newmarket Administrative Services, Inc. Dividends and other permitted distributions from insurance subsidiaries are expected to be the sole source of funds for Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, Ltd to meet any ongoing cash requirements, including any debt service payments and other expenses, and to pay any dividends to shareholders. Bermuda law, including Bermuda insurance regulations and the Companies Act restricts the declaration and payment of dividends and the making of distributions by Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, Ltd, Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd, and Allied World Assurance Holdings (Ireland) Ltd, unless specified requirements are met. Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd is prohibited from paying dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus (as shown in its previous financial years statutory balance sheet) 39 Table of Contents unless it files with the Bermuda Monetary Authority at least seven days before payment of such dividend an affidavit stating that the declaration of such dividends has not caused it to fail to meet its minimum solvency margin and minimum liquidity ratio. Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd is also prohibited from declaring or paying dividends without the approval of the Bermuda Monetary Authority if Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd failed to meet its minimum solvency margin and minimum liquidity ratio on the last day of the previous financial year. Furthermore, in order to reduce its total statutory capital by 15% or more, Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd would require the prior approval of the Bermuda Monetary Authority. In addition, Bermuda corporate law prohibits a company from declaring or paying a dividend if there are reasonable grounds for believing that (i) the company is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due; or (ii) the realizable value of the companys assets would thereby be less than the aggregate of its liabilities, its issued share capital and its share premium accounts. The inability by Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd or Allied World Assurance Holdings (Ireland) Ltd to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, Ltd to meet its cash requirements at the holding company level could have a material adverse effect on our business, our ability to make payments on any indebtedness, our ability to transfer capital from one subsidiary to another and our ability to declare and pay dividends to our shareholders. In addition, Allied World Assurance Company (Europe) Limited, Allied World Assurance Company (Reinsurance) Limited, Allied World Assurance Company (U.S.) Inc. and Newmarket Underwriters Insurance Company are subject to significant regulatory restrictions limiting their ability to declare and pay any dividends. In particular, payments of dividends by Allied World Assurance Company (U.S.) Inc. and Newmarket Underwriters Insurance Company are subject to restrictions on statutory surplus pursuant to Delaware law and New Hampshire law, respectively. Both states require prior regulatory approval of any payment of extraordinary dividends. Our business could be adversely affected by Bermuda employment restrictions. We will need to hire additional employees to work in Bermuda. Under Bermuda law, non-Bermudians (other than spouses of Bermudians, holders of a permanent residents certificate and holders of a working residents certificate) may not engage in any gainful occupation in Bermuda without an appropriate governmental work permit. Work permits may be granted or extended by the Bermuda government if it is shown that, after proper public advertisement in most cases, no Bermudian (or spouse of a Bermudian, holder of a permanent residents certificate or holder of a working residents certificate) is available who meets the minimum standard requirements for the advertised position. In 2001, the Bermuda government announced a new immigration policy limiting the total duration of work permits, including renewals, to six to nine years, with specified exemptions for key employees. In March 2004, the Bermuda government announced an amendment to this policy which expanded the categories of occupations recognized by the government as key and with respect to which businesses can apply to be exempt from the six-to-nine-year limitations. The categories include senior executives, managers with global responsibility, senior financial posts, certain legal professionals, senior insurance professionals, experienced/specialized brokers, actuaries, specialist investment traders/analysts and senior information technology engineers and managers. All of our Bermuda-based professional employees who require work permits have been granted permits by the Bermuda government. It is possible that the Bermuda government could deny work permits for our employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Shares Future sales of our common shares may adversely affect the market price. As of February 28, 2007 we had 60,342,079 common shares outstanding. Up to an additional 3,062,308 common shares may be issuable upon the vesting and exercise of outstanding stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance based equity awards. In addition, our principal shareholders and their transferees have the right to require us to register their common shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act) for sale to the public. Following any registration of this type, the common shares to which the registration relates will be freely transferable. We have also filed a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register common shares issued or reserved for issuance under the Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, Ltd Amended and Restated 2001 Employee Stock Option Plan, the Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, 40 Table of Contents Ltd Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan and the Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, Ltd Long-Term Incentive Plan. Subject to the exercise of issued and outstanding stock options, shares registered under the registration statement on Form S-8 will be available for sale to the public. We cannot predict what effect, if any, future sales of our common shares, or the availability of common shares for future sale, will have on the market price of our common shares. Sales of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, or the perception that sales of this type could occur, could depress the market price of our common shares and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common shares at a time and price that you deem appropriate. Our Bye-laws contain restrictions on ownership, voting and transfers of our common shares. Under our amended and restated Bye-laws, our directors (or their designees) are required to decline to register any transfer of common shares that would result in a U.S. person owning our common shares and shares of any other class or classes, in excess of certain prescribed limitations. These limitations take into account attribution and constructive ownership rules under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), and beneficial ownership rules under the Exchange Act. Similar restrictions apply to our ability to issue or repurchase shares. Our directors (or their designees), in their absolute discretion, may also decline to register the transfer of any common shares if they have reason to believe that (1) the transfer could expose us or any of our subsidiaries, any shareholder or any person ceding insurance to us or any of our subsidiaries, to, or materially increase the risk of, material adverse tax or regulatory treatment in any jurisdiction; or (2) the transfer is required to be registered under the Securities Act or under the securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction, and such registration has not occurred. These restrictions apply to a transfer of common shares even if the transfer has been executed on the New York Stock Exchange. Any person wishing to transfer common shares will be deemed to own the shares for dividend, voting and reporting purposes until the transfer has been registered on our register of members. We are authorized to request information from any holder or prospective acquiror of common shares as necessary to give effect to the transfer, issuance and repurchase restrictions described above, and may decline to effect that kind of transaction if complete and accurate information is not received as requested. Our Bye-laws also contain provisions relating to voting powers that may cause the voting power of certain shareholders to differ significantly from their ownership of common shares. Our Bye-laws specify the voting rights of any owner of shares to prevent any person from owning, beneficially, constructively or by attribution, shares carrying 10% or more of the total voting rights attached to all of our outstanding shares. Because of the attribution and constructive ownership provisions of the Code, and the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding determination of beneficial ownership, this requirement may have the effect of reducing the voting rights of a shareholder even if that shareholder does not directly or indirectly hold 10% or more of the total combined voting power of our company. Further, our directors (or their designees) have the authority to request from any shareholder specified information for the purpose of determining whether that shareholders voting rights are to be reduced. If a shareholder fails to respond to this request or submits incomplete or inaccurate information, the directors (or their designees) have the discretion to disregard all votes attached to that shareholders shares. No person, including any of our current shareholders, may exercise 10% or more of our total voting rights. To our knowledge, as of this date, none of our current shareholders is anticipated to own 10% or more of the total voting rights attached to all of our outstanding shares after giving effect to the voting cutback. Anti-takeover provisions in our Bye-laws could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors, which could diminish the value of our common shares. Our Bye-laws contain provisions that may entrench directors and make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so. In addition, these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable. For example, these provisions may prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our shares offered by a bidder in a potential takeover. Even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares if they are viewed as discouraging changes in management and takeover attempts in the future. 41 Table of Contents For example, the following provisions in our Bye-laws could have such an effect:  the election of our directors is staggered, meaning that members of only one of three classes of our directors are elected each year, thus limiting your ability to replace directors,  our shareholders have a limited ability to remove directors,  the total voting power of any shareholder beneficially owning 10% or more of the total voting power of our voting shares will be reduced to less than 10% of the total voting power. Conversely, shareholders owning less than 10% of the total voting power may gain increased voting power as a result of these cutbacks,  no shareholder may transfer shares if as a result of such transfer any U.S. person (other than some of our principal shareholders, whose share ownership may not exceed the percentage of our common shares owned immediately after our IPO) owns 10% or more of our shares by vote or value,  if our directors determine that share ownership of any person may result in a violation of our ownership limitations, our board of directors has the power to force that shareholder to sell its shares and  our board of directors has the power to issue preferred shares without any shareholder approval, which effectively allows the board to dilute the holdings of any shareholder and could be used to institute a poison pill that would work to dilute the share ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors. As a shareholder of our company, you may have greater difficulties in protecting your interests than as a shareholder of a U.S. corporation. The Companies Act, which applies to our company, our Bermuda insurance subsidiary, Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd, and Allied World Assurance Holdings (Ireland) Ltd, differs in material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. Taken together with the provisions of our Bye-laws, some of these differences may result in your having greater difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder of our company than you would have as a shareholder of a U.S. corporation. This affects, among other things, the circumstances under which transactions involving an interested director are voidable, whether an interested director can be held accountable for any benefit realized in a transaction with our company, what approvals are required for business combinations by our company with a large shareholder or a wholly-owned subsidiary, what rights you may have as a shareholder to enforce specified provisions of the Companies Act or our Bye-laws, and the circumstances under which we may indemnify our directors and officers. It may be difficult to enforce service of process and enforcement of judgments against us and our officers and directors. Our company is a Bermuda company and it may be difficult for investors to enforce judgments against it or its directors and executive officers. We are incorporated pursuant to the laws of Bermuda and our business is based in Bermuda. In addition, certain of our directors and officers reside outside the United States, and all or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of such persons are located in jurisdictions outside the United States. As such, it may be difficult or impossible to effect service of process within the United States upon us or those persons or to recover against us or them on judgments of U.S. courts, including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. Further, no claim may be brought in Bermuda against us or our directors and officers in the first instance for violation of U.S. federal securities laws because these laws have no extraterritorial jurisdiction under Bermuda law and do not have force of law in Bermuda. A Bermuda court may, however, impose civil liability, including the possibility of monetary damages, on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under Bermuda law. We have been advised by Conyers Dill & Pearman, our Bermuda counsel, that there is doubt as to whether the courts of Bermuda would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against us or our directors and officers, predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws or original actions brought in Bermuda against us or such persons predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Further, we have been 42 Table of Contents advised by Conyers Dill & Pearman that there is no treaty in effect between the United States and Bermuda providing for the enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts. Some remedies available under the laws of U.S. jurisdictions, including some remedies available under the U.S. federal securities laws, may not be allowed in Bermuda courts as contrary to that jurisdictions public policy. Because judgments of U.S. courts are not automatically enforceable in Bermuda, it may be difficult for investors to recover against us based upon such judgments. There are regulatory limitations on the ownership and transfer of our common shares. The Bermuda Monetary Authority must approve all issuances and transfers of securities of a Bermuda exempted company like us. We have received from the Bermuda Monetary Authority their permission for the issue and subsequent transfer of our common shares, as long as the shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange or other appointed exchange, to and among persons resident and non-resident of Bermuda for exchange control purposes. Before any shareholder acquires 10% or more of the voting shares, either directly or indirectly, of Allied World Assurance Company (U.S.) Inc. or Newmarket Underwriters Insurance Company, that shareholder must file an acquisition statement with and obtain prior approval from the domiciliary insurance commissioner of the respective company. Risks Related to Taxation U.S. taxation of our non-U.S. companies could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, Ltd, Allied World Assurance Holdings (Ireland) Ltd and Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd are Bermuda companies, and Allied World Assurance Company (Europe) Limited and Allied World Assurance Company (Reinsurance) Limited are Irish companies (collectively, the non-U.S. companies). We believe that the non-U.S. companies have operated and will operate their respective businesses in a manner that will not cause them to be subject to U.S. tax (other than U.S. federal excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premiums and withholding tax on specified investment income from U.S. sources) on the basis that none of them are engaged in a U.S. trade or business. However, there are no definitive standards under current law as to those activities that constitute a U.S. trade or business and the determination of whether a non-U.S. company is engaged in a U.S. trade or business is inherently factual. Therefore, we cannot assure you that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) will not contend that a non-U.S. company is engaged in a U.S. trade or business. If any of the non-U.S. companies are engaged in a U.S. trade or business and do not qualify for benefits under the applicable income tax treaty, such company may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation at regular corporate rates on its premium income from U.S. sources and investment income that is effectively connected with its U.S. trade or business. In addition, a U.S. federal branch profits tax at the rate of 30% will be imposed on the earnings and profits attributable to such income. All of the premium income from U.S. sources and a significant portion of investment income of such company, as computed under Section 842 of the Code requiring that a foreign company carrying on a U.S. insurance or reinsurance business have a certain minimum amount of effectively connected net investment income, determined in accordance with a formula that depends, in part, on the amount of U.S. risks insured or reinsured by such company, may be subject to U.S. federal income and branch profits taxes. If Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd (the Bermuda insurance subsidiary) is engaged in a U.S. trade or business and qualifies for benefits under the United States-Bermuda tax treaty, U.S. federal income taxation of such subsidiary will depend on whether (i) it maintains a U.S. permanent establishment and (ii) the relief from taxation under the treaty generally applies to non-premium income. We believe that the Bermuda insurance subsidiary has operated and will operate its business in a manner that will not cause it to maintain a U.S. permanent establishment. However, the determination of whether an insurance company maintains a U.S. permanent establishment is inherently factual. Therefore, we cannot assure you that the IRS will not successfully assert that the Bermuda insurance subsidiary maintains a U.S. permanent establishment. In such case, the subsidiary will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates and branch profit tax at the rate of 30% with respect to its income attributable to the permanent establishment. Furthermore, although the provisions of the treaty clearly apply to premium income, it is uncertain whether they generally apply to other income of a Bermuda company. Therefore, if the Bermuda insurance subsidiary is engaged in a U.S. trade or business, qualifies for benefits under the treaty and does not maintain a U.S. permanent establishment but the treaty is interpreted not to apply to income other than 43 Table of Contents premium income, such subsidiary will be subject to U.S. federal income and branch profits taxes on its investment and other non-premium income as described in the preceding paragraph. If any of Allied World Assurance Holdings (Ireland) Ltd or our Irish companies is engaged in a U.S. trade or business and qualifies for benefits under the Ireland-United States income tax treaty, U.S. federal income taxation of such company will depend on whether it maintains a U.S. permanent establishment. We believe that each such company has operated and will operate its business in a manner that will not cause it to maintain a U.S. permanent establishment. However, the determination of whether a non-U.S. company maintains a U.S. permanent establishment is inherently factual. Therefore, we cannot assure you that the IRS will not successfully assert that any of such companies maintains a U.S. permanent establishment. In such case, the company will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates and branch profits tax at the rate of 5% with respect to its income attributable to the permanent establishment. U.S. federal income tax, if imposed, will be based on effectively connected or attributable income of a non-U.S. company computed in a manner generally analogous to that applied to the income of a U.S. corporation, except that all deductions and credits claimed by a non-U.S. company in a taxable year can be disallowed if the company does not file a U.S. federal income tax return for such year. Penalties may be assessed for failure to file such return. None of our non-U.S. companies filed U.S. federal income tax returns for the 2002 and 2001 taxable years. However, we have filed protective U.S. federal income tax returns on a timely basis for each non-U.S. company for 2003, 2004 and 2005, and we plan to timely file returns for subsequent years in order to preserve our right to claim tax deductions and credits in such years if any of such companies is determined to be subject to U.S. federal income tax. If any of our non-U.S. companies is subject to such U.S. federal taxation, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries may be subject to additional U.S. taxes in connection with our interaffiliate arrangements. Allied World Assurance Company (U.S.) Inc. and Newmarket Underwriters Insurance Company (the U.S. insurance subsidiaries) are U.S. companies. They reinsure a substantial portion of their insurance policies with Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd. While we believe that the terms of these reinsurance arrangements are arms length, we cannot assure you that the IRS will not successfully assert that the payments made by the U.S. subsidiaries with respect to such arrangements exceed arms length amounts. In such case, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries will be treated as realizing additional income that may be subject to additional U.S. income tax, possibly with interest and penalties. Such excess amount may also be deemed to have been distributed as dividends to the direct parent of the U.S. insurance subsidiaries, Allied World Assurance Holdings (Ireland) Ltd, in which case this deemed dividend will also be subject to a U.S. federal withholding tax of 5%, assuming that the parent is eligible for benefits under the United States-Ireland income tax treaty (or a withholding tax of 30% if the parent is not so eligible). If any of these U.S. taxes are imposed, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. You may be subject to U.S. income taxation with respect to income of our non-U.S. companies and ordinary income characterization of gains on disposition of common shares under the controlled foreign corporation (CFC) rules. We believe that U.S. persons holding our common shares should not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation with respect to income of our non-U.S. companies prior to the distribution of earnings attributable to such income or ordinary income characterization of gains on disposition of common shares on the basis that such persons should not be United States shareholders subject to the CFC rules of the Code. Generally, each United States shareholder of a CFC will be subject to (i) U.S. federal income taxation on its ratable share of the CFCs subpart F income, even if the earnings attributable to such income are not distributed, provided that such United States shareholder holds directly or through non-U.S. entities shares of the CFC; and (ii) potential ordinary income characterization of gains from sale or exchange of the directly owned shares of the non-U.S. corporation. For these purposes, any U.S. person who owns directly, through non-U.S. entities, or under applicable constructive ownership 44 Table of Contents rules, 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of any non-U.S. company will be considered to be a United States shareholder. Although our non-U.S. companies may be or become CFCs and certain of our principal U.S. shareholders currently own 10% or more of our common shares, for the following reasons we believe that no U.S. person holding our shares directly, or through non-U.S. entities, should be a United States shareholder. First, our Bye-laws provide that if a U.S. person (including any principal shareholder) owns directly or through non-U.S. entities any of our shares, the number of votes conferred by the shares owned directly, indirectly or under applicable constructive ownership rules by such person will be less than 10% of the aggregate number of votes conferred by all issued shares of Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, Ltd. Second, our Bye-laws restrict issuance, conversion, transfer and repurchase of the shares to the extent such transaction would cause a U.S. person holding directly or through non-U.S. entities any of our shares to own directly, through non-U.S. entities or under applicable constructive ownership rules shares representing 10% or more of the voting power in Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, Ltd. Third, our Bye-laws and the bye-laws of our non-U.S. subsidiaries require (i) the board of directors of Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd to consist only of persons who have been elected as directors of Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, Ltd (with the number and classification of directors of Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd being identical to those of Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, Ltd) and (ii) the board of directors of each other non-U.S. subsidiary of Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, Ltd to consist only of persons approved by our shareholders as persons eligible to be elected as directors of such subsidiary. Therefore, U.S. persons holding common shares should not be subject to the CFC rules of the Code (except that a U.S. person may be subject to the ordinary income characterization of gains on disposition of common shares if such person owned 10% or more of our total voting power solely under the applicable constructive ownership rules at any time during the 5-year period ending on the date of the disposition when we were a CFC). We cannot assure you, however, that the Bye-law provisions referenced in this paragraph will operate as intended or that we will be otherwise successful in preventing a U.S. person from exceeding, or being deemed to exceed, these voting limitations. Accordingly, U.S. persons who hold our shares directly or through non-U.S. entities should consider the possible application of the CFC rules. You may be subject to U.S. income taxation under the related person insurance income (RPII) rules. Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd, Allied World Assurance Company (Europe) Limited and Allied World Assurance Company (Reinsurance) Limited (the non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries), are non-U.S. companies which currently insure and reinsure and are expected to continue to insure and reinsure directly or indirectly certain of our U.S. shareholders (including our U.S. principal shareholders) and persons related to such shareholders. We believe that U.S. persons that hold our shares directly or through non-U.S. entities will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation with respect to the income realized in connection with such insurance and reinsurance prior to distribution of earnings attributable to such income on the basis that RPII, determined on gross basis, realized by each non-U.S. insurance subsidiary will be less than 20% of its gross insurance income in each taxable year. In order to qualify for this exception, each non-U.S. insurance subsidiary requests information from its insureds and reinsureds in order to determine whether such persons are, or are related to, our direct and indirect shareholders. On the basis of this information, each non-U.S. subsidiary currently monitors and will monitor the amount of RPII realized and, when appropriate, declines and will decline to write primary insurance and reinsurance for our U.S. shareholders and persons related to such shareholders. However, we cannot assure you that the measures described in this paragraph will operate as intended. In addition, some of the factors that determine the extent of RPII in any period may be beyond our knowledge or control. For example, we may be considered to insure indirectly the risk of our shareholder if an unrelated company that insured such risk in the first instance reinsures such risk with us. Therefore, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in keeping the RPII realized by the non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries below the 20% limit in each taxable year. Furthermore, even if we are successful in keeping the RPII below the 20% limit, we cannot assure you that we will be able to establish that fact to the satisfaction of the U.S. tax authorities. If we are unable to establish that the RPII of any non-U.S. insurance subsidiary is less than 20% of that subsidiarys gross insurance income in any taxable year, and no other exception from the RPII rules applies, each U.S. person who owns common shares, directly or through non-U.S. entities, on the last day of the taxable year will be generally required to include in its income for U.S. federal income tax purposes that persons ratable share of that subsidiarys RPII for the taxable year, determined as if that RPII were distributed proportionately to U.S. holders at that date, regardless of whether that income was actually distributed. 45 Table of Contents The RPII rules provide that if a holder who is a U.S. person disposes of shares in a foreign insurance corporation that has RPII (even if the amount of RPII is less than 20% of the corporations gross insurance income) and in which U.S. persons own 25% or more of the shares, any gain from the disposition will generally be treated as a dividend to the extent of the holders share of the corporations undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that the holder owned the shares (whether or not those earnings and profits are attributable to RPII). In addition, such a shareholder will be required to comply with specified reporting requirements, regardless of the amount of shares owned. These rules should not apply to dispositions of our common shares because Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, Ltd is not itself directly engaged in the insurance business and these rules appear to apply only in the case of shares of corporations that are directly engaged in the insurance business. We cannot assure you, however, that the IRS will interpret these rules in this manner or that the proposed regulations addressing the RPII rules will not be promulgated in final form in a manner that would cause these rules to apply to dispositions of our common shares. U.S. tax-exempt entities may recognize unrelated business taxable income (UBTI). A U.S. tax-exempt entity holding our common shares generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to dividends and gains on our common shares, provided that such entity does not purchase our common shares with borrowed funds. However, if a U.S. tax-exempt entity realizes income with respect to our common shares under the CFC or RPII rules, as discussed above, such entity will be generally subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to such income as UBTI. Accordingly, U.S. tax-exempt entities that are potential investors in our common shares should consider the possible application of the CFC and RPII rules. You may be subject to additional U.S. federal income taxation with respect to distributions on and gains on dispositions of common shares under the passive foreign investment company (PFIC) rules. We believe that U.S. persons holding common shares should not be subject to additional U.S. federal income taxation with respect to distributions on and gains on dispositions of common shares under the PFIC rules. We expect that our insurance subsidiaries will be predominantly engaged in an insurance business and will not hold reserves in excess of reasonable needs of their business, and therefore qualify for the insurance exception from the PFIC rules. However, the determination of the nature of such business and the reasonableness of such reserves is inherently factual. Furthermore, we cannot assure you, as to what positions the IRS or a court might take in the future regarding the application of the PFIC rules to us. Therefore, we can not assure you that we will not be considered to be a PFIC. If we are considered to be a PFIC, U.S. persons holding common shares could be subject to additional U.S. federal income taxation on distributions on and gains on dispositions of common shares. Accordingly, each U.S. person who is considering an investment in common shares should consult his or her tax advisor as to the effects of the PFIC rules. Application of a recently published IRS Revenue Ruling with respect to our insurance or reinsurance arrangements can materially adversely affect us and our shareholders. Recently, the IRS published Revenue Ruling 2005-40 (the Ruling) addressing the requirement of adequate risk distribution among insureds in order for a primary insurance arrangement to constitute insurance for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS successfully contends that our insurance or reinsurance arrangements, including such arrangements with affiliates of our principal shareholders, and with our U.S. subsidiaries, do not provide for adequate risk distribution under the principles set forth in the Ruling, we and our shareholders could be subject to material adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, including taxation under PFIC rules. Future U.S. legislative action or other changes in U.S. tax law might adversely affect us or our shareholders. The tax treatment of non-U.S. insurance companies and their U.S. insurance subsidiaries has been the subject of discussion and legislative proposals in the U.S. Congress. We cannot assure you that future legislative action will not increase the amount of U.S. tax payable by our non-U.S. companies, our U.S. subsidiaries or our shareholders. If this happens, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 46 Table of Contents We may be subject to U.K. tax, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. None of our companies are incorporated in the United Kingdom. Accordingly, none of our companies should be treated as being resident in the United Kingdom for corporation tax purposes unless our central management and control of any such company is exercised in the United Kingdom. The concept of central management and control is indicative of the highest level of control of a company, which is wholly a question of fact. Each of our companies currently intend to manage our affairs so that none of our companies is resident in the United Kingdom for tax purposes. The rules governing the taxation of foreign companies operating in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency were amended by the Finance Act 2003. The current rules apply to the accounting periods of non-U.K. resident companies which start on or after January 1, 2003. Accordingly, a non-U.K. resident company will only be subject to U.K. corporation tax if it carries on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom. In that case, the company is, in broad terms, taxable on the profits and gains attributable to the permanent establishment in the United Kingdom. Broadly a company will have a permanent establishment if it has a fixed place of business in the United Kingdom through which the business of the company is wholly or partly carried on or if an agent acting on behalf of the company habitually exercises authority in the United Kingdom to do business on behalf of the company. Each of our companies, other than Allied World Assurance Company (Reinsurance) Limited and Allied World Assurance Company (Europe) Limited (which have established branches in the United Kingdom), currently intend that we will operate in such a manner as to not carry on a trade through a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom. If any of our U.S. subsidiaries were trading in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency and the U.S. subsidiaries were to qualify for benefits under the applicable income tax treaty between the United Kingdom and the United States, only those profits which were attributable to a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom would be subject to U.K. corporation tax. If Allied World Assurance Holdings (Ireland) Ltd was trading in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency and it was entitled to the benefits of the tax treaty between Ireland and the United Kingdom, it would only be subject to U.K. taxation on its profits which were attributable to a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom. The branches established in the United Kingdom by Allied World Assurance Company (Reinsurance) Limited and Allied World Assurance Company (Europe) Limited constitute a permanent establishment of those companies and the profits attributable to those permanent establishments are subject to U.K. corporation tax. The United Kingdom has no income tax treaty with Bermuda. There are circumstances in which companies that are neither resident in the United Kingdom nor entitled to the protection afforded by a double tax treaty between the United Kingdom and the jurisdiction in which they are resident may be exposed to income tax in the United Kingdom (other than by deduction or withholding) on the profits of a trade carried on there even if that trade is not carried on through a branch or agency, but each of our companies currently intend to operate in such a manner that none of our companies will fall within the charge to income tax in the United Kingdom (other than by deduction or withholding) in this respect. If any of our companies were treated as being resident in the United Kingdom for U.K. corporation tax purposes, or if any of our companies, other than Allied World Assurance Company (Reinsurance) Limited and Allied World Assurance Company (Europe) Limited, were to be treated as carrying on a trade in the United Kingdom through a branch or agency or of having a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom, our results of operations and your investment could be materially adversely affected. We may be subject to Irish tax, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Companies resident in Ireland are generally subject to Irish corporation tax on their worldwide income and capital gains. None of our companies, other than our Irish companies and Allied World Assurance Holdings (Ireland) Ltd, which resides in Ireland, should be treated as being resident in Ireland unless our central management and control is exercised in Ireland. The concept of central management and control is indicative of the highest level of control of a company, and is wholly a question of fact. Each of our companies, other than Allied World Assurance Holdings (Ireland) Ltd and our Irish companies, currently intend to operate in such a manner so that the central 47 Table of Contents management and control of each of our companies, other than Allied World Assurance Holdings (Ireland) Ltd and our Irish companies, is exercised outside of Ireland. Nevertheless, because central management and control is a question of fact to be determined based on a number of different factors, the Irish Revenue Commissioners might contend successfully that the central management and control of any of our companies, other than Allied World Assurance Holdings (Ireland) Ltd or our Irish companies, is exercised in Ireland. Should this occur, such company will be subject to Irish corporation tax on their worldwide income and capital gains. The trading income of a company not resident in Ireland for Irish tax purposes can also be subject to Irish corporation tax if it carries on a trade through a branch or agency in Ireland. Each of our companies currently intend to operate in such a manner so that none of our companies carry on a trade through a branch or agency in Ireland. Nevertheless, because neither case law nor Irish legislation definitively defines the activities that constitute trading in Ireland through a branch or agency, the Irish Revenue Commissioners might contend successfully that any of our companies, other than Allied World Assurance Holdings (Ireland) Ltd and our Irish companies, is trading through a branch or agency in Ireland. Should this occur, such companies will be subject to Irish corporation tax on profits attributable to that branch or agency. If any of our companies, other than Allied World Assurance Holdings (Ireland) Ltd and our Irish companies, were treated as resident in Ireland for Irish corporation tax purposes, or as carrying on a trade in Ireland through a branch or agency, our results of operations and your investment could be materially adversely affected. If corporate tax rates in Ireland increase, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. Trading income derived from the insurance and reinsurance businesses carried on in Ireland by our Irish companies is generally taxed in Ireland at a rate of 12.5%. Over the past number of years, various European Union Member States have, from time to time, called for harmonization of corporate tax rates within the European Union. Ireland, along with other member states, has consistently resisted any movement towards standardized corporate tax rates in the European Union. The Government of Ireland has also made clear its commitment to retain the 12.5% rate of corporation tax until at least the year 2025. Should, however, tax laws in Ireland change so as to increase the general corporation tax rate in Ireland, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If investments held by our Irish companies are determined not to be integral to the insurance and reinsurance businesses carried on by those companies, additional Irish tax could be imposed and our business and financial results could be adversely affected. Based on administrative practice, taxable income derived from investments made by our Irish companies is generally taxed in Ireland at the rate of 12.5% on the grounds that such investments either form part of the permanent capital required by regulatory authorities, or are otherwise integral to the insurance and reinsurance businesses carried on by those companies. Our Irish companies intend to operate in such a manner so that the level of investments held by such companies does not exceed the amount that is integral to the insurance and reinsurance businesses carried on by our Irish companies. If, however, investment income earned by our Irish companies exceeds these thresholds, or if the administrative practice of the Irish Revenue Commissioners changes, Irish corporations tax could apply to such investment income at a higher rate (currently 25%) instead of the general 12.5% rate, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We may become subject to taxes in Bermuda after March 28, 2016, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our investment. The Bermuda Minister of Finance, under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act, 1966 of Bermuda, has given each of Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, Ltd, Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd and Allied World Assurance Holdings (Ireland) Ltd an assurance that if any legislation is enacted in Bermuda that would impose tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, then the imposition of any such tax will not be applicable to Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, Ltd, Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd and Allied World Assurance Holdings (Ireland) Ltd or any of their operations, shares, debentures or other obligations until March 28, 2016. Given the limited duration of the Minister of Finances assurance, we cannot be certain that we will not be subject to any Bermuda tax after March 28, 2016. 48 Table of Contents The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Union are considering measures that might increase our taxes and reduce our net income. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the OECD) has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non-member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition. These measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world. In the OECDs report dated April 18, 2002 and updated as of June 2004 and November 2005 via a Global Forum, Bermuda was not listed as an uncooperative tax haven jurisdiction because it had previously committed to eliminate harmful tax practices and to embrace international tax standards for transparency, exchange of information and the elimination of any aspects of the regimes for financial and other services that attract business with no substantial domestic activity. We are not able to predict what changes will arise from the commitment or whether such changes will subject us to additional taxes. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None.
