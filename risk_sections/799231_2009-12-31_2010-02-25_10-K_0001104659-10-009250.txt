ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Described below and elsewhere in this report are risks, uncertainties and other factors that can adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition. Investing in our common stock involves a degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risks, as well as other information in this filing and the incorporated documents before investing in our common stock. Risks Related to Our Industry Health Care Reform Efforts Currently Underway in Congress The US Congress has been pursuing a comprehensive reform of the US health care system since early 2009. In late 2009, the US House of Representatives and the Senate passed separate measures either of which, if enacted, would reduce home health reimbursement rates. Due to recent political developments it is unclear if any attempts will be made to reconcile differences in the two bills, to pass either of the two bills or to start anew with new legislation, or whether comprehensive reform efforts will be abandoned entirely. On February 22, 2010, the President announced his own proposal which we believe mirrors the Senate plan as it relates to home healthcare. Should such legislation ultimately be passed by both houses of Congress it would then be submitted to the President for his signature before becoming law. In the event that comprehensive health care reform is not passed into law, the Congress and the President could still enact legislation that could impact the Companys reimbursement rates. There can be no assurance that comprehensive health care reform, or other legislation impacting the Companys reimbursement rates, in any form will or will not be passed into law. Accordingly, the Company is unable to predict what impact the ultimate Federal budget or the Congress consideration of comprehensive health care reform or reimbursement rates might have on our financial condition, our results of operations or the realizability of the carrying amount of our assets, in particular intangible assets including goodwill. We may be unable to take actions to mitigate any of whatever negative reimbursement changes might ultimately be enacted. The reimbursement changes ultimately enacted could have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial position. Further provisions of any ultimate health care reform may impact the health insurance benefits we currently offer or may be required to offer our employees which could also have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial position. At this point, we are unable to predict what actions Congress may take in passing health care reform or the changes to the Federal budget for 2010. The implications on the potential budget for 2011, which would actually be passed some time during 2010, are even less predictable. We can provide you with no assurance that the ultimate outcome of health care reform efforts and/or the Federal budget and resulting Medicare reimbursement rates will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, our results of operation, the realizability of the carrying amounts of our intangible assets including goodwill or our financial condition. Further, we are unable to predict what effect, if any, such material adverse effect, if it were to occur, might have on our ability to continue to comply with the financial covenants of our revolving credit facility and our ability to continue to access debt capital through that facility. The current crisis in world-wide economies and credit and financial markets may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition, as well as our ability to access credit and capital. As widely reported, global capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme disruptions and turmoil for over 12 months, including the bankruptcy, failure, collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States federal government. This has resulted in severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic stability. There can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions. While the 13 Table of Contents ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted, it may have a material adverse affect on the Company. The current crisis may cause budget deficits or other reductions in reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors which may result in decreased revenue growth and a decrease in our profitability. Our contractors and suppliers may also be negatively impacted by these conditions and our ability to provide patient care at a lower cost may diminish and reduce our profitability. The continuing disruption in the credit and capital markets may restrict our access to capital. As a result, our ability to incur additional indebtedness to fund operations and acquisitions may be constrained. If the economic conditions continue to deteriorate or do not improve, our results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Our profitability depends principally on the level of government-mandated payment rates. Reductions in rates, or rate increases that do not cover cost increases, may adversely affect our business. We generally receive fixed payments from Medicare for our services based on the level of care that we provide patients. Consequently, our profitability largely depends upon our ability to manage the cost of providing services. Although current Medicare legislation provides for an annual adjustment of the various payment rates based on the increase or decrease of the medical care expenditure category of the Consumer Price Index, these Medicare payment rate increases may be less than actual inflation or could be eliminated or reduced in any given year. Consequently, if our cost of providing services, which consists primarily of labor costs, is greater than the current Medicare payment rate, our profitability would be negatively impacted. If any of our agencies fail to comply with the conditions of participation in the Medicare program, that agency could be terminated from the Medicare program, which would adversely affect our net patient service revenue and profitability. Each of our home care agencies must comply with the extensive conditions of participation in the Medicare program. If any of our agencies fail to meet any of the Medicare conditions of participation, that agency may receive a notice of deficiency from the applicable state surveyor. If that agency then fails to institute a plan of correction to correct the deficiency within the correction period provided by the state surveyor, that agency could be terminated from the Medicare program. Any termination of one or more of our home care agencies from the Medicare program for failure to satisfy the programs conditions of participation could adversely affect our net service revenue and profitability. We are subject to extensive government regulation, audits and investigations. Any changes to the laws and regulations governing our business, or the interpretation and enforcement of those laws or regulations, could cause us to modify our operations and could negatively impact our operating results. The federal government and the states in which we operate regulate our industry extensively. The laws and regulations governing our operations, along with the terms of participation in various government programs, regulate how we do business, the services we offer, and our interactions with patients and the public. These laws and regulations, and their interpretations, are subject to frequent change. Changes in existing laws and regulations, or their interpretations, or the enactment of new laws or regulations could reduce our profitability by: · increasing our liability; · increasing our administrative and other costs; · increasing or decreasing mandated services; · forcing us to restructure our relationships with referral sources and providers; or · requiring us to implement additional or different programs and systems. In addition, we are subject to various routine and non-routine governmental reviews, audits, and investigations. For example, we are in the process of complying with a civil subpoena from the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General we received in December 2009. The subpoena seeks the production of various business records relating to our visiting nurse operations in Birmingham, Alabama, which we acquired in July 2006 and which generated approximately 2% of our consolidated revenues in 2009. Due to the limited information we currently have about the nature and status of this matter and the preliminary posture of the request, we cannot predict the timing or eventual outcome of this matter. 14 Table of Contents Violation of the laws governing our operations, or changes in interpretations of those laws, could result in the imposition of fines, civil or criminal penalties, the termination of our rights to participate in federal and state-sponsored programs, and the suspension or revocation of our licenses. If we become subject to material fines or if other sanctions or other corrective actions are imposed on us, we might suffer a substantial reduction in profitability. If we are unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establish new referral sources, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected. Our success depends significantly on referrals from physicians, hospitals and other patient referral sources in the communities that our home care agencies serve, as well as on our ability to maintain good relationships with these referral sources. Our referral sources are not contractually obligated to refer home care patients to us and may refer their patients to other providers. Our growth and profitability depend on our ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of the benefits of home care by our referral sources and their patients. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our existing referral source relationships or that we will be able to develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets. Our loss of, or failure to maintain, existing relationships or our failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect our ability to expand our operations and operate profitably. We are subject to federal and state laws that govern our financial relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers, including potential or current referral sources. We are required to comply with federal and state laws, generally referred to as anti-kickback laws, that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between healthcare providers that are designed to encourage the referral of patients to a particular provider for medical services. In addition to enacting anti-kickback laws, some of the states in which we operate have enacted laws prohibiting certain business relationships between physicians and other providers of healthcare services. We currently have contractual relationships with certain physicians who provide consulting services to our company. Many of these physicians are current or potential referral sources. Although we believe our physician consultant arrangements currently comply with state and federal anti-kickback laws and state laws regulating relationships between healthcare providers, we cannot assure you that courts or regulatory agencies will not interpret these laws in ways that will implicate our physician consultant arrangements. Violations of anti-kickback and similar laws could lead to fines or sanctions that may have a material adverse effect on our operations. We may be subject to substantial malpractice or other similar claims. The services we offer involve an inherent risk of professional liability and related substantial damage awards. On any given day, we have several hundred nurses and therapists and other direct care personnel driving to and from patients homes where they deliver medical and other care. Due to the nature of our business, we and the caregivers who provide services on our behalf may be the subject of medical malpractice claims. These caregivers could be considered our agents, and, as a result, we could be held liable for their medical negligence. We cannot predict the effect that any claims of this nature, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have on our business or reputation or on our ability to attract and retain patients and employees. We maintain malpractice liability insurance and are responsible for amounts in excess of the limits of our coverage. Delays in reimbursement may cause liquidity problems. Our business is characterized by delays in reimbursement from the time we provide services to the time we receive reimbursement or payment for these services. If we have information system problems or issues that arise with Medicare, we may encounter delays in our payment cycle. Such a timing delay may cause working capital shortages. Working capital management, including prompt and diligent billing and collection, is an important factor in our results of operations and liquidity. We cannot assure you that system problems, Medicare issues or industry trends will not extend our collection period, adversely impact our working capital, or that our working 15 Table of Contents capital management procedures will successfully negate this risk. There are often timing delays when attempting to collect funds from Medicaid programs. We cannot assure you that delays in receiving reimbursement or payments from these programs will not adversely impact our working capital. Our industry is highly competitive. Our home health care agencies compete with local and regional home health care companies, hospitals, nursing homes, and other businesses that provide home nursing services, some of which are large established companies that have significantly greater resources than we do. Our primary competition comes from local companies in each of our markets, and these privately-owned or hospital-owned health care providers vary by region and market. We compete based on the availability of personnel; the quality, expertise, and value of our services; and in select instances, on the price of our services. Increased competition in the future from existing competitors or new entrants may limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Some of our existing and potential new competitors may enjoy greater name recognition and greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. This may permit our competitors to devote greater resources than we can to the development and promotion of services. These competitors may undertake more far-reaching and effective marketing campaigns and may offer more attractive opportunities to existing and potential employees and services to referral sources. We expect our competitors to develop new strategic relationships with providers, referral sources, and payors, which could result in increased competition. The introduction of new and enhanced service offerings, in combination with industry consolidation and the development of strategic relationships by our competitors, could cause a decline in revenue or loss of market acceptance of our services or make our services less attractive. Additionally, we compete with a number of non-profit organizations that can finance acquisitions and capital expenditures on a tax-exempt basis or receive charitable contributions that are unavailable to us. We expect that industry forces will continue to have an impact on our business and that of our competitors. In recent years, the health care industry has undergone significant changes driven by efforts to reduce costs, and we expect these cost containment measures to continue in the future. Frequent regulatory changes in our industry, including reductions in reimbursement rates and changes in services covered, have increased competition among home health care providers. If we are unable to react competitively to new developments, our operating results may suffer. A shortage of qualified registered nursing staff, physical therapists, occupational therapists and other caregivers could adversely affect our ability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel and could increase operating costs. We rely significantly on our ability to attract and retain caregivers who possess the skills, experience, and licenses necessary to meet the requirements of our patients. We compete for personnel with other providers of home nursing services. Our ability to attract and retain caregivers depends on several factors, including our ability to provide these caregivers with attractive assignments and competitive benefits and salaries. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in any of these areas. In addition, there are occasional shortages of qualified healthcare personnel in some of the markets in which we operate. As a result, we may face higher costs of attracting caregivers and providing them with attractive benefit packages than we originally anticipated and, if that occurs, our profitability could decline. Finally, although this is currently not a significant factor in our existing markets, if we expand our operations into geographic areas where healthcare providers have historically unionized, we cannot assure you that the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements will not have a negative effect on our ability to timely and successfully recruit qualified personnel. Generally, if we are unable to attract and retain caregivers, the quality of our services may decline, and we could lose patients and referral sources. 16 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Business We depend on Medicare for the largest portion of our revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we received 77%, 74% and 68%, respectively, of our revenue from Medicare. Further, the acquisitions completed by us in 2009, 2008 and 2007 substantially increase our dependence on Medicare reimbursement. Reductions in Medicare reimbursement could have an adverse impact on our profitability. Such reductions in payments to us could be caused by: · administrative or legislative changes to the base episode rate; · the elimination or reduction of annual rate increases based on medical inflation; · the imposition by Medicare of co-payments or other mechanisms shifting responsibility for a portion of payment to beneficiaries; · adjustments to the relative components of the wage index; · changes to our case mix or therapy thresholds; or · other adverse changes to the way we are paid for delivering our services. Our non-Medicare revenues and profitability also are affected by the continuing efforts of third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care by lowering reimbursement rates, narrowing the scope of covered services, increasing case management review of services, and negotiating reduced contract pricing. Any changes in reimbursement levels from these third-party payor sources and any changes in applicable government regulations could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. We can provide no assurance that we will continue to maintain the current payor or revenue mix. Our reliance on government sponsored reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid makes us vulnerable to possible legislative and administrative regulations and budget cut-backs that could adversely affect the number of persons eligible for such programs, the amount of allowed reimbursements or other aspects of the programs, any of which could materially affect us. In addition, loss of certification or qualification under Medicare or Medicaid programs could materially affect our ability to effectively market our services. We have a significant dependence on state Medicaid reimbursement programs. For the year ended December 31, 2009, approximately 7.5%, 4.4% and 3.1% of our revenues were generated from Medicaid reimbursement programs in the states of Connecticut, Ohio and Kentucky, respectively. Approximately 17% of our 2009 revenues were derived from state Medicaid and other government programs, many of which currently face significant budget issues. The financial condition of the Medicaid programs in each of the states in which we operate is cyclical and many may be expected from time to time to take actions or evaluate taking actions to control the rate of growth of Medicaid expenditures. Among these actions are the following: · redefining eligibility standards for Medicaid coverage · redefining coverage criteria for home and community based care services · slowing payments to providers by increasing the minimum time in which payments are made · limiting reimbursement rate increases · increased utilization of self-directed care alternatives · shifting beneficiaries from traditional coverage to Medicaid managed care providers · changing regulations under which providers must operate States may be expected to address these issues because the number of Medicaid beneficiaries and their related expenditures are growing at a faster rate than the governments revenue. Medicaid is consuming a greater percentage of states budgets. This issue is exacerbated when revenues slow in a slowing economy. We believe that these financial issues are cyclical in nature rather than indicative of the long-term prospect for Medicaid funding of health care services. Additionally, we believe our services offer the lowest cost alternative to institutional care and are a part of the solution to the states Medicaid financing problems. It is possible, however, that the actions taken by the state Medicaid programs in the future could have a significant unfavorable impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 17 Table of Contents Migration of our Medicare beneficiary patients to Medicare managed care providers could negatively impact our operating results. Historically, we have generated a substantial portion of our revenue from the Medicare fee-for-service market. Under the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of December 2003 (MMA), however, the United States Congress allocated significant additional funds and other incentives to Medicare managed care providers in order to promote greater participation in those plans by Medicare beneficiaries. If these increased funding levels have the intended result, the size of the potential Medicare fee-for-service market could decline, thereby reducing the size of our potential patient population, which could cause our operating results to suffer. Our growth strategy depends on our ability to manage growing and changing operations. Our business plan calls for significant growth in our business over the next several years. This growth will place significant demands on our management systems, internal controls, and financial and professional resources. In addition, we will need to further develop our financial controls and reporting systems to accommodate future growth. This could require us to incur expenses for hiring additional qualified personnel, retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems, and expanding our information technology infrastructure. Our inability to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Our growth strategy depends on our ability to develop and to acquire additional agencies on favorable terms and to integrate and operate these agencies effectively. If we are unable to do so, our future growth and operating results could be negatively impacted. Development. We expect to continue to open agencies in our existing and new markets. Our new agency growth, however, will depend on several factors, including our ability to: · obtain locations for agencies in markets where need exists; · identify and hire a sufficient number of sales personnel and appropriately trained home care and other health care professionals; · obtain adequate financing to fund growth; and · operate successfully under applicable government regulations. Acquisitions. We are focusing significant time and resources on the acquisition of home healthcare providers, or of certain of their assets, in targeted markets. We may be unable to identify, negotiate, and complete suitable acquisition opportunities on reasonable terms. We may incur future liabilities related to acquisitions. Should any of the following problems, or others, occur as a result of our acquisition strategy, the impact could be material: · difficulties integrating personnel from acquired entities and other corporate cultures into our business; · difficulties integrating information systems; · the potential loss of key employees or referral sources of acquired companies or a reduction in patient referrals by hospitals from which we have acquired home health care agencies; · the assumption of liabilities and exposure to undisclosed liabilities of acquired companies; · the acquisition of an agency with undisclosed compliance problems; · the diversion of management attention from existing operations; · difficulties in recouping partial episode payments and other types of misdirected payments for services from the previous owners; or · an unsuccessful claim for indemnification rights from previous owners for acts or omissions arising prior to the date of acquisition. Effective January 1, 2010, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented a prohibition of the sale or transfer of the Medicare Provider Agreement for any Medicare-certified home health agency that has been in existence for less than 36 months or that has undergone a change of ownership in the last 36 months. This limitation may reduce the number of home health agencies that otherwise would have been available for acquisition and may limit our ability to successfully pursue our acquisition strategy. 18 Table of Contents We may require additional capital to pursue our acquisition strategy. At December 31, 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $19.4 million and additional borrowing capacity of approximately $69.1 million. Based on our current plan of operations, including acquisitions, we cannot assure you that this amount will be sufficient to support our current growth strategies. We cannot readily predict the timing, size, and success of our acquisition efforts and the associated capital commitments. If we do not have sufficient cash resources, our growth could be limited unless we obtain additional equity or debt financing. In December 2008, we filed a $150.0 million shelf registration statement with the availability for the issuance of any combination of common stock, preferred stock, warrants and debt securities. The registration statement became effective December 12, 2008, and on August 5, 2009, we entered into a Distribution Agreement to offer and sell from time to time up to 1,600,000 shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50 million through a distribution agent. In 2009, we issued 967,556 of our shares of common stock and as of December 31, 2009, a maximum of 632,444 shares remain available for sale subject to a maximum additional value limit of approximately $22 million. At some future point we may elect to issue additional equity or debt securities in conjunction with raising capital or completing an acquisition. We cannot assure you that such issuances will not be dilutive to existing shareholders. Our business depends on our information systems. Our inability to effectively integrate, manage, and keep secure our information systems could disrupt our operations. Our business depends on effective and secure information systems that assist us in, among other things, monitoring utilization and other cost factors, processing claims, reporting financial results, measuring outcomes and quality of care, managing regulatory compliance controls, and maintaining operational efficiencies. These systems include software developed in-house and systems provided by external contractors and other service providers. To the extent that these external contractors or other service providers become insolvent or fail to support the software or systems, our operations could be negatively affected. Our agencies also depend upon our information systems for accounting, billing, collections, risk management, quality assurance, payroll, and other information. If we experience a reduction in the performance, reliability, or availability of our information systems, our operations and ability to produce timely and accurate reports could be adversely affected. Our information systems and applications require continual maintenance, upgrading, and enhancement to meet our operational needs. Our acquisition activity requires transitions and integration of various information systems. We regularly upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities. If we experience difficulties with the transition and integration of information systems or are unable to implement, maintain, or expand our systems properly, we could suffer from, among other things, operational disruptions, regulatory problems, and increases in administrative expenses. Our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security systems and patient data stored in our information systems. Anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate our confidential information or cause interruptions in our services or operations. The Internet is a public network, and data is sent over this network from many sources. In the past, computer viruses or software programs that disable or impair computers have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the Internet. Computer viruses could be introduced into our systems, or those of our providers or regulators, which could disrupt our operations or make our systems inaccessible to our providers or regulators. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches. Our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches, and our business operations would be negatively impacted by cancellation of contracts and loss of patients if security breaches are not prevented. Further, our information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins and similar events. A failure to restore our information systems after the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because of the confidential health information we store and transmit, loss of electronically- 19 Table of Contents stored information for any reason could expose us to a risk of regulatory action, litigation, possible liability and loss. Our clinical software system has been developed in-house. Failure of, or problems with, our system could harm our business and operating results. We have developed and utilize a proprietary clinical software system to collect assessment data, log patient visits, generate medical orders, and monitor treatments and outcomes in accordance with established medical standards. The system integrates billing and collections functionality as well as accounting, human resource, payroll, and employee benefits programs provided by third parties. Problems with, or the failure of, our technology and systems could negatively impact data capture, billing, collections, and management and reporting capabilities. Any such problems or failures could adversely affect our operations and reputation, result in significant costs to us, and impair our ability to provide our services in the future. The costs incurred in correcting any errors or problems may be substantial and could adversely affect our profitability. We depend on outside software providers. We depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems in operating our business, some of which are provided by outside software providers. These information systems and applications require continual maintenance, upgrading, and enhancement to meet our operational needs. If our providers are unable to maintain or expand our information systems properly, we could suffer from operational disruptions and an increase in administrative expenses, among other things. Our insurance liability coverage may not be sufficient for our business needs. We bear significant insurance risk under our large-deductible workers compensation insurance program and our self-insured employee health program. Under our workers compensation insurance program, we bear risk up to $400,000 per incident. We purchase stop-loss insurance for our employee health plan that places a specific limit, generally $100,000, on our exposure for any individual covered life. However, we cannot assure you that claims will not be made in the future in excess of the limits of such insurance, if any, nor can we assure you that any such claims, if successful and in excess of such limits, will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business or on our assets. Our insurance coverage also includes fire, property damage, and general liability with varying limits. Although we maintain insurance consistent with industry practice, we cannot assure you that the insurance we maintain will satisfy claims made against us. In addition, as a result of operating in the home healthcare industry, our business entails an inherent risk of claims, losses and potential lawsuits alleging employee accidents that may occur in a patients home. Finally, we cannot assure you that insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at commercially reasonable rates, in adequate amounts or on satisfactory terms. Any claims made against us, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, could damage our reputation and business. We have established reserves for Medicare and Medicaid liabilities that may be payable by us in the future. These liabilities may be subject to audit or further review, and we may owe additional amounts beyond what we expect and have reserved. The Company is paid for its services primarily by Federal and state third-party reimbursement programs, commercial insurance companies, and patients. Revenues are recorded at established rates in the period during which the services are rendered. Appropriate allowances to give recognition to third party payment arrangements are recorded when the services are rendered. Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation. It is common for issues to arise related to: 1) medical coding, particularly with respect to Medicare, 2) patient eligibility, particularly related to Medicaid; and 3) other reasons unrelated to credit risk, all of which may result in adjustments to recorded revenue amounts. Management continuously evaluates the potential for revenue adjustments and when appropriate provides allowances for losses based upon the best available information. There is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates could change by material amounts in the near term. 20 Table of Contents We depend on the services of our executive officers and other key employees. Our success depends upon the continued employment of certain members of our senior management team, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, William B. Yarmuth, and our other named executive officers. We also depend upon the continued employment of the individuals that manage several of our key functional areas, including operations, business development, accounting, finance, human resources, marketing, information systems, contracting and compliance. The departure of any member of our senior management team may materially adversely affect our operations. Our operations could be affected by natural disasters. A substantial number of our agencies are located in Florida, increasing our exposure to hurricanes and other natural disasters. The occurrence of natural disasters in the markets in which we operate could not only affect the day-to-day operations of our agencies, but also could disrupt our relationships with patients, employees and referral sources located in the affected areas. In addition, any episode of care that is not completed due to the impact of a natural disaster will generally result in lower revenue for the episode. We cannot assure you that hurricanes or other natural disasters will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the future. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock The price of our common stock may be volatile and this may adversely affect our stockholders. The price at which our common stock trades may be volatile. The stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of securities, particularly securities of health care companies. The market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including: · our operating and financial performance; · variances in our quarterly financial results compared to expectations; · the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock; · future sales of common stock or the perception that sales could occur; · investor perception of our business and our prospects; · developments relating to litigation or governmental investigations; · changes or proposed changes in health care laws or regulations or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters; or · general economic and stock market conditions In addition, the stock market in general has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of health care provider companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, securities class-action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their respective securities. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type is often expensive to defend and may divert our management teams attention as well as resources from the operation of our business. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the availability of those shares for future sale, could adversely affect our stock price and limit our ability to raise capital. At December 31, 2009, 9,150,672 shares of our common stock were outstanding. In 2007, we established the 2007 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan for the benefit of employees and directors providing for the issuance of up to 500,000 shares of common stock. Moreover, as of December 31, 2009, 695,938 shares of our common stock remained reserved for issuance pursuant to our incentive compensation plans and 300,000 shares of our common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock to the public or the perception that substantial sales could occur. These sales also may make it more difficult for us to sell common stock in the future to raise capital. 21 Table of Contents We do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and you should not expect to receive dividends on shares of our common stock. We do not pay dividends and intend to retain all future earnings to finance the continued growth and development of our business. In addition, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, capital requirements, earnings, and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Our Board of Directors may use anti-takeover provisions or issue stock to discourage control contests. We have implemented anti-takeover provisions or provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including advance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals. These provisions, and others that the Board of Directors may adopt hereafter, may discourage offers to acquire us and may permit our Board of Directors to choose not to entertain offers to purchase us, even if such offers include a substantial premium to the market price of our stock. Therefore, our stockholders may be deprived of opportunities to profit from a sale of control. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.
