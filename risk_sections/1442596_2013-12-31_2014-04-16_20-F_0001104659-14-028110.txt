D Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Industry We have incurred net losses since our inception and may continue to incur losses in the future. We incurred net losses since our inception, including net losses in the amount of RMB172.1 million, RMB424.0 million and RMB580.7 million (US$95.9 million) in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively, primarily due to significant bandwidth and content costs, and capital expenditures required to ramp up our business and operations. Our net losses increased from 2012 to 2013 primarily due to the increases in our sales and marketing efforts, content costs, bandwidth costs. Our ability to achieve profitability is affected by various factors, many of which are beyond our control. For example, our revenues and profitability depend on the continuous development of the online advertising industry in China and brand advertisers allocation of more budgets to online video websites. We cannot assure you that online advertising, as a relatively new marketing channel, will become more widely accepted in China or that the advertisers will increase their spending on online video websites. The procurement of bandwidth and content has historically accounted for the majority of our cost of revenues. Although we expect our bandwidth and content costs as a percentage of net revenues to decrease over time, we expect our bandwidth and content costs to increase on an absolute basis as traffic to our websites grow, the resolution of our videos increases and as we acquire more content to enrich user experience. If we cannot successfully offset our increased bandwidth and content costs with an increase in net revenues, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Therefore, although we expect our net loss to decrease as a percentage of our total net revenues in the foreseeable future, we may continue to incur net losses in the future due to our continued investments in bandwidth, content and technology. We may also continue to incur net losses in the future due to changes in the macroeconomic and regulatory environment, competitive dynamics and our inability to respond to these changes in a timely and effective manner. We generate substantially all of our revenues from online advertising. If we fail to retain existing advertisers or attract new advertisers to advertise on our websites or if we are unable to collect accounts receivable from the advertisers or advertising agencies in a timely manner, our financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. We generate substantially all of our revenues from online advertising. We retain existing advertisers and attract new advertisers by maximizing return on their investment. On our Youku platform, 57% of our brand advertisers in 2012 remained as our advertisers in 2013. However, we cannot assure you that we will continue to maintain similar retention rates in the future, attract new advertisers continuously or be able to retain our advertisers at all. If our advertisers determine that their expenditures on online video websites do not generate expected returns, they may allocate a portion or all of their advertising budgets to traditional advertising channels such as television, newspapers and magazines or new Internet channels such as e-commerce or social media websites, and reduce or discontinue business with us. Since most of our advertisers are not bound by long-term contracts, they may amend or terminate advertising arrangements with us easily without incurring liabilities. Failure to retain existing advertisers or attract new advertisers to advertise on our websites may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Substantially all of our online advertising agreements are entered into with various third-party advertising agencies. In Chinas advertising industry, advertising agencies typically have good relationships and maintain longer periods of cooperation with the brand advertisers they represent as compared to media companies which provide advertising services on their properties. As a relatively young media company, we intend to strategically leverage advertising agencies relationships and network resources to increase our sales and expand our customer base. Therefore, we generally enter into advertising contracts with third-party advertising agencies, which represent advertisers, even if we have direct contact with such advertisers. As a result, we rely on third-party advertising agencies for sales to, and collection of payment from, our advertisers. In consideration for the third-party advertising agencies services, we pay them commissions based on the volume of business they bring to us. The financial soundness of our advertisers and advertising agencies may affect our collection of accounts receivable. We make a credit assessment of the advertiser and advertising agency to evaluate the collectibility of the advertising service fees before entering into an advertising contract. However, we cannot assure you that we are or will be able to accurately assess the creditworthiness of each advertiser or advertising agency, and any inability of advertisers or advertising agencies to pay us in a timely manner may adversely affect our liquidity and cash flows. In addition, there has been some consolidation in Chinas online advertising market. If this trend continues, a small number of large advertising agencies may be in a position to demand higher commission for advertising agency services, which could reduce our gross margin. 5 Table of Contents In addition, we do not have long-term cooperation agreements or exclusive arrangements with third-party advertising agencies and they may elect to direct business opportunities to other advertising service providers, including our competitors. If we fail to retain and enhance the business relationships with third-party advertising agencies, we may suffer from a loss of advertisers and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. The online video industry in China and user acceptance of our online video content may not grow as quickly as expected, which may adversely affect our revenues and business prospects. Our business and prospects depend on the continuing development of the online video industry in China. As an emerging industry, Chinas online video industry has experienced substantial growth in recent years both in terms of users and content. We cannot assure you, however, that the online video industry will continue to grow as rapidly as it has in the past. With the continued development of technology, new forms of media may emerge and render online video websites less attractive to users. Growth of the online video industry is affected by numerous factors, such as users general online video experience, technological innovations, development of Internet and Internet-based services, regulatory changes, especially regulations affecting copyrights, and the macroeconomic environment. If the online video industry in China does not grow as quickly as expected or if we fail to benefit from such growth by successfully implementing our business strategies, our user traffic may decrease and our business and prospects may be adversely affected. Youku Tudou is a relatively young company facing risks and uncertainties, and our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects. We launched our Youku.com website and online video services in December 2006 and have experienced rapid growth since then. As part of our strategic expansion plan, we completed the business combination in August 2012 with Tudou Holdings Limited, or Tudou, a leading Internet video company in China providing premium licensed content, user generated content and original in-house produced content, in a 100% stock-for-stock transaction. See also Item 4. Information on the CompanyC. Organizational Structure. We expect our expansion trend to continue as we grow our user and customer bases and explore new market opportunities. However, due to our limited operating history, especially our limited history since the business combination with Tudou, our historical growth rate may not be indicative of our future performance. We cannot assure you that we will grow at the same rate as we have in the past. You should consider our prospects in light of the risks and uncertainties fast-growing companies with limited operating histories may encounter. Our strategy to acquire or invest in complementary businesses and assets and establish strategic alliances involves significant risk and uncertainty that may prevent us from achieving our objectives and harm our financial condition and results of operations. As part of our plan to expand our product and service offerings, we from time to time consider opportunities for strategic acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses and assets and strategic alliances. On August 23, 2012, we completed the business combination with Tudou in a 100% stock-for-stock transaction. Upon completion of the business combination, Tudou has become a wholly owned subsidiary of Youku Inc. and we then changed our name to Youku Tudou Inc. See also Item 4. Information on the CompanyC. Organizational Structure. As of the date of this annual report, we operate both the Youku platform and the Tudou platform. Our future strategic acquisitions and investments could subject us to uncertainties and risks, including: · costs associated with, and difficulties in, integrating acquired businesses and managing a larger business; · potentially significant goodwill impairment charges; · high acquisition and financing costs; · potential ongoing financial obligations and unforeseen or hidden liabilities; · failure to achieve our intended objectives, benefits or revenue-enhancing opportunities; · potential claims or litigation regarding our boards exercise of its duty of care and other duties required under applicable law in connection with any of our significant acquisitions or investments approved by the board; and · diversion of our resources and management attention. 6 Table of Contents Our failure to address these uncertainties and risks may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we establish strategic alliances with various third parties, such as sub-licensing arrangements for content and revenue sharing agreements with e-commerce companies, to further our business purposes from time to time. Strategic alliances with third parties could subject us to a number of risks, including risks associated with sharing proprietary information, non-performance by the counter-party, and an increase in expenses incurred in establishing new strategic alliances, any of which may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. We may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of combined or acquired businesses and may not achieve the anticipated operating results in connection with these acquisitions or business combinations. Achieving the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or business combinations will depend in part upon our ability to integrate these businesses in an efficient and effective manner. The integration of companies that have previously operated independently may result in significant challenges in various respects, and we may be unable to accomplish the integration successfully. In particular, the efficient coordination of similar organizations with differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration. The integration of acquired businesses has involved, and may continue to require, the dedication of significant management resources, which may distract our managements attention from the day-to-day operations. In addition, the process of integrating operations may cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of our businesses and the loss of key personnel from us or the acquired or combined businesses. Further, employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration process may disrupt our businesses or the acquired businesses. Increases in market prices for professionally produced content may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A majority of our user traffic is attributable to professionally produced content. The market prices for professionally produced content, especially television serial dramas and movies, have increased significantly in China during the past few years. Due to the improving monetization perspective of online video advertising, online video websites are generating more revenues and are competing aggressively to license popular television serial dramas and movies, and the increasingly intense content bidding process has in turn led to increases in license fees of professionally produced content in general. In addition, as the market develops, the expectations of copyright owners, distributors and industry associations may continue to rise, and as such they may demand higher licensing fees for professionally produced content. Furthermore, with the expansion of our content library, we expect the costs for professionally produced content to continue to increase. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to outpace the increase in market prices for professionally produced content, we may incur more losses and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. We operate in a capital intensive industry and require a significant amount of cash to fund our operations and content, technology and bandwidth acquisitions. If we cannot obtain sufficient capital, our business, financial condition and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. The operation of an online video business requires significant capital expenditures as well as continuous, substantial investment in content, technology and infrastructure. We believe the cash we received from the initial public offering in 2010, the follow-on offering in 2011 and the anticipated cash flows from operations will provide us with sufficient capital to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future. However, in order to implement our development strategies to expand our infrastructure and optimize our services across Internet-enabled devices, and further expand and diversify our revenue sources, we may incur additional capital needs in the future. We may obtain additional financing, including further equity offerings or debt financing in capital markets, to fund the operation and expansion of our online video business. Our ability to obtain additional financing in the future, however, is subject to a number of uncertainties, including: 7 Table of Contents · our future business development, financial condition and results of operations; · general market conditions for financing activities by companies in our industry; and · macro-economic, political and other conditions in China and elsewhere. If we cannot obtain sufficient capital to meet our capital expenditure needs, we may not be able to execute our growth strategies and our business, financial condition and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. Videos and other content displayed on our websites may be found objectionable by PRC regulatory authorities and may subject us to penalties and other administrative actions. The PRC government has adopted regulations governing Internet access and the distribution of videos and other information over the Internet. Under these regulations, Internet content providers and Internet publishers are prohibited from posting or displaying over the Internet any content that, among other things, violates PRC laws and regulations, impairs the national dignity of China or the public interest, or is obscene, superstitious, fraudulent or defamatory. Furthermore, Internet content providers are also prohibited from displaying content that may be deemed by relevant government authorities as socially destabilizing or leaking state secrets of the PRC. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in the revocation of licenses to provide Internet content or other licenses, the closure of the concerned websites and reputational harm. The website operator may also be held liable for the content displayed on or linked to its website that is subject to censorship. In addition to professionally produced content, we allow our users to upload videos to our websites. Our users can upload all types of content, including user-created and professionally produced content, and can upload certain graphical files for limited purposes. Although we have adopted internal procedures to monitor the content displayed on our websites, due to the significant amount of content uploaded by our users, we may not be able to identify all the videos or other content that may violate relevant laws and regulations. See Item 4. Information on the CompanyB. Business OverviewContent Monitoring and Copyright Protection for more details relating to our content monitoring procedures. Failure to identify and prevent illegal or inappropriate content from being displayed on our websites may subject us to liability. In addition, these laws and regulations are subject to interpretation by the relevant authorities, and it may not be possible to determine in all cases the types of content that could cause us to be held liable as a website operator. For a detailed discussion, see Item 4. Information on the CompanyB. Business OverviewRegulationRegulations on Internet Content Services and Item 4. Information on the CompanyB. Business OverviewRegulationRegulations on Information Security. To the extent that PRC regulatory authorities find any content displayed on our websites objectionable, they may require us to limit or eliminate the dissemination of such content on our websites in the form of take-down orders or otherwise. In the past, we have from time to time received phone calls and written notices from the relevant PRC regulatory authorities requesting us to delete certain content that the government deemed inappropriate or sensitive. The General Administration of Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television, or the GAPPRFT, formerly known as the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, or SARFT, publishes from time to time lists of content that is objectionable, and our contract employees who work on content screening continuously monitor user-uploaded content and remove those mentioned on the list. In addition, regulatory authorities may impose penalties on us based on content displayed on or linked to our websites in cases of material violations, including a revocation of our operating licenses or a suspension or shutdown of our online operations. Although we have not been penalized for objectionable content in the past, in the event that the PRC regulatory authorities find the video content on our websites objectionable and impose penalties on us or take other administrative actions against us in the future, our business, results of operations and reputation may be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, the costs of compliance with these regulations may continue to increase as a result of more content uploaded by our increasing number of users. In addition, we operate our websites through 1Verge Information Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd., or 1Verge Information, Quan Toodou Network Science and Technology Co., Ltd., or Quan Toodou, and its wholly owned subsidiary, Quan Toodou Cultural Communication Co., Ltd., or Toodou Cultural, as well as our consolidated affiliated entities, and our ability to comply with laws and regulations described above depends in large part on the experience and skills of, and our control over, the management of 1Verge Information and Quan Toodou. We rely on contractual arrangements with 1Verge Information and Quan Toodou and their shareholders to exercise control over the management and operations of 1Verge Information and Quan Toodou. These contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing us with control over 1Verge Information and Quan Toodou. 1Verge Information, Quan Toodou and their shareholders may fail to take certain actions required for our business or follow our instructions to comply with the relevant PRC regulations despite their contractual obligations to do so. If we had direct ownership of 1Verge Information and Quan Toodou, we would be able to directly exercise our rights as a shareholder to effect changes in the board of directors of 1Verge Information and Quan Toodou, which in turn could effect changes at the management level, subject to any applicable fiduciary obligations. See Risks Related to Our Corporate StructureWe rely on contractual arrangements with our consolidated affiliated entities in China and their shareholders for our operations, which may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing operational control. 8 Table of Contents We have been, and may continue to be, subject to liabilities for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or other allegations based on the content available on our websites or services we provide. We have been involved in litigation based on allegations of infringement of third-party copyright and other rights, such as privacy and image rights, due to the content available on our websites. We were subject to a total of 340, 334 and 258 lawsuits in China for alleged copyright infringement in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively, in connection with our Youku platform. Approximately 97% of the lawsuits filed from 2011 through December 31, 2013 in connection with the Youku platform were rejected by relevant PRC courts, withdrawn by the plaintiffs or settled by the parties. Since our combination with Tudou, we assumed and were subject to a total of 48 and 274 lawsuits in China in 2012 and 2013, respectively, for alleged copyright infringement in connection with the Tudou platform. As of December 31, 2013, we accrued RMB6.5 million (US$1.1 million) in expenses and other liabilities based on judgments by court and out-of-court settlements. We have implemented internal procedures to review videos uploaded by our users and remove any infringing video promptly after we receive infringement notification from the legitimate rights owner claiming that their rights are infringed by a video on our website. See Item 4. Information on the CompanyB. Business OverviewContent Monitoring and Copyright Protection for more details relating to our content monitoring procedures. Due to the significant number of videos uploaded by users, we may not be able to identify all content that may infringe on third-party rights. Moreover, some rights owners may not send us a notice before bringing a lawsuit against us. Thus, our failure to identify unauthorized videos posted on our website has subjected us to, and may continue to subject us to, claims of infringement on third-party intellectual property rights or other rights. In addition, we may be subject to administrative actions brought by the National Copyright Administration of the PRC or its local branches for alleged copyright infringement. Although we have not been subject to claims or lawsuits outside China, we cannot assure you that we will not become subject to copyright laws in other jurisdictions, such as the United States, by virtue of our ADSs being listed on the NYSE, the ability of users to access our videos in the United States and other jurisdictions, the ownership of our ADSs by investors in the United States and other jurisdictions, the extraterritorial application of foreign law by foreign courts or otherwise. In addition, as a publicly listed company, we may be exposed to increased risk of litigation. If a claim of infringement brought against us in the United States or other jurisdictions is successful, we may be required to (i) pay substantial statutory or other damages and fines, (ii) remove relevant content from our websites or (iii) enter into royalty or license agreements which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We may also face litigation or administrative actions for defamation, negligence, or other purported injuries resulting from the content we provide or the nature of our services. Such litigation and administrative actions, with or without merits, may be expensive and time-consuming and may result in significant diversion of resources and management attention from our business operations. Furthermore, such litigation or administrative actions may adversely affect our brand image and reputation. In addition, we operate our websites through our consolidated affiliated entities, 1Verge Information, Quan Toodou and its wholly owned subsidiary, Toodou Cultural, and our ability to monitor content as described above depends in large part on the experience and skills of, and our control over, the management of 1Verge Information and Quan Toodou. Our control over the management and operations of 1Verge Information and Quan Toodou through contractual arrangements may not be as effective as that through direct ownership. See Risks Related to Our Corporate StructureWe rely on contractual arrangements with our consolidated affiliated entities in China and their shareholders for our operations, which may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing operational control. 9 Table of Contents We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, and any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our revenues and competitive position. We believe that trademarks, trade secrets, copyright, and other intellectual property we use are important to our business. We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret protection laws in China and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and our brand. Protection of intellectual property rights in China may not be as effective as in the United States or other jurisdictions, and as a result, we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our revenues and competitive position. In addition, any unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties may adversely affect our revenues and our reputation. Furthermore, policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology is difficult and expensive, and we may need to resort to litigation to enforce or defend intellectual property or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of others. Such litigation and an adverse determination in any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Advertisements shown on our websites may subject us to penalties and other administrative actions. Under PRC advertising laws and regulations, we are obligated to monitor the advertising content shown on our websites to ensure that such content is true, accurate and in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, where a special government review is required for specific types of advertisements prior to website posting, such as advertisements relating to pharmaceuticals, medical instruments, agrochemicals and veterinary pharmaceuticals, we are obligated to confirm that such review has been performed and approval has been obtained from competent governmental authority, which is generally the local branch of the State Administration of Industry and Commerce, or SAIC. To fulfill these monitoring functions, we include clauses in all of our advertising contracts requiring that all advertising content provided by advertisers must comply with relevant laws and regulations. Under PRC law, advertising agencies are liable for all damages to us caused by their breach of such representations. Violation of these laws and regulations may subject us to penalties, including fines, confiscation of our advertising income, orders to cease dissemination of the advertisements and orders to publish an announcement correcting the misleading information. In circumstances involving serious violations, such as posting a pharmaceutical product advertisement without approval, or posting an advertisement for fake pharmaceutical product, PRC governmental authorities may force us to terminate our advertising operation or revoke our licenses. A majority of the advertisements shown on our websites are provided to us by third-party advertising agencies on behalf of advertisers. While significant efforts have been made to ensure that the advertisements shown on our websites are in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that all the content contained in such advertisements is true and accurate as required by the advertising laws and regulations, especially given the uncertainty in the application of these laws and regulations. Although we have not been subject to penalties or administrative sanctions in the past for the advertisements shown on our websites, if we are found to be in violation of applicable PRC advertising laws and regulations in the future, we may be subject to penalties and our reputation may be harmed, which may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, we operate our websites through our consolidated affiliated entities, 1Verge Information, Quan Toodou and its wholly owned subsidiary, Toodou Cultural, and our ability to comply with laws and regulations described above depends in large part on the experience and skills of, and our control over, the management of 1Verge Information and Quan Toodou. Our control over the management and operations of 1Verge Information and Quan Toodou through contractual arrangements may not be as effective as that through direct ownership. See Risks Related to Our Corporate StructureWe rely on contractual arrangements with our consolidated affiliated entities in China and their shareholders for our operations, which may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing operational control. 10 Table of Contents Ineffective implementation of separation of our advertising sales and regulatory compliance functions may result in insufficient supervision over the content of advertisements shown on our websites and may subject us to penalties or administrative actions. We keep our advertising sales function separate from our team in charge of government compliance to address the potential conflicts between our compliance with relevant PRC advertising laws and regulations and advertising business, where we derive substantially all of our revenues. Before a sale is confirmed and the relevant advertisements are publicly posted on our websites, our account execution personnel, which is a separate back-office team that does not interface directly with advertisers, are required to review all advertising materials, including video commercials, flashes and pictures, to ensure there is no racial, violent, pornographic or any other improper content. They will request the advertiser to provide proof of governmental approval if the advertisement is subject to special governmental review and such process is designed to enhance our regulatory compliance efforts. However, in the event that the separation of advertising sales and regulatory compliance functions is not effectively implemented, the content of our advertisements may not be in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Although we have not been subject to any penalties for the three years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, and have not been subject to any administrative actions in the past for the advertisements shown on our websites, if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations in the future, we may be subject to penalties and our reputation may be harmed. This may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in government policies or regulations may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our online video business is subject to strict government regulations in the PRC. Under the current PRC regulatory scheme, a number of regulatory agencies, including the GAPPRFT, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or MIIT, and the State Council Information Office, or SCIO, jointly regulate all major aspects of the Internet industry, including the online video industry. Operators must obtain various government approvals and licenses, including an Internet content provider license, or ICP license, and an Internet audio/video program transmission license, prior to the commencement of online video operations. We have obtained the licenses and permits essential for our business operations. We have obtained the ICP license, the Internet audio/video program transmission license and a permit from the Beijing Drug Administration to post approved non-prescription drug advertisements on our websites. We are in the process of applying for the approval from the SCIO to publish news on our websites or disseminate news through the Internet. We currently operate a current events channel on our websites which includes audio/video content relating to current topics and social events. We have made oral inquiries with the SCIO, and were orally informed that such operations do not violate the regulations on Internet news publication. If the PRC government finds that we were operating without the proper licenses or approvals, promulgates new laws and regulations that require additional licenses or imposes additional restrictions on the operation of online video businesses and/or mobile and web-based subscription services that we plan to launch, the PRC government has the power to, among other things, levy fines, confiscate our income or the income of our affiliates, revoke our business licenses or the business licenses of our affiliates, and require us to discontinue or impose restrictions on the affected portion or our business. Any of these actions by the PRC government may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, the PRC government may promulgate regulations restricting the types and content of advertisements that may be transmitted online, which could have a direct adverse impact on our business. Any lack of requisite permits for any of our online video content may expose us to regulatory sanctions. In 2009, SARFT released a Notice on Strengthening the Administration of Online Audio/Video Content. This notice reiterated, among other things, that all movies and television shows released or published online must be in compliance with relevant regulations on the administration of radio, film and television. In other words, these movies and television shows, whether produced in the PRC or overseas, must be pre-approved by SARFT and distributors of these movies and television shows must obtain an applicable permit before releasing any movie or television show. 11 Table of Contents We rely on written representations from the content providers regarding the SARFT approval status of the content licensed to us. Under our content licensing agreements, the content providers generally represent and warrant that (i) the content they provide has legitimate copyright or authorization, and they are entitled to grant us the rights of communication through information networks; (ii) the content itself as well as the authorization or rights granted to us neither breach any applicable laws, regulations or public morals, nor impair any third party rights; and (iii) that they will indemnify us for any loss resulting from both the non-compliance of such content with the law and claims from third parties. However, we cannot guarantee that the remedies provided by these content providers, if any, will be sufficient to compensate us for potential regulatory sanctions imposed by the State Administration for Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television due to violations of the approval and permit requirements. Nor can we ensure that any such sanctions will not adversely affect either the general availability of video content on our websites or our reputation. In addition, such risks may persist due to ambiguities and uncertainties relating to the implementation and enforcement of this notice. If the online advertising industry does not further grow in China, our profitability and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. Both the Internet and broadband penetration rates in China are relatively low as compared to those in many developed countries. Many advertisers in China have limited experience with online advertising, have historically allocated an insignificant portion of their advertising budgets to online advertising and may consider online advertising a less attractive channel than traditional broadcast and print media in promoting their products and services. Our profitability and prospects depend on the continuing development of the online advertising industry in China and may be affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: · development of a larger user base with demographic characteristics attractive to advertisers; · our ability to keep up with technological innovation and improvements in the measurement of user traffic and online advertising; · acceptance of online advertising as an effective marketing channel; · changes in government regulations or policies affecting the online advertising industry; and · increased Internet usage in China. We operate in a highly competitive market and we may not be able to compete successfully against our competitors. We face significant competition, primarily from other online video websites in China, such as iQiyi.com, as well as from major Chinese Internet portals which provide online video products, such as SINA, Tencent and Sohu. We compete for both users and advertisers. Some of our competitors have a longer operating history and significantly greater financial resources than we do, and, in turn, may be able to attract and retain more users and advertisers. Our competitors may compete with us in a variety of ways, including by obtaining exclusive online distribution rights for popular content, conducting brand promotions and other marketing activities, and making acquisitions. Although in August 2012, we completed the business combination with Tudou, who used to be our competitor, we expect the competition with the other competitors to continue. In addition, certain online video websites may continue to derive their revenues from providing content that infringes third-party copyright and may not monitor their websites for any such infringing content. As a result, we may be placed at a disadvantage to some of these websites that do not incur similar costs as we do with respect to content acquisition and content monitoring. If any of our competitors achieves greater market acceptance than we do or are able to offer more attractive online video content, our user traffic may decrease and our market share may decrease, which may result in a loss of advertisers and have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also face competition from traditional advertising media such as television, newspapers, magazines, billboards, radio and other forms of out-of-home media. Most large companies in China allocate, and will likely continue to allocate, a significant portion of their advertising budgets to traditional advertising media, particularly television. If online advertising, as a new marketing channel, does not become more widely accepted in China, we may experience difficulties in competing with traditional advertising media. 12 Table of Contents The success of our business depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands. We believe that maintaining and enhancing our Youku优酷 brand and Tudou土豆 brand is of significant importance to the success of our business. Our well-recognized brands are critical to increasing our user base and, in turn, enhancing our attractiveness to advertisers. Since the online video market is highly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brands depends largely on our ability to remain the market leader in China, which may be difficult and expensive. As a company with a limited operating history, we have conducted, and may continue to conduct, various marketing and brand promotion activities, mainly through cooperation with our business partners. We cannot assure you, however, that these activities will be successful and achieve the brand promotion effects we expect. In addition, any negative publicity in relation to our services or products, regardless of its veracity, could harm our brand image and, in turn, result in a reduced number of users. If we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. If we fail to continue to anticipate user preferences and provide products and services to attract and retain users, we may not be able to generate sufficient user traffic to remain competitive. Our success depends on our ability to generate sufficient user traffic through provision of attractive products and services. To attract and retain users and compete against our competitors, we must continue to offer high-quality content that provides our users with a satisfactory online video experience. To this end, we must continue to source new professionally produced content, produce new in-house content or encourage more user-generated content, while balancing the value of each type of content to our advertising services. Other than the fees we pay for licensed content, we do not provide any additional compensation or benefits to professional content providers and their affiliates. In order to maintain good relationships with current licensors of professionally produced content to renew our current licenses and license new content from them, we need to continue to grow our platforms and content demand to strategically keep our status as an important customer of the major content licensors. Given that we operate in a rapidly evolving industry, we also need to continue to anticipate user preferences and industry changes and respond to such changes in a timely and effective manner. If we fail to cater to the needs and preferences of our users and, as a result, fail to deliver satisfactory user experience, we may suffer from reduced user traffic and our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. We operate in a rapidly evolving industry. If we fail to keep up with the technological developments and users changing requirements, our business, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. The online video industry is rapidly evolving and subject to continuous technological changes. Our success will depend on our ability to keep up with the changes in technology and user behavior resulting from the technological developments. For example, the development of broadband enabled the enjoyment of high definition videos online. In addition, the number of people accessing the Internet via devices other than personal computers, including mobile phones and other hand-held devices, has increased in recent years. If we fail to adapt our products and services to such changes in an effective and timely manner, we may suffer from decreased user traffic, which may result in a reduced number of advertisers using our online advertising services. Furthermore, changes in technologies may require substantial capital expenditures in product development as well as in modification of products, services or infrastructure. We may not execute our business strategies successfully due to a variety of reasons such as technical hurdles, misunderstanding or erroneous prediction of market demand or lack of necessary resources. Failure to keep up with technological development may result in our products and services being less attractive, which, in turn, may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects. Our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results of operations difficult to predict and may cause our quarterly results of operations to fall short of expectations. Our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate depending upon a number of factors, many of which are out of our control. For these reasons, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Our quarterly and annual revenues and costs and expenses as a percentage of our revenues in a given period may be significantly different from our historical or projected rates and our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. Factors that may affect our financial results include, among others: 13 Table of Contents · global economic conditions; · our ability to maintain and increase user traffic; · our ability to attract and retain advertisers; · changes in government policies or regulations, or their enforcement; and · geopolitical events or natural disasters such as war, threat of war, earthquake or epidemics. Our operating results tend to be seasonal. For instance, we may have slightly lower revenues during the first quarter of each year primarily due to the Chinese New Year holidays in that quarter. In addition, advertising spending in China has historically been cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions as well as the budgeting and buying patterns of customers. We may not be able to manage our expansion effectively. We have experienced rapid growth since we commenced our online video business in 2006. According to iResearch, the number of our monthly unique visitors from homes and offices was approximately 50 million in December 2007. In December 2013, our monthly unique visitors from home and office PC users amounted to approximately 245 million and 174 million for Youku platform and Tudou platform, respectively. The daily mobile views of both Youku and Tudou platforms combined reached 281 million in 2013. In addition, the number of our employees grew rapidly from 100 as of December 31, 2007 to 2,056 as of December 31, 2013 on both platforms (exclusive of our approximately 649 contract employees who work on content files screening, copyright checking, source file acquisition and editing). To manage the further expansion of our business and the growth of our operations and personnel, we need to continuously expand and enhance our infrastructure and technology, and improve our operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. We also need to expand, train and manage our growing employee base. In addition, our management will be required to maintain and expand our relationships with content providers, advertisers, advertising agencies and other third parties. We cannot assure you that our current infrastructure, systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support our expanding operations. If we fail to manage our expansion effectively, our business, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. Disruption or failure of our systems could impair our users online video experience and adversely affect our reputation. Our ability to provide users with a high-quality online video experience depends on the continuous and reliable operation of our systems. We cannot assure you that we will be able to procure sufficient bandwidth in a timely manner or on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to do so may significantly impair user experience on our websites and decrease the overall effectiveness of our websites to both users and advertisers. Disruptions, failures, unscheduled service interruptions or a decrease in connection speeds could hurt our reputation and cause our users and advertisers to switch to our competitors websites. Our systems and proprietary content delivery network, or CDN, are vulnerable to damage or interruption as a result of fires, floods, earthquakes, power losses, telecommunications failures, undetected errors in software, computer viruses, hacking and other attempts to harm our systems. We have experienced service interruptions for up to three hours in the past, which typically were caused by (i) overload of our servers; (ii) unexpected overflow of user traffic; and/or (iii) service malfunction of the telecommunications operators, such as power outage of Internet data centers or network transmission congestion. We may continue to experience similar interruptions in the future despite our continuous efforts to improve our systems. Since we host our servers at third-party Internet data centers, any natural disaster or unexpected closure of Internet data centers operated by third-party providers may result in lengthy service interruptions. 14 Table of Contents If we experience frequent or persistent service disruptions, whether caused by failures of our own systems or those of third-party service providers, our users experience with us may be negatively affected, which in turn, may have a material and adverse effect on our reputation. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in minimizing the frequency or duration of service interruptions. We may be the subject of detrimental conduct by third parties, including complaints to regulatory agencies, negative blog postings, and the public dissemination of malicious assessments of our business, which could have a negative impact on our reputation and cause us to lose market share, advertisers, customers and revenues, and adversely affect the price of our ADSs. We have been, and in the future may be, the target of anti-competitive, harassing or other detrimental conduct by third parties. Such conduct may include complaints, anonymous or otherwise, to regulatory agencies regarding our operations, accounting, revenues, business relationships, business prospects and business ethics. Additionally, allegations, directly or indirectly against us, may be posted in internet chat-rooms or on blogs or any websites by anyone, whether or not related to us, on an anonymous basis. We may be subject to government or regulatory investigation as a result of such third-party conduct and may be required to expend significant time and incur substantial costs to address such third-party conduct, and there is no assurance that we will be able to conclusively refute each of the allegations within a reasonable period of time, or at all. Our reputation may also be negatively affected as a result of the public dissemination of anonymous allegations or malicious statements about our business, which in turn may cause us to lose market share, advertisers, customers and revenues, and adversely affect the price of our ADSs. Undetected programming errors could adversely affect our user experience and market acceptance of our video programs, which may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. The video programs, including advertising video programs, on our websites may contain programming errors that may only become apparent after their release. We receive user feedbacks in connection with programming errors affecting the user experience from time to time, and such errors may also come to our attention during our monitoring process. We generally have been able to resolve such programming errors in a timely manner. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to detect and resolve all these programming errors effectively. Undetected audio or video programming errors or defects may adversely affect user experience and cause our advertisers to reduce their use of our services, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our business is sensitive to global economic conditions. A severe or prolonged downturn in the global or Chinese economy could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition. The global financial markets experienced significant disruptions in 2008 and the United States, Europe and other economies went into recession. The recovery from the lows of 2008 and 2009 was uneven and is facing new challenges, including the escalation of the European sovereign debt crisis in 2011 and the slowdown of the Chinese economy starting in 2012. It is unclear how the European sovereign debt crisis or the Chinese economic slowdown will progress in 2014 and beyond. There is considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies that have been adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the worlds leading economies, including Chinas. There have also been concerns over unrest in the Middle East and Africa, which have resulted in volatility in oil and other markets, and over the possibility of a war involving Iran. There have also been concerns about the economic effect of the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis in Japan, typhoon in the Philippines, political unrest in Thailand and diplomatic tensions in the relationship between China and Japan. Economic conditions in China are sensitive to global economic conditions. Any prolonged slowdown in the global or Chinese economy may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and continued turbulence in the international markets may adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs. The continuing and collaborative efforts of our senior management and key employees are crucial to our success, and our business may be harmed if we lose their services. Our success depends on the continuous efforts and services of our senior management, especially the executive officers set out in Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and EmployeesA. Directors and Senior Management of this annual report. We have not experienced attrition of our senior management team since we were established. If, however, one or more of our executives or other key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue to provide services to us, we may not be able to find suitable replacements easily or at all. Competition for management and key personnel is intense and the pool of qualified candidates is limited. We may not be able to retain the services of our executives or key personnel, or attract and retain experienced executives or key personnel in the future. If any of our executive officers or key employees joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose advertisers, know-how and key professionals and staff members. Each of our executive officers and key employees has entered into an employment agreement with us, which contains non-compete provisions. However, if any dispute arises between us and our executives or key employees, these agreements may not be enforceable in China, where these executives and key employees reside, in light of uncertainties with Chinas legal system. See Risks Relating to Doing Business in ChinaUncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could adversely affect us. 15 Table of Contents Our operations depend on the performance of the Internet infrastructure and telecommunications networks in China. The successful operation of our business depends on the performance of the Internet infrastructure and telecommunications networks in China. Almost all access to the Internet is maintained through state-owned telecommunications operators under the administrative control and regulatory supervision of the MIIT. Moreover, we have entered into contracts with various subsidiaries of a limited number of telecommunications service providers at provincial level and rely on them to provide us with data communications capacity through local telecommunications lines and Internet data centers to host our servers. We have limited access to alternative networks or services in the event of disruptions, failures or other problems with Chinas Internet infrastructure or the telecommunications networks provided by telecommunications service providers. Our websites regularly serve a large number of users and advertisers. With the expansion of our business, we may be required to upgrade our technology and infrastructure to keep up with the increasing traffic on our websites. However, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by telecommunications service providers. If the prices we pay for telecommunications and Internet services rise significantly, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. If Internet access fees or other charges to Internet users increase, our user traffic may decline and our business may be harmed. Moreover, the agreements we have entered into with domestic telecommunications carriers to host our servers typically have terms of approximately one year and are renewable subject to early termination. If we are not able to renew such hosting services agreements with the telecommunications carriers when they expire and are not able to enter into agreements with alternative carriers at commercially reasonable terms or at all, the quality and stability of our services may be adversely affected. We have granted, and may continue to grant, share-based awards to our personnel, employees and advisors, which may result in increased share-based compensation expenses. We adopted a stock option scheme, or the 2006 Plan, on December 1, 2005, which was amended on March 26, 2007, June 20, 2008, December 16, 2009 and September 9, 2010. In November 2010, we adopted our 2010 Share Incentive Plan, or the 2010 Plan, which was amended and restated on September 25, 2012, that permits the grant of options to purchase our Class A ordinary shares, restricted shares and restricted share units. As of March 31, 2014, options to purchase a total of 86,228,874 Class A ordinary shares and restricted share units to acquire a total of 97,440,084 Class A ordinary shares were outstanding under the 2006 Plan and the 2010 Plan. See Item 6. Director, Senior Management and EmployeesB. Compensation of Directors and Executive OfficersShare Incentive Plan for detailed discussion. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, we recorded RMB47.5 million, RMB118.2 million and RMB188.4 million (US$31.1 million), respectively, in share-based compensation expenses. We believe the granting of share-based awards is of significant importance to our ability to attract and retain key personnel and employees, and we will continue to grant share-based awards in the future. As a result, our expenses associated with share-based compensation may increase, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 16 Table of Contents If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which may cause our investors to lose confidence in our company, and the market price of our ADSs may be adversely affected. We are subject to reporting obligations under the U.S. securities laws. Among other things, the Securities Exchange Commission, or the SEC, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, adopted rules requiring every public company, including us, to include a report from management on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting in its second annual report on Form 20-F. In addition, beginning at the same time, an independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We began to be subject to these requirements since the annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011. Our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2013. See Item 15. Controls and ProceduresManagements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report, which has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2013. However, if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our management and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting at a reasonable assurance level. This could in turn result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and negatively impact the trading price of our ADSs. Furthermore, we have incurred and anticipate that we will continue to incur considerable costs, management time and other resources in an effort to maintain compliance with Section 404 and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have limited business insurance coverage. Insurance companies in China currently do not offer as extensive an array of insurance products as insurance companies do in more developed economies. We do not have any business liability or disruption insurance to cover our operations. We have determined that the costs of insuring for these risks and the difficulties associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make it impractical for us to have such insurance. Any uninsured occurrence of business disruption may result in our incurring substantial costs and the diversion of resources, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure If the PRC government finds that the agreements that establish the structure for operating our businesses in China do not comply with PRC governmental restrictions on foreign investment in Internet business, or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations. Current PRC laws and regulations place certain restrictions on foreign ownership of companies that engage in Internet business, including the provision of online video and online advertising services. Specifically, foreign ownership in an Internet content provider or other value-added telecommunication service providers may not exceed 50%. We conduct our operations in China principally through contractual arrangements among our wholly owned PRC subsidiaries, 1Verge Internet Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd., or 1Verge Internet, and Reshuffle Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., or Reshuffle Technology, and our significant consolidated affiliated entities in the PRC, namely, 1Verge Information, Quan Toodou and its wholly owned subsidiary, Toodou Cultural, as well as Zhejiang Dongyang Tianshi Cultural Media Ltd., or Tianshi, and their respective shareholders. 1Verge Information, Quan Toodou and Toodou Cultural hold the licenses and permits necessary to conduct our online video, online advertising and related businesses in China. Our contractual arrangements with our consolidated affiliated entities and their respective shareholders enable us to exercise effective control over these entities and hence treat them as our consolidated affiliated entities and consolidate their results. For a detailed discussion of these contractual arrangements, see also Item 4. Information on the CompanyC. Organizational Structure. 17 Table of Contents We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to enforce these contracts. Although in the opinion of our PRC counsel, TransAsia Lawyers, we are in compliance with current PRC regulations, we cannot assure you that the PRC government would agree that these contractual arrangements comply with PRC licensing, registration or other regulatory requirements, with existing policies or with requirements or policies that may be adopted in the future. PRC laws and regulations governing the validity of these contractual arrangements are uncertain and the relevant government authorities have broad discretion in interpreting these laws and regulations. In or around September 2011, various media sources reported that the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, had prepared a report proposing pre-approval by a competent central government authority of offshore listings by China-based companies with variable interest entity structures, such as ours, that operate in industry sectors subject to foreign investment restrictions. However, it is unclear whether the CSRC officially issued or submitted such a report to a higher level government authority or what any such report provides, or whether any new PRC laws or regulations relating to variable interest entity structures will be adopted or, if adopted, what they would provide. If the PRC government determines that we do not comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could revoke our business and operating licenses, require us to discontinue or restrict our operations, restrict our right to collect revenues, block our websites, require us to restructure our operations, impose additional conditions or requirements with which we may not be able to comply, or take other regulatory or enforcement actions against us that could be harmful to our business. The imposition of any of these penalties would result in a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. We rely on contractual arrangements with our consolidated affiliated entities in China and their shareholders for our operations, which may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing operational control. Since PRC laws restrict foreign equity ownership in companies engaged in online video and advertising businesses in China, we rely on contractual arrangements with our consolidated affiliated entities and their respective shareholders to operate our business in China. These contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing us with control over the consolidated affiliated entities as direct ownership. From a legal perspective, if our consolidated affiliated entities, any of their subsidiaries or any of their respective shareholders fails to perform their respective obligations under the contractual arrangements, we may have to incur substantial costs and spend other resources to enforce such arrangements, and rely on legal remedies under PRC law, including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief and claiming damages, which could be time consuming and costly. If we had direct equity ownership of our consolidated affiliated entities, we would be able to exercise our rights as a shareholder to effect changes in the board of directors of these entities, which in turn could effect changes at the management level, subject to any applicable fiduciary obligations. However, under the current contractual arrangements, we rely on our consolidated affiliated entities and their respective shareholders performance of their contractual obligations to exercise effective control. A lawsuit initiated prior to our business combination with Tudou by the ex-wife of Mr. Gary Wei Wang, the then founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Tudou, seeking the division of 76% of the equity interest in Quan Toodou held by Mr. Wang based on marital asset distribution dispute, has been viewed as evidence of the ineffectiveness of Tudous control over Quan Toodou and its subsidiaries. The lawsuit was subsequently concluded through a settlement directed by the court in June 2011, and we believe that the equity interests of Quan Toodou will not be subject to any court enforcement measures. Our contractual arrangements generally have a term of ten years with an automatic extension of successive ten years, which is subject to the unilateral termination rights of our company and our wholly owned subsidiaries, namely, 1Verge Internet and/or Reshuffle Technology, as applicable. In general, neither our consolidated affiliated entities nor their respective shareholders may terminate the contracts prior to the expiration date. However, the shareholders of our consolidated affiliated entities may not act in the best interests of our company or may not perform their obligations under these contracts, including the obligation to renew these contracts when their initial ten-year term expires. Such risks exist throughout the period in which we intend to operate our business through the contractual arrangements with our consolidated affiliated entities. We may replace the shareholders of our consolidated affiliated entities at any time pursuant to our contractual arrangements with them and their shareholders. However, if any dispute relating to these contracts remains unresolved, we will have to enforce our rights under these contracts through the operations of PRC law and courts and therefore will be subject to uncertainties in the PRC legal system. See Any failure by our consolidated affiliated entities or their respective shareholders to perform their obligations under our contractual arrangements with them may have a material adverse effect on our business. In the event we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, we may not be able to have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of our consolidated affiliated entities and their subsidiaries, and our ability to conduct our business may be negatively affected, and we may not be able to consolidate the financial results of our consolidated affiliated entities and their subsidiaries into our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Therefore, these contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing us with control over these consolidated affiliated entities. 18 Table of Contents Any failure by our consolidated affiliated entities or their respective shareholders to perform their obligations under our contractual arrangements with them may have a material adverse effect on our business. Our consolidated affiliated entities and their respective shareholders may fail to take certain actions required for our business or follow our instructions despite their contractual obligations to do so. If they fail to perform their obligations under their respective agreements with us, we may have to rely on legal remedies under PRC law, including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief, which may not be effective. Under the equity pledge agreements among 1Verge Internet and the respective shareholders of 1Verge Information and Tianshi, these shareholders pledged all of their equity interests in 1Verge Information and Tianshi to 1Verge Internet. Under the pledge agreement among Reshuffle Technology and the shareholders of Quan Toodou, the shareholdres of Quan Toodou pledged all of their equity interests in Quan Toodou to Reshuffle Technology. Our PRC counsel, TransAsia Lawyers, has advised us that the pledges in respect to 1Verge Information, Tianshi and Quan Toodou were duly created and effective given that such pledges have already been duly registered with the relevant local branch of the SAIC in accordance with the PRC Property Rights Law. As a result, if any of 1Verge Information, Tianshi and Quan Toodou or any of their respective shareholders breaches its obligations under the contractual arrangements, we may be able to enforce the pledges. All of these contractual arrangements are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in the PRC. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with PRC law and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. The legal environment in the PRC is not as developed as in certain other jurisdictions, such as the United States. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements, which may make it difficult to exert effective control over our consolidated affiliated entities, and our ability to conduct our business may be adversely affected. See Risks Relating to Doing Business in ChinaUncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could adversely affect us. Contractual arrangements with our consolidated affiliated entities may result in adverse tax consequences to us. Under applicable PRC tax laws and regulations, arrangements and transactions among related parties may be subject to audit by the PRC tax authorities within ten years after the taxable year when the arrangements or transactions are conducted. We could face material and adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax authorities were to determine that the contractual arrangements among 1Verge Internet and/or Reshuffle Technology, our wholly owned subsidiaries in China, our consolidated affiliated entities in China and their respective shareholders were not entered into on an arms-length basis and therefore constituted unfavorable transfer pricing arrangements. Unfavorable transfer pricing arrangements could, among other things, result in an upward adjustment on taxation. In addition, the PRC tax authorities may impose interest on late payments on our consolidated affiliated entities for the adjusted but unpaid taxes. Our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if our consolidated affiliated entities tax liabilities increase significantly or if they are required to pay interest on late payments. The shareholders of our consolidated affiliated entities may have potential conflicts of interest with us, which may materially and adversely affect our business. Ms. Qiong Qin and Mr. Dele Liu are shareholders of our significant consolidated affiliated entities, namely, 1Verge Information and Quan Toodou. Mr. Zhou Yu formerly owned an 18% stake in Quan Toodou and transferred his entire stake to Ms. Qin in September 2013 upon his resignation from our company. Ms. Qin is the wife of our founder and chief executive officer, and she does not have any equity interest or management position at our company. Mr. Liu is our director and president. We provide no incentives to Ms. Qin or Mr. Liu for the purpose of encouraging them to act in our best interests in their capacity as the shareholders of our consolidated affiliated entities. We may replace Ms. Qin and Mr. Liu as the shareholders of our consolidated affiliated entities at any time pursuant to the equity option agreements. As a director and executive officer of our company, Mr. Liu has a duty of loyalty and care to us under Cayman Islands law. In addition, each of Ms. Qin and Mr. Liu, as a shareholder of 1Verge Information, has executed an irrevocable power of attorney to appoint a person to be designated by 1Verge Internet in writing who is approved by us as their attorney-in-fact to vote on her/his behalf and exercise the full voting rights as the shareholder of 1Verge Information. Each of Ms. Qin and Mr. Liu, as a shareholder of Quan Toodou, has executed a power of attorney to appoint a person to be designated by Reshuffle Technology in writing who is approved by us as their attorney-in-fact to vote on their behalf on all Quan Toodou matters requiring shareholder approval. In addition, 1Verge Internet and Reshuffle Technology each passed a shareholders resolution indicating that all activities related to the powers and rights assigned pursuant to the powers of attorney for 1Verge Information and Quan Toodou, respectively, shall be exercised at the direction and approval of the Company and the resolutions are effective for the same term as the powers of attorney. However, we cannot assure you that when conflicts arise, Ms. Qin and Mr. Liu will act in the best interests of our company or that conflicts will be resolved in our favor. If we cannot resolve any conflicts of interest or disputes between us and Ms. Qin and Mr. Liu, we would have to rely on legal proceedings, which may be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations. There is also substantial uncertainty as to the outcome of any such legal proceedings. Upon completion of an increase of registered capital of Tianshi in 2013, 1Verge Information became a shareholder of Tianshi that holds 70% of its equity interest, and Ms. Wen Lu and Ms. Qiong Hu jointly hold the remaining 30% the equity interest of Tianshi. Ms. Lu and Ms. Hu currently serve as our employees. Each of Ms. Lu, Ms. Hu and 1Verge Information has executed an irrevocable power of attorney to appoint a person to be designated by 1Verge Internet in writing who is approved by us as their attorney-in-fact to vote on their behalf and exercise the full voting rights as the shareholder of Tianshi. In addition, 1Verge Internet passed a shareholders resolution indicating that all activities related to the powers and rights assigned pursuant to the powers of attorney for Tianshi shall be exercised at the direction and approval of the Company and the resolutions are effective for the same term as the powers of attorney. We cannot assure you that if conflicts arise, Ms. Wen Lu and Ms. Qiong Hu will act in the best interests of our company or that conflicts will be resolved in our favor. If we cannot resolve any conflicts of interest or disputes between us and Ms. Lu and Ms. Hu, we would have to rely on legal proceedings, which may be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations. The outcome of any such legal proceedings is uncertain. 19 Table of Contents We may need to rely principally on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC and Hong Kong subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC and Hong Kong subsidiaries to pay dividends to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. We are a holding company, and we may need to rely principally on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by two of our wholly owned PRC subsidiaries, 1Verge Internet and Reshuffle Technology, and our wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiary, Jet Brilliant, which is the direct holding company of Jet Brilliant Beijing, for our cash and financing requirements, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders and service any debt we may incur. If any of these wholly owned subsidiaries incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. In addition, the PRC tax authorities may require us to adjust our taxable income under the contractual arrangements that any of our wholly owned PRC subsidiaries currently has in place with our consolidated affiliated entities in a manner that would materially and adversely affect its ability to pay dividends and other distributions to us. Under PRC laws and regulations, 1Verge Internet, Reshuffle Technology and Jet Brilliant Beijing, as wholly foreign-owned enterprises in the PRC, may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, wholly foreign-owned enterprises such as 1Verge Internet, Reshuffle Technology and Jet Brilliant Beijing are required to set aside at least 10% of their accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain statutory reserve funds, until the aggregate amount of such a fund reaches 50% of their respective registered capital. At their discretion, they may allocate a portion of their after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to staff welfare and bonus funds. These reserve funds and staff welfare and bonus funds are not distributable as cash dividends. As of December 31, 2013, the registered capital of 1Verge Internet, Reshuffle Technology and Jet Brilliant Beijing were US$171.9 million, US$63.0 million and RMB1.0 million (US$0.2 million), respectively. 1Verge Internet has incurred losses of RMB441.4 million (US$72.9 million) from incorporation to December 31, 2013, Reshuffle Technology has incurred losses of RMB437.3 million (US$72.2 million) from incorporation to December 31, 2013, and Jet Brilliant Beijing has incurred losses of RMB0.7 million (US$0.1 million) from incorporation to December 31, 2013. As they have not made any profits to date, they have not been subject to the statutory reserve fund requirements and have not set aside any money to fund the statutory reserve funds or staff welfare and bonus funds. Our PRC subsidiaries have not and will not be able to pay dividends to our offshore entities until they generate accumulated profits and meet the requirements for statutory reserve funds. As of December 31, 2013, our PRC subsidiaries had accumulated deficits of RMB1,342.5 million (US$221.8 million) in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Substantially all of their revenues have been used to fund our business operations or expansion. 20 Table of Contents Any limitation on the ability of 1Verge Internet, Reshuffle Technology or Jet Brilliant Beijing to pay dividends or make other distributions to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business. See also Risks Related to Doing Business in ChinaOur global income and the dividends that we may receive from our PRC subsidiaries may be subject to PRC taxes under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. PRC regulation of loans to, and direct investment in, PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may limit our use of the proceeds from public offerings, our ability to finance our PRC subsidiaries or to fund our expansion or operations. In utilizing the proceeds we received from the follow-on public offering we completed in May 2011 and our initial public offering in December 2010 or in other financing activities in the future, as an offshore holding company with PRC subsidiaries, we may (i) make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, (ii) establish new PRC subsidiaries and make capital contributions to these new PRC subsidiaries, (iii) make loans to our PRC subsidiaries or consolidated affiliated entities, or (iv) acquire offshore entities with business operations in China in an offshore transaction. However, most of these uses are subject to PRC regulations and approvals. For example: · capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, whether existing ones or newly established ones, must be approved by the PRC Ministry of Commerce or its local counterparts; · loans by us to our PRC subsidiaries, each of which is a foreign-invested enterprise, to finance their activities cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, or its local branches; and · loans by us to our consolidated affiliated entities, which are domestic PRC entities, must be approved by the National Development and Reform Commission and must also be registered with SAFE or its local branches. In August, 2008, SAFE promulgated the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 142, regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested enterprise of foreign currency registered capital into Renminbi by restricting how the converted Renminbi may be used. On November 16, 2011, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Issues Relating to Further Clarification and Regulation of Certain Capital Account Items under Foreign Exchange Control, or Circular 45, in order to clarify the application of Circular 142. Under Circular 142 and Circular 45, the Renminbi capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable governmental authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC, unless it is provided for otherwise. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the Renminbi capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested company. The use of such Renminbi capital may not be altered without SAFE approval, and such Renminbi capital may not in any case be used to repay Renminbi loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used. Violations of SAFE Circular 142 or Circular 45 could result in severe monetary or other penalties. We expect that if we convert the foreign-denominated currency into Renminbi pursuant to SAFE Circular 142 and Circular 45, our use of Renminbi funds will be for purposes within the approved business scope of our PRC subsidiaries. Such business scope includes technical services, which we believe permits our PRC subsidiaries to purchase or lease servers and other equipment for their own technical data and research and to provide operational support to our consolidated affiliated entities. However, we may not be able to use such Renminbi funds to make equity investments in the PRC through our PRC subsidiaries. 21 Table of Contents We expect that the PRC regulations of loans and direct investment by offshore holding companies to PRC entities may continue to limit our use of the proceeds we received from the public offerings or from other financing sources. There are no costs associated with registering loans or capital contributions with relevant PRC governmental authorities, other than nominal processing charges. Under the relevant PRC laws and regulations, the PRC governmental authorities are required to process such approvals or registrations or deny our application within a prescribed time period, which is usually less than 90 days. The actual time taken, however, may be longer due to administrative delays. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to our future plans to use the U.S. dollar proceeds we receive from public offerings for our expansion and operations in China. If we fail to receive such registrations or approvals, our ability to use the proceeds of our public offerings and to capitalize our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and ability to fund and expand our business. We may be unable to collect long-term loans extended to the shareholders of our consolidated affiliated entities. As of December 31, 2013, we have made long-term interest-free loans in an aggregate principal amount of RMB94.1 million (US$15.5 million) to the shareholders of certain of our consolidated affiliated entities to enable them to fund the initial capitalization and the subsequent financial requirements of our consolidated affiliated entities. The initial term for such loans is ten or five years and will be automatically extended for successive ten- or five-year periods (as applicable) unless we give a three-month written notice prior to the expiration of the then current term. We may in the future make additional loans to the shareholders of our consolidated affiliated entities in China in connection with any increase in the capitalization or financial requirements of these entities to the extent necessary and permissible under applicable PRC laws and regulations. Our ability to collect these long-term loans will depend on the profitability and results of operations of these consolidated affiliated entities, which is uncertain. Risks Related to Doing Business in China Changes in Chinas economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. Substantially all of our assets and operations are located in China. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be influenced to a significant degree by political, economic and social conditions in China generally and by continued economic growth in China as a whole. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the level of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although the Chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets, and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the government. In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. The Chinese government also exercises significant control over Chinas economic growth through allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy, and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. While the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over the past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. In addition, in the past the Chinese government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate increases, to control the pace of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China, which may adversely affect our business and operating results. Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could adversely affect us. We conduct our business primarily through our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities in China. Our operations in China are governed by PRC laws and regulations. Our PRC subsidiaries are foreign-invested enterprises and are subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China and, in particular, laws applicable to foreign-invested enterprises. The PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. 22 Table of Contents In 1979, the PRC government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing economic matters in general. The overall effect of legislation over the past three decades has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, China has not developed a fully integrated legal system, and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China. In particular, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties. Since PRC administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms, it may be difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy. These uncertainties may affect our judgment on the relevance of legal requirements and our ability to enforce our contractual or tort rights. In addition, the regulatory uncertainties may be exploited through unmerited or frivolous legal actions or threats in attempts to extract payments or benefits from us. Furthermore, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all and may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of any violation of any of these policies and rules until some time after the violation. In addition, any administrative and court proceedings in China may be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. We may be adversely affected by the complexity, uncertainties and changes in PRC regulation of Internet business and companies. The PRC government extensively regulates the Internet industry, including foreign ownership of, and the licensing and permit requirements pertaining to, companies in the Internet industry. These Internet-related laws and regulations are relatively new and evolving, and their interpretation and enforcement involve significant uncertainty. As a result, in certain circumstances it may be difficult to determine what actions or omissions may be deemed to be in violations of applicable laws and regulations. Issues, risks and uncertainties relating to PRC regulation of the Internet business include, but are not limited to, the following: · We only have contractual control over our websites. We do not own the website due to the restriction of foreign investment in businesses providing value-added telecommunication services in China, including Internet content provision services. This may significantly disrupt our business, subject us to sanctions, compromise enforceability of related contractual arrangements, or have other harmful effects on us. · There are uncertainties relating to the regulation of Internet businesses in China, including evolving licensing practices. This means that permits, licenses or operations at some of our companies may be subject to challenge, or we may fail to obtain permits or licenses that may be deemed necessary for our operations or we may not be able to obtain or renew certain permits or licenses. The major permits and licenses that could be involved include, without limitation, the Internet Audio/Video Program Transmission License (including ancillary licenses covering services of live broadcasting on general social and cultural activities, sports games or other similar activities, search functionality for services of online audio/video programs and services of distribution of audio/video programs to mobile phones) issued by the SARFT, the Internet Culture Operation Permit issued by the Ministry of Culture, the Value-Added Telecommunications Services Operation Permit issued by the MIIT, the Telecommunications and Information Services Operation Permit issued by the Beijing Communications Administration, the Internet News Information Services License issued by the SCIO, the Internet Medical Information Services License issued by the State Food and Drug Administration and the Internet Publication License issued by the GAPP. If we fail to maintain any of these required licenses or approvals, we may be subject to various penalties, including fines and discontinuation of, or restriction on, our operations. Any such disruption in our business operations may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. · The evolving PRC regulatory system for the Internet industry may lead to the establishment of new regulatory agencies. For example, in May 2011, the State Council announced the establishment of a new department, the State Internet Information Office (with the involvement of the SCIO, the MIIT and the Ministry of Public Security). The primary role of this new agency is to facilitate the policy-making and legislative development in this field to direct and coordinate with the relevant departments in connection with online content administration and to deal with cross-ministry regulatory matters in relation to the Internet industry. Further, new laws, regulations or policies may be promulgated or announced that will regulate Internet activities, including online video and online advertising businesses. If these new laws, regulations or policies are promulgated, additional licenses may be required for our operations. If our operations do not comply with these new regulations after they become effective, or if we fail to obtain any licenses required under these new laws and regulations, we could be subject to penalties. · In 2013, the GAPPRFT released a Supplemental Notice on Improving the Administration of Online Audio/Video Content Including Internet Dramas and Micro Films, which requires that (i) a permit for radio and television program production and operation must be obtained for all online content, such as Internet dramas and micro films, (ii) online audio/video service providers transmitting Internet dramas or micro films produced and uploaded by individual users will be deemed responsible as producers for such content, (iii) online audio/video service providers may only transmit content uploaded by individuals whose identity has been verified and such content shall comply with relevant content management rules and (iv) online audio/video content, including Internet dramas and micro films, must be filed with the relevant authorities before release. This supplementary notice is very new, and thus far no relevant implementation rules or interpretations have been issued. Therefore, it remains unclear what, if any, potential liabilities 1Verge Information and Toodou Cultural could face in respect of the online audio/video content available on our websites. 23 Table of Contents In July 2006, the MIIT, the predecessor of which is the Ministry of Information Industry, issued the Notice of the Ministry of Information Industry on Strengthening Administration of Foreign Investment in Value-added Telecommunications Services. This notice prohibits domestic telecommunications services providers from leasing, transferring or selling telecommunications business operating licenses to any foreign investor in any form, or providing any resources, sites or facilities to any foreign investor for their illegal operation of a telecommunications business in China. According to this notice, either the holder of a value-added telecommunications business operating license or its shareholders must directly own the domain names and trademarks used by such license holders in their provision of value-added telecommunications services. The notice also requires each license holder to have the necessary facilities, including servers, for its approved business operations and to maintain such facilities in the regions covered by its license. Currently, all contracts with telecommunications carriers and other service providers to host the servers used in our business were entered into by 1Verge Information, our PRC consolidated affiliated entity, and such arrangements are in compliance with the notice. 1Verge Information also owns the related domain names and holds the value-added telecommunications business operating license and the ICP license necessary to conduct our operations in China, while the related trademarks are owned by 1Verge Internet, our wholly owned subsidiary. There remain significant uncertainties with respect to the procedural requirements involved in effecting the transfer of trademarks from 1Verge Internet to 1Verge Information. It is also unclear as to which, if not all, of the trademarks that 1Verge Internet owns will be subject to the transfer requirement under this notice. To our knowledge, in practice, the notice has not been enforced in respect of trademarks. We have not been required by the MIIT or its local branch to transfer the relevant trademarks held by 1Verge Internet to 1Verge Information. If the relevant government authority strictly enforces the notice, we will be required to transfer the related trademarks to 1Verge Information, which may be time consuming. If we fail to do so, the relevant governmental authority has the discretion to revoke the value-added telecommunications license held by 1Verge Information or impose other penalties, including fines. The interpretation and application of existing PRC laws, regulations and policies and possible new laws, regulations or policies relating to the Internet industry have created substantial uncertainties regarding the legality of existing and future foreign investments in, and the businesses and activities of, Internet businesses in China, including our business. We cannot assure you that we have obtained all the permits or licenses required for conducting our business in China or will be able to maintain our existing licenses or obtain any new licenses required under any new laws or regulations. There are also risks that we may be found to violate the existing or future laws and regulations given the uncertainty and complexity of Chinas regulation of Internet business. 24 Table of Contents A PRC tax pilot program may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. The PRC government adopted a PRC tax pilot program, which is initially being implemented in Shanghai and has been extended to other cities. On November 16, 2011, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation jointly issued the Circular on the Pilot Program for the Collection of Value Added Tax in Lieu of Business Tax, or Circular 110, and the Circular on the Pilot Program for the Collection of Value Added Tax in Lieu of Business Tax in the Transportation and Certain Modern Service Sectors in Shanghai, or Circular 111. These circulars became effective on January 1, 2012. Pursuant to Circular 110 and Circular 111, starting from January 1, 2012, companies classified by Shanghais local tax authorities as being engaged in certain services, including transportation services, research and development services, information technology services and advertising services, are required to pay value added tax, or VAT, at a rate ranging from 6% to 17% in lieu of business tax. The pilot VAT reform program initially applied only to the pilot industries in Shanghai and has been expanded to eight additional regions, including, among others, Beijing, in 2012. The pilot program will also be expanded nationwide when conditions permit. Advertising services provided by our Shanghai and Beijing entities have been subject to a 6% VAT in lieu of business tax since January 1, 2012 and September 1, 2012, respectively. This program may negatively impact our results of operations. On May 24, 2013, the Ministry of Finance, or MOF, and the State Administration of Taxation, or SAT, jointly issued Caishui [2013] No. 37, or Circular 37. From August 1, 2013, the VAT Pilot has been expanded to the transportation industry (expect for railway transport) and some modern service industries nationwide. On December 12, 2013, MOF and SAT jointly issued Caishui [2013] No. 106, or Circular 106, which sets out that railway transportation and postal services would be within the scope of the VAT pilot from January 1, 2014. Circular 106 also includes some updates and changes to VAT pilot rules. Circular 106 replaced Circular 37 from January 1, 2014. Fluctuations in exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment. The conversion of RMB into foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars, is based on rates set by the Peoples Bank of China. The PRC government allowed the RMB to appreciate by more than 20% against the U.S. dollar between July 2005 and July 2008. Between July 2008 and June 2010, this appreciation halted and the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar remained within a narrow band. Since June 2010, the PRC government has allowed the RMB to appreciate slowly against the U.S. dollar again, though there have been periods when the U.S. dollar has appreciated against the Renminbi as well. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar in the future. There remains significant international pressure on the Chinese government to adopt a substantial liberalization of its currency policy, which could result in further appreciation in the value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. To the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into Renminbi for capital expenditures and working capital and other business purposes, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount we would receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our ordinary shares or ADSs, strategic acquisitions or investments or other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us. Governmental control of currency conversion may limit our ability to utilize our revenues effectively and affect the value of your investment. The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. We receive substantially all of our revenues in Renminbi. Under our current corporate structure, our Cayman Islands holding company primarily relies on dividend payments from our wholly owned PRC subsidiaries, 1Verge Internet and Reshuffle Technology, and our wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiary, Jet Brilliant, which is the direct holding company of Jet Brilliant Beijing, to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior SAFE approval by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where the Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. Specifically, under the existing exchange restrictions, without prior approval of SAFE, cash generated from the operations of our subsidiaries in China may be used to pay dividends by our PRC subsidiaries to our company either directly or through Jet Brilliant and pay employees of our PRC subsidiaries who are located outside China in a currency other than the Renminbi. With prior approval from SAFE, cash generated from the operations of our PRC subsidiaries and affiliated entities may be used to pay off debt in a currency other than the Renminbi owed by our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities to entities outside China, and make other capital expenditures outside China in a currency other than the Renminbi. If either or both of our consolidated affiliated entities liquidate, the proceeds from the liquidation of their assets may be used outside of the PRC or be given to investors who are not PRC nationals. The PRC government may at its discretion restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions in the future. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders, including holders of our ADSs. 25 Table of Contents Certain PRC regulations may make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions. The Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, which became effective in September 2006 and was amended in June 2009, established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex. Such regulation requires, among other things, that the Ministry of Commerce be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise or a foreign company with substantial PRC operations, if certain thresholds under the Provisions on Thresholds for Prior Notification of Concentrations of Undertakings, issued by the State Council in August 2008, were triggered. We believe that neither the acquisition of Trade Lead Investments Ltd., or Trade Lead, nor the business combination with Tudou met the explicit thresholds under the Provisions on Thresholds for Prior Notification of Concentrations of Undertakings. However, even for transactions that do not meet the explicit thresholds, MOFCOM has discretion to initiate an investigation, if it believes it has collected evidence showing that the business concentration caused by such combination results in, or is likely to result in, an elimination or restriction of competition. As a result, we cannot preclude the possibility that MOFCOM may conduct investigation on the two transactions, impose restrictive conditions or even unwind the transactions. According to the Implementing Rules Concerning Security Review on the Mergers and Acquisitions by Foreign Investors of Domestic Enterprises issued by the Ministry of Commerce in August 2011, mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors involved in an industry related to national security are subject to strict review by the Ministry of Commerce. These rules also prohibit any transactions attempting to bypass such security review, including by controlling entities through contractual arrangements. We believe that our business and the business we acquired or combined are not in an industry related to national security. However, we cannot preclude the possibility that the Ministry of Commerce or other government agencies may publish interpretations contrary to our understanding or broaden the scope of such security review in the future. We may grow our business in part by directly acquiring complementary businesses in China. Complying with the requirements of these regulations to complete such transactions could be time-consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining approval from the Ministry of Commerce, may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions, which could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share. PRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose vehicles, or SPVs, by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident beneficial owners or our PRC subsidiaries to liability or penalties, limit our ability to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries, limit our PRC subsidiaries ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits to us, or may otherwise adversely affect us. SAFE has promulgated several regulations, including the Notice on Issues Relating to the Administration of Foreign Exchange in Fund-Raising and Round-trip Investment Activities of Domestic Residents Conducted via Offshore Special Purpose Companies, or SAFE Circular No. 75, effective on November 1, 2005. To further clarify and simplify the implementation of the SAFE Circular No. 75, the SAFE issued the Implementing Rules Relating to the Administration of Foreign Exchange in Fund-Raising and Round-trip Investment Activities of the Domestic Residents Conducted via Offshore Special Purpose Companies, or SAFE Circular No. 19 on May 20, 2011, which has come into effect on July 1, 2011. These regulations require PRC residents and PRC corporate entities to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct or indirect offshore investment activities. These regulations apply to our shareholders who are PRC residents and may apply to any offshore acquisitions that we make in the future. 26 Table of Contents Under these foreign exchange regulations, PRC residents who make, or have previously made prior to the implementation of these foreign exchange regulations, direct or indirect investments in SPVs will be required to register those investments. In addition, any PRC resident who is a direct or indirect shareholder of an SPV is required to update the previously filed registration with the local branch of SAFE, with respect to that SPV, to reflect any material change. Moreover, the PRC subsidiaries of that SPV are required to urge the PRC resident shareholders to update their registration with the local branch of SAFE. If any PRC shareholder fails to make the required registration or update the previously filed registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that SPV may be prohibited from distributing their profits and the proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to their SPV, and the SPV may also be prohibited from injecting additional capital into its PRC subsidiaries. Moreover, failure to comply with the various foreign exchange registration requirements described above could result in liabilities for such PRC subsidiaries under PRC laws for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions, including (i) the requirement by SAFE to return the foreign exchange remitted overseas within a period specified by SAFE, with a fine of up to 30% of the total amount of foreign exchange remitted overseas and deemed to have been evasive and (ii) in circumstances involving serious violations, a fine of no less than 30% of and up to the total amount of remitted foreign exchange deemed evasive. Furthermore, the persons-in-charge and other persons at such PRC subsidiaries who are held directly liable for the violations may be subject to administrative sanctions. The shareholders of our consolidated affiliated entities, Ms. Qiong Qin, Mr. Dele Liu, Ms. Wen Lu and Ms. Qiong Hu, all of whom are PRC citizens, have not conducted any direct or indirect offshore investment activities or held any shares, directly or indirectly in any of our offshore entities other than those due to exercise of their share options. Therefore, these PRC resident shareholders are not required to file the registrations and amendments pursuant to SAFE Circular No. 75 and related rules. Mr. Victor Koo, our founder and chief executive officer, who is a permanent resident of Hong Kong, stays in mainland China for over 183 days per annum. However, as a result of our inquiries with the competent local branch of SAFE responsible for our PRC subsidiaries foreign exchange registrations, we were informed that, given the lack of any publicly-available implementing rules or official interpretations issued by the SAFE regarding the issue of whether the registration and amendment filing requirements under SAFE Circular No. 75 and related rules should apply to non-PRC citizens, Mr. Koo should not be deemed a PRC resident for these purposes, and any attempt to submit an application to such local SAFE branch with respect to Mr. Koos investment and shareholdings in our offshore SPV will not be officially accepted or examined. In addition, Ms. Qiong Qin should not be required to make an application with respect to Mr. Koos offshore SPV activities merely by virtue of being Mr. Koos wife. However, we cannot conclude that the SAFE or the local branch responsible for our PRC subsidiaries foreign exchange registrations will not later change its position on, and interpretation of, the applicability of these foreign exchange regulations to Mr. Koo or the PRC resident shareholders of our consolidated affiliated entities. In the event the registration procedures set forth in these foreign exchange regulations become applicable to Mr. Koo or the PRC resident shareholders of our consolidated affiliated entities, we will urge these individuals to file necessary registrations and amendments as required under SAFE Circular No. 75 and related rules. However, as SAFE regulations and policies have been evolving rapidly in the past few years, we cannot assure that all of these individuals can successfully make or update any applicable registration or obtain the necessary approval required by these foreign exchange regulations as these individuals may not be able to fully satisfy the new requirements or interpretations that SAFE or its local branch may impose or adopt from time to time. The failure or inability of such individuals to comply with the registration procedures set forth in these regulations may subject us to fines or legal sanctions, restrictions on our cross-border investment activities or our PRC subsidiaries ability to distribute dividends to, or obtain foreign-exchange-dominated loans from, our company, or prevent us from making distributions or paying dividends. As a result, our business operations and our ability to make distributions to you could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, as these foreign exchange regulations are still relatively new and there is uncertainty concerning the reconciliation of the new regulations with the approval requirements under other existing PRC laws and regulations, such as tax laws, it is unclear how these regulations, and any future regulation concerning offshore or cross-border transactions, will be interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant government authorities. We cannot predict how these regulations will affect our business operations or future strategy. For example, we may be subject to a more stringent review and approval process with respect to our foreign exchange activities, such as remittance of dividends and foreign-currency-denominated borrowings, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we decide to acquire a PRC domestic company, we cannot assure you that we or the owners of such company, as the case may be, will be able to obtain the necessary approvals or complete the necessary filings and registrations required by the foreign exchange regulations. This may restrict our ability to implement our acquisition strategy and could adversely affect our business and prospects. 27 Table of Contents Failure to comply with PRC regulations regarding the registration requirements for employee stock ownership plans or share option plans may subject the PRC plan participants or us to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions. In December 2006, the Peoples Bank of China promulgated the Administrative Measures of Foreign Exchange Matters for Individuals, which set forth the respective requirements for foreign exchange transactions by individuals (both PRC or non-PRC citizens) under either the current account or the capital account. In January 2007, SAFE issued implementing rules for the Administrative Measures of Foreign Exchange Matters for Individuals, which, among other things, specified approval requirements for certain capital account transactions such as a PRC citizens participation in the employee stock ownership plans or stock option plans of an overseas publicly-listed company. In March 2007, SAFE promulgated the Application Procedures of Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Employee Stock Ownership Plan or Stock Option Plan of Overseas-Listed Company, or the Stock Option Rules. In February 2012, SAFE promulgated the Notice on the Administration of Foreign Exchange Matters for Domestic Individuals Participating in the Stock Incentive Plans of Overseas Listed Companies, or the Stock Option Notice, and replaced the Stock Option Rules. The Stock Option Notice simplifies the requirements and procedures for the registration of stock incentive plan participants, especially in respect of the required application documents and the elimination of strict requirements on offshore and onshore custodian banks, as were stipulated in the Stock Option Rules. According to the Stock Option Notice, for PRC resident individuals who participate in stock incentive plans of overseas public companies, which includes employee stock ownership plans, stock option plans and other incentive plans permitted by relevant laws and regulations, a PRC domestic qualified agent or the PRC subsidiary of such overseas public company must, among other things, file, on behalf of such individuals, an application with the SAFE or its local counterpart to obtain an annual allowance with respect to the purchase of foreign exchange in connection with stock holding or share option exercises, as PRC domestic individuals may not directly use overseas funds to purchase shares or exercise share options. In addition, within three months after there is any substantial change to such stock incentive plans, including for example any changes due to merger or acquisition or changes of domestic or overseas custodian agent, the domestic agent must update the registration with SAFE. We and our PRC citizen employees who participate in an employee stock ownership plan or a stock option plan are subject to these regulations, since we are a publicly-listed company in the United States. We and our employees have made such applications and intend to continue making such application on an on-going basis and complete all the requisite procedures in accordance with the Stock Option Notice. If we or our PRC optionees fail to comply with these regulations, we or our PRC optionees may be subject to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions. See Item 4. Information on the CompanyB. Business OverviewRegulationRegulations on Employee Stock Options Plan. We face uncertainty with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises by their non-PRC holding companies. Pursuant to the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Enterprise Income Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or SAT Circular 698, issued by the State Administration of Taxation, or the SAT, in December 2009, with retroactive effect from January 1, 2008, where a non-resident enterprise transfers the equity interests of a PRC resident enterprise indirectly by disposition of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, or an Indirect Transfer, and such overseas holding company is located in a tax jurisdiction that: (i) has an effective tax rate of less than 12.5% or (ii) does not impose income tax on foreign income of its residents, the non-resident enterprise, being the transferor, shall report to the competent tax authority of the PRC resident enterprise this Indirect Transfer. Using a substance over form principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such Indirect Transfer may be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10%. SAT Circular 698 also provides that, where a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers its equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise to its related parties at a price lower than the fair market value, the relevant tax authority has the power to make a reasonable adjustment to the taxable income of the transaction. On March 28, 2011, the SAT released the SAT Public Notice (2011) No. 24, or SAT Public Notice 24, to clarify several issues related to SAT Circular 698. SAT Public Notice 24 became effective on April 1, 2011. According to SAT Public Notice 24, the term effective tax refers to the effective tax on the gain derived from disposition of the equity interests of an overseas holding company; and the term does not impose income tax refers to the cases where the gain derived from disposition of the equity interests of an overseas holding company is not subject to income tax in the country/region where the overseas holding company is a resident. 28 Table of Contents There is uncertainty as to the application of SAT Circular 698. For example, while the term Indirect Transfer is not clearly defined, it is understood that the relevant PRC tax authorities have jurisdiction regarding requests for information over a wide range of foreign entities having no direct contact with China. Moreover, the relevant authority has not yet promulgated any formal provisions or made any formal declaration as to the process and format for reporting an Indirect Transfer to the competent tax authority of the relevant PRC resident enterprise. In addition, there are not any formal declarations with regard to how to determine whether a foreign investor has adopted an abusive arrangement in order to reduce, avoid or defer PRC tax. SAT Circular 698 may be determined by the tax authorities to be applicable to our private equity financing transactions where non-resident investors were involved, if any of such transactions were determined by the tax authorities to lack reasonable commercial purpose. As a result, we and our non-resident investors may become at risk of being taxed under SAT Circular 698 and may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with SAT Circular 698 or to establish that we should not be taxed under SAT Circular 698, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or such non-resident investors investments in us. Discontinuation of any of the preferential tax treatments or imposition of any additional taxes could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. China passed a new PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the New EIT Law, and its implementation rules, both of which became effective on January 1, 2008. The New EIT Law significantly curtails tax incentives granted to foreign-invested enterprises under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law concerning Foreign-Invested Enterprises and Foreign Enterprises, or the Old EIT Law, which was effective prior to January 1, 2008. The New EIT Law, however, (i) reduces the statutory rate of the enterprise income tax from 33% to 25%, (ii) permits companies established before March 16, 2007 to continue to enjoy their existing tax incentives, adjusted by certain transitional phase-out rules promulgated by the State Council on December 26, 2007, and (iii) introduces new tax incentives, subject to various qualification criteria. The New EIT Law and its implementation rules permit certain high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the state which hold independent ownership of core intellectual property to enjoy a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 15%, subject to certain new qualification criteria. 1Verge Internet, our wholly owned subsidiary, and 1Verge Information, our consolidated affiliated entity, were recognized by the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission as high and new technology enterprises on December 24, 2010 and April 27, 2006, respectively, and therefore were eligible for the reduced 15% enterprise income tax rate upon its filing with the relevant tax authority. The qualification as a high and new technology enterprise is subject to annual evaluation and a three-year review by the relevant authorities in China. 1Verge Information was reaffirmed as such on December 14, 2009 and was entitled to the preferential tax rate of 15% for 2009, 2010 and 2011. However, 1Verge Information was not recognized as a high and new technology enterprise in the three-year review in 2012, and its applicable enterprise income tax rate increased to 25% starting in 2012. 1Verge Internet was recognized as a high and new technology enterprise in the three-year review in 2013, and its applicable enterprise income tax rate remained at 15% from 2013 to 2015. Preferential tax treatment granted to our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities by the local governmental authorities is subject to review and may be adjusted or revoked at any time. The discontinuation of any preferential tax treatments currently available to us and our wholly owned PRC subsidiary, 1Verge Internet, will cause our effective tax rate to increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current effective tax rate in the future. 29 Table of Contents Our global income and the dividends that we may receive from our PRC subsidiaries may be subject to PRC taxes under the New EIT Law, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and on the investments of our non-PRC shareholders and ADS holders. Under the New EIT Law and its implementation rules, both of which became effective on January 1, 2008, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with a de facto management body within the PRC is considered a resident enterprise and will be subject to the enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on its global income. The implementation rules define the term de facto management body as establishments that carry out substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel, accounting, properties, etc. of an enterprise. The SAT issued the Notice Regarding the Determination of Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax Resident Enterprises on the Basis of De Facto Management Bodies, or SAT Circular 82, on April 22, 2009. SAT Circular 82 provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the de facto management body of a Chinese-controlled offshore-incorporated enterprise is located in China. See Item 4. Information on the CompanyB. Business OverviewRegulationRegulations on TaxPRC Enterprise Income Tax. Although SAT Circular 82 only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises, not those controlled by PRC individuals, the determining criteria set forth in the SAT Circular 82 may reflect the SATs general position on how the de facto management body test may be applied in determining the tax resident status of offshore enterprises. According to the SAT Circular 82, a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having a de facto management body in China and will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax on its worldwide income only if all of the following conditions set forth in the SAT Circular 82 are met: (i) the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC; (ii) decisions relating to the enterprises financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC; (iii) the enterprises primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholder resolutions are located or maintained in the PRC; and (iv) at least 50% of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC. We do not believe that either Youku Tudou Inc. or its Hong Kong, Cayman or BVI subsidiaries, including Jet Brilliant, Tudou Holdings Limited and StarCloud Media Co., Limited, meet all of the conditions above. Each of Youku Tudou Inc. and these offshore subsidiaries is a company incorporated outside the PRC. These entities key assets and records, including the resolutions of their respective board of directors and the resolutions of their respective shareholders, are located and maintained outside the PRC. In addition, we are not aware of any offshore holding companies with similar corporate structures ever having been deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise by the PRC tax authorities. Therefore, we believe that neither Youku Tudou Inc. nor any of these offshore subsidiaries should be treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes if the criteria for a de facto management body as set forth in the SAT Circular 82 were deemed applicable to us. However, as the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term de facto management body as applicable to our offshore entities, we may be considered a resident enterprise and may therefore be subject to the enterprise income tax at 25% on our global income. If we are considered a resident enterprise and earn income other than dividends from our PRC subsidiary, a 25% enterprise income tax on our global income could significantly increase our tax burden and materially and adversely affect our cash flow and profitability. In addition to the uncertainty regarding how the new resident enterprise classification may apply, it is also possible that the rules may change in the future, possibly with retroactive effect. Pursuant to the New EIT Law and its implementation rules, however, dividends generated after January 1, 2008 and payable by a foreign-invested enterprise in China to its foreign investors, which are non-PRC tax resident enterprises without an establishment in China, or which has an establishment in China but the dividend income is not connected with the establishment, are subject to withholding tax at a rate of 10%, unless any such foreign investors jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that provides for a preferential withholding arrangement and the foreign investor is the beneficial owner. We are a Cayman Islands holding company and we plan to conduct our advertising business and derive substantially all of our income from dividends through Jet Brilliant Beijing, which is 100% owned by Jet Brilliant, our wholly owned subsidiary located in Hong Kong. As long as Jet Brilliant, our Hong Kong subsidiary, is considered a non-PRC resident enterprise and holds at least 25% of the equity interest of Jet Brilliant Beijing, dividends that it receives from Jet Brilliant Beijing may be subject to withholding tax at a preferential rate of 5% under the Arrangement between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion, effective on January 1, 2007, if it is the beneficial owner of the dividends, upon receiving approval from the local tax authority. However, if Jet Brilliant, our Hong Kong subsidiary, is not considered to be the beneficial owner of such dividends under applicable tax regulations, such dividends would be subject to withholding tax at a rate of 10%. See Item 4. Information on the CompanyB. Business OverviewRegulationRegulations on TaxDividends Withholding Tax. Our PRC subsidiaries have not paid any dividends, and do not currently plan to pay dividends in the future, as they continue to incur losses, to our company or Jet Brilliant, our Hong Kong subsidiary, as the case may be. We have not obtained the approval mentioned above from the local tax authority and do not currently plan to do so in the near future. 30 Table of Contents We have been advised by our PRC counsel, TransAsia Lawyers, that according to the interpretation and implementation of the New EIT Law and its implementation rules, if we are regarded as a PRC resident enterprise, any dividends to be distributed by us to our non-PRC shareholders and ADS holders would be subject to PRC withholding tax. If we are regarded as a PRC resident enterprise and if we were required under the New EIT Law to withhold PRC income tax on our dividends payable to our non-PRC enterprise shareholders and ADS holders, your investment in our ordinary shares or ADSs may be materially and adversely affected. The enforcement of the Labor Contract Law and other labor-related regulations in the PRC may adversely affect our business and our results of operations. In June 2007, the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress of China enacted the Labor Contract Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008. The Labor Contract Law introduces specific provisions related to fixed-term employment contracts, part-time employment, probation, consultation with labor union and employee assemblies, employment without a written contract, dismissal of employees, severance, and collective bargaining, which together represent enhanced enforcement of labor laws and regulations. According to the Labor Contract Law, an employer is obliged to sign an unlimited-term labor contract with any employee who has worked for the employer for ten consecutive years. Further, if an employee requests or agrees to renew a fixed-term labor contract that has already been entered into twice consecutively, the resulting contract must have an unlimited term, with certain exceptions. The employer must also pay severance to an employee in nearly all instances where a labor contract, including a contract with an unlimited term, is terminated or expires. In addition, the government has continued to introduce various new labor-related regulations after the Labor Contract Law. Among other things, new annual leave requirements mandate that annual leave ranging from five to 15 days is available to nearly all employees and further require that the employer compensate an employee for any annual leave days the employee is unable to take in the amount of three times his daily salary, subject to certain exceptions. As a result of these new regulations designed to enhance labor protection, our labor costs are expected to increase. In addition, as the interpretation and implementation of these new regulations are still evolving, we cannot assure you that our employment practice will at all times be deemed in full compliance with the new regulations. If we are subject to severe penalties or incur significant liabilities in connection with labor disputes or investigations, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. Proceedings instituted recently by the SEC against five PRC-based accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm, could result in our financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act. In December 2012, the SEC brought administrative proceedings against five accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm, in China, alleging that they had refused to produce audit work papers and other documents related to certain other China-based companies under investigation by the SEC for potential accounting fraud. On January 22, 2014, an initial administrative law decision was issued, censuring these accounting firms and suspending four of the five firms from practicing before the SEC for a period of six months. The decision is neither final nor legally effective unless and until reviewed and approved by the SEC. The accounting firms appealed the initial administrative law decision to the SEC in February 2014. The sanction will not become effective until after a full appeal process is concluded and a final decision is issued by the SEC. The accounting firms can also further appeal the final decision of the SEC through the federal appellate courts. We are not involved in the proceedings brought by the SEC against the accounting firms. However, our independent registered public accounting firm is one of the four accounting firms subject to the six month suspension from practicing before the SEC in the initial administrative law decision. We may therefore be adversely affected by the outcome of the proceedings, along with other U.S.-listed companies audited by these accounting firms. 31 Table of Contents On May 24, 2013, the PCAOB announced that it had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding on Enforcement Cooperation with the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, and the Ministry of Finance which establishes a cooperative framework between the parties for the production and exchange of audit documents relevant to investigations in the United States and China. However, it is not clear how these recent developments could affect the SECs final decision in the case against the five accounting firms or any subsequent appeal to courts that the accounting firms may initiate. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the final outcome of the administrative proceedings and the potential consequences thereof. If our independent registered public accounting firm were denied, temporarily, the ability to practice before the SEC and we were unable to timely find another registered public accounting firm to audit and issue an opinion on our financial statements, our financial statements could be determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act. Such a determination could ultimately lead to delisting of our ADSs from the NYSE or deregistration from the SEC, or both, which would substantially reduce or effectively terminate the trading of our ADSs in the United States. Our auditor, like other independent registered public accounting firms operating in China, is not permitted to be subject to inspection by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and consequently, investors may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection. The independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit reports included in this annual report, as an auditor of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB, is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess its compliance with the laws of the United States and with applicable professional standards. Because our auditor is located in China, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the PRC authorities, our auditor, like other independent registered public accounting firms operating in China, is currently not inspected by the PCAOB. Inspections of other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside of China have identified deficiencies in those firms audit procedures and quality control procedures, and such deficiencies may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of independent registered public accounting firms operating in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditors audit procedures or quality control procedures, and to the extent that such inspections might have facilitated improvements in our auditors audit procedures and quality control procedures, investors may be deprived of such benefits. Risks Related to Our ADSs The market price for our ADSs has fluctuated and may be volatile. The market price for our ADSs has fluctuated since we first listed our ADSs. Since our ADSs became listed on the NYSE on December 8, 2010, the trading price of our ADSs have ranged from US$13.76 to US$69.95 per ADS, and the last reported trading price on April 15, 2014 was US$24.57 per ADS. The market price for our ADSs may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors within and outside our control including, but not limited to, the following: 32 Table of Contents · regulatory developments affecting us, our advertisers or our industry; · announcements of studies and reports relating to the quality and popularity of our services or those of our competitors; · changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other companies that provide online video or online advertising; · actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and changes of our expected results; · changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts; · conditions in the online video or online advertising industry; · announcements by us or our competitors of new services, acquisitions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments; · additions to or departures of our senior management; · fluctuations of exchange rates between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar; and · sales or perceived potential sales of additional ordinary shares or ADSs. In addition, the securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of any particular companies. These market fluctuations may also have a material adverse effect on the market price of our ADSs. The securities of some China-based companies that have listed their securities in the United States have experienced significant volatility since their initial public offerings in recent years, including, in some cases, substantial declines in the trading prices of their securities. The trading performances of these companies securities after their offerings may affect the attitudes of investors towards Chinese companies listed in the United States in general, which consequently may impact the trading performance of our ADSs, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, any negative news or perceptions about inadequate corporate governance practices or fraudulent accounting, corporate structure or other matters of other Chinese companies may also negatively affect the attitudes of investors towards Chinese companies in general, including us, regardless of whether we have engaged in any inappropriate activities. In particular, the global financial crisis and the ensuing economic recessions in many countries have contributed and may continue to contribute to extreme volatility in the global stock markets. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our ADSs. Volatility in our ADS price may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, most of whom have been granted options or other equity incentives. Our dual-class voting structure will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could discourage others from pursuing any change of control transactions that holders of our Class A ordinary shares and ADSs may view as beneficial. We have a dual-class voting structure such that our ordinary shares consist of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares. Subject to certain exceptions, in respect of matters requiring the votes of shareholders, holders of Class A ordinary shares are entitled to one vote per share, while holders of Class B ordinary shares are entitled to four votes per share. We issued Class A ordinary shares represented by ADSs in our initial public offering in December 2010 and the follow-on public offering in May 2011. Since our initial public offering in December 2010, (i) all ordinary shares previously held by 1Look Holdings Ltd., which is wholly owned by our founder, chairman and chief executive officer, Victor Koo, and its affiliates have been automatically re-designated as Class B ordinary shares on a 1-for-1 basis, (ii) all preferred shares previously held by Chengwei Partners, L.P., Chengwei Evergreen Capital, L.P. (formerly known as Chengwei Ventures Evergreen Fund, L.P.) and Chengwei Ventures Evergreen Advisors Fund, LLC, collectively referred to as Chengwei Funds, and their affiliates have been automatically converted into Class B ordinary shares each on a 1-for-1 basis, and (iii) all preferred shares previously held by our shareholders other than Chengwei Funds or their affiliates have been automatically converted into Class A ordinary shares on a 1-for-1 basis. Each Class B ordinary share is convertible into one Class A ordinary share at any time by the holder thereof, while Class A ordinary shares are not convertible into Class B ordinary shares under any circumstances. Upon any transfer of Class B ordinary shares by a holder thereof to any person or entity which is not an affiliate of such holder, such Class B ordinary shares shall be automatically and immediately converted into the equal number of Class A ordinary shares. Due to the disparate voting powers attached to these two classes, Victor Koo and Chengwei Funds beneficially own approximately 53% of the aggregate voting power of our company as of the date of this report and have considerable influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, subject to certain exceptions. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could discourage others from pursuing any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transactions that holders of Class A ordinary shares and ADSs may view as beneficial. 33 Table of Contents Because we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, you must rely on price appreciation of our ADSs for return on your investment. We intend to retain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Therefore, you should not rely on an investment in our ADSs as a source for any future dividend income. Our board of directors has complete discretion as to whether to distribute dividends. Even if our board of directors decides to declare and pay dividends, the timing, amount and form of future dividends, if any, will depend on, among other things, our future results of operations and cash flow, our capital requirements and surplus, the amount of distributions, if any, received by us from our subsidiaries, our financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Accordingly, the return on your investment in our ADSs will likely depend entirely upon any future price appreciation of our ADSs. There is no guarantee that our ADSs will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which you purchased the ADSs. You may not realize a return on your investment in our ADSs and you may even lose your entire investment in our ADSs. Substantial future sales or perceived potential sales of our ADSs in the public market could cause the price of our ADSs to decline. Additional sales of our ADSs or Class A ordinary shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our ADSs to decline. As of December 31, 2013, we had 3,016,091,294 ordinary shares outstanding including 2,356,529,401 Class A ordinary shares represented by ADSs. All ADSs are freely transferable without restriction or additional registration under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. Certain holders of our ordinary shares have the right to cause us to register under the Securities Act the sale of their shares. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in ADSs representing these shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act immediately upon the effectiveness of the registration. Sales of these registered shares in the form of ADSs, in the public market could cause the price of our ADSs to decline. We have incurred increased costs as a result of being a public company, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional future costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. As a public company, we have incurred significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. These rules and regulations have increased our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs and made some of our corporate activities more time-consuming and costly. Also, we have incurred additional costs associated with satisfying our public company reporting requirements. We are evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these rules and regulations, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional future costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. You may not have the same voting rights as the holders of our ordinary shares and may not receive voting materials in time to be able to exercise your right to vote. Except as described in this annual report and in the deposit agreement, holders of our ADSs are not able to exercise voting rights attaching to the Class A ordinary shares represented by our ADSs on an individual basis. Pursuant to the deposit agreement, holders of our ADSs will appoint the depositary or its nominee as their representative to exercise the voting rights attaching to the Class A ordinary shares represented by the ADSs. You may not receive voting materials in time to instruct the depositary to vote, and it is possible that you, or persons who hold their ADSs through brokers, dealers or other third parties, will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote. 34 Table of Contents The depositary for our ADSs will give us a discretionary proxy to vote our ordinary shares underlying your ADSs if you do not vote at shareholders meetings, except in limited circumstances, which could adversely affect your interests. Under the deposit agreement for the ADSs, if you do not vote, the depositary will give us a discretionary proxy to vote the Class A ordinary shares underlying your ADSs at shareholders meetings unless: · we have failed to timely provide the depositary with notice of meeting and related voting materials; · we have instructed the depositary that we do not wish a discretionary proxy to be given; · we have informed the depositary that there is substantial opposition as to a matter to be voted on at the meeting; · we have informed the depositary that a matter to be voted on at the meeting would have a material adverse impact on shareholders; or · the voting at the meeting is to be made on a show of hands. Your right to participate in any future rights offerings may be limited, which may cause dilution to your holdings, and you may not receive cash dividends if it is impractical to make them available to you. We may from time to time distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire our securities. However, we cannot make rights available to you in the United States unless we register both the rights and the securities to which the rights relate under the Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements is available. Under the deposit agreement, the depositary will not make rights available to you unless both the rights and the underlying securities to be distributed to ADS holders are either registered under the Securities Act or exempt from registration under the Securities Act. We are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or securities or to endeavor to cause such a registration statement to be declared effective and we may not be able to establish a necessary exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Accordingly, you may be unable to participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution in your holdings. The depositary of our ADSs has agreed to pay to you the cash dividends or other distributions it or the custodian receives on our ordinary shares or other deposited securities after deducting its fees and expenses. You will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of ordinary shares your ADSs represent. However, the depositary may, at its discretion, decide that it is inequitable or impractical to make a distribution available to any holders of ADSs. For example, the depositary may determine that it is not practicable to distribute certain property through the mail, or that the value of certain distributions may be less than the cost of mailing them. In these cases, the depositary may decide not to distribute such property to you. You may be subject to limitations on transfer of your ADSs. Your ADSs are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary may close its transfer books at any time or from time to time when it deems expedient in connection with the performance of its duties. In addition, the depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of ADSs generally when our books or the books of the depositary are closed, or at any time if we or the depositary deems it advisable to do so because of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body, or under any provision of the deposit agreement, or for any other reason. You may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through the U.S. federal courts may be limited because we are incorporated under Cayman Islands law, we conduct substantially all of our operations in China and substantially all of our directors and officers reside outside the United States. We are incorporated in the Cayman Islands and conduct substantially all of our operations in China through our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities. Substantially all of our directors and officers reside outside the United States and a substantial portion of their assets are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action in the United States against us or against these individuals in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under the securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the Cayman Islands and of China may render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers. There is no statutory recognition in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, although a judgment obtained in the United States will be recognized and enforced in the courts of the Cayman Islands at common law, without any re-examination of the merits of the underlying dispute, by an action commenced on the foreign judgment debt in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, provided such judgment (a) is given by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction; (b) imposes on the judgment debtor a liability to pay a liquidated sum for which the judgment has been given; (c) is final; (d) is not in respect of taxes, a fine or a penalty; and (e) was not obtained in a manner and is not of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands. 35 Table of Contents Our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association, as amended and restated from time to time, and by the Companies Law (2013 Revision) and common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take legal action against us and our directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, which provides persuasive, but not binding, authority. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a less developed body of securities laws than the United States and provides significantly less protection to investors. In addition, shareholders in Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in U.S. federal courts. As a result, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against us, our management, our directors or our major shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States. Our memorandum and articles of association contain anti-takeover provisions that could adversely affect the rights of holders of our ordinary shares and ADSs. Our memorandum and articles of association contain certain provisions that could limit the ability of others to acquire control of our company, including a provision that grants authority to our board of directors to establish from time to time one or more series of preferred shares without action by our shareholders and to determine, with respect to any series of preferred shares, the terms and rights of that series. The provisions could have the effect of depriving our shareholders of the opportunity to sell their shares, including shares represented by ADSs, at a premium over the prevailing market price by discouraging third parties from seeking to obtain control of our company in a tender offer or similar transactions. Our corporate actions are substantially controlled by our directors, executive officers and other principal shareholders, who can exert significant influence over important corporate matters, which may reduce the price of our ADSs and deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares. As of March 31, 2014, our directors, executive officers and principal shareholders beneficially own approximately 37% of our outstanding ordinary shares, representing 62% of our total voting power. These shareholders, if acting together, could exert substantial influence over matters such as electing directors and approving material mergers, acquisitions or other business combination transactions. This concentration of ownership may also discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could have the dual effect of depriving our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and reducing the price of our ADSs. These actions may be taken even if they are opposed by our other shareholders, including those who purchase ADSs. In addition, these persons could divert business opportunities away from us to themselves or others. 36 Table of Contents We may be classified as a passive foreign investment company for United States federal income tax purposes, which could result in adverse United States federal income tax consequences to United States investors in the ADSs or ordinary shares. Depending upon the value of our ordinary shares and ADSs and the nature of our assets and income over time, we could be classified as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A non-United States corporation will be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year if either (i) 75% or more of its gross income for such year consists of certain types of passive income, or (ii) 50% or more of the value of its assets (determined on the basis of a quarterly average) during such year is attributable to assets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income. Although the application of these rules is unclear and therefore determinations are not free from doubt, based on the market price of our ADSs and ordinary shares and the composition of our income and assets for the taxable year ended December 31, 2013, we do not believe that we were a PFIC for that year. However, the United States Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, does not issue rulings with respect to PFIC status, and there can be no assurance that the IRS, or a court, will agree with our determination. Although the law in this regard is unclear, we treat our consolidated affiliated entities as being owned by us for United Stated federal income tax purposes, not only because we exercise effective control over the operation of such entities but also because we are entitled to substantially all of their economic benefits, and, as a result, we consolidate their results of operations in our consolidated financial statements. If it were determined, however, that we are not the owner of our consolidated affiliated entities for United States federal income tax purposes, we would likely be treated as a PFIC. While we do not expect to be a PFIC for the current taxable year, fluctuations in the market price of our ADSs or ordinary shares or changes in the composition of our income and assets may cause us to be a PFIC for 2014 or subsequent taxable years. Because there are uncertainties in the application of the relevant rules and PFIC status is a factual determination made annually after the close of each taxable year on the basis of the composition of our income and the value of our active versus passive assets, there can be no assurance that we will not be a PFIC for the taxable year 2014 or any future taxable year. If we were to be or become treated as a PFIC, a U.S. Holder (as defined in Item 10. Additional InformationTaxationCertain United States Federal Income Tax ConsiderationsGeneral) may incur significantly increased United States income tax on gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares and on the receipt of distributions on the ADSs or ordinary shares to the extent such distribution is treated as an excess distribution under the United States federal income tax rules. Such U.S. Holder also generally would not be able to benefit from any preferential tax rate with respect to any dividend distribution that such U.S. Holder receives from us in that year, the next year, and potentially following years. Further, if we are treated as a PFIC for any year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or ordinary shares, our ADSs or ordinary shares generally will continue to be treated as shares in a PFIC as to such U.S. Holder for all succeeding years during which such U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or ordinary shares, unless we cease to be a PFIC and the U.S. Holder makes a deemed sale election with respect to the ADSs or ordinary shares. You are urged to consult your tax advisor concerning the United States federal income tax consequences of acquiring, holding, and disposing of ADSs or ordinary shares if we are or become treated as a PFIC. For more information see Item 10. Additional InformationE. TaxationCertain United States Federal Income Tax ConsiderationsPassive Foreign Investment Company Considerations and Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules.
