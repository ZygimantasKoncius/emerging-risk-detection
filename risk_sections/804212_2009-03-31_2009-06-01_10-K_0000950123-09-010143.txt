ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. In addition to risk factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the Company believes the following, which have not been sequenced in any particular order, are the most significant risks related to our business that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. We face risks related to the current economic conditions, which may impact the demand for and supply of our products and our results of operations. Demand for our products depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the United States and, to a lesser extent, the rest of the world. Although our diverse product offering and customer base help provide relative stability to our business in difficult times, the current weak economic conditions in the United States are broad-based. This general downturn has and may continue to negatively impact the demand for our products and services, as well as, our customers ability to fulfill their obligations to us. Falling demand may lead to lower sales volumes, lower pricing and/or lower profit margins. A protracted period of lower product demand and profitability may result in diminished values for both tangible and intangible assets, increasing the possibility of future impairment charges. Further, suppliers may be impacted by the economic downturn, which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. If current economic conditions continue for significant future periods or deteriorate significantly, our financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. Additionally, our growth strategies to maximize shareholder value by driving market-leading sales growth through core and strategic product offerings that leverage our infrastructure may be delayed until current economic conditions improve. We operate in a highly competitive environment and such competition could negatively impact us. The U.S. industrial gas industry operates in a highly competitive environment. Competition is generally based on price, reliable product delivery, product availability, technical support, quality and service. If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, we may suffer lower revenue and a loss of market share. Increases in product and energy costs could reduce our profitability. The cost of industrial gases represents a significant percentage of our operating costs. The production of industrial gases requires significant amounts of electric energy. Therefore, industrial gas prices have historically increased as the cost of electric energy increases. Price increases for oil and natural gas have historically resulted in electric energy surcharges. In addition, a significant portion of our distribution expenses consist of diesel fuel costs. Although prices of oil, natural gas and diesel fuel are currently lower than the peaks experienced during fiscal 2009, energy prices may rise again in the future and as a result, increase the cost of industrial gases. While we have historically been able to pass increases in the cost of our products and operating expenses on to our customers, we cannot guarantee our ability to do so in the future, which could negatively impact our operations, financial results or liquidity. Our financial results may be adversely affected by gas supply disruptions/constraints. We are the largest U.S. distributor of industrial, medical and specialty gases in packaged form and have long-term supply contracts with the major gas producers. Additionally, we operate 16 air separation plants, which provide us with substantial production capacity. Both long-term supply contracts and our own production capacity mitigate supply disruptions to various degrees. However, natural disasters, plant shut downs, labor strikes and other supply disruptions may occur within our industry. Regional supply disruptions may create shortages of certain products. Consequently, we may not be able to obtain the products required to meet our customers demands or may incur significant cost to ship product from other regions of the country to meet customer requirements. Such additional costs may adversely impact 11 Table of Contents operating results until product sourcing can be restored. In the past, we successfully met customer demand by arranging for alternative supplies and transporting product into an affected region, but we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in arranging alternative product supplies or passing the additional transportation or other costs on to customers in the event of future supply disruptions, which could negatively impact our operations, financial results or liquidity. Recent turmoil in the U.S. credit markets may impact our ability to obtain financing or increase the cost of future financing. As of March 31, 2009, we had total consolidated debt of approximately $1.8 billion, which includes $90 million under a term loan we intend to refinance under our credit facility and $11 million of acquisition notes that mature within the next twelve months. We also participate in a trade receivables securitization agreement with three commercial banks to sell up to $345 million in qualified trade receivables. At March 31, 2009, the amount of outstanding trade receivables sold under the program was $311 million and the agreement matures in March 2010. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7. Although the current credit environment has not had a significant adverse impact on our liquidity or cost of borrowing, the availability of funds has tightened and credit spreads on corporate debt have increased. Therefore, obtaining additional or replacement financing may be more difficult and the cost of issuing new debt or replacing a credit facility would likely be at a higher cost than under our current facilities. The higher cost of new debt may limit our ability to finance future acquisitions on terms that are acceptable to us. Additionally, although we actively manage our interest rate risk through derivative and diversified debt obligations, approximately 40% of our debt has a variable interest rate. If interest rates increase, our interest expense could increase significantly, affecting earnings and reducing cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. We may not be successful in integrating acquisitions and achieving intended benefits and synergies. We have successfully integrated approximately 400 acquisitions in our history and consider the acquisition and integration of businesses to be a core competency. However, the process of integrating acquired businesses into our operations may result in unexpected operating difficulties and may require significant financial and other resources. Unexpected difficulties may impair our ability to achieve targeted synergies or planned operating results, which could diminish the value of acquired tangible and intangible assets resulting in future impairment charges. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:  acquired companies may not have an internal control structure appropriate for a larger public company resulting in significant internal control remediations;  acquired operations, information systems and products may be difficult to assimilate;  acquired operations may not achieve targeted synergies;  we may not be able to retain key employees, customers and business relationships of acquired companies; and  our management team may have their attention and resources diverted from ongoing operations. 12 Table of Contents We depend on our key personnel to manage our business effectively and they may be difficult to replace. Our performance substantially depends on the efforts and abilities of our senior management team, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, other executive officers and key employees. Furthermore, much of our competitive advantage is based on the expertise, experience and know-how of our key personnel regarding our distribution infrastructure, systems and products. The loss of key employees could have a negative effect on our business, revenues, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to litigation risk as a result of the nature of our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits that arise from our business. Litigation may, for example, relate to product liability claims, vehicle accidents, contractual disputes, or employment matters. The defense and ultimate outcome of lawsuits against us may result in higher operating expenses. Those higher operating expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We have established insurance programs with significant deductibles and maximum coverage limits which could result in the recognition of significant losses. We maintain insurance coverage for workers compensation, auto and general liability claims with significant per claim deductibles and, in some policy years, aggregate per claim retentions above those deductibles. In the past, we have incurred significant workers compensation, auto and general liability losses. Such losses could impact our profitability. Additionally, claims in excess of our insurance limits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Catastrophic events may disrupt our business and adversely affect our operating results. Although our operations are widely distributed across the U.S., a catastrophic event such as a fire or explosion at one of the Companys fill plants or natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes, could result in significant property losses, employee injuries and third-party damage claims. Additionally, such events may severely impact our regional customer base and supply sources resulting in lost revenues, higher product costs, and increased bad debts. We are subject to environmental, health and safety regulations that generate ongoing environmental costs and could subject us to liability. We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and natural resources. These include, among other things, reporting on chemical inventories and risk management plans, and management of hazardous substances and wastes, air emissions and water discharges. Violations of existing laws and enactment of future legislation and regulations could result in substantial penalties, temporary or permanent plant closures and legal consequences. Moreover, the nature of our existing and historical operations exposes us to the risk of liabilities to third parties. These potential claims include property damage, personal injuries and cleanup obligations. See Item 1, Business  Regulatory and Environmental Matters above. More recently, the issue of greenhouse gas emissions has been subject to increased scrutiny, public awareness and evolving legislation, both internationally and in the U.S. Increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose significant additional costs on us. Until such time that federal legislation is passed in the United States, it will remain unclear as to what industries would be impacted, the period of time within which compliance would be required, the significance of the greenhouse gas emissions reductions and the costs of compliance. At this time, we cannot predict the effect that climate change regulation may have on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 13 Table of Contents We face risks in connection with our current project to install a new enterprise information system for our business. We have initiated a phased implementation project of a new enterprise information system for many aspects of our business. The implementation is a technically intensive process, requiring testing, modifications and project coordination. Although our implementation process includes at least twelve months of design and testing, which is intended to provide minimal business disruption and to minimize conversion risks, we may experience disruptions in our business operations relating to this implementation effort. Such disruptions could result in material adverse consequences, including delays in the design and implementation of the system, loss of information, damage to our ability to process transactions or harm to our control environment, and unanticipated increases in costs. Market conditions and other uncertainties may unfavorably impact our withdrawal liabilities from multi-employer pension plans. We participate in several multi-employer pension plans that provide defined benefits to union employees under the provisions of collective bargaining agreements. The plans generally provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers. As we negotiate changes in collective bargaining agreements and cease making contributions to certain multi-employer pension funds, estimates for withdrawal liabilities must be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. However, the estimates are based on numerous assumptions that continually change and information that is not always current, and can take a number of years to settle. Furthermore, the investment assets in these plans are subject to market fluctuations and may significantly increase potential withdrawal liabilities during market downturns. As a result, increases in future withdrawal liabilities from multi-employer pension plans could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. ITEM 1B.
