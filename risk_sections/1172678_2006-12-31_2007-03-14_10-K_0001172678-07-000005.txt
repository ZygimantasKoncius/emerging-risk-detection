Item 1A Risk Factors” and other risk factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report. 3 PART I ITEM 1: BUSINESS General Temecula Valley Bancorp Inc. We formed Temecula Valley Bancorp Inc. ("company" or “our company” or “our holding company”) in 2002 to serve as a holding company for Temecula Valley Bank ("bank" or “our bank”). We reincorporated our holding company from Delaware into California in December 2003 as a tax savings measure. Our holding company is a bank holding company registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve") under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended ("BHCA"). Our holding company’s activities consist of owning the outstanding shares of our bank, Temecula Valley Statutory Trust I, Temecula Valley Statutory Trust II, Temecula Valley Statutory Trust III, Temecula Valley Statutory Trust IV, and Temecula Valley Statutory Trust V. Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references in this report to “we”, “us”, and “our” refer to our company and our bank on a consolidated basis. Temecula Valley Bank Our bank was organized in 1996 and commenced operations on December 16, 1996 as a national banking association. Our bank converted from a national charter to a state charter on June 29, 2005 to take advantage of higher legal lending limits and reduced examination fees. The deposits of our bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") up to the applicable limits. Our bank has no subsidiaries. Since we opened our bank in 1996, we have experienced substantial annual growth. We continue to have strong growth in loans and deposits. We plan to continue to expand through new full-service and/or loan production office locations if they make good business sense and are located within our geographic service areas or contiguous markets. General Business Our bank currently has ten full-service banking offices in California providing services to customers in the Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego Counties. Our principal office is located in Temecula, California with other California full-service offices in Carlsbad, Corona, El Cajon, Escondido, Fallbrook, Murrieta, Ontario, Solana Beach, and in the Rancho Bernardo area of San Diego. Our bank also operates loan production offices which principally generate construction and/or mortgage loans in California at the following locations: Encinitas, Fallbrook, Ontario, and Temecula. The Real Estate Industries Group of our bank focuses on construction lending and maintains loan production offices in Corona and San Rafael, both in California. Our bank also has SBA loan production offices in the following states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Nebraska, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, and Washington. Our bank offers a broad range of banking services, including personal and business checking accounts and various types of interest-bearing deposit accounts, including interest-bearing checking, money market, savings, IRA, SEP, and time certificates of deposits. In addition, our bank has developed a nationwide SBA lending program as a “preferred lender”. Through this program, we originate and fund both “7(a)” and “504” loans, primarily secured by commercial real estate property and guaranteed up to 85% by the Small Business Administration. Loan products include consumer installment (primarily automobile loans), home equity lines of credit, single-family residential construction loans, on both an owner-occupied and a non-owner basis, single family residential tract loans (over 4 units), commercial construction and permanent loans for office, retail and industrial buildings for owner-occupancy, investment and re-sale, commercial lines of credit, term loans and letters of credit for local businesses, and residential mortgage financing including conventional, VA, FHA, and Cal Vet loans. We fund our lending activities primarily from our core deposit base and our Certificate of Deposit Money Desk. We obtain deposits from the local market with no material portion (in excess of 10% of total deposits) dependent upon any one person, entity or industry. Our bank also offers safe deposit boxes, night depository facilities, merchant credit card services, notary services, travelers checks, note collection, wire transfer services, cashiers checks, drive up facilities at some locations, 24 hour ATM banking services, telephone banking, internet banking, direct deposit, and automatic transfers between accounts. Our bank is a member of the regional ATM network and offers nationwide ATM access. 4 Our holding company, as the parent of our bank, has no operations and conducts no business of its own other than owning our bank, Temecula Valley Statutory Trust I, Temecula Valley Statutory Trust II, Temecula Valley Statutory Trust III, Temecula Valley Statutory Trust IV, and Temecula Valley Statutory Trust V. Accordingly, the discussion of the business which follows concerns the business conducted by our bank, unless otherwise indicated. No material portion of our company’s business is seasonal. Business Strategy Our goals are to build a leading Southern California regional community banking franchise and to maximize long-term returns to our shareholders by seeking to grow assets, while maintaining strong earnings. In order to achieve these goals, we intend to pursue a strategy that takes advantage of and enhances our three core business lines: community banking, construction lending and SBA lending. Specifically, our strategy relies upon our ability to continue: Attracting Talented & Experienced Management. We have created an entrepreneurial culture with performance-based compensation that attracts highly skilled bankers. Rather than a traditional banking model of opening branches in a market followed by staffing, we expand into new markets upon hiring producers. Our senior management team of 11 members averages more than 30 years of banking experience per individual and includes two former CEOs, five former CLOs/CCOs/SLOs and two former CFOs/COOs, several of whom have held senior management positions at other financial institutions with assets exceeding $1 billion. We believe that our customers significantly benefit from having access to experienced bankers. We believe that our management depth is far greater than typically seen at community banks of similar or greater size. Expanding our Community Banking Model. Our goal is to deliver superior commercial loan and deposit products to expand our customer base in existing markets. For example, we have built a cash management team devoted exclusively to the development and implementation of state of the art products designed to allow us to generate a higher level of core deposits from existing customers and serve new deposit customers within our markets. In addition, we provide a one-on-one total banking relationship that may not be available at larger financial institutions. We will continue to cross-sell our business services and cash management products to enhance and maximize our banking relationships with our customers. A highly experienced and customer driven staff will differentiate us from our competition. We opened two new branches in 2004, one new branch in 2005 and two branches in 2006. Ontario, California, our most recent expansion area, continues to be the business hub of the Inland Empire. This marketplace will provide a wide spectrum of business banking opportunities. We will continue to explore branch expansion opportunities as skilled bankers become available in or around our market areas. Branch offices are staffed by proven managers with long-standing ties within the communities they serve. As a complement to our loan production offices, we use the relationships of our branch staff to provide lending products to customers in the Southern California markets we serve. In particular, we expect to see our commercial and industrial loan portfolio grow with the addition of the Ontario team serving the San Bernardino County market. Maintaining Strength in Construction Lending. Our Real Estate Industries Group (REIG) specializes in residential, commercial and industrial construction loans to established, mid-sized builders in established markets. In Southern California, the predominate product of choice has been residential tracts located throughout the Inland Empire (Riverside and San Bernardino Counties). In contrast, Northern California efforts have been focused primarily on residential condominiums in San Francisco and smaller tracts in the East Bay area. The REIG consists of experienced real estate construction lenders with decades of successful lending experience. The loan portfolios of this group include builders that have been customers of the loan officers for more than 15 years. We believe our loan quality will continue to be enhanced by this degree of experience at both the loan officer and customer levels, beginning at underwriting and continuing through loan disbursement, project completion and the ultimate sale or lease of the completed product. Building our SBA Loan Origination Volume. The expansion of the loan volume through our SBA distribution channel is dependent on hiring seasoned business development officers (“BDOs”) and increasing the number of loans closed by each BDO. In December 2006, we began increasing the products available to our BDOs. We hope to capture a greater portion of the BDOs’ referral sources’ business, thus increasing the loan production of each BDO. The referral sources are typically commercial real estate brokers, business brokers, mortgage brokers, attorneys and accountants, among others. 5 In January 2007, we closed our regional SBA offices in the northeast and southeast areas of the country except that we retained one office in Florida. It is anticipated that this reorganization will result in cost savings greater than the income generated from the closed offices. As a result of these actions, we are placing greater emphasis and resources on generating SBA loans in the mid and western United States. In addition to the origination of SBA loans through our current network of BDOs, we have initiated a program to purchase participations in the unguaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans from other lenders. The team we have in place to manage this program includes individuals who have successfully managed similar portfolios at other financial institutions. Overview of Performance. Our profitability goals have been realized historically by increases in net interest income as well as expense controls during several consecutive years of significant internal expansion. This produced record earnings for 2006 of $16.9 million, compared to $14.0 million in 2005, and $10.6 million in 2004. Return on average equity was 23.89% for 2006, compared to 27.71% for 2005, and 28.94% in 2004. Return on average total assets was 1.64% for 2006, compared to 1.91% for 2005, and 2.00% for 2004. Our management expects that during 2007, net income will increase over the results in 2006 by at least 10% but cannot guarantee these results. Net interest income before provision for loan losses has increased to $59.8 million for 2006, compared to $43.5 million for 2005, and $27.2 million in 2004 due to increases in rates and volume of interest-earning assets. Total assets increased 42.49% to $1.24 billion as of December 31, 2006, compared to $869.0 million as of December 31, 2005, and $606.8 million as of December 31, 2004. Average interest-earning assets increased 46.26% to $939.2 million for 2006, compared to $642.2 million for 2005, and $454.8 million in 2004. The net interest margin has decreased to 6.37% in 2006 from 6.78% in 2005, and up from 5.98% in 2004. Non-interest income was $19.4 million as of December 31, 2006, compared to $23.8 million for 2005, and $28.7 million for 2004. This source of income is principally derived from SBA loan sales. The decrease in non-interest income in 2006 is primarily due to the decrease in servicing income as a result of unusually high prepayments. We currently anticipate that for 2007, non-interest income will increase due to decreased amortization of the SBA servicing assets as a result of lower prepayments and the reduction of serviced SBA 7(a) loans that have higher retained servicing. We measure operating expenses as a percentage of average assets. As a percentage of average assets, operating expenses decreased to 4.56% for 2006, compared to 5.57% for 2005, and 6.43% for 2004. Average assets increased from $528.2 million as of December 31, 2004, to $730.0 million as of December 31, 2005, and $1.03 billion as of December 31, 2006. The decrease is a result of increases in the growth in average assets having outpaced growth in operating expenses in each of the last three years. Lending Loan Portfolio Composition Total loans, including loans held-for-sale, excluding deferred loan fees, and allowance for loan loss, were $1.15 billion at December 31, 2006, compared to $758.1 million at December 31, 2005, and $533.9 million at December 31, 2004. Contributing to the increase was the outstanding balance of the purchase of the unguaranteed portion of 7(a) loans in the amount of $120.3 million. Without the purchase of these loans, the increase in total loans, excluding loans held-for-sale, would have been $267.8 million or 35.32%. Loan growth is expected to remain strong in 2007 due to the expansion of our branches, growth of the SBA unguaranteed purchase program, and growth of the SBA wholesale lending unit. Our loan portfolio composition is primarily construction, commercial, SBA, and real estate secured loans. SBA 7(a) loans, of which we are an active originator, comprise approximately 19% of net loans outstanding as of December 31, 2006 and 13% of net loans outstanding as of December 31, 2005. Typical of community bank loan markets, a significant portion of our portfolio is real estate secured. Approximately 94% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2006 was real estate secured, compared to 95% at December 31, 2005 and 94% at December 31, 2004. Approximately 50%, 51%, and 38% of our lending portfolio was classified as real estate construction loans as of December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. In December 2006, the federal banking agencies issued final guidance to reinforce sound risk management practices for bank holding companies and banks in commercial real estate (“CRE”) loans. The guidance establishes CRE concentration thresholds as criteria for examiners to identify CRE concentration that may warrant further analysis. The implementation of these guidelines could result in increased reserves and capital costs for banks with “CRE concentration”. We believe that our CRE portfolio as of December 31, 2006 does not have the risks associated with high CRE concentration due to mitigating factors, including low loan-to-value ratios, adequate debt coverage ratios, and a wide variety of property types. Under the final guidance, our ratio of commercial real estate loans, excluding owner-occupied properties, to capital as of December 31, 2006, is approximately 401%. While this exceeds the 300% benchmark set by the guidance, we believe we have implemented enhanced risk management practices as recommended by the guidance. These practices include the review and analysis of detailed monthly construction loan status reports, detailed monthly geographic concentration reports by product type and county location, detailed monthly commercial real estate concentration reports, and centralized monitoring and servicing of our commercial real estate term loans. 6 The weighted-average loan-to-value for our real estate loan portfolio, excluding owner occupied properties, is approximately 60% at December 31, 2006. The following table summarizes our loan portfolio, (including loans held-for-sale), excluding deferred loan fees and allowance for loan loss, by type of loan and their percentage distribution: December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent (dollars in thousands) Commercial $ 59,663 5 % $ 25,457 3 % $ 16,322 3 % $ 23,630 7 % $ 24,578 9 % Real estate - Construction 570,204 50 % 385,378 51 % 203,885 38 % 113,847 31 % 61,568 23 % Real estate - Other 294,220 25 % 248,039 32 % 196,098 36 % 123,948 34 % 105,731 39 % SBA 218,457 19 % 94,914 13 % 114,799 22 % 98,428 27 % 76,433 28 % Consumer 3,685 1 % 4,306 1 % 2,796 1 % 3,193 1 % 4,456 1 % Total Loans $ 1,146,229 100 % $ 758,094 100 % $ 533,900 100 % $ 363,046 100 % $ 272,766 100 % Loan Maturity The following table sets forth the contractual maturities of gross loans at December 31, 2006.

Each loan must meet minimum underwriting criteria established in our lending policies and must fit within our strategies for yield and portfolio enhancement. For all newly originated loans, upon receipt of a completed loan application from a prospective borrower, a credit report is ordered and, if necessary, additional financial information is requested. An independent appraisal is required on every property securing a loan in excess of $250 thousand, which is ordered by our Appraisal Department. In addition, the loan officer conducts a review of these appraisals for accuracy, reasonableness, and conformance to our lending policy on all applications. All revisions to the approved appraiser list must be approved by the Chief Credit Officer or Chief Appraiser. Depending on the loan size and type, our loan approval process consists of a chain of concurrences beginning with the originating loan officer and rising through the office/division manager, the Chief Credit Officer, the Chief Administrative Officer, the Real Estate Lending Manager, the President/CEO and the Board of Directors. The number of concurring signatures obtained is dependent upon the dollar amount of the transaction and/or the total liability of the borrowing relationship. All signatures in the chain must be obtained except in the case of absence from the Bank. In all cases, the signature of the highest required loan authority must be obtained. All loans exceeding the limits of the above mentioned individuals will be forwarded to our Board of Directors Loan Committee for approval after concurrence by the appropriate chain of authority. The vote of our Directors Loan Committee will be obtained by the committee chairman telephonically or in person at the monthly Board of Directors Loan Committee meeting. The approval or declination by each member will be indicated on the signature page of the loan report. 8 If the loan is approved, the loan commitment specifies the terms and conditions of the proposed loan including the amount, interest rate, amortization term, a brief description of the required collateral, and the required insurance coverage. Generally, the borrower must provide proof of fire, flood (if applicable), and casualty insurance on the property serving as collateral. This insurance must be maintained during the full term of the loan. Also, generally, title insurance endorsed to our bank is required on all real estate secured loans. We maintain SBA loan production offices in the mid and western United States and an office in Florida. SBA loan production offices are typically staffed with a business development officer who prepares the loan applications and compiles the necessary information regarding the applicant. All SBA loans are approved at our Temecula office. The other construction lending and mortgage related loan production offices, all of which are in California, are typically staffed with business development officers, underwriters, and processors who send these loans files to our main office where the credit decision is made. Our retail full-service branches may include non-SBA commercial, mortgage, and construction loan officers. SBA Lending Programs The SBA lending programs are designed by the federal government to assist the small business community in obtaining financing from financial institutions that are given government guarantees as an incentive to make the loan. Our bank is a Nationwide SBA "Preferred Lender". As a "Preferred Lender," we can approve a loan within the authority given us by the SBA without prior approval from the SBA. "Preferred Lenders" approve, package, fund, and service SBA loans within a range of authority that is not available to other SBA lenders without the "Preferred Lender" designation. Our SBA loans fall into two categories, loans originated under the SBA's 7(a) Program ("7(a) loans") and loans originated under the SBA's 504 Program ("504 Loans"). For 2006, 7(a) loans have represented approximately 66% of the SBA Loans originated while 504, piggyback, USDA business, and industry loan programs have represented the balance. Under the SBA's 7(a) Program, loans in excess of $150 thousand up to $2 million are guaranteed 75% by the SBA. Generally, this guarantee may become invalid only if the loan does not meet the SBA underwriting, documentation, and servicing guidelines. Loans under $150 thousand are guaranteed 85% by the SBA. SBA 7(a) loans collateralized by real estate have terms of up to 25 years, while loans collateralized by equipment and working capital have terms of up to 10 years and 7 years, respectively. A minimum down payment of 10% is required on most 7(a) loans, but may require a larger down payment when the real estate collateral consists of a special purpose or single use property such as a motel, service station, and/or the business is a start-up. We generally sell the guaranteed portion SBA 7(a) loans, which is up to 85% of the loan. The remaining portion is the unguaranteed portion of the loans, a portion of which may also be sold with approval from the SBA. Approximately 5% of the 7(a) loans are generally required to stay on the books of our bank. Funding for these loans has come principally from retail deposit sources. The SBA loans generally have an interest rate of 1.00% to 2.75% over Wall Street Journal Prime Rate. We retain the servicing on the sold guaranteed portion of 7(a) loans. The strategy of selling both the guaranteed and unguaranteed portion of the 7(a) loans allows us to manage our capital levels and to assist us in meeting the local community loan demand. Upon sale in the secondary market, the purchaser of the guaranteed portion of 7(a) loans pays a premium to us, which generally is between 6% and 10% of the guaranteed amount, and in the case of a sale of the unguaranteed portion, the premium is usually between 1% and 4%. We also receive a servicing fee equal to 1% to 5% of the guaranteed amount sold in the secondary market. In the event that a 7(a) loan has missed payments in the first three months and goes into default within 270 days of its sale, or prepays within 90 days, we might repurchase the loan and may be required to refund the premium to the purchaser. We have repurchased 35 loans, however only 1 of these repurchased loans required a refund of the premium. No refunds were owed on the other 34 loans repurchased. Under the SBA's 504 Program, we require a minimum down payment of 10% (more on special purpose, single use properties, or start-ups). We then enter into a 50% first trust deed loan to the borrower and an interim 40% second trust deed loan. The first trust deed loan must be equal to half of the original maturity of the related debenture. The second trust deed loan is for a term of 120 days. Within the 120 day period of entering into the loan, the second trust deed loans are refinanced by SBA certified development companies and used as collateral for SBA guaranteed debentures. For 504 construction loans, the term on the second trust deed loan is generally 18 months and the Certified Development Company cannot payoff the loan until a notice of completion is filed. The first trust deed loan on a construction project is generally a term of 25 years and 18 months. The first trust deed loans may be pre-sold with no recourse, before releasing the funds to the purchaser. We retain no servicing on 504 Loans after they are sold. 9 Our SBA lending program, and portions of our real estate lending, are dependent on the continual funding and programs of certain federal agencies or quasi-government corporations, including the SBA. The guaranteed portion of an SBA loan does not count towards our bank’s loans-to-one-borrower limitation which, at December 31, 2006 was $22.0 million. SBA lending is a federal government created and administered program. As such, legislative and regulatory developments can affect the availability and funding of the program. This dependence on legislative funding and regulatory restrictions from time to time causes limitations and uncertainties with regard to the continued funding of such loans, with a resulting potential adverse financial impact on our business. Currently, the maximum limit of individual 7(a) loans which the SBA will permit is $2 million. Any reduction in the maximum loan amount or the maximum guaranty amount could have a negative impact on our business. Since the SBA lending of our bank constitutes a significant portion of our lending business, dependence on this government program, and its periodic uncertainty with availability and amounts of funding, creates greater risk for our business than do other parts of our business. Commercial Lending/Real Estate Lending Generally, our commercial loans are underwritten in our market area on the basis of the borrower's ability to service such debt from identified cash flow. We usually take as collateral a lien on available real estate, equipment or other assets and obtain a personal guaranty of the business principals. In addition to commercial loans secured by real estate, we make commercial mortgage loans to finance the purchase of real property, which generally consists of real estate on which structures have already been completed or will be completed and occupied by the borrower. We offer a variety of mortgage loan products that generally are amortized over 5 to 25 years. Our commercial mortgage loans are secured by first liens on real estate. Typically, we have both fixed and variable interest rates and amortize over a 10 to 25 year period with balloon payments due at the end of 3 to 10 years. As a Preferred SBA Lender (discussed above), we also issue full term variable rate real estate loan commitments when the facility is enhanced by the underlying SBA guaranty. In underwriting commercial mortgage loans, consideration is given to the property's operating history, future operating projections, current and projected occupancy, location and physical condition. The underwriting analysis also includes credit checks, appraisals, environmental assessments and a review of the financial condition of the borrower. Construction Lending We originate construction loans on both one-to-four-family residences and on commercial real estate properties. We originate two types of residential construction loans, owner-occupied and speculative. We also originate owner-occupied construction loans to build single family residences. We will originate speculative construction loans to companies engaged in the business of constructing homes for re-sale. These loans may be for homes currently under contract for sale or homes built for speculative purposes to be marketed for sale during construction. For owner-occupied single family residences, the borrower and the property must qualify for permanent financing. Prequalification for owner-occupied single family residences is required. For commercial property, the borrower must qualify for permanent financing and the debt service coverage must be 1.20 to 1 or more (except for SBA loans). Qualification for permanent financing should be determined by the loan officer as part of the credit presentation. Absent such prequalification, we will not approve a construction loan. We originate land acquisition and development loans with the source of repayment being either the sale of finished lots or the sale of homes to be constructed on the finished lots. Construction loans are generally offered with terms up to 24 months. Construction loans are generally made in amounts up to 75% of the value of the security property for "spec" single family residences and commercial properties and up to 80% for owner-occupied single family residences. During construction, loan proceeds are disbursed in draws as construction progresses based upon inspections of work in place by independent construction inspectors. At December 31, 2006, construction loans, including land acquisition and development loans totaled $570.2 million or approximately 50% of our total loan portfolio. Construction loans are generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the security property's value upon completion of construction as compared to the estimated costs of construction, including interest. Also, we assume certain risks associated with the borrower's ability to complete construction in a timely and workmanlike manner. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, or if construction is not performed timely or accurately, we may be confronted with a project which, when completed, has a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment. 10 Consumer Lending Consumer loans include automobile loans, recreational vehicle loans, boat loans, home improvement loans, home equity lines of credit, personal loans (collateralized and uncollateralized), and deposit account collateralized loans. The terms of these loans typically range from 12 to 120 months and vary based upon the nature of collateral and size of loan. Our portfolio of consumer loans primarily consists of installment loans secured by new or used automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles, and loans secured by deposits. At December 31, 2006, consumer loans totaled $3.7 million. As of December 31, 2006, home equity loans totaled $3.1 million, or 3% our gross loan portfolio. Our home equity loans are adjustable-rate and reprice with changes in our internal prime rate. Adjustable-rate home equity lines of credit are offered in amounts up to 80% of the appraised value. Home equity lines of credit are offered with terms up to 10 years. Loan Servicing Sold loans are serviced by our loan servicing department. The loan officer is responsible for the day-to-day relationship with the customer, unless the loan becomes delinquent (60 days or more past due), at which time the responsibilities are reassigned to credit administration. The loan servicing is centralized at our corporate headquarters. As of December 31, 2006, we were servicing $480.1 million of loans originated that were sold to other investors. Our loan servicing operations, performed by the loan servicing department, are intended to provide prompt customer service and accurate and timely information for account follow-up, financial reporting and management review. Following the funding of an approved loan, all pertinent loan data is entered into our data processing system, which provides monthly billing statements, tracks payment performance, and effects agreed upon interest rate adjustments on loans. Regular loan service efforts include payment processing and collection notices, as well as tracking the performance of additional borrower obligations with respect to the maintenance of casualty insurance coverage, payment of property taxes and senior liens. When payments are not received by their contractual due date, collection efforts begin on the 11th day of delinquency with a telephone contact. If the borrower is non-responsive or the loan officer feels more stringent action may be required, the Chief Credit Officer is consulted. Notices of default are generally filed when the loan has become 30-90 days past due. Credit Risk and Loan Review We incur credit risk whenever we extend credit to, or enter into other transactions with, our customers. The risks associated with extensions of credit include general risk, which is inherent in the lending business, and risk specific to individual borrowers. Loan review and other loan monitoring practices provide a means for our management to ascertain whether proper credit, underwriting and loan documentation policies, procedures and practices are being followed by our loan officers and are being applied uniformly throughout our bank. The Chief Risk Officer oversees the daily administration of loan review. The Chief Credit Officer and Assistant Chief Credit Officer approve loan officer requests for changes in risk ratings. In 2006 our bank hired an Internal Loan Review Officer who reviews each profit center’s loan operations on an annual basis and each loan over $5.0 million. Loan officers are responsible for continually grading their loans so that individual credits properly reflect the risk inherent therein. On an annual basis, our Board of Directors provides for a third-party outside loan review of all loans that meet certain criteria originated since the previous review. While we continue to review these and other related functional areas, there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to date will be sufficient to enable us to identify, measure, monitor and control all credit risk. Concentrations of Credit Our primary investment is in loans, 94% of which are secured by real estate. Therefore, although we monitor the real estate loan portfolio on a regular basis to avoid undue concentrations to a single borrower or type of real estate collateral, real estate in general is considered a concentration of investment. We seek to mitigate this risk by requiring each borrower to have a certain amount of equity in the real estate at the time of origination, depending on the type of real estate and the credit quality of the borrower. Trends in the market are monitored closely by management on a regular basis. Under state law, our ability to make aggregate secured loans-to-one-borrower is limited to 25% of unimpaired capital and surplus (as of December 31, 2006, this amount was $22.0 million). 11 Investment Activities Our investment policy, as established by our Board of Directors, attempts to provide for and maintain liquidity, generate a favorable return on investments without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk, and complement our lending activities. Our company's policies provide the authority to invest in bank-qualified securities. Our company's policies provide that all investment purchases, that are outside our policy guidelines, be approved by our Board of Directors or committee thereof. Purchases and sales under this limitation and within the guidelines of our policies may be completed at the discretion of our President, our Chief Financial Officer or our Chief Operating Officer. At December 31, 2006, we held $1.0 million in FNMA Mortgage-backed securities, $2.0 million in Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) stock, and $18.2 million in federal funds sold. Nonaccrual, Past Due and Restructured Loans Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”). We had $19.3 million of nonperforming loans as of December 31 2006, of which $10.3 million was guaranteed by the SBA, compared to $8.0 million of nonperforming loans as of December 31, 2005, of which $6.5 million was government guaranteed and $11.8 million of nonperforming loans as of December 31, 2004, of which $8.1 million was government guaranteed. There was $1.3 of OREO at December 31, 2006, of which $638 thousand was guaranteed by the SBA, compared to $2.1 million of OREO at December 31, 2005, of which $604 thousand was guaranteed by the SBA. Pursuant to SBA operating procedures, real estate collateral is liquidated when a loan becomes uncollectible. Should there be a shortfall in liquidation proceeds of an SBA guaranteed loan; the SBA will assume 75% - 85% of that shortfall. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans (after reducing for SBA guarantees) was 0.77%, 0.19%, and 0.69% for the years ended 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. We generally place a loan on nonaccrual status and cease accruing interest when loan payment performance is deemed unsatisfactory. All loans past due 90 days, however, are placed on nonaccrual status, unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. Cash payments received, while a loan is classified as nonaccrual, are recorded as a deduction of principal as long as doubt exists as to collection. We are sometimes required to revise a loan's interest rate or repayment terms in a troubled debt restructuring. We had no restructured loans as of December 31, 2006 or 2005. Restructured loans totaled $154 thousand at December 31, 2004. Our credit administration department regularly evaluates potential problem loans as to risk exposure to determine the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. We review collateral value on loans secured by real estate during the internal loan review process. New appraisals are acquired when loans are categorized as renewed, nonperforming or potential problem loans. In instances where updated appraisals reflect reduced collateral values, an evaluation of the borrower's overall financial condition is made to determine the need, if any, for possible write-downs or appropriate additions to our allowance for loan losses. 12 The following table presents information concerning nonaccrual loans, OREO, accruing loans which are contractually past due 90 days or more, as to interest or principal payments and still accruing, and restructured loans: December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 Gross Government Net Gross Government Net Balance Guaranteed Balance Balance Guaranteed Balance Nonaccrual loans (Gross): (dollars in thousands) Commercial $ 89 $ (44 ) $ 45 $ 2,259 $ (2,178 ) $ 81 Real Estate - Construction 5,942 - 5,942 - - - Real Estate - Other 13,093 (10,290 ) 2,803 5,692 (4,336 ) 1,356 Installment - - - - - - Total 19,124 (10,334 ) 8,790 7,951 (6,514 ) 1,437 OREO 1,255 (638 ) 617 2,111 (604 ) 1,507 Total nonaccrual loans and OREO $ 20,379 $ (10,972 ) $ 9,407 $ 10,062 $ (7,118 ) $ 2,944 Gross nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans 1.67 % 1.06 % Gross nonaccrual loans and OREO as a percentage of total loans and OREO 1.78 % 1.34 % Allowance for loan losses to total net loans (including held-for-sale) 1.10 % 1.20 % Allowance for loan losses to total net loans (excluding held-for-sale) 1.29 % 1.35 % Allowance for loan losses to gross nonaccrual loans 65.48 % 113.69 % Loans past due 90 days or more on accrual status: Commercial $ 26 $ - Real Estate 114 - Installment - - Total $ 140 $ - The table below summarizes the approximate changes in gross nonaccrual loans for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in thousands) Balance, beginning of the year $ 7,951 $ 11,799 $ 6,675 Loans placed on nonaccrual 15,265 3,840 5,293 Charge-offs (381 ) (540 ) (1,097 ) Loans returned to accrual status (3,936 ) (6,586 ) - Repayments (including interest applied to principal) 2,356 1,920 2,338 Transfers to OREO (2,131 ) (2,482 ) (1,410 ) Balance, end of year $ 19,124 $ 7,951 $ 11,799 The additional interest income that would have been recorded from nonaccrual loans if the loans had not been on nonaccrual status, was $2.0 million, $898 thousand, and $549 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied to principal, unless there is no doubt as to ultimate full repayment of principal, in which case, the interest payment is recognized as interest income. Interest income not recognized on nonaccrual loans reduced the net interest margin by 22 basis points, 14 basis points, and 12 basis points for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Other Real Estate Owned Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) was $1.3 million at December 31, 2006, of which $638 thousand was guaranteed by the SBA, compared $2.1 million at December 31, 2005, of which $604 thousand was guaranteed by the SBA, and $303 thousand at December 31, 2004, of which $227 thousand was guaranteed by the SBA. Our policy is to record these properties at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, net of selling expenses, at the time they are transferred into OREO, thereby tying future gains or losses from sale or potential additional write-downs to underlying changes in the market. Potential Problem Loans At December 31, 2006, in addition to loans disclosed above as past due, nonaccrual or restructured, management also identified $9.3 million of additional classified loans, net of SBA guaranteed loans, where the ability to comply with the present loan payment terms in the future is questionable. However, the inability of the borrowers to comply with repayment terms was not sufficiently probable to place these loans on nonaccrual status at December 31, 2006. This amount was determined based on analysis of information known to management about the borrowers' financial condition and current economic conditions. Estimated potential losses from these potential problem loans have been provided for in determining the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2006. Our management's classification of credits as nonaccrual, restructured or problems does not necessarily indicate that the principal is uncollectible in whole or part. 13 Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses which is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses. Based on an evaluation of our loan portfolio, management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for loan losses to our Board of Directors, indicating any change in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments. In making our evaluation, we consider the diversification by industry of our commercial loan portfolio, the effect of changes in the local real estate market on collateral values, the results of recent regulatory examinations, the effects on the loan portfolio of current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers, the amount of charge-offs for the period, the amount of nonperforming loans and related collateral security, and the evaluation of our loan portfolio through our loan review function. A charge-off occurs when a loan is deemed to be uncollectible. We establish specific allowances for loans which management believes require reserves greater than those allocated according to their classification or delinquent status as prescribed in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 114, “Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan”, as amended by SFAS No. 118, “Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan - Income Recognition and Disclosures”. The amount of the specific allocation is based on the estimated value of the collateral securing the loans and other analyses pertinent to each situation. Loans are identified for specific allowances from information provided by several sources including asset classification, third party reviews, delinquency reports, periodic updates to financial statements, public records, and industry reports. All loan types are subject to specific allowances once identified as impaired or nonperforming. Additionally, we use two approaches for the analysis of the performing portfolio: general factors and historical losses. These methods are further broken down into identified loan pools within our portfolio. Using these methodologies, we provide loss allocations to each identified loan classification and to performing loan pools. All pools are evaluated by both methods. We then charge to operations a provision for loan loss to maintain the allowance for loan losses at the level determined by the foregoing methodology. We follow a loan review program to evaluate credit risk in our loan portfolio. Through the loan review process, we maintain an internally classified loan watch list, which, along with the delinquency list of loans, helps us assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and our allowance for loan losses. Loans classified as "substandard" are those loans with clear and defined weaknesses such as a highly leveraged position, unfavorable financial ratios, uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition, which may jeopardize ultimate recoverability of the debt. Loans classified as "doubtful" are those loans that have characteristics similar to substandard loans but with an increased risk that a loss may occur, or at least a portion of the loan may require a charge-off if liquidated at present. Although loans classified as substandard do not duplicate loans classified as doubtful, both substandard and doubtful loans include some loans that are delinquent at least 30 days or on nonaccrual status. In addition to loans on the internal watch list classified as substandard or doubtful, we maintain additional classifications on a separate watch list which further aids us in monitoring loan portfolios. These additional loan classifications reflect warning elements where the present status portrays one or more deficiencies that require attention in the short-term or where pertinent ratios of the loan account have weakened to a point where more frequent monitoring is warranted. These loans do not have all of the characteristics of a classified loan (substandard, doubtful) but do show weakened elements as compared with those of a satisfactory credit. We regularly review these loans to aid in assessing our allowance for loan losses. The economy of our market areas remains somewhat dependent on real estate and related industries (i.e. construction, housing). While we maintain a reasonably diverse commercial and consumer loan portfolio, any major downturn in real estate or construction could have an adverse effect on borrowers' ability to repay loans and, therefore, could potentially affect our results of operations and financial condition. Consequently, in evaluating our allowance for loan losses, management incorporates, among many other factors, the effect on borrowers of an economic downturn in the real estate related industries, the diversification of the loan portfolio, and economic indicators and conditions. Additionally, we have several procedures in place to assist us in minimizing credit risk and maintaining the overall quality of our loan portfolio. We frequently review and update our underwriting guidelines and monitor our delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends. 14 The provision for loan loss is the amount expensed and added to the allowance for loan losses. The allowance is kept at a level that is determined by a quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio and represents the probable incurred credit losses in the portfolio. Examples of inherent risks in the loan portfolio include the quality of the loans, the concentrations of credit by collateral and industries, our bank's lending staff and policies, and external factors such as economic conditions. The following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for loan losses for the five years ended December 31, 2006: Allowance for Loan Losses Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 (dollars in thousands) Loans outstanding and loans held-for-sale $ 1,142,693 $ 753,246 $ 530,196 $ 360,749 $ 268,409 Average amount of loans outstanding 922,264 634,731 446,493 318,600 284,849 Balance of allowance for loan losses, beginning of years 9,039 6,362 3,608 3,017 1,239 Loans charged off: Commercial (208 ) (250 ) (986 ) (464 ) (338 ) Real Estate - Construction (10 ) - - - - Real Estate - Other (159 ) (286 ) (105 ) (37 ) (354 ) Consumer (4 ) (4 ) (6 ) (4 ) (15 ) Total loans charged off $ (381 ) $ (540 ) $ (1,097 ) $ (505 ) $ (707 ) Recoveries of loans previously charged off: Commercial 202 281 23 19 11 Real Estate - Construction 10 - - - - Real Estate - Other 1 39 3 33 3 Consumer 1 - 4 22 11 Total recoveries $ 214 $ 320 $ 30 $ 74 $ 25 Net loans charged off (167 ) (220 ) (1,067 ) (431 ) (682 ) Provision for Loan loss expense 3,650 2,897 3,821 1,022 2,460 Balance, end of year $ 12,522 $ 9,039 $ 6,362 $ 3,608 $ 3,017 The following table describes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among various categories of loans and certain other information for the dates indicated. The allocation is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the categories in which future losses may occur. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of loans. 15 At the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Allowance Amount % of Allowance to Total Amount % in Loans in Each Category to Total Loans Allowance Amount % of Allowance to Total Amount % in Loans in Each Category to Total Loans (dollars in thousands) Commercial $ 658 5.3 % 5.2 % $ 254 2.8 % 3.4 % Real Estate 2,159 17.2 % 25.7 % 2,027 22.4 % 32.7 % Construction/Land Development 5,658 45.2 % 49.8 % 4,253 47.1 % 50.7 % Mortgage - 0.0 % 0.0 % - 0.0 % 0.0 % SBA 4,008 32.0 % 19.1 % 2,462 27.2 % 12.6 % Consumer & Other 39 0.3 % 0.2 % 43 0.5 % 0.6 % Total $ 12,522 100.0 % 100.0 % $ 9,039 100.0 % 100.0 % At the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 Allowance Amount % of Allowance to Total Amount % in Loans in Each Category to Total Loans Allowance Amount % of Allowance to Total Amount % in Loans in Each Category to Total Loans (dollars in thousands) Commercial $ 178 2.8 % 3.1 % $ 154 4.3 % 6.5 % Real Estate 1,590 25.0 % 36.4 % 655 18.2 % 33.4 % Construction/Land Development 1,958 30.7 % 38.0 % 589 16.3 % 31.2 % Mortgage - 0.0 % 0.4 % - 0.0 % 0.7 % SBA 2,612 41.1 % 21.6 % 2,184 60.5 % 27.3 % Consumer & Other 24 0.4 % 0.5 % 26 0.7 % 0.9 % Total $ 6,362 100.0 % 100.0 % $ 3,608 100.0 % 100.0 % At the Year Ended December 31, 2002 Allowance Amount % of Allowance to Total Amount % in Loans in Each Category to Total Loans (dollars in thousands) Commercial $ 172 5.7 % 9.1 % Real Estate 667 22.1 % 35.9 % Construction/Land Development 391 13.0 % 22.4 % Mortgage - 0.0 % 2.8 % SBA 1,741 57.7 % 28.2 % Consumer & Other 46 1.5 % 1.6 % Total $ 3,017 100.0 % 100.0 % The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of net loans outstanding and loans held-for-sale was 1.10% as of December 31, 2006, and 1.20% as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of net loans outstanding, excluding loans held-for-sale, was 1.29% as of December 31, 2006, 1.35% as of December 31 2005, and 1.29% as of December 31, 2004. As a result of past decreases in local and regional real estate values and the significant losses experienced by many financial institutions, there has been a greater level of scrutiny by regulatory authorities of the loan portfolios of financial institutions undertaken as a part of the examinations of such institutions by banking regulators. While we believe we have established our existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, there can be no assurance that regulators, in reviewing our loan portfolio, will not request that we increase significantly our allowance for loan losses. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that substantial increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 16 Deposits We offer a variety of deposit accounts, having a wide range of interest rates and terms, consisting of demand, savings, money market, and time accounts. We rely primarily on competitive pricing policies, customer service, and referrals to attract and retain these deposits. The daily average balances and weighted average rates paid on deposits and other borrowings for each of the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 are represented below.

Supervision and Regulation Bank holding companies and banks are extensively regulated under state and federal law. The following is a brief summary of certain statutes and rules that affect or will affect our company and our bank. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute and regulatory provisions referred to below and is not intended to be an exhaustive description of all applicable statutes and regulations. As a bank holding company, our company principally is subject to Federal Reserve regulations. We are required to file with the Federal Reserve quarterly and annual reports and such additional information the Federal Reserve may require pursuant to the BHCA. The Federal Reserve may conduct examinations of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Under a policy of the Federal Reserve, with respect to bank holding company operations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so absent such a policy. The Federal Reserve, under the BHCA, also has the authority to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or to relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary (other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank) upon the Federal Reserve's determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company. The Federal Reserve may also prohibit our company, except in certain instances prescribed by statute, from acquiring or engaging in nonbanking activities, other than activities that are deemed by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. See "Recent and Proposed Legislation" in this Section. In addition, insured depository institutions under common control are required to reimburse the FDIC for any loss suffered by its deposit insurance funds as a result of the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled insured depository institution in danger of default. The FDIC may decline to enforce the cross-guarantee provisions if it determines that a waiver is in the best interest of the deposit insurance funds. The FDIC's claim for damages is superior to claims of stockholders of the insured depository institution or its holding company but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt (other than affiliates) of the commonly controlled insured depository institutions. As a California state-chartered bank, we are subject to supervision, periodic examination and regulation by the California Department of Financial Institutions (“DFI”) and the Federal Reserve Bank. Our bank's deposits are insured (presently $100,000 per account; $250,000 in the case of certain retirement accounts) by the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") which is operated by the FDIC. As a result of this deposit insurance function, the FDIC also has certain supervisory authority and powers over our bank as well as all other FDIC insured institutions. If, as a result of an examination of our bank, the regulators should determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of our bank's operations are unsatisfactory or that our bank or our management is violating or has violated any law or regulation, various remedies are available to the regulators. Such remedies include the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in capital, to restrict growth, to assess civil monetary penalties, to remove officers and directors and ultimately to request the FDIC to terminate our bank's deposit insurance. Our bank has never been subject to any such enforcement action. Our bank is also subject to certain provisions of California law. 18 Because California permits commercial banks chartered by the state to engage in any activity permissible for national banks, our bank can form subsidiaries to engage in activates “closely related to banking” or “nonbanking” activities and expanded financial activities. However, to form a financial subsidiary, our bank must be well capitalized and would be subject to the same capital deduction, risk management and affiliate transaction rules as applicable to national banks. Generally, a financial subsidiary is permitted to engage in activities that are “financial in nature” or incidental thereto, even though they are not permissible for the national bank to conduct directly within the bank. The definition of “financial in nature” includes, among other items, underwriting, dealing in or making a market in securities, including, for example, distributing shares of mutual funds. The subsidiary may not, however, engage as principal in underwriting insurance (other than credit life insurance), issue annuities or engage in real estate development or investment or merchant banking. Presently, our bank does not have any subsidiaries. Various requirements and restrictions under the laws of the United States affect the operations of our bank. Statutes and regulations relate to many aspects of our bank's operations, including reserves against deposits, ownership of deposit accounts, interest rates payable on deposits, loans, investments, mergers and acquisitions, borrowings, dividends, locations of branch offices and capital requirements. Further, our bank is required to maintain certain levels of capital. See "Capital Adequacy Requirements" in this Section below. Recent and Proposed Legislation From time to time, legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks and other financial institutions are frequently made in Congress, in the California legislature and by various bank regulatory agencies. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”), was signed into law to address corporate governance and accounting oversight matters of companies whose securities are registered under the Securities Exchange Act. SOX established the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”), a new accounting oversight board that enforces auditing standards and restricts the scope of services that accounting firms may provide to their public company audit clients. SOX addresses accounting oversight and corporate governance matters, including: · required executive certification of financial presentations · increased requirements for board audit committees and their members · enhanced disclosure of controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting · enhanced controls on, and reporting of, insider trading · increased penalties for financial crimes and forfeiture of executive bonuses in certain circumstances · the prohibition of accounting firms from providing various types of consulting services to public clients and requiring accounting firms to rotate partners among public client assignments every five years. As with most other companies that are required to comply with SOX, we have incurred, and will in the future incur, significant costs as a result of its compliance efforts. Such costs and efforts, however, are not expected to have a material adverse effect upon our financial results. USA PATRIOT Act The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (“USA PATRIOT Act”) and its implementing regulations significantly expanded the anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws. Under the USA PATRIOT Act, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships as well as enhanced due diligence and "know your customer" standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. For example, the enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls generally require financial institutions to take reasonable steps · to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and report any suspicious transaction · to determine the identity of the nominal and beneficial owners of, and the source of funds deposited into, each account as needed to guard against money laundering and report any suspicious transactions · to determine for any foreign bank, the shares of which are not publicly traded, the identity of the owners of the foreign bank and the nature and extent of the ownership interest of each such owner · to determine whether any foreign bank provides correspondent accounts to other foreign banks and, if so, the identity of those foreign banks and related due diligence information Under the USA PATRIOT Act, financial institutions are required to establish and maintain anti-money laundering programs which include: · the establishment of a customer identification program · the development of internal policies, procedures, and controls · the designation of a compliance officer · an ongoing employee training program · an independent audit function to test the programs 19 Our Board of Directors of our Bank has adopted comprehensive policies and procedures to address the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act. Compliance has not had a material adverse effect upon us and it is not expected that future compliance will cause this to change. This area has been a particular focus for federal regulators and material deficiencies in anti-money laundering compliance can result in public enforcement actions by the banking agencies, including the imposition of civil money penalties and supervisory restrictions on growth and expansion. Such actions could have serious reputation consequence for our company and our bank. Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations Our bank is subject to many federal and state consumer protection statutes and regulations, some of which are discussed below. Examination and enforcement by the bank regulatory agencies in these areas has in the recent past intensified. Privacy policies are required by federal banking regulations which limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. Pursuant to those rules, financial institutions must provide: · initial notices to customers about their privacy policies, describing the conditions under which they may disclose nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates; · annual notices of their privacy policies to current customers; and · a reasonable method for customers to “opt out” of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties. These privacy protections affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, state laws may impose more restrictive limitations on the ability of financial institution to disclose such information. California has adopted such a privacy law that among other things generally provides that customers must “opt in” before information may be disclosed to certain nonaffiliated third parties. The Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, or “FACT Act”, requires financial firms to help deter identity theft, including developing appropriate fraud response programs, and gives consumers more control of their credit data. It also reauthorizes a federal ban on state laws that interfere with corporate credit granting and marketing practices. In connection with the FACT Act, financial institution regulatory agencies proposed rules that would prohibit an institution from using certain information about a consumer it received from an affiliate to make a solicitation to the consumer, unless the consumer has been notified and given a chance to opt out of such solicitations. A consumer’s election to opt out would be applicable for at least five years. The Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, or “Check 21”, facilitates check truncation and electronic check exchange by authorizing a new negotiable instrument called a “substitute check,” which is the legal equivalent of an original check. Check 21 does not require banks to create substitute checks or accept checks electronically; however, it does require banks to accept a legally equivalent substitute check in place of an original. In addition to its issuance of regulations governing substitute checks, the Federal Reserve has issued final rules governing the treatment of remotely created checks (sometimes referred to as “demand drafts”) and electronic check conversion transactions (involving checks that are converted to electronic transactions by merchants and other payees). 20 The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, or “ECOA”, generally prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction, whether for consumer or business purposes, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (except in limited circumstances), receipt of income from public assistance programs, or good faith exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The Truth in Lending Act, or “TILA”, is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably. As a result of the TILA, all creditors must use the same credit terminology to express rates and payments, including the annual percentage rate, the finance charge, the amount financed, the total of payments and the payment schedule, among other things. The Fair Housing Act, or “FH Act”, regulates many practices, including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or familial status. A number of lending practices have been found by the courts to be, or may be considered, illegal under the FH Act, including some that are not specifically mentioned in the FH Act itself. The Community Reinvestment Act, or “CRA”, is intended to encourage insured depository institutions, while operating safely and soundly, to help meet the credit needs of their communities. The CRA specifically directs the federal regulatory agencies, in examining insured depository institutions, to assess a bank’s record of helping meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound banking practices. The CRA further requires the agencies to take a financial institution’s record of meeting its community credit needs into account when evaluating applications for, among other things, domestic branches, mergers or acquisitions, or holding company formations. The agencies use the CRA assessment factors to provide a rating to the financial institution. The ratings range from a high of “outstanding” to a low of “substantial noncompliance.” In our last examination for CRA compliance as of May 2004, our bank was rated “satisfactory.” The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, or “HMDA”, grew out of public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods and provides public information that will help show whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located. The HMDA also includes a “fair lending” aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti-discrimination statutes. The Federal Reserve Board amended regulations issued under HMDA to require the reporting of certain pricing data with respect to higher priced mortgage loans for review by federal banking agencies from a fair lending perspective. We do not expect that the HMDA data report will raise material issues regarding our compliance with the fair lending laws. The term “predatory lending,” covers a potentially broad range of behavior. Typically, predatory lending involves at least one, and perhaps all three, of the following elements: · making unaffordable loans based on the assets of the borrower rather than on the borrower’s ability to repay an obligation (“asset-based lending”) · inducing a borrower to refinance a loan repeatedly in order to charge high points and fees each time the loan is refinanced (“loan flipping”) · engaging in fraud or deception to conceal the true nature of the loan obligation from an unsuspecting or unsophisticated borrower. FRB regulations aimed at curbing such lending significantly widen the pool of high-cost home-secured loans covered by the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994, or “HOEPA”, a federal law that requires extra disclosures and consumer protections to borrowers. Lenders that violate the rules face cancellation of loans and penalties equal to the finance charges paid. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, or “RESPA”, requires lenders to provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements. Also, RESPA prohibits certain abusive practices, such as kickbacks, and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts. Penalties under the above laws may include fines, reimbursements and other penalties. Due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with the FACT Act, ECOA, TILA, FH Act, CRA, HMDA, HOEPA, and RESPA generally, we may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in its local community. 21 Guidance on Nontraditional Mortgage Products In September 2006, the federal banking agencies issued final guidance on residential mortgage products that allow borrowers to defer repayment of principal and sometimes interest, including “interest only” mortgage loans, and “payment option” adjustable rate mortgages where a borrower has flexible payment options, including payments that have the potential for negative amortization. While acknowledging that innovations in mortgage lending can benefit some consumers, the final guidance states that management should: · assess a borrower’s ability to repay the loan, including any balances added through negative amortization, at the fully indexed rate that would apply after the introductory period · recognize that certain nontraditional mortgages are untested in a stressed environment and warrant strong risk management standards as well as appropriate capital and loan loss reserves · ensure that borrowers have sufficient information to clearly understand loan terms and associated risks before making a product or payment choice. We believe our products and disclosures are in conformance with the requirements of the guidance. Safety and Soundness Standards In addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions, commercial banking organizations may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal and/or state regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law, rule, regulation, or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency. Finally, pursuant to an interagency agreement, the FDIC can examine any institution that has a substandard regulatory examination score or is considered undercapitalized without the express permission of the institution’s primary regulator. The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines set forth operational and managerial standards relating to: · internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems · loan documentation · credit underwriting · asset growth · earnings · compensation, fees and benefits. In addition, the federal banking agencies have also adopted safety and soundness guidelines with respect to asset quality and earnings standards. These guidelines provide six standards for establishing and maintaining a system to identify problem assets and prevent those assets from deteriorating. Under these standards, an insured depository institution should: · conduct periodic asset quality reviews to identify problem assets · estimate the inherent losses in problem assets and establish reserves that are sufficient to absorb estimated losses · compare problem asset totals to capital · take appropriate corrective action to resolve problem assets · consider the size and potential risks of material asset concentrations · provide periodic asset quality reports with adequate information for management and the board of directors to assess the level of asset risk. These guidelines also set forth standards for evaluating and monitoring earnings and for ensuring that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves. In December 2006, the federal banking agencies issued final guidance to reinforce sound risk management practices for bank holding companies and banks in commercial real estate (“CRE”) loans. The guidance establishes CRE concentration thresholds as criteria for examiners to identify CRE concentration that may warrant further analysis. The implementation of these guidelines could result in increased reserves and capital costs for banks with “CRE concentration”. We believe that our CRE portfolio as of December 31, 2006 does not have the risks associated with high CRE concentration due to mitigating factors, including low loan-to-value ratios, adequate debt coverage ratios, and a wide variety of property types. 22 Pending Legislation Changes to federal and state laws and regulations (including changes in interpretation or enforcement) can affect the operating environment of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways. From time to time, various legislative and regulatory proposals are introduced. These proposals, if codified, may change banking statutes and regulations and our company’s operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. If codified, these proposals could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions and other financial institutions. We cannot accurately predict whether those changes in laws and regulations will occur, and, if those changes occur, the ultimate effect they would have upon our financial condition or results of operations. It is likely, however, that the current high level of enforcement and compliance-related activities of federal and state authorities will continue and potentially increase. Capital Adequacy Requirements The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations establishing minimum requirements for capital adequacy. These agencies may establish higher minimum requirements if, for example, a bank or company previously has received special attention or has a high susceptibility to interest rate risk. Under Federal Reserve regulations, the minimum ratio of total capital to risk-adjusted assets is 8%. At least half of the total capital is required to be "Tier I capital," principally consisting of common stockholders' equity, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock, less certain goodwill items. The remainder ("Tier II capital") may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt, certain hybrid capital instruments and other debt securities, perpetual preferred stock, and a limited amount of the allowance for loan loss. In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the Federal Reserve has adopted a minimum Tier I capital (leverage) ratio, under which a bank holding company must maintain a minimum level of Tier I capital to average total consolidated assets of at least 3% in the case of a bank holding company which has the highest regulatory examination rating and is not contemplating significant growth or expansion. All other bank holding companies are expected to maintain a Tier I capital (leverage) ratio of at least 1% to 2% above the stated minimum. As of December 31, 2006, our company's capital ratios were as follows: · Tier I leverage ratio was 11.42% · Tier I risk-based ratio was 10.93% · Total risk-based ratio was 12.40% As of December 31, 2006, our bank’s capital ratios were as follows: · Tier I leverage ratio was 11.16% · Tier I risk-based ratio was 10.66% · Total risk-based ratio was 11.67% The current risk-based capital guidelines are based upon the 1988 capital accord of the International Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. A new international accord, referred to as Basel II, which emphasizes internal assessment of credit, market and operational risk, supervisory assessment and market discipline in determining minimum capital requirements, currently becomes mandatory for large international banks outside the U.S. in 2008. In October 2006, the U.S. federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for comment to implement Basel II for U.S. banks with certain differences from the international Basel II framework and which would not be fully in effect for U.S. banks until 2012. Further, the U.S. banking agencies propose to retain the minimum leverage requirement and prompt corrective action regulatory standards. In December 2006, the federal banking agencies issued another notice of proposed rulemaking for comment, referred to as Basel IA, that proposed alternative capital requirements for smaller U.S. banks which may be negatively impacted competitively by certain provisions of Basel II. Additional guidance on Basel II issued in February 2007 stated the agencies' expectation that to determine the extent to which banks should hold capital in excess of regulatory minimum levels, examiners would look at the combined implications of a bank's compliance with qualification requirements for regulatory risk-based capital standards, the quality and results of the bank's internal capital adequacy assessment process, and the examiners' assessment of the bank's risk profile and capital position. At this time the impact that proposed changes in capital requirements may have on the cost and availability of different types of credit and the potential compliance cost to us of implementing Basel II or Basel IA, as applicable, are uncertain. 23 The federal banking regulators are required to take "prompt corrective action" with respect to capital-deficient institutions. Agency regulations define, for each capital category, the levels at which institutions are "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "under capitalized," "significantly under capitalized" and "critically under capitalized." A "well capitalized" bank has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or higher; a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or higher; a leverage ratio of 5.0% or higher; and is not subject to any written agreement, order or directive requiring it to maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. An "adequately capitalized" bank has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or higher; a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 4.0% or higher; a leverage ratio of 4.0% or higher (3.0% or higher if the bank was rated a composite 1 in its most recent examination report and is not experiencing significant growth); and does not meet the criteria for a well capitalized bank. A bank is "under capitalized" if it fails to meet any one of the ratios required to be adequately capitalized. In addition to requiring undercapitalized institutions to submit a capital restoration plan, agency regulations contain broad restrictions on certain activities of undercapitalized institutions including asset growth, acquisitions, branch establishment and expansion into new lines of business. With certain exceptions, an insured depository institution is prohibited from making capital distributions, including dividends, and is prohibited from paying management fees to control persons if the institution would be undercapitalized after any such distribution or payment. As an institution's capital decreases, the federal agency's enforcement powers become more severe. A significantly undercapitalized institution is subject to mandated capital raising activities, restrictions on interest rates paid and transactions with affiliates, removal of management, and other restrictions. A federal agency has only very limited discretion in dealing with a critically undercapitalized institution and is virtually required to appoint a receiver or conservator. Banks with risk-based capital and leverage ratios below the required minimums may also be subject to certain administrative actions, including the termination of deposit insurance upon notice and hearing, or a temporary suspension of insurance without a hearing in the event the institution has no tangible capital. Our bank was “well capitalized” according to the guidelines discussed above, as of December 31, 2006. Deposit Insurance Assessments Our bank's deposits are insured (presently $100,000 per depositor; $250,000 in the case of certain retirement accounts) by the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") which is operated by the FDIC. FDIC insured depository institutions pay insurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification. Institutions assigned to higher-risk classifications (that is, institutions that pose a greater risk of loss to their respective deposit insurance funds) pay assessments at higher rates than institutions that pose a lower risk. An institution's risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to the regulators. In addition, the FDIC can impose special assessments in certain instances. We pay an assessment fee to the FDIC for deposit insurance protection. This assessment fee is required for all FDIC-insured banks for the payment of interest on bonds that were issued by the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) as a means of capitalizing the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. These bonds are commonly known as FICO bonds. The current range if DIF assessments are (not including FICO bond assessments) between 0.05% and 0.43% per $100 of domestic deposits. The rate for our bank was 0.0% for 2006, 2005, and 2004. The assessment for the fourth quarter of 2006 was 1.24 basis points for each $100 of assessable deposits. We paid $98 thousand of FDIC assessments in 2006, $75 thousand in 2005, and $58 thousand in 2004. The FDIC is authorized to terminate a depository institution's deposit insurance upon a finding by the FDIC that the institution's financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution's regulatory agency. On November 2, 2006, the FDIC finalized a rule intended to match an institution's deposit insurance premium to the risk an institution poses to the deposit insurance fund. The final regulations adopt a new base schedule of rates that the FDIC Board could adjust up or down, depending on the revenue needs of the insurance fund. The base rates range from 2 to 4 basis points for healthy banks, based on supervisory ratings and financial ratios, and debt ratings for large banks. The new assessment rates will be effective on January 1, 2007 and will vary between five and seven cents per $100 of domestic deposits. We anticipate an increase in the amount we will pay for deposit insurance of approximately $295 thousand during 2007. The Reform Act provides for the following changes: 24 · Merging the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) into a new fund, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). This change was made effective March 31, 2006. · Increasing the coverage limit for retirement accounts to $250,000 and indexing the coverage limit for retirement accounts to inflation as with the general deposit insurance coverage limit. This change was made effective April 1, 2006. · Establishing a range of 1.15 percent to 1.50 percent within which the FDIC Board of Directors may set the Designated Reserve Ratio (DRR). · Allowing the FDIC to manage the pace at which the reserve ratio varies within this range. 1. If the reserve ratio falls below 1.15 percent—or is expected to within 6 months—the FDIC must adopt a restoration plan that provides that the DIF will return to 1.15 percent generally within 5 years. 2. If the reserve ratio exceeds 1.35 percent, the FDIC must generally dividend to DIF members half of the amount above the amount necessary to maintain the DIF at 1.35 percent, unless the FDIC Board, considering statutory factors, suspends the dividends. 3. If the reserve ratio exceeds 1.5 percent, the FDIC must generally dividend to DIF members all amounts above the amount necessary to maintain the DIF at 1.5 percent. · Eliminating the restrictions on premium rates based on the DRR and granting the FDIC Board the discretion to price deposit insurance according to risk for all insured institutions regardless of the level of the reserve ratio. · Granting a one-time initial assessment credit (of approximately $4.7 billion) to recognize institutions' past contributions to the fund. Change in Control The BHCA prohibits our company from acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting securities or substantially all the assets of any bank or savings bank, or merging or consolidations with another bank holding company or savings bank holding company, without prior approval of the Federal Reserve. Similarly, Federal Reserve approval (or in certain cases, nondisapproval) must be obtained before any person acquiring control of a bank holding company. Control is conclusively presumed to exist if, among other things, a person acquires more that 25% of any class of voting stock of our company or controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of our company. Control is presumed to exist if a person acquires more that 10% of any class of voting stock and the stock is registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act or the acquirer will be the largest stockholder after the acquisition. Examinations The Federal Reserve, through the BHCA, has the authority to examine and evaluate our company and its subsidiaries. The DFI and the FDIC periodically examine and evaluate non-member state-chartered banks, including our bank. These examinations review areas such as capital adequacy, allowance for loan losses, loan portfolio quality and management, consumer and other compliance issues, investments and management practices. In addition to these regular examinations, we are required to furnish quarterly and annual reports to the FDIC and the Federal Reserve. The FDIC and the DFI may exercise cease and desist or other supervisory powers if actions represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law. Further, any proposed addition of any individual to the board of directors of a bank or the employment of any individual as a senior executive officer of a bank, or the change in responsibility of such an officer, will be subject to prior written notice to the FDIC if a bank is not in compliance with the applicable minimum capital requirements, is otherwise a troubled institution or the FDIC determines that such prior notice is appropriate for a bank. The FDIC then has the opportunity to disapprove any such appointment. Federal Securities Law Our company has registered its common stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission (" SEC") under the Exchange Act. As a result, the proxy and tender offer rules, insider trading reporting requirements, corporate governance, annual and periodic reporting and other requirements of the Exchange Act are applicable to our company. 25 Transactions with Insiders and Affiliates Depository institutions are subject to the restrictions contained in Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act with respect to loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders. Under Section 22(h), loans to directors, executive officers and stockholders who own more than 10% of a depository institution and certain affiliated entities of any of the foregoing, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated entities, the institution's loans-to-one-borrower limit (as discussed below). Section 22(h) also prohibits loans above amounts prescribed by the appropriate federal banking agency to directors, executive officers, and stockholders who own more than 10% of an institution, and their respective affiliates, unless such loans are approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the institution. Any "interested" director may not participate in the voting. The prescribed loan amount (which includes all other outstanding loans to such person), as to which such prior board of director approval is required, is the greater of $25,000 or 5% of capital and surplus (up to $500,000). Further, pursuant to Section 22(h), the Federal Reserve requires that loans to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions with non-executive employees of the bank. There are additional limits on the amount a bank can loan to an executive officer. Transactions between a bank and its "affiliates" are quantitatively and qualitatively restricted under the Federal Reserve Act. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act applies Sections 23A and 23B to insured nonmember banks, including our bank, in the same manner and to the same extent as if they were members of the Federal Reserve System. Regulation W incorporates the exemption from the affiliate transaction rules but expands the exemption to cover the purchase of any type of loan or extension of credit from an affiliate. Affiliates of a bank include, among other entities, the bank’s holding company and companies that are under common control with the bank. Our company is considered to be an affiliate of our bank. Regulation W incorporates the exemption from the affiliate transaction rules but expands the exemption to cover the purchase of any type of loan or extension of credit from an affiliate. Affiliates of a bank include, among other entities, the bank's holding company and companies that are under common control with the bank. Our company is considered to be an affiliate of our bank. Monetary Policy The monetary policies of regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant effect on the operating results of banks. The Federal Reserve supervises and regulates the national supply of bank credit. Among the means available to the Federal Reserve to regulate the supply of bank credit are open market purchases and sales of U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on borrowings from the Federal Reserve, and changes in reserve requirements with respect to deposits. These activities are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments, and deposits on a national basis and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits. Federal Reserve monetary policies and the fiscal policies of the federal government have materially affected the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. We cannot predict the nature of future monetary and fiscal policies and the effect of such policies on our future business and earnings. Subsidiaries Our bank is a subsidiary of our company. In June 2002, our company formed Temecula Valley Statutory Trust I, a Connecticut statutory trust, for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities. In September 2003, our company formed Temecula Valley Statutory Trust II, a Connecticut statutory trust, for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities. In September 2004, our company formed Temecula Valley Statutory Trust III, a Delaware statutory trust, for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities. In September 2005, our company formed Temecula Valley Statutory Trust IV, a Delaware statutory trust, for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities. In September 2006, our company formed Temecula Valley Statutory Trust V, a Delaware statutory trust, for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities. Employees As of December 31, 2006, we had 317 employees (312 full time equivalent), of which 299 are full time. Approximately one third of our employees are directly involved in the origination, underwriting, and processing of SBA loans. Additional support staff is required to service the SBA loans after they are funded. There are no employees at our company. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. 26 Available Information We do not make available on our website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and proxy statements for our annual shareholders meetings, or the amendments to those reports, although there is a hyper-link at our website at www.temvalbank.com through the "SEC Filings" page to the SEC website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy statements, and other information regarding SEC registrants including our company.

ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS Risks Related to Our Business and Operations Our success has been built upon significant and profitable growth and we may not be able to sustain our profitable growth or our rate of growth or be able to support our growth, any of which events will adversely affect our profits and results of operations. We have experienced significant growth from $606.8 million in total assets and $534.8 million in total deposits at December 31, 2004 to $1.24 billion in total assets and $1.08 billion in total deposits at December 31, 2006. We expect to continue to experience growth in assets, deposits, and scale of operations. However, we do expect our levels of construction lending to taper off and intend to replace this business by increasing our commercial and industrial (“C&I”) loan portfolios. If the margins in C&I business are less than with construction lending, if our growth declines or if we do not manage our growth effectively, we will become less profitable, which will adversely affect our business and prospects. Our growth also subjects us to increased capital and operating needs. We must continue to recruit experienced individuals with the skills and experience to manage our growing business lines, but who may have no prior history with us. Our historical growth has caused us to update our policies and procedures in response to this growth, and our plans for continued growth will continue to place a significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources. We cannot guarantee that our policies will be adequate or that we will be able to recruit and train qualified individuals to implement our business strategy in a timely, cost effective and efficient manner. Our recent operating results may not be indicative of our future operating results. We may not be able to sustain our growth. Various factors, such as our increased size, economic conditions, decreased construction and SBA loan demand, governmental, regulatory and legislative considerations, competition and the ability to find and retain people that can make our community-focused operating model successful, may impede our ability to expand our market presence. If we experience a significant decrease in our growth rate, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Our dependence on loans secured by real estate subjects us to risks relating to fluctuations in the real estate market and related interest rates, environmental risks, and legislation that could result in significant additional costs and capital requirements that could adversely affect our assets and results of operations. A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate. Real estate served as the principal source of collateral with respect to approximately 94% and 95% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. Our markets have experienced a sharp increase in real estate values in recent years, in part as the result of historically low interest rates. During 2006, real estate markets in California and elsewhere experienced a slowdown in appreciation and in some cases a modest depreciation. A decline in economic conditions or rising interest rates could have an adverse effect on the demand for new loans, the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, the value of real estate and other collateral securing loans, and the value of real estate owned by us, as well as our financial condition and results of operations in general and the market value of our common stock. Acts of nature, including earthquakes and floods, which may cause uninsured damage and other loss of value to real estate that secures these loans, may also adversely affect our financial condition. 27 In the course of business, we may acquire, through foreclosure, properties securing loans that are in default. In commercial real estate lending, there is a risk that hazardous substances could be discovered on these properties. In this event, we might be required to remove these substances from the affected properties at our sole cost and expense. The cost of this removal could substantially exceed the value of affected properties. We may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties or could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In December 2006, banking regulators issued final guidance regarding high concentrations of real estate loans within bank lending portfolios. The guidance establishes commercial real estate (“CRE”) concentration thresholds as criteria for examiners to identify CRE concentration that may warrant further analysis. If we do not have appropriate risk management policies and practices in place, as a result of the final guidance, we may be subject to enhanced regulatory scrutiny and higher capital maintenance requirements. Our bank's concentration in real estate construction loans subjects it to risks such as inadequate security for repayment of those loans and fluctuations in the demand for those loans based on changes in the housing market. We have a high concentration in real estate construction loans. Approximately 50% and 51% of our lending portfolio was classified as real estate construction loans as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. Our real estate construction loans are based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the completed project. These estimates may be inaccurate. Construction lending involves additional risks when compared to permanent residential lending because funds are advanced upon the security of the project, which is of uncertain value prior to its completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to accurately determine the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. Construction lending also typically involves higher loan principal amounts and is often concentrated with a small number of builders. In addition, generally during the term of a construction loan, no payment from the borrower is required since the accumulated interest is added to the principal of the loan through an interest reserve. Construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds, with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or obtain permanent take-out financing, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If our appraisal of the value of the completed project proves to be overstated, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction and may incur a loss. Our ability to continue to originate a significant amount of construction loans is dependent on the continued strength of the housing market in the Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego County regions of Southern California and in the San Francisco Bay area. To the extent there is a decline in the demand for new housing in these communities, it is expected that the demand for construction loans would decline, our liquidity would substantially increase and our net income would be adversely affected. Our earnings are highly dependent on our continued ability to originate, sell and service SBA loans. Our earnings are highly dependent on our ability to generate new SBA loans, as our net income generated from our SBA activities is significant. Increases in interest rates and other economic conditions could result in decreased SBA loan demand as well as lower gains on sale. SBA lending is a federal government created and administered program. As such, legislative and regulatory developments can affect the availability and funding of the program. This dependence on legislative funding and regulatory restrictions from time to time causes limitations and uncertainties with regard to the continued funding of such loans, with a resulting potential adverse financial impact on our business. Currently, the maximum limit on individual 7(a) loans which the SBA will permit is $2 million. Any reduction in this level could adversely affect the volume of our business. Since our SBA business constitutes a significant portion of our lending program, our dependence on this government program and its periodic uncertainty relative to availability and amounts of funding creates greater risk for our business than do more stable aspects of our business. 28 Our new SBA purchase program is subject to governmental and management changes that could affect its success and operations. In April 2006, we began purchasing participations in unguaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans. At December 31, 2006, we have $120.3 million in outstanding participation balances. If the SBA program was discontinued or the SBA decided to stop funding the program, the participation purchase program would be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated. Additionally, the participation purchase program is highly dependent upon a management team experienced in the program. If our management from this program were to terminate employment with us, we could have a difficult time replacing them with qualified personnel and this may limit our growth and adversely affect the program and our results. We may incur additional costs and experience impaired operating results if we are unable to retain our key management or we are unable to attract and retain additional successful bankers in order to grow our business. Stephen H. Wacknitz has been the president and chief executive officer of our holding company and our bank since the inception of both entities. Mr. Wacknitz and our executive management team developed numerous aspects of our current business strategy, and the implementation of that strategy depends heavily upon the active involvement of Mr. Wacknitz and our executive management team. The loss of the services of Mr. Wacknitz or other senior officers who are part of our succession planning could adversely affect our business strategy and could cause us to incur additional costs and experience impaired operating results while we seek suitable replacements. Additionally, because our business model depends on hiring successful bankers that generally bring to us additional customers, if we are unsuccessful in continuing to attract and retain producers, our growth may be impaired and the results of our operations adversely affected. If our bank is unable to pay our holding company cash dividends to meet its cash obligations, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected. Dividends paid by our bank to our holding company provide cash flow used to service the interest payments on our trust preferred securities. Various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends our bank can pay to our holding company without regulatory approval. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of our bank and other factors, that the applicable regulatory authorities could assert that payment of dividends or other payments, including payments to our holding company, is an unsafe or unsound practice. If our bank is unable to pay dividends to our holding company, our holding company may not be able to service its debt or pay its obligations. Our holding company's inability to receive dividends from our bank would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio. Like all financial institutions, every loan we make carries a risk that it will not be repaid in accordance with its terms, or that securing collateral will not be sufficient to assure repayment. This risk is affected by, among other things: · cash flow of the borrower and/or the project being financed; · in the case of a secured loan, the changes and uncertainties as to the value of the collateral; · the credit history of a particular borrower; · changes in economic and industry conditions; and · the duration of the loan. Our bank’s loan losses as a percentage of net loans outstanding and loans held-for-sale was 1.10% as of December 31, 2006 and 1.20% as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of net loans outstanding, excluding loans held-for-sale, was 1.29% as of December 31, 2006, 1.35% as of December 31 2005, and 1.29% as of December 31, 2004. Regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review our bank’s loans and allowance for loan losses. Although management believes the level of our loan loss allowance is adequate to absorb probable losses in our loan portfolio, management cannot predict these losses or whether the allowance will be adequate or whether regulators will require us to increase this allowance. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects and profitability. Our bank's business, financial condition and results of operations are sensitive to and may be adversely affected by interest rate and prepayment changes. Our earnings are substantially affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect the demand for new loans, the credit profile of existing loans, the rates received on loans and securities and the rates we must pay on deposits and borrowings. The difference between the rates we receive on loans and short-term investments and the rates we must pay on deposits and borrowings is known as the interest rate spread. Given our current volume and mix of interest-bearing assets and liabilities, our interest rate spread can be expected to increase when market interest rates are rising, and to decline when market interest rates are declining. Although we believe our current level of interest rate sensitivity is reasonable, significant fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect our business, financial condition and result of operations. 29 While the federal funds rate and other short-term market interest rates, which we use to guide our deposit pricing, have increased, intermediate and long-term market interest rates, which we use to guide our loan pricing, have not increased proportionately. This has led to a flattening of the market yield curve, which has even inverted recently as short-term rates have exceeded long-term rates over an intermediate maturity horizon. If short-term interest rates continue to rise so that the yield curve remains relatively flat or inverts further, we would expect that our net interest spread and net interest margin would compress, which would hurt our net interest income. Our net interest margin has ranged from a low of 5.69% to a high of 6.78% for the years ended December 31, 2002 to 2006. We are asset sensitive, which means that our assets reprice faster than our liabilities. Thus, in an increasing interest rate environment the net interest margin will generally increase and in a declining interest rate environment the net interest margin will generally decline. Beginning in June 2006, when the short-term Fed Fund rates stopped increasing, our net interest margin began to slightly compress due to the repricing at maturity of longer term, lower rate time deposits. In addition, the value of our SBA servicing asset and SBA I/O strip receivable, which totaled $8.3 million and $13.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006, are subject to fluctuations based on changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds. Generally, we would expect the value of our SBA servicing asset to decrease in a rising interest rate environment, as well as if prepayment speeds increase. Similarly, the value of our SBA interest-only strip receivable asset is subject to fluctuations in prepayment speeds and would be expected to decrease if prepayment speeds increase. Increasing levels of competition in banking and financial services businesses may reduce our market share or cause the prices we charge for services to fall, which may decrease our profits. Competition may adversely affect our results of operations. The financial services business in our market area is highly competitive and becoming more so due to changes in regulation, technological advances, and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. We face competition both in attracting deposits and making loans. We compete for loans principally through competitive interest rates and the efficiency and quality of the services we provide. Increased competition in the banking and financial services businesses may reduce our market share or cause the prices we charge for services to fall. Many of the financial intermediaries operating in our market area offer certain services, such as trust, investment, and international banking services, that we do not offer directly, and may have larger lending limits than ours, which may prompt existing or potential customers to do business with our competitors instead of us. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to effectively use rapid-changing technology in providing and marketing products and services to our customers. The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to use technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations and compliance with regulatory expectations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing those products and services to our customers. Both our holding company and our bank are subject to government regulation that limits and restricts their activities and operations. The financial services industry is heavily regulated, and the regulatory burden on banks is increasing. Federal and state regulation is designed to protect the deposits of consumers, not to benefit shareholders. The regulations impose significant limitations on operations, and may change at any time, possibly causing results to vary significantly from past results. Government policy and regulation, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve System, significantly affect our credit conditions. 30 Our policies and procedures for minimizing loan losses may not fully protect us, particularly when the economy is weak. Some of our borrowers and guarantors may fail to perform their obligations as required by the terms of their loans, which could result in larger than expected losses. This risk increases when the economy and the real estate markets are weak. As a result of our growth, we have periodically modified our underwriting and credit policies, and loan monitoring procedures, including the establishment and monitoring of our allowance for loan losses. Management believes these policies and practices are reasonable and should minimize loan losses by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance, tracking loan performance, and diversifying the credit portfolio. However, these policies and procedures may not be adequate to prevent unexpected losses that could adversely affect our results of operations. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to insure against or control our operations risks. We are subject to various operations risks, including, but not limited to, data processing system failures and errors, communications and information systems failures, errors and breaches, customer or employee fraud, and catastrophic failures resulting from terrorist acts or natural disasters. Should an event occur that is not prevented or detected by our internal controls, or is uninsured or in excess of applicable insurance limits, it could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, cause additional regulatory scrutiny, and expose us to litigation risks and possible financial liability, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our geographic concentration may adversely affect our results of operations if business conditions in our market area decline. If SBA lending is excluded, our operations are located almost entirely in California, with close to 100% of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2006 derived from California operations. Due to this geographic concentration, our results depend largely upon California economic and business conditions and real estate values. Deterioration in economic and business conditions and real estate values in our market area could adversely affect the quality of our loan portfolio and the demand for our products and services, which in turn may adversely affect our results of operations to a greater extent than if our operations were geographically diverse. Even if the economy remains healthy, a sustained downturn in California real estate values would adversely affect our results of operations. Our growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when needed. We are required by regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. We anticipate that our capital levels following the private placement offering in November 2006 will satisfy our regulatory requirements for at least the next 12 months. We may at some point, however, need to raise additional capital to support our continued growth, particularly if the regulatory authorities pass legislation to increase our capital requirements. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend, in part, on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations could be adversely affected. In addition, if we decide to raise additional equity capital, your interest could be diluted. Our business is subject to liquidity risk, and changes in our source of funds may adversely affect our performance and financial condition by increasing our cost of funds. Our ability to make loans is directly related to our ability to secure funding. Core deposits are our primary source of liquidity. Also, we use the national certificate of deposit (“CD”) markets, which are generally CDs purchased by other financial institutions and brokered CDs. Both the national CD market and brokered CDs are rate sensitive and generally have a higher rate than deposits generated in our local markets. We use advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and Federal Fund lines of credit to satisfy temporary borrowing needs. Payments of principal and interest on loans and sales and participations of eligible loans are also a primary source for our liquidity needs. Primary uses of funds include withdrawal of and interest payments on deposits, originations and purchases of loans, and payment of operating expenses. Core deposits represent significant sources of low-cost funds. Alternative funding sources, such as large balance time deposits or borrowings, are a comparatively higher-costing source of funds. Liquidity risk arises from the inability to meet obligations when they come due or to manage the unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources. Although we believe we can continue to successfully pursue our core deposit funding strategy, significant fluctuations in core deposit balances may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 31 Risks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock We may issue additional shares of common stock or derivative securities that will dilute the percentage ownership interest of existing shareholders and may dilute the book value per share of our common stock and adversely affect the terms on which we may obtain additional capital. Our authorized capital includes 40,000,000 shares of common stock. At December 31, 2006, we have 10,586,659 shares of common stock outstanding, and have reserved for issuance 1,413,398 shares underlying options that are or may become exercisable at an average price of $9.36 per share. Our board generally has the authority, without action by or vote of the shareholders, to issue all or part of any authorized but unissued shares of common stock for any corporate purpose, including issuance of equity-based incentives under or outside of our stock option plans. We may seek equity capital in the future as we develop our business and expand our operations. Any issuance of additional shares of common stock or derivative securities will dilute the percentage ownership interest of our shareholders and may dilute the book value per share of our common stock. Future sales of our stock by our shareholders or the perception that those sales could occur may cause our stock price to decline. Although our common stock is listed for trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, the trading volume in our common stock is lower than that of other larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the relatively low trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales may occur, could cause the trading price of our common stock to decrease or to be lower than it otherwise might be in the absence of those sales or perceptions. Volatility of our stock price may result in losses to our investors and litigation against us. Stock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to sell our securities when you want and at prices you find attractive. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, including, among other things: · Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations; · Recommendations by securities analysts; · Operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to our company; · News reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry; and · Perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors. Moreover, in the past, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We could in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources from our normal business. The existence of outstanding stock options issued to our directors, executive officers and employees may result in dilution of your ownership and adversely affect the terms on which we can obtain additional capital. As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding options to purchase 1,413,398 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $9.36 per share. All of these options are held by our directors, executive officers and employees. The issuance of shares subject to options under the plans may result in dilution of your ownership of our common stock. The exercise of stock options could also adversely affect the terms on which we can obtain additional capital. Option holders are most likely to exercise their options when the exercise price is less than the market price for our common stock. They profit from any increase in the stock price without assuming the risks of ownership of the underlying shares of common stock by exercising their options and selling the stock immediately. Our ability to pay cash dividends is limited, and we may be unable to pay future dividends even if we desire to do so. Since our inception, our holding company has not paid any cash dividends on shares of its common stock, and currently it does not intend to pay cash dividends. Even if our holding company eventually decides to pay cash dividends, its ability to do so may be limited by regulatory restrictions, by our bank’s ability to pay cash dividends to our holding company and by our need to maintain sufficient capital to support our operations. The ability of our bank to pay cash dividends to our holding company is limited by its obligations to maintain sufficient capital and by other restrictions on its cash dividends that are applicable to California state banks and banks that are regulated by the FDIC. If our holding company does not satisfy these regulatory requirements, it will be unable to pay cash dividends on its common stock. 32 Our common stock is not an insured deposit and therefore is subject to risk of loss. Our common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our securities is inherently risky for the reasons described in this “Risk Factors” section and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of securities in any company as well as other factors which affect the stock of financial services companies in general and of our company in particular. The risks described in this report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
