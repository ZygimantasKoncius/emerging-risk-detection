ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones faced by the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that the Company is unaware of, or that it currently deems immaterial, may become important factors that affect it. If any of the following risks occurs, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Risks That Relate to Southern UnionSouthern Union has substantial debt and may not be able to obtain funding or obtain funding on acceptable terms because of deterioration in the credit and capital markets. This may hinder or prevent Southern Union from meeting its future capital needs.Southern Union has a significant amount of debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2012, consolidated debt on the consolidated balance sheet totaled $3.28 billion outstanding, compared to total capitalization (long- and short-term debt plus stockholders’ equity) of $7.31 billion.Covenants exist in certain of the Company’s debt agreements that require the Company to maintain a certain level of net worth, to meet certain debt to total capitalization ratios and to meet certain ratios of earnings before depreciation, interest and taxes to cash interest expense. A failure by the Company to satisfy any such covenant would give rise to an event of default under the associated debt, which could become immediately due and payable if the Company did not cure such default within any permitted cure period or if the Company did not obtain amendments, consents or waivers from its lenders with respect to such covenants. Any such acceleration or inability to borrow could cause a material adverse change in the Company’s financial condition.The Company relies on access to both short- and long-term credit as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from its operations. A deterioration in the Company’s financial condition could hamper its ability to access the capital markets.Global financial markets and economic conditions have been, and may continue to be, disrupted and volatile. The current weak economic conditions have made, and may continue to make, obtaining funding more difficult. Due to these factors, the Company cannot be certain that funding will be available if needed and, to the extent required, on acceptable terms. If funding is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, the Company may be unable to grow its existing business, complete acquisitions, refinance its debt or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s revenues and results of operations.Further, in order for the Company to receive equity contributions or loans from its parent or incur long-term debt, certain state regulatory approvals are required. This may limit the Company’s overall access to sources of capital otherwise available. 14Table of ContentsRestrictions on the Company’s ability to access capital markets could affect its ability to execute its business plan or limit its ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions on which it may otherwise rely for future growth.Credit ratings downgrades could increase the Company’s financing costs and limit its ability to access the capital markets.The Company is not party to any lending agreement that would accelerate the maturity date of any obligation due to a failure to maintain any specific credit rating, nor would a reduction in any credit rating, by itself, cause an event of default under any of the Company’s lending agreements. However, if its current credit ratings were downgraded below investment grade the Company could be negatively impacted as follows:•Borrowing costs associated with existing debt obligations could increase in the event of a credit rating downgrade;•The costs of refinancing debt that is maturing or any new debt issuances could increase due to a credit rating downgrade;•The costs of maintaining certain contractual relationships could increase, primarily related to the potential requirement for the Company to post collateral associated with its derivative financial instruments; and•Regulators may be unwilling to allow the Company to pass along increased debt service costs to natural gas customers.The financial soundness of the Company’s customers could affect its business and operating results and the Company’s credit risk management may not be adequate to protect against customer risk.As a result of macroeconomic challenges that have impacted the economy of the United States and other parts of the world, the Company’s customers may experience cash flow concerns. As a result, if customers’ operating and financial performance deteriorates, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable owed to the Company. The Company’s credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully eliminate customer credit risk. In addition, in certain situations, the Company may assume certain additional credit risks for competitive reasons or otherwise. Any inability of the Company’s customers to pay for services could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The Company depends on distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its needs.The Company is dependent on the earnings and cash flows of, and dividends, loans, advances or other distributions from, its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet its obligations. The availability of distributions from such entities is subject to their earnings and capital requirements, the satisfaction of various covenants and conditions contained in financing documents by which they are bound or in their organizational documents, and in the case of the regulated subsidiaries, regulatory restrictions that limit their ability to distribute profits to Southern Union.Some of our executive officers and directors face potential conflicts of interest in managing our business.Certain of our executive officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of ETE and/or ETP. These relationships may create conflicts of interest regarding corporate opportunities and other matters. The resolution of any such conflicts may not always be in our or our Unitholders' best interests. In addition, these overlapping executive officers and directors allocate their time among us and ETE and/or ETP. These officers and directors face potential conflicts regarding the allocation of their time, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our affiliates may compete with us.Our affiliates and related parties are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities, including those that might be in direct competition with us.The Company’s growth strategy entails risk for investors.The Company may actively pursue acquisitions in the energy industry to complement and diversify its existing businesses. As part of its growth strategy, Southern Union may:•examine and potentially acquire regulated or unregulated businesses, including transportation and storage assets and gathering and processing businesses within the natural gas industry;•enter into joint venture agreements and/or other transactions with other industry participants or financial investors;•selectively divest parts of its business, including parts of its core operations; and•continue expanding its existing operations.15Table of ContentsThe Company’s ability to acquire new businesses will depend upon the extent to which opportunities become available, as well as, among other things:•its success in valuing and bidding for the opportunities;•its ability to assess the risks of the opportunities;•its ability to obtain regulatory approvals on favorable terms; and•its access to financing on acceptable terms.Once acquired, the Company’s ability to integrate a new business into its existing operations successfully will largely depend on the adequacy of implementation plans, including the ability to identify and retain employees to manage the acquired business, and the ability to achieve desired operating efficiencies. The successful integration of any businesses acquired in the future may entail numerous risks, including:•the risk of diverting management’s attention from day-to-day operations;•the risk that the acquired businesses will require substantial capital and financial investments;•the risk that the investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations; and•the risk of substantial difficulties in the transition and integration process.These factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time.The consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects the Company’s financial results. In addition, acquisitions or expansions may result in the incurrence of additional debt.The Company is subject to operating risks.The Company’s operations are subject to all operating hazards and risks incident to handling, storing, transporting and providing customers with natural gas or NGL, including adverse weather conditions, explosions, pollution, release of toxic substances, fires and other hazards, each of which could result in damage to or destruction of its facilities or damage to persons and property. If any of these events were to occur, the Company could suffer substantial losses. Moreover, as a result, the Company has been, and likely will be, a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. While the Company maintains insurance against many of these risks to the extent and in amounts that it believes are reasonable, the Company’s insurance coverages have significant deductibles and self-insurance levels, limits on maximum recovery, and do not cover all risks. There is also the risk that the coverages will change over time in light of increased premiums or changes in the terms of the insurance coverages that could result in the Company’s decision to either terminate certain coverages, increase deductibles and self-insurance levels, or decrease maximum recoveries. In addition, there is a risk that the insurers may default on their coverage obligations. As a result, the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could be adversely affected if a significant event occurs that is not fully covered by insurance.Terrorist attacks, such as the attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, have resulted in increased costs, and the consequences of terrorism may adversely impact the Company’s results of operations.The impact that terrorist attacks, such as the attacks of September 11, 2001, may have on the energy industry in general, and on the Company in particular, is not known at this time. Uncertainty surrounding military activity may affect the Company’s operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets and the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines, LNG facilities, gathering facilities and processing plants, could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror or a retaliatory strike. The Company may have to incur significant additional costs in the future to safeguard its physical assets.The success of the pipeline and gathering and processing businesses depends, in part, on factors beyond the Company’s control.Third parties own most of the natural gas transported and stored through the pipeline systems operated by Panhandle. Additionally, third parties produce all of the natural gas gathered and processed by SUGS, and third parties provide all of the NGL transportation and fractionation services for SUGS. As a result, the volume of natural gas or NGL transported, stored, gathered, processed or fractionated depends on the actions of those third parties and is beyond the Company’s control. Further, other factors beyond the Company’s and those third parties’ control may unfavorably impact the Company’s ability to maintain or increase current transmission, storage, gathering or processing rates, to renegotiate existing contracts as they expire or to remarket unsubscribed capacity. High utilization of contracted capacity by firm customers reduces capacity available for interruptible transportation and parking services.16Table of Contents The success of the pipeline and gathering and processing businesses depends on the continued development of additional natural gas reserves in the vicinity of their facilities and their ability to access additional reserves to offset the natural decline from existing sources connected to their systems.The amount of revenue generated by Panhandle ultimately depends upon their access to reserves of available natural gas. Additionally, the amount of revenue generated by SUGS depends substantially upon the volume of natural gas gathered and processed and NGL extracted. As the reserves available through the supply basins connected to these systems naturally decline, a decrease in development or production activity could cause a decrease in the volume of natural gas available for transmission, gathering or processing. If production from these natural gas reserves is substantially reduced and not replaced with other sources of natural gas, such as new wells or interconnections with other pipelines, and certain of the Company’s assets are consequently not utilized, the Company may have to accelerate the recognition and settlement of AROs. Investments by third parties in the development of new natural gas reserves or other sources of natural gas in proximity to the Company’s facilities depend on many factors beyond the Company’s control. Revenue reductions or the acceleration of AROs resulting from the decline of natural gas reserves and the lack of new sources of natural gas may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The pipeline and gathering and processing businesses’ revenues are generated under contracts that must be renegotiated periodically.The revenues of Panhandle and SUGS are generated under contracts that expire periodically and must be replaced. Although the Company will actively pursue the renegotiation, extension and/or replacement of all of its contracts, it cannot assure that it will be able to extend or replace these contracts when they expire or that the terms of any renegotiated contracts will be as favorable as the existing contracts. If the Company is unable to renew, extend or replace these contracts, or if the Company renews them on less favorable terms, it may suffer a material reduction in revenues and earnings.The expansion of the Company’s pipeline and gathering and processing systems by constructing new facilities subjects the Company to construction and other risks that may adversely affect the financial results of the Company’s pipeline and gathering and processing businesses.The Company may expand the capacity of its existing pipeline, storage, LNG, and gathering and processing facilities by constructing additional facilities. Construction of these facilities is subject to various regulatory, development and operational risks, including:•the Company’s ability to obtain necessary approvals and permits from FERC and other regulatory agencies on a timely basis and on terms that are acceptable to it;•the ability to access sufficient capital at reasonable rates to fund expansion projects, especially in periods of prolonged economic decline when the Company may be unable to access capital markets;•the availability of skilled labor, equipment, and materials to complete expansion projects;•adverse weather conditions;•potential changes in federal, state and local statutes, regulations, and orders, including environmental requirements that delay or prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project;•impediments on the Company’s ability to acquire rights-of-way or land rights or to commence and complete construction on a timely basis or on terms that are acceptable to it;•the Company’s ability to construct projects within anticipated costs, including the risk that the Company may incur cost overruns, resulting from inflation or increased costs of equipment, materials, labor, contractor productivity, delays in construction or other factors beyond its control, that the Company may not be able to recover from its customers;•the lack of future growth in natural gas supply and/or demand; and•the lack of transportation, storage or throughput commitments or gathering and processing commitments.Any of these risks could prevent a project from proceeding, delay its completion or increase its anticipated costs. There is also the risk that a downturn in the economy and its potential negative impact on natural gas demand may result in either slower development in the Company’s expansion projects or adjustments in the contractual commitments supporting such projects. As a result, new facilities could be delayed or may not achieve the Company’s expected investment return, which may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.17Table of ContentsThe inability to continue to access lands owned by third parties could adversely affect the Company’s ability to operate and/or expand its pipeline and gathering and processing businesses.The ability of Panhandle or SUGS to operate in certain geographic areas will depend on their success in maintaining existing rights-of-way and obtaining new rights-of-way. Securing additional rights-of-way is also critical to the Company’s ability to pursue expansion projects. Even for Panhandle, which generally has the right of eminent domain, the Company cannot assure that it will be able to acquire all of the necessary new rights-of-way or maintain access to existing rights-of-way upon the expiration of the current rights-of-way or that all of the rights-of-way will be obtainable in a timely fashion. The Company’s financial position could be adversely affected if the costs of new or extended rights-of-way materially increase or the Company is unable to obtain or extend the rights-of-way timely.Federal, state and local jurisdictions may challenge the Company’s tax return positions.The positions taken by the Company in its tax return filings require significant judgment, use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. Despite management’s belief that the Company’s tax return positions are fully supportable, certain positions may be challenged successfully by federal, state and local jurisdictions.The Company is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations regulating the environmental aspects of its business that may increase its costs of operation, expose it to environmental liabilities and require it to make material unbudgeted expenditures.The Company is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations regulating the environmental aspects of its business (including air emissions), which are complex, change from time to time and have tended to become increasingly strict. These laws and regulations have necessitated, and in the future may necessitate, increased capital expenditures and operating costs. In addition, certain environmental laws may result in liability without regard to fault concerning contamination at a broad range of properties, including currently or formerly owned, leased or operated properties and properties where the Company disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, waste.The Company is currently monitoring or remediating contamination at several of its facilities and at waste disposal sites pursuant to environmental laws and regulations and indemnification agreements. The Company cannot predict with certainty the sites for which it may be responsible, the amount of resulting cleanup obligations that may be imposed on it or the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental remediation because of the difficulty of estimating cleanup costs and the uncertainty of payment by other PRPs.Costs and obligations also can arise from claims for toxic torts and natural resource damages or from releases of hazardous materials on other properties as a result of ongoing operations or disposal of waste. Compliance with amended, new or more stringently enforced existing environmental requirements, or the future discovery of contamination, may require material unbudgeted expenditures. These costs or expenditures could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, particularly if such costs or expenditures are not fully recoverable from insurance or through the rates charged to customers or if they exceed any amounts that have been reserved.An impairment of goodwill and intangible assets could reduce our earnings.As of December 31, 2012, our consolidated balance sheet reflected $2.36 billion of goodwill. Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur, indicating that goodwill might be impaired. Long-lived assets such as intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If we determine that any of our goodwill or intangible assets were impaired, we would be required to take an immediate charge to earnings with a correlative effect on partners' capital and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization.The use of derivative financial instruments could result in material financial losses by us.From time to time, we have sought to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates by using derivative financial instruments and other risk management mechanisms and by our trading, marketing and/or system optimization activities. To the extent that we hedge our commodity price and interest rate exposures, we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in our favor. 18Table of ContentsThe accounting standards regarding hedge accounting are very complex, and even when we engage in hedging transactions that are effective economically (whether to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, or to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates), these transactions may not be considered effective for accounting purposes. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges, even when there is no underlying economic impact at that point. It is also not always possible for us to engage in a hedging transaction that completely mitigates our exposure to commodity prices. Our consolidated financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge. In addition, even though monitored by management, our derivatives activities can result in losses. Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the derivative arrangement, the hedge is imperfect, commodity prices move unfavorably related to our physical or financial positions or hedging policies and procedures are not followed. The adoption of the Dodd-Frank Act could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business, resulting in our operations becoming more volatile and our cash flows less predictable.Congress has adopted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), a comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The legislation was signed into law by President Obama on July 21, 2010 and requires the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the SEC and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation. While certain regulations have been promulgated and are already in effect, the rulemaking and implementation process is still ongoing, and we cannot yet predict the ultimate effect of the rules and regulations on our business. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the types of entities that are required to register with the CFTC and the SEC as a result of their activities in the derivatives markets or otherwise become specifically qualified to enter into derivatives contracts. We will be required to assess our activities in the derivatives markets, and to monitor such activities on an ongoing basis, to ascertain and to identify any potential change in our regulatory status. Reporting and recordkeeping requirements also could significantly increase operating costs and expose us to penalties for non-compliance. Certain CFTC recordkeeping requirements became effective on October 14, 2010, and additional recordkeeping requirements will be phased in through April 2013. Beginning on December 31, 2012, certain CFTC reporting rules became effective, and additional reporting requirements will be phased in through April 2013. These additional recordkeeping and reporting requirements may require additional compliance resources. Added public transparency as a result of the reporting rules may also have a negative effect on market liquidity which could also negatively impact commodity prices and our ability to hedge. The CFTC has also issued regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. The CFTC's position limits rules were to become effective on October 12, 2012, but a United States District Court vacated and remanded the position limits rules to the CFTC. The CFTC has appealed that ruling and it is uncertain at this time whether, when, and to what extent the CFTC's position limits rules will become effective. The new regulations may also require us to comply with certain margin requirements for our over-the-counter derivative contracts with certain CFTC- or SEC-registered entities that could require us to enter into credit support documentation and/or post significant amounts of cash collateral, which could adversely affect our liquidity and ability to use derivatives to hedge our commercial price risk; however, the proposed margin rules are not yet final and therefore the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time. The financial reform legislation may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty. The new legislation also requires that certain derivative instruments be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform. Mandatory exchange trading and clearing requirements could result in increased costs in the form of additional margin requirements imposed by clearing organizations. On December 13, 2012, the CFTC published final rules regarding mandatory clearing of certain interest rate swaps and certain index credit default swaps and setting compliance dates for different categories of market participants, the earliest of which is March 11, 2013. The CFTC has not yet proposed any rules requiring the clearing of any other classes of swaps, including physical commodity swaps. Although there may be an exception to the mandatory exchange trading and clearing requirement that applies to our trading activities, we must obtain approval from the board of directors of our General Partner and make certain filings in order to rely on this exception. In addition, 19Table of Contentsmandatory clearing requirements applicable to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging.Rules promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act further defined forwards as well as instances where forwards may become swaps. Because the CFTC rules, interpretations, no-action letters, and case law are still developing, it is possible that some arrangements that previously qualified as forwards or energy service contracts may fall in the regulatory category of swaps or options. In addition, the CFTC's rules applicable to trade options may further impose burdens on our ability to conduct our traditional hedging operations and could become subject to CFTC investigations in the future. The new legislation and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including through restrictions on the types of collateral we are required to post), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable. Finally, if we fail to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations, we may be subject to fines, cease-and-desist orders, civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions.The Company’s business could be affected adversely by union disputes and strikes or work stoppages by its unionized employees.As of December 31, 2012, approximately 791 of the Company’s 2,256 employees were represented by collective bargaining units under collective bargaining agreements. Any future work stoppage could, depending on the affected operations and the length of the work stoppage, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.The Company is subject to risks associated with climate change.It has been advanced that emissions of “greenhouse gases” (GHGs) are linked to climate change. Climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impact and the regulation of GHGs have the potential to affect the Company’s business in many ways, including negatively impacting (i) the costs it incurs in providing its products and services, including costs to operate and maintain its facilities, install new emission controls on its facilities, acquire allowances to authorize its GHG emissions, pay any taxes related to GHG emissions, administer and manage a GHG emissions program, pay higher insurance premiums or accept greater risk of loss in areas affected by adverse weather and coastal regions in the event of rising sea levels, (ii) the demand for and consumption of its products and services (due to change in both costs and weather patterns), and (iii) the economic health of the regions in which it operates, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Recently proposed rules regulating air emissions from natural gas operations could cause us to incur increased capital expenditures and operating costs, which may be significant.On April 17, 2012, the EPA issued final rules that would establish new air emission controls for natural gas production and processing operations. Specifically, the EPA's proposed rule package includes New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with natural gas production and processing activities. The EPA's proposal would require the reduction of VOC emissions from natural gas production facilities by mandating the use of "green completions" for hydraulic fracturing by January 2015, which requires the operator to recover rather than vent the gas and natural gas liquids that come to the surface during completion of the fracturing process. The proposed rules also would establish specific requirements regarding emissions from compressors, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. In addition, the rules would establish new leak detection requirements for natural gas processing plants. These rules will require us to modify certain of our operations, including the possible installation of new equipment. Compliance with such rules will be required within three years of their effective date, and it could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, which may adversely impact our business.Climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of “greenhouse gases” could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the natural gas that we transport, store or otherwise handle.In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other “greenhouse gases” present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. The 20Table of ContentsEPA has recently adopted rules regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act, one of which requires a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and another which regulates emissions of greenhouse gases from certain large stationary sources, effective January 2, 2011. In November 2011, the EPA also adopted rules requiring companies with facilities that emit over 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide to report their greenhouse gas emissions to the EPA by September 30, 2012, a requirement with which we timely complied. In addition, the United States Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase may be reduced over time in an effort to achieve the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal.The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and refined products. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Some have suggested that one consequence of climate change could be increased severity of extreme weather, such as increased hurricanes and floods. If such effects were to occur, our operations could be adversely affected in various ways, including damages to our facilities from powerful winds or rising waters, or increased costs for insurance. Another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. The market for our fuels is generally improved by periods of colder weather and impaired by periods of warmer weather, so any changes in climate could affect the market for the fuels that we produce. Despite the use of the term “global warming” as a shorthand for climate change, some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages. As a result, it is difficult to predict how the market for our fuels could be affected by increased temperature volatility, although if there is an overall trend of warmer temperatures, it would be expected to have an adverse effect on our business.The Company is subject to risks resulting from the moratorium in 2010 on and the resulting increased costs of offshore deepwater drilling.The United States Department of Interior (DOI) implemented a six-month moratorium on offshore drilling in water deeper than 500 feet in response to the blowout and explosion on April 20, 2010 at the British Petroleum Plc deepwater well in the Gulf of Mexico. The offshore drilling moratorium was implemented to permit the DOI to review the safety protocols and procedures used by offshore drilling companies, which review will enable the DOI to recommend enhanced safety and training needs for offshore drilling companies. The moratorium was lifted in October 2010. Additionally, the United States Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (formerly the United States Mineral Management Service) has been fundamentally restructured by the DOI with the intent of providing enhanced oversight of onshore and offshore drilling operations for regulatory compliance enforcement, energy development and revenue collection. Certain enhanced regulatory mandates have been enacted with additional regulatory mandates expected. The new regulatory requirements will increase the cost of offshore drilling and production operations. The increased regulations and cost of drilling operations could result in decreased drilling activity in the areas serviced by the Company. Furthermore, the imposed moratorium did result in some offshore drilling companies relocating their offshore drilling operations for currently indeterminable periods of time to regions outside of the United States. Business decisions to not drill in the areas serviced by the Company resulting from the increased regulations and costs could result in a reduction in the future development and production of natural gas reserves in the vicinity of the Company’s facilities, which could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The costs of providing pension and other postretirement health care benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values, changing demographics and fluctuating actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial results. In addition, the passage of the Health Care Reform Act in 2010 could significantly increase the cost of providing health care benefits for Company employees.The Company provides pension plan and other postretirement healthcare benefits to certain of its employees. The costs of providing pension and other postretirement health care benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension and other postretirement fund values, changing demographics and fluctuating actuarial assumptions that may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future financial results. In addition, the passage of the Health Care Reform Act of 2010 could significantly 21Table of Contentsincrease the cost of health care benefits for its employees. While certain of the costs incurred in providing such pension and other postretirement healthcare benefits are recovered through the rates charged by the Company’s regulated businesses, the Company may not recover all of its costs and those rates are generally not immediately responsive to current market conditions or funding requirements. Additionally, if the current cost recovery mechanisms are changed or eliminated, the impact of these benefits on operating results could significantly increase.The Company is subject to risks related to cybersecurity.The Company is subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in connection with its efforts to enhance and ensure security and in response to actual or attempted cybersecurity attacks.Substantial aspects of the Company’s business depend on the secure operation of its computer systems and websites. Security breaches could expose the Company to a risk of loss, misuse or interruption of sensitive and critical information and functions, including its own proprietary information and that of its customers, suppliers and employees and functions that affect the operation of the business. Such losses could result in operational impacts, reputational harm, competitive disadvantage, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, and liability. While the Company devotes substantial resources to maintaining adequate levels of cybersecurity, there can be no assurance that it will be able to prevent all of the rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks. Actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause the Company to incur increasing costs for technology, personnel and services to enhance security or to respond to occurrences.If the Company’s security measures are circumvented, proprietary information may be misappropriated, its operations may be disrupted, and its computers or those of its customers or other third parties may be damaged. Compromises of the Company’s security may result in an interruption of operations, violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to its reputation, and a loss of confidence in its security measures.Risk That Relate to the Company’s Transportation and Storage BusinessThe transportation and storage business is highly regulated.The Company’s transportation and storage business is subject to regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. FERC, the U.S. Department of Transportation and various state and local regulatory agencies regulate the interstate pipeline business. In particular, FERC has authority to regulate rates charged by Panhandle for the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce. FERC also has authority over the construction, acquisition, operation and disposition of these pipeline and storage assets. In addition, the U.S. Coast Guard has oversight over certain issues including the importation of LNG.The Company’s rates and operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal regulators as well as the actions of Congress and state legislatures and, in some respects, state regulators. The Company cannot predict or control what effect future actions of regulatory agencies may have on its business or its access to the capital markets. Furthermore, the nature and degree of regulation of natural gas companies has changed significantly during the past several decades and there is no assurance that further substantial changes will not occur or that existing policies and rules will not be applied in a new or different manner. Should new and more stringent regulatory requirements be imposed, the Company’s business could be unfavorably impacted and the Company could be subject to additional costs that could adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations if these costs are not ultimately recovered through rates.The Company’s transportation and storage business is also influenced by fluctuations in costs, including operating costs such as insurance, postretirement and other benefit costs, wages, outside contractor services costs, asset retirement obligations for certain assets and other operating costs. The profitability of regulated operations depends on the business’ ability to collect such increased costs as a part of the rates charged to its customers. To the extent that such operating costs increase in an amount greater than that for which revenue is received, or for which rate recovery is allowed, this differential could impact operating results. The lag between an increase in costs and the ability of the Company to file to obtain rate relief from FERC to recover those increased costs can have a direct negative impact on operating results. As with any request for an increase in rates in a regulatory filing, once granted, the rate increase may not be adequate. In addition, FERC may prevent the business from passing along certain costs in the form of higher rates. Competition may prevent the recovery of increased costs even if allowed in rates.FERC may also exercise its Section 5 authority to initiate proceedings to review rates that it believes may not be just and reasonable. FERC has recently exercised this authority with respect to several other pipeline companies, as it had in 2007 with respect to Southwest Gas. If FERC were to initiate a Section 5 proceeding against the Company and find that the Company’s rates at that time were not just and reasonable due to a lower rate base, reduced or disallowed operating costs, or other factors, the applicable maximum rates the Company is allowed to charge customers could be reduced and the reduction could potentially have a material 22Table of Contentsadverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In 2010, in response to an intervention and protest filed by BG LNG Services (BGLS) regarding its rates with Trunkline LNG applicable to certain LNG expansions, FERC determined that there was no reason at that time to expend FERC’s resources on a Section 5 proceeding with respect to Trunkline LNG even though cost and revenue studies provided by the Company to FERC indicated Trunkline LNG’s revenues were in excess of its associated cost of service. However, since the current fixed rates expire at the end of 2015 and revert to tariff rate for these LNG expansions as well as the base LNG facilities for which rates were set in 2002, a Section 5 proceeding could be initiated at that time and result in significant revenue reductions if the cost of service remains lower than revenues. For additional related information, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Other Matters – Rate Matters – Trunkline LNG Cost and Revenue Study.”A rate reduction is also a possible outcome with any Section 4 rate case proceeding for the regulated entities of Panhandle, including any rate case proceeding required to be filed as a result of a prior rate case settlement. A regulated entity’s rate base, upon which a rate of return is allowed in the derivation of maximum rates, is primarily determined by a combination of accumulated capital investments, accumulated regulatory basis depreciation, and accumulated deferred income taxes. Such rate base can decline due to capital investments being less than depreciation over a period of time, or due to accelerated tax depreciation in excess of regulatory basis depreciation.The pipeline businesses are subject to competition.The interstate pipeline and storage businesses of Panhandle competes with those of other interstate and intrastate pipeline companies in the transportation and storage of natural gas. The principal elements of competition among pipelines are rates, terms of service and the flexibility and reliability of service. Natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to the Company’s customers and end-users, including electricity, coal and fuel oils. The primary competitive factor is price. Changes in the availability or price of natural gas and other forms of energy, the level of business activity, conservation, legislation and governmental regulations, the capability to convert to alternate fuels and other factors, including weather and natural gas storage levels, affect the demand for natural gas in the areas served by Panhandle.Substantial risks are involved in operating a natural gas pipeline system.Numerous operational risks are associated with the operation of a complex pipeline system. These include adverse weather conditions, accidents, the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, the performance of pipeline facilities below expected levels of capacity and efficiency, the collision of equipment with pipeline facilities (such as may occur if a third party were to perform excavation or construction work near the facilities) and other catastrophic events beyond the Company’s control. In particular, the Company’s pipeline system, especially those portions that are located offshore, may be subject to adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, extreme temperatures and other natural phenomena, making it more difficult for the Company to realize the historic rates of return associated with these assets and operations. A casualty occurrence might result in injury or loss of life, extensive property damage or environmental damage. Insurance proceeds may not be adequate to cover all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost.Fluctuations in energy commodity prices could adversely affect the pipeline businesses.If natural gas prices in the supply basins connected to the pipeline systems of Panhandle are higher than prices in other natural gas producing regions able to serve the Company’s customers, the volume of natural gas transported by the Company may be negatively impacted. Natural gas prices can also affect customer demand for the various services provided by the Company.The pipeline businesses are dependent on a small number of customers for a significant percentage of their sales.Panhandle’s top two customers accounted for 43% of its 2012 revenue. The loss of any one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Risks That Relate to the Company’s Gathering and Processing BusinessThe Company’s gathering and processing business is unregulated.Unlike the Company’s returns on its regulated transportation and distribution businesses, the natural gas gathering and processing operations conducted at SUGS are not regulated for cost-based ratemaking purposes and may potentially have a higher level of risk in recovering incurred costs than the Company’s regulated operations.23Table of ContentsAlthough SUGS operates in an unregulated market, the business is subject to certain regulatory risks, most notably environmental and safety regulations. Moreover, the Company cannot predict when additional legislation or regulation might affect the gathering and processing industry, nor the impact of any such changes on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.The Company’s gathering and processing business is subject to competition.The gathering and processing industry is expected to remain highly competitive. Most customers of SUGS have access to more than one gathering and/or processing system. The Company’s ability to compete depends on a number of factors, including the infrastructure and contracting strategies of competitors in the Company’s gathering region and the efficiency, quality and reliability of the Company’s plant and gathering system.In addition to SUGS’ current competitive position in the gathering and processing industry, its business is subject to pricing risks associated with changes in the supply of, and the demand for, natural gas and NGL. Since the demand for natural gas or NGL is influenced by commodity prices (including prices for alternative energy sources), customer usage rates, weather, economic conditions, service costs and other factors beyond the control of the Company, volumes processed and/or NGL extracted during processing may, after analysis, be reduced from time to time based on existing market conditions.The Company’s profit margin in the gathering and processing business is highly dependent on energy commodity prices.SUGS’ gross margin is largely derived from (i) percentage of proceeds arrangements based on the volume and quality of natural gas gathered and/or NGL recovered through its facilities and (ii) specified fee arrangements for a range of services. Under percent-of-proceeds arrangements, SUGS generally gathers and processes natural gas from producers for an agreed percentage of the proceeds from the sales of the resulting residue natural gas and NGL. The percent-of-proceeds arrangements, in particular, expose SUGS’ revenues and cash flows to risks associated with the fluctuation of the price of natural gas, NGL and crude oil and their relationships to each other. The markets and prices for natural gas and NGL depend upon many factors beyond the Company’s control. These factors include demand for these commodities, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions, and other factors, including: •the impact of seasonality and weather;•general economic conditions;•the level of domestic crude oil and natural gas production and consumption;•the level of worldwide crude oil and NGL production and consumption;•the availability and level of natural gas and NGL storage;•the availability of imported natural gas, LNG, NGL and crude oil;•actions taken by foreign oil and natural gas producing nations;•the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems;•the availability of NGL transportation and fractionation capacity;•the availability and marketing of competitive fuels;•the impact of energy conservation efforts;•the extent of governmental regulation and taxation; and•the availability and effective liquidity of natural gas and NGL derivative counterparties.To manage its commodity price risk related to natural gas and NGL, the Company uses a combination of puts, fixed-rate (i.e., receive fixed price) or floating-rate (i.e. receive variable price) index and basis swaps, NGL gross processing spread puts and fixed-rate swaps and exchange-traded futures and options. These derivative financial instruments allow the Company to preserve value and protect margins because changes in the value of the derivative financial instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in physical market commodity prices and reducing basis risk. Basis risk exists primarily due to price differentials between cash market delivery locations and futures contract delivery locations. However, the Company does not fully hedge against commodity price changes, and therefore retains some exposure to market risk. Accordingly, any adverse changes to commodity prices could result in decreased revenue and increased cost. For information related to derivative financial instruments, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.A reduction in demand for NGL products by the petrochemical, refining or heating industries could materially adversely affect the Company’s gathering and processing business.The NGL products the Company produces have a variety of applications, including for use as heating fuels, petrochemical feed stocks and refining blend stocks. A reduction in demand for NGL products, whether because of general economic conditions, new 24Table of Contentsgovernment regulations, reduced demand by consumers for products made with NGL products, increased competition from petroleum-based products due to pricing differences, mild winter weather, severe weather such as hurricanes causing damage to Gulf Coast petrochemical facilities or other reasons, could result in a decline in the value of the NGL products the Company sells and/or reduce the volume of NGL products the Company produces.Operational risks are involved in operating a gathering and processing business.Numerous operational risks are associated with the operation of a natural gas gathering and processing business. These include adverse weather conditions, accidents, the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, the performance of processing and fractionation facilities below expected levels of capacity or efficiency, the collision of equipment with facilities and catastrophic events such as explosions, fires, earthquakes, floods, landslides, tornadoes, lightning or other similar events beyond the Company’s control. A casualty occurrence might result in injury or loss of life, extensive property damage or environmental damage. Insurance proceeds may be inadequate to cover all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost.The Company does not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas reserves dedicated to its gathering and processing business, potentially resulting in future volumes of natural gas available to the Company being less than anticipated.The Company does not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas reserves connected to its gathering systems due to the unwillingness of producers to provide reserve information, as well as the cost of such evaluations. Accordingly, the Company does not have independent estimates of total reserves dedicated to its gathering systems or the anticipated life of such reserves. If the total reserves or estimated lives of the reserves connected to the Company’s gathering systems are less than anticipated and the Company is unable to secure additional sources of natural gas, then the volumes of natural gas in the future and associated gross margin could be less than anticipated. A decline in the volumes of natural gas and associated NGL in the Company’s gathering and processing business could have a material adverse effect on its business.The Company depends on two natural gas producers for a significant portion of its supply of natural gas. The loss of these producers or the replacement of its contracts on less favorable terms could result in a decline in the Company’s volumes and/or gross margin.SUGS’ two largest natural gas suppliers for the year ended December 31, 2012 accounted for approximately 29% of the Company’s wellhead throughput under multiple contracts. The loss of all or even a portion of the natural gas volumes supplied by these producers or the extension or replacement of these contracts on less favorable terms, if at all, as a result of competition or otherwise, could reduce the Company’s gross margin. Although these producers represent a large volume of natural gas, the gross margin per unit of volume is significantly lower than the average gross margin per unit of volume on the Company’s gathering and processing system due to the lack of need for services required to make the natural gas merchantable (e.g. high pressure, low NGL content, essentially transmission pipeline quality natural gas).The Company depends on one NGL customer for a significant portion of its sales of NGLs. The loss of this customer or the replacement of its contract on less favorable terms could result in a decline in the Company’s gross margin.Through December 31, 2014, SUGS has contracted to sell its entire owned or controlled output of NGL to Conoco Phillips Company (Conoco). Pricing for the NGL volumes sold to Conoco throughout the contract period are based on OPIS pricing at Mont Belvieu, Texas delivery points. For the period from March 26, 2012 to December 31, 2012, Conoco accounted for approximately 35% and 68% of the Company’s and SUGS’ operating revenues, respectively.Risks That Relate to the Company’s Distribution BusinessThe distribution business is highly regulated and the Company’s revenues, operating results and financial condition may fluctuate with the distribution business’ ability to achieve timely and effective rate relief from state regulators.The Company’s distribution business is subject to regulation by the MPSC and the MDPU. These authorities regulate many aspects of the Company’s distribution operations, including construction and maintenance of facilities, operations, safety, the rates that can be charged to customers and the maximum rate of return that the Company is allowed to realize. The ability to obtain rate increases depends upon regulatory discretion. The distribution business is influenced by fluctuations in costs, including operating costs such as insurance, postretirement and other benefit costs, wages, changes in the provision for the allowance for doubtful accounts associated with volatile natural gas costs and other operating costs. The profitability of regulated operations depends on the business’ ability to recover costs related to providing services to its customers. To the extent that such operating costs increase in an amount greater than that for which 25Table of Contentsrate recovery is allowed, this differential could impact operating results until the business files for and is allowed an increase in rates. The lag between an increase in costs and the rate relief obtained from the regulators can have a direct negative impact on operating results. As with any request for an increase in rates in a regulatory filing, once granted, the rate increase may not be adequate. In addition, regulators may prevent the business from passing along some costs in the form of higher rates.The distribution business’ operating results and liquidity needs are seasonal in nature and may fluctuate based on weather conditions and natural gas prices.The natural gas distribution business is a seasonal business with a significant percentage of annual operating revenues and EBITDA occurring in the traditional winter heating season in the first and fourth calendar quarters. The business is also subject to seasonal and other variations in working capital due to changes in natural gas prices and the fact that customers pay for the natural gas delivered to them after they use it, whereas the business is required to pay for the natural gas before delivery. As a result, fluctuations in natural gas prices may have a significant effect on results of operations and cash flows.Operational risks are involved in operating a distribution business.Numerous risks are associated with the operations of a natural gas distribution business. These include adverse weather conditions, accidents, the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, the performance of suppliers’ processing facilities below expected levels of capacity or efficiency, the collision of equipment with facilities and catastrophic events such as explosions, fires, earthquakes, floods, landslides, tornadoes, lightning or other similar events beyond the Company’s control. A casualty occurrence might result in injury or loss of life, extensive property damage or environmental damage. Insurance proceeds may be inadequate to cover all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost.The distribution business has recorded certain assets that may not be recoverable from its customers.The distribution business records certain assets on the Company’s balance sheet resulting from the regulatory process that could not be recorded under GAAP for non-regulated entities. As of December 31, 2012, the Company’s regulatory assets recorded in its consolidated balance sheet as held-for-sale assets were $123 million, as the regulatory assets are included in the LDC Disposal Group. When establishing regulatory assets, the distribution business considers factors such as rate orders from its regulators, previous rate orders for substantially similar costs, written approval from the regulators and analysis of recoverability from legal counsel to determine the probability of future recovery of these assets. The Company would be required to write-off any regulatory assets for which future recovery is determined not to be probable.Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.
