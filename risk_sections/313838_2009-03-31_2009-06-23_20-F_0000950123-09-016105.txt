Item 4A. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects OPERATING RESULTS Operating Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2009 compared with the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2008 Overview Effective from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, Sony revised the presentation of its financial information to ensure that it is consistent with the way management views its consolidated operations. Since Sony considers Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB (Sony Ericsson) and S-LCD Corporation (S-LCD) to be integral to Sonys operations, Sony determined that the most appropriate method to report equity in net income (loss) of all affiliated companies was as a component of operating income (loss). The equity earnings from Sony Ericsson and S-LCD are recorded within operating income (loss) of the Electronics segment. In connection with this reclassification, consolidated operating income (loss), operating income (loss) of each segment and consolidated income (loss) before income taxes and minority interest for all prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. Through September 30, 2008, Sony also reported the equity results for SONY BMG MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT (SONY BMG) within All Other. As a result of Sonys acquisition of Bertelsmann AGs (Bertelsmann) 50 percent interest in SONY BMG on October 1, 2008, effective from that date, Sony consolidated the results of SONY BMG as a wholly-owned subsidiary within All Other. SONY BMG changed its name to Sony Music Entertainment (SME) on January 1, 2009. Sonys sales and operating revenue (sales) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 decreased 12.9 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, the average value of the yen was 99.5 yen against the U.S. dollar and 142.0 yen against the euro, which was 13.8 percent and 12.7 percent higher against the U.S. dollar and the euro, respectively, compared with the average rates for the previous fiscal year. Electronics segment sales decreased 17.0 percent compared to the prior fiscal year mainly due to the negative impact of the appreciation of the yen, deterioration in the business environment brought on by the slowing global economy and intensification of price competition. In the Game segment, sales decreased 18.0 percent compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the impact of the appreciation of the yen, and a decrease in unit sales of PlayStation®2 (PS2). In the Pictures segment, sales decreased 16.4 percent compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to unfavorable exchange rates and lower home entertainment sales. The prior fiscal years revenue also benefited from the sale of a bankruptcy claim against KirchMedia GmbH & Co. KGaA (KirchMedia). In the Financial Services segment, although revenue from insurance premiums at Sony Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (Sony 33 Table of Contents Life) increased, the segment revenue decreased 7.4 percent compared to the previous fiscal year, due to the impact of a significant decline in the Japanese stock market. An operating loss of 227.8 billion yen was recorded, a deterioration of 703.1 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year. In the Electronics segment, an operating loss was recorded mainly due to the negative impact from the appreciation of the yen, deterioration in equity in net income (loss) for Sony Ericsson, the higher cost of sales ratio due to intensified price competition and a decrease in sales due to deterioration in the business environment. In the Game segment, the operating loss decreased as a result of PLAYSTATION®3 (PS3) hardware cost reductions and increased sales of PS3 software. In the Pictures segment, operating income decreased primarily due to the lower home entertainment sales and the absence of the prior fiscal years sale of the bankruptcy claim against KirchMedia. In the Financial Services segment, an operating loss was recorded mainly due to deterioration in profitability at Sony Life resulting from a significant decline in the Japanese stock market. In addition, operating income for the prior fiscal year included a gain on the sale of a portion of the site of Sonys former headquarters of 60.7 billion yen which was recorded in Corporate, the recording of a 15.6 billion yen gain relating to the sale of a portion of Sonys semiconductor manufacturing operations in Nagasaki, Japan, including machinery and equipment, which was recorded in the Electronics segment, and a gain on the sale of the urban entertainment complex The Sony Center am Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, Germany, of 10.0 billion yen, which was recorded in All Other. Restructuring In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, Sony incurred 75.4 billion yen of restructuring charges, mainly within the Electronics segment, compared with 47.3 billion yen in the prior fiscal year. Of the overall total of 75.4 billion yen, 56.4 billion yen was for personnel-related restructuring costs. For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010, Sony anticipates recording restructuring charges of 110 billion yen. In the Electronics segment, restructuring charges were 61.9 billion yen compared to 45.6 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Restructuring efforts undertaken in the current year included headcount reduction programs, initiatives to advance rationalization of manufacturing operations, shifting and aggregating manufacturing to lower-cost countries and utilizing the services of third-party original equipment and design manufacturers (OEMs and ODMs). As part of its restructuring efforts, Sony ceased production in February 2009 at Sony Technology Center  Pittsburgh, United States (where LCD televisions were manufactured), and in April 2009 at Sony France S.A.  Dax Technology Center (where tape and other recording media were manufactured). Furthermore, in addition to the factories mentioned above, Sony announced plans to cease or shift production at four sites in Japan and two sites outside of Japan by the end of December 2009. As part of the above restructuring measures, Sony has undergone several headcount reduction programs to further reduce operating costs within its Electronics segment. As a result of these programs, Sony recorded restructuring charges totaling 44.5 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, and these charges were included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The remaining liability balance as of March 31, 2009 was 42.4 billion yen and will be paid throughout the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010. Sony will continue to implement programs to reduce headcount by streamlining business operations, including closure and consolidation of manufacturing sites and the consolidation of headquarters and administrative functions. For more detailed information about restructuring, please refer to Note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 34 Table of Contents Operating Performance Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2008 2009 Percent change (Yen in billions) Sales and operating revenue 8,871.4 7,730.0 12.9 % Equity in net income (loss) of affiliated companies 100.8 (25.1 )  Operating income (loss) 475.3 (227.8 )  Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interest 567.1 (175.0 )  Net income (loss) 369.4 (98.9 )  Sales Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 decreased by 1,141.4 billion yen, or 12.9 percent, to 7,730.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. A further breakdown of sales figures is presented under Operating Performance by Business Segment below. Sales in the analysis of the ratio of cost of sales to sales and the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales, refers only to the net sales and other operating revenue portions of consolidated sales and operating revenue (which excludes financial service revenue). This is because Financial Service expenses are recorded separately from cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated financial statements. The calculations of all ratios below that pertain to business segments include intersegment transactions. Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 decreased by 629.5 billion yen, or 10.0 percent, to 5,660.5 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, and increased from 75.6 percent to 78.5 percent as a percentage of sales. The cost of sales ratio increased from 77.9 percent to 83.5 percent in the Electronics segment, decreased from 93.9 percent to 87.7 percent in the Game segment, and increased from 58.6 percent to 58.8 percent in the Pictures segment compared with the prior fiscal year. In the Electronics segment, there was deterioration in the cost of sales ratio for several products, in particular LCD televisions, PCs and compact digital cameras. The cost of sales ratio in the Game segment improved as a result of PS3 hardware cost reductions and increased sales of PS3 software. Research and development costs (all research and development costs are included within cost of sales) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 decreased by 23.3 billion yen to 497.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of research and development costs to sales was 6.9 percent compared to 6.3 percent in the previous fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 decreased by 28.4 billion yen, or 1.7 percent, to 1,686.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The overall ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales increased from 20.6 percent in the previous fiscal year to 23.4 percent, 16.2 percent to 18.6 percent in the Electronics segment, from 15.8 percent to 17.8 percent in the Games segment and from 35.1 percent to 38.1 percent in the Pictures segment. Personnel-related costs in selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 32.5 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year mainly due to an increase in restructuring charges within the Electronics segment. Overall advertising and publicity expenses for the fiscal year decreased by 32.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year due to the impact of the appreciation of the yen and a decrease in advertising and publicity expenses mainly in the Game segment. Loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net was 38.3 billion yen, compared with a 37.8 billion yen gain on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net in the previous fiscal year. This loss was primarily the result of impairment charges including long-lived asset impairments mainly as a result of downsizing and withdrawal from 35 Table of Contents certain businesses in the Electronics segment as well as goodwill impairment charges in All Other. The gain recorded in the previous fiscal year was primarily from a gain on the sale of a portion of the site of Sonys former headquarters of 60.7 billion yen and a gain on the sale of The Sony Center am Potsdamer Platz in Berlin of 10.0 billion yen. Results of Affiliated Companies Accounted for under the Equity Method Equity in net loss of affiliated companies was 25.1 billion yen, a deterioration of 125.9 billion yen compared to the prior fiscal year. Sony recorded equity in net loss for Sony Ericsson of 30.3 billion yen, compared to equity in net income of 79.5 billion yen in the previous fiscal year, primarily as a result of a less favorable product mix and price pressure, a decrease in unit shipments due to the global economic slowdown, as well as the recording of restructuring charges. Equity in net income for S-LCD, a joint-venture with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Samsung), decreased 0.5 billion yen compared with the prior fiscal year to 6.9 billion yen. Sony also recorded equity in net loss of 6.0 billion yen for SONY BMG, as opposed to equity in net income of 10.0 billion yen in the prior fiscal year. Operating Income (Loss) Operating loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 was 227.8 billion yen, compared with a profit of 475.3 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. The Electronics segment, the Game segment and the Financial Services segment contributed to the operating loss. For a further breakdown of operating income (loss) for each segment, please refer to Operating Performance by Business Segment below. Other Income and Expenses For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, other income decreased by 50.6 billion yen, or 33.9 percent, to 98.8 billion yen, while other expenses decreased by 11.6 billion yen, or 20.2 percent, to 46.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The net amount of other income and other expenses was net other income of 52.8 billion yen, a decrease of 39.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The gain on change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees decreased by 80.2 billion yen, or 97.7 percent compared to the previous fiscal year, to 1.9 billion yen. This decrease is due to the recording of a gain of 81.0 billion yen for the change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees as a result of the global initial public offering of shares of Sony Financial Holdings Inc. (SFH) in connection with the listing of shares on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) in the previous fiscal year. Interest and dividends in other income of 22.3 billion yen was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, a decrease of 12.0 billion yen, or 34.9 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, interest expense totaling 24.4 billion yen was recorded, an increase of 1.4 billion yen, or 6.3 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. In addition, net foreign exchange income of 48.6 billion yen was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, an increase of 43.0 billion yen as compared to the previous fiscal year. Net foreign exchange income was recorded due to the value of the yen, during the first through third quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, appreciating against other currencies from the time that Sony entered into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts. These contracts were entered into by Sony to mitigate the foreign exchange fluctuation risk to cash flows that arises from settlements of foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and accounts payable, as well as foreign currency denominated transactions between consolidated subsidiaries. Income (Loss) before Income Taxes and Minority Interest A loss before income taxes and minority interest of 175.0 billion yen was recorded, compared to income of 567.1 billion yen in the previous fiscal year primarily as a result of deterioration in operating profitability and a decrease in the gain on the change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees mentioned above. 36 Table of Contents Income Taxes Sony recorded an income tax benefit amounting to 72.7 billion yen resulting in an effective tax rate of 41.6 percent. This is mainly due to a loss before income taxes and minority interest during the current fiscal year and the partial reversal of certain deferred tax liabilities amounting to 55.5 billion yen for undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, due to a change in the tax regulations in Japan to treat 95 percent of the dividends from overseas subsidiaries as non-taxable income, partially offset by the impact of the inclusion of equity in net loss of affiliated companies into net loss before income taxes and minority interest, the reversal of certain deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits at Sony Corporation and an increase in valuation allowances recorded on deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards at certain subsidiaries. Minority Interest in Income (Loss) of Consolidated Subsidiaries In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiaries of 3.3 billion yen was recorded, a 2.5 billion yen decrease as compared to the previous fiscal year. Minority interest in loss was recorded in the current fiscal year mainly due to the loss recorded at Sony Life. The operating results of SFH in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 were negatively impacted mainly by the increase in net valuation losses from convertible bonds and an impairment loss on equity securities at Sony Life. Net Income (Loss) Net loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 was 98.9 billion yen, compared with net income of 369.4 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Basic net loss per share was 98.59 yen compared with net income per share of 368.33 yen in the previous fiscal year, and diluted net loss per share was 98.59 yen compared with diluted net income per share of 351.10 yen in the previous fiscal year. Refer to Note 22 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Operating Performance by Business Segment The following discussion is based on segment information. Sales and operating revenue in each business segment include intersegment transactions. Refer to Note 26 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Business Segment Information Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2008 2009 Percent change (Yen in billions) Sales and operating revenue Electronics 6,613.8 5,488.0 −17.0 % Game 1,284.2 1,053.1 −18.0 Pictures 857.9 717.5 −16.4 Financial Services 581.1 538.2 −7.4 All Other 382.2 539.6 +41.2 Elimination (847.9 ) (606.4 )  Consolidated 8,871.4 7,730.0 −12.9 37 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2008 2009 Percent change (Yen in billions) Operating income (loss) Electronics 441.8 (168.1 )  % Game (124.5 ) (58.5 )  Pictures 58.5 29.9 −48.9 Financial Services 22.6 (31.2 )  All Other 60.8 30.4 −50.1 Sub-Total 459.2 (197.4 )  Elimination and unallocated corporate expenses/gains 16.1 (30.3 )  Consolidated 475.3 (227.8 )  Electronics Sales and operating revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 decreased 1,125.9 billion yen, or 17.0 percent, to 5,488.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. An operating loss of 168.1 billion yen was recorded for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, compared to income of 441.8 billion yen for the prior fiscal year. Sales to outside customers decreased 15.2 percent compared with the prior fiscal year. Regarding sales to outside customers by geographical area, sales decreased by 14 percent in Japan, 20 percent in the U.S., 17 percent in Europe, and 11 percent in non-Japan Asia and other geographic areas (Other Areas). In Japan, sales of products such as Blu-ray Disctm recorders increased while sales of products such as CCDs and CMOS image sensors, PCs, a contactless integrated circuit card business and home-use video cameras decreased. In the U.S., sales of products such as Blu-ray Disc players increased while sales of products such as compact digital cameras, PCs and LCD rear-projection televisions, a business from which Sony has already withdrawn, decreased. In Europe, sales of products such as digital single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras increased while sales of home-use video cameras, PCs, compact digital cameras, DVD recorders and recording media decreased. In Other Areas, sales of LCD televisions increased while sales of cathode ray tube (CRT) televisions (a business from which Sony has already withdrawn), home-use video cameras, compact digital cameras and home audio decreased. Performance by Product Category Sales and operating revenue by product category discussed below represent sales to outside customers, which do not include intersegment transactions. Refer to Note 26 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Audio sales decreased by 104.6 billion yen, or 18.7 percent, to 454.0 billion yen. Sales of products, including home audio, car audio, portable audio and personal navigation systems, decreased. Despite an increase in worldwide unit shipments of flash memory digital audio players by approximately 1.2 million units to approximately 7.0 million units, revenue decreased due to the impact of price declines and the appreciation of the yen. Video sales decreased by 237.2 billion yen, or 18.5 percent, to 1,042.0 billion yen. Sales of Blu-ray Disc players and recorders increased due to a significant worldwide increase in unit shipments. Sales of digital SLR cameras increased significantly due to several factors including an expansion of the product line-up. On the other hand, sales of home-use video cameras, compact digital cameras and DVD recorders decreased, with worldwide unit shipments of home-use video cameras decreasing by approximately 1.5 million units to 6.2 million units, compact digital cameras decreasing by approximately 1.5 million units to 22.0 million units and DVD recorders decreasing by approximately 500,000 units to approximately 1.2 million units. Moreover, despite worldwide unit shipments of DVD players increasing by approximately 1.2 million units to approximately 9.7 million units, sales decreased due to the impact of price declines and the appreciation of the yen. 38 Table of Contents Televisions sales decreased by 91.3 billion yen, or 6.7 percent, to 1,275.8 billion yen. Worldwide LCD television unit shipments increased by approximately 4.6 million units to approximately 15.2 million units, but, due to the impact of price declines and the appreciation of the yen, sales increased only slightly. Overall, televisions category sales decreased as sales of LCD rear-projection and CRT televisions, businesses from which Sony has already withdrawn, were contained in the previous fiscal year. Information and Communications sales decreased by 160.7 billion yen, or 14.6 percent, to 942.5 billion yen. Although worldwide PC unit shipments increased by approximately 600,000 units to approximately 5.8 million units, sales decreased due to price declines and the appreciation of the yen. Sales of broadcast- and professional-use products decreased as a result of several factors including a decrease in the sales of high-definition related products. Semiconductors sales decreased by 32.8 billion yen, or 13.8 percent, to 205.1 billion yen. This decrease was primarily due to lower sales of CCDs and CMOS image sensors and system large-scale integration (LSI). Components sales decreased by 170.9 billion yen, or 20.5 percent, to 662.5 billion yen, as sales of products such as recording media, Memory Sticks, optical pickups, low-temperature poli-silicon TFT LCD panels for mobile products, optical disc drives and lithium-ion batteries decreased. Other sales decreased by 101.3 billion yen, or 18.3 percent, to 451.1 billion yen, as sales of mobile phones produced for wireless customers and sales of disc manufacturing decreased. In the Electronics segment, cost of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 decreased by 573.1 billion yen, or 11.1 percent, to 4,581.5 billion yen. The cost of sales ratio deteriorated by 5.6 percentage points to 83.5 percent compared to 77.9 percent in the previous fiscal year. While the cost of sales ratio of such products as Blu-ray Disc players improved, the cost of sales ratio of products such as LCD televisions, PCs and compact digital cameras deteriorated. Restructuring charges recorded in cost of sales amounted to 6.4 billion yen, a decrease of 13.1 billion yen compared with the 19.5 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. This change was due to the recording of significant charges for impairment losses and depreciation on LCD rear-projection televisions in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008. Research and development costs decreased 14.9 billion yen, or 3.4 percent, from 438.7 billion yen in the previous fiscal year to 423.9 billion yen. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 53.0 billion yen, or 4.9 percent, to 1,019.2 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales deteriorated 2.4 percentage points from the 16.2 percent recorded in the previous fiscal year to 18.6 percent. Restructuring charges recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Electronics segment increased by 37.3 billion yen from 12.6 billion yen in the previous fiscal year to 49.9 billion yen, which was one of the main reasons for the above mentioned deterioration. Restructuring charges for both the current and prior fiscal years are mainly attributed to headcount reductions primarily through the early retirement program. Additionally, a portion of the provision of the 51.2 billion yen charges recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 related to notebook computer battery pack recalls and the subsequent global replacement program totaling 2.3 billion yen was reversed in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, compared to 15.7 billion yen reversed in the previous fiscal year, which also contributed to the deterioration in the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales. An additional provision was recorded during the previous fiscal year for free repair expenses relating to Sony products and the products of other companies containing Sony-made charged coupled devices (CCDs), but there was no such provision recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. Loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2.2 billion yen to 28.9 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating profitability of the Electronics segment deteriorated significantly primarily due to the negative impact of the appreciation of the yen, a deterioration in equity in net income (loss) for Sony Ericsson, the higher cost of sales ratio due to intensified price competition, a decrease in sales due to deterioration in the business environment and an increase in restructuring charges included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Regarding profit performance by product, profitability of products such as compact digital cameras, PCs, LCD televisions and home-use video cameras deteriorated significantly. 39 Table of Contents Manufacturing by Geographic Area Slightly lower than 50 percent of the Electronics segments total annual production during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 took place in Japan, including the production of compact digital cameras, home-use video cameras, LCD televisions, PCs, semiconductors and components including batteries and Memory Sticks. Approximately 60 percent of the annual production in Japan was destined for other regions. China accounted for slightly more than 15 percent of total annual production, approximately 70 percent of which was destined for other regions. Asia, excluding Japan and China, accounted for slightly more than 10 percent of total annual production, with approximately 50 percent destined for the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. The Americas and Europe together accounted for the remaining balance of approximately 25 percent of total annual production, most of which was destined for local sale. Game Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 decreased by 231.1 billion yen, or 18.0 percent, to 1,053.1 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating loss decreased by 66.1 billion yen to 58.5 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. Overall hardware sales decreased compared with the previous fiscal year, mainly due to the impact of the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar and the euro, as well as a decrease in unit sales of PS2. Despite an increase in PS3 software sales, overall software sales decreased as a result of the impact of the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar and the euro, as well as a decrease in PS2 software sales. Total worldwide unit sales of hardware and software for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 were as follows: Worldwide hardware unit sales (increase/decrease compared to the prior fiscal year): à PS2: 7.91 million units (a decrease of 5.75 million units) à PSP: 14.11 million units (an increase of 0.30 million units) à PS3: 10.06 million units (an increase of 0.94 million units) Worldwide software unit sales (increase/decrease compared to the prior fiscal year):* à PS2: 83.5. million units (a decrease of 70.5 million units) à PSP: 50.3 million units (a decrease of 5.2 million units) à PS3: 103.7 million units (an increase of 45.8 million units) * Including those both from Sony and third parties under Sony licenses. The operating loss decreased significantly compared with the previous fiscal year. The decrease in the operating loss in the current fiscal year was due to an improvement in the operating performance of the PS3 business as a result of hardware cost reductions and increased software sales despite the impact of the decrease in sales in the PS2 business. Pictures Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 decreased by 140.4 billion yen, or 16.4 percent, to 717.5 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating income decreased by 28.6 billion yen, or 48.9 percent, to 29.9 billion yen and the operating margin decreased from 6.8 percent to 4.2 percent. The results in the Pictures segment consist of the results of Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. (SPE), a U.S.-based subsidiary. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales for the current fiscal year in the Pictures segment decreased by approximately 360.7 million U.S. dollars (approximately 5 percent) and operating income decreased by approximately 234.0 million U.S. dollars (approximately 43 percent). Motion pictures revenues decreased primarily due to lower home entertainment revenues of new release and catalog product. This decrease was due to an accelerated contraction in the market, brought on principally by the global economic downturn, as well as fewer films being sold into the home entertainment market in the current fiscal year. The decrease in motion picture sales was partially offset by higher theatrical revenues driven by the current years successful film slate, which included Hancock, Quantum of Solace 40 Table of Contents and Paul Blart: Mall Cop. Total home entertainment revenues decreased by approximately 500 million U.S. dollars while theatrical revenues increased by approximately 266 million U.S. dollars. The prior years revenues for the Pictures segment also benefited from the sale of a bankruptcy claim against KirchMedia, a former licensee of film and television product. Television revenues increased by approximately 101 million U.S. dollars due to increased advertising revenue from several international channels. Operating income for the segment decreased primarily due to the lower home entertainment sales and the absence of the prior fiscal years sale of the bankruptcy claim against KirchMedia. Operating income from motion picture product decreased by approximately 139 million U.S. dollars, reflecting the negative impact of the lower home entertainment sales. Operating income from television product increased by approximately 70 million U.S. dollars reflecting the benefit of the higher advertising revenues noted above as well as higher equity income, partially due to the gain recorded by an equity affiliate from the sale of a European cable television channel. Current year results were also negatively impacted by 53 million U.S. dollars of restructuring charges. As of March 31, 2009, unrecognized license fee revenue at SPE was approximately 1.2 billion U.S. dollars. SPE expects to record this amount in the future having entered into contracts with television broadcasters to provide those broadcasters with completed motion picture and television products. The license fee revenue will be recognized in the fiscal year in which the product is made available for broadcast. Financial Services Note that the revenue and operating income (loss) at Sony Life, Sony Assurance Inc. (Sony Assurance) and Sony Bank Inc. (Sony Bank) discussed below on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP) differ from the results that Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank disclose on a Japanese statutory basis. Financial Services segment revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 decreased by 42.9 billion yen, or 7.4 percent, to 538.2 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. An operating loss of 31.2 billion yen was recorded compared to operating income of 22.6 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. At Sony Life, revenue was 430.5 billion yen, a 33.5 billion yen or a 7.2 percent decrease compared to the previous fiscal year. Revenue decreased compared to the prior fiscal year due to an increase of net valuation losses from convertible bonds and an increase of impairment losses on equity securities in the general account and an increase of net losses from investments in the separate account, due to a decline in the Japanese stock market during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, that was larger than the decline in the previous fiscal year. Partially offsetting these unfavorable items was an increase in revenue from insurance premiums, reflecting a higher policy amount in force. The operating loss at Sony Life was 29.8 billion yen, compared to operating income of 11.5 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. This deterioration of profitability was mainly due to increased net valuation losses from convertible bonds, an impairment loss on equity securities in the general account and the additional recording of policy reserves for variable life insurance products in the separate account, as a result of the significant decline in the Japanese stock market. This increase in losses more than offset the contribution from increased revenue from insurance premiums at Sony Life. At Sony Assurance, revenue increased due to higher insurance revenue brought about by an expansion in automobile insurance policy amount in force. Operating income increased mainly due to an increase in revenue and an improvement in the net loss ratio. At Sony Bank, revenue decreased as a result of factors including deterioration in foreign exchange gains or losses on foreign-currency denominated customer deposits, and lower returns on investments. Operating income decreased significantly mainly due to a decrease in revenue and an increase in operating expenses. At Sony Finance International, Inc. (Sony Finance), revenue decreased overall due to lower revenue from the leasing business, reflecting the decline in capital expenditures in the weakening economy. The operating loss increased due to the recording of restructuring charges including impairment losses and an early retirement program. 41 Table of Contents Information of Operations Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following charts show Sonys unaudited information of operations for the Financial Services segment alone and for all segments excluding the Financial Services segment. These separate condensed presentations are not required or prepared under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony utilizes this information to analyze its results without the Financial Services segment and believes that these presentations may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding the Financial Services segment are eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below. Fiscal Year Ended March 31 Financial Services segment 2008 2009 (Yen in millions) Financial service revenue 581,121 538,206 Financial service expenses 558,488 567,567 Equity in net income (loss) of affiliated companies  (1,796 ) Operating income (loss) 22,633 (31,157 ) Other income (expenses), net (383 ) 28 Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interest 22,250 (31,129 ) Income taxes and other 11,908 (6,922 ) Net income (loss) 10,342 (24,207 ) Fiscal Year Ended March 31 Sony without the Financial Services segment 2008 2009 (Yen in millions) Net sales and operating revenue 8,324,828 7,212,492 Costs and expenses 7,974,630 7,387,236 Equity in net income (loss) of affiliated companies 100,817 (23,313 ) Operating income (loss) 451,015 (198,057 ) Other income (expenses), net 100,479 58,254 Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interest 551,494 (139,803 ) Income taxes and other 194,190 (61,219 ) Net income (loss) 357,304 (78,584 ) 42 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended March 31 Consolidated 2008 2009 (Yen in millions) Financial service revenue 553,216 523,307 Net sales and operating revenue 8,318,198 7,206,686 8,871,414 7,729,993 Costs and expenses 8,496,932 7,932,667 Equity in net income (loss) of affiliated companies 100,817 (25,109 ) Operating income (loss) 475,299 (227,783 ) Other income (expenses), net 91,835 52,828 Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interest 567,134 (174,955 ) Income taxes and other 197,699 (76,017 ) Net income (loss) 369,435 (98,938 ) All Other During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, sales within All Other were comprised mainly of sales from SONY BMG, which was consolidated by Sony on October 1, 2008 as a wholly-owned subsidiary and renamed Sony Music Entertainment (SME) on January 1, 2009 Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) Inc. (SMEJ), a Japanese domestic recorded music business; Sonys U.S.- based music publishing business; So-net Entertainment Corporation (So-net), an Internet-related service business subsidiary operating mainly in Japan and an advertising agency business in Japan. Trademark royalty income from Sony Ericsson is also included in sales and operating income of All Other. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 increased by 157.4 billion yen, or 41.2 percent, to 539.6 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. Of total sales, 87 percent were sales to outside customers. The increase in sales is mainly due to the consolidation of SME on October 1, 2008. During the six-month period ended March 31, 2009, sales at SME were 169.3 billion yen. On a pro forma basis, this represents a 16 percent decrease on a U.S. dollar basis compared with the same six months of the previous fiscal year when sales of SME were not consolidated. Revenues were negatively impacted by unfavorable exchange rates and the accelerated decline of the worldwide physical music market resulting from the global economic slowdown. Best selling albums that contributed to sales during the six months ended March 31, 2009 included AC/DCs Black Ice, Beyoncés I AM... SASHA FIERCE, P!nks Funhouse and Britney Spears Circus. Excluding the impact of the consolidation of SME, sales of All Other decreased compared to the previous fiscal year. This decrease was mainly due to lower sales at SMEJ in the current fiscal year and the absence of the receipt of a settlement payment related to copyright infringement claims in the prior fiscal year. This was partially offset by higher fee revenue from broadband connection services at So-net. Sales at SMEJ decreased compared to the prior fiscal year mainly due to a decrease in album sales resulting from a continuing decline in the physical music market. SMEJs best-selling albums during the current fiscal year included I LOVED YESTERDAY by YUI, My song Your song by ikimono-gakari and VOICE by Mika Nakashima. In terms of profit performance, operating income for All Other decreased by 30.4 billion yen, or 50.1 percent from the previous fiscal year, to 30.4 billion yen. This decrease was mainly due to the absence of the 10.0 billion yen gain on the sale of The Sony Center am Potsdamer Platz in Berlin and the receipt of the settlement payment related to copyright infringement claims, both recorded in the prior fiscal year. Regarding SME, the current fiscal year includes equity in net loss of 6.0 billion yen and operating income for the six-month period ended March 31, 2009 of 13.7 billion yen, which totaled 7.7 billion yen for the full year. This compared to the prior years results, which included 10.0 billion yen of equity in net income for Sonys then 43 Table of Contents 50 percent share of SME. On a pro forma basis, this 13.7 billion yen operating income for the six-month period ended March 31, 2009 represents a 30 percent decrease compared to the operating income for the comparable period of the prior fiscal year when its results were not consolidated. This decrease was due to lower sales, higher restructuring charges and unfavorable exchange rates. Operating income at SMEJ decreased approximately 10 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year, mainly due to a decrease in album sales. Foreign Exchange Fluctuations and Risk Hedging During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, the average value of the yen was 99.5 yen against the U.S. dollar, and 142.0 yen against the euro, which was 13.8 percent and 12.7 percent higher against the U.S. dollar and the euro, respectively, compared with the average of the previous fiscal year. In the Pictures segment, Sony translates into yen the U.S. dollar consolidated results of SPE (a U.S.-based operation that has worldwide subsidiaries). Therefore, analysis and discussion of certain portions of the operating results of SPE are specified as being on a U.S. dollar basis. Results on a U.S. dollar basis are not on the same basis as Sonys consolidated financial statements and do not conform with U.S. GAAP. Sony does not believe that these measures are a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures. However, Sony believes that results presented on a local currency basis provide additional useful information to investors regarding operating performance. Sonys consolidated results are subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations largely because the countries where manufacturing takes place may be different from those where such products are sold. In order to reduce the risk caused by such fluctuations, Sony employs derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, in accordance with a consistent risk management strategy. Such derivatives are used primarily to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows generated by anticipated intercompany transactions and intercompany accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies. Sony Global Treasury Services Plc (SGTS) in London provides integrated treasury services for Sony Corporation, its subsidiaries, and affiliated companies. Sonys policy is that Sony Corporation and all subsidiaries with foreign exchange exposures should enter into commitments with SGTS for hedging their exposures. Sony Corporation and most of its subsidiaries utilize SGTS for this purpose. The concentration of foreign exchange exposures at SGTS means that, in effect, SGTS hedges most of the net foreign exchange exposure of Sony Corporation, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies. SGTS in turn enters into foreign exchange transactions with creditworthy third-party financial institutions. Most of these transactions are entered into against projected exposures before the actual export and import transactions take place. In general, SGTS hedges the projected exposures on average three months before the actual transactions take place. However, in certain cases SGTS partially hedges the projected exposures one month before the actual transactions take place when business requirements such as shorter production-sales cycles for certain products arise. Sony enters into foreign exchange transactions with financial institutions primarily for hedging purposes. Sony does not use these derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes except for certain derivatives in the Financial Services segment. In the Financial Services segment, Sony uses derivatives for Asset Liability Management (ALM) and trading. To minimize the adverse effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on its financial results, particularly in the Electronics segment, Sony seeks, when appropriate, to localize material and parts procurement, design, and manufacturing operations in areas outside of Japan. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts and other derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are marked-to-market with changes in value recognized in other income and expenses. The notional amount and the net fair value of all the foreign exchange derivative contracts as of March 31, 2009 were 1,951.0 billion yen and a liability of 4.5 billion yen, respectively. 44 Table of Contents Operating Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2008 compared with the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2007 Overview Sonys sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 increased 6.9 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. Sales within the Electronics segment and the Game segment increased while sales for the Pictures segment and revenue for the Financial Services segment decreased. In the Electronics segment, while there was a decline in sales of such products as LCD rear-projection televisions, sales to outside customers increased 9.0 percent compared with the previous fiscal year mainly due to an increase in sales of LCD televisions, PCs and compact digital cameras. Sales within the Game segment increased 26.3 percent compared to the previous fiscal year primarily as a result of a significant increase in sales of PS3. In the Pictures segment, sales decreased 11.2 percent compared to the previous fiscal year as motion picture sales decreased primarily due to fewer films being released during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008. Revenues decreased 10.5 percent within the Financial Services segment primarily due to net losses from investments in the separate account and the deterioration in net valuation gains from convertible bonds in the general account reflecting a significant decline in the Japanese stock market partially offset by an increase in insurance premium revenue at Sony Life. Operating income increased 216.0 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income within the Electronics segment increased 75.8 percent mainly as a result of an increase in sales and the positive impact from the depreciation of the yen against the euro. In the previous fiscal year, a 51.2 billion yen provision was recorded for charges related to recalls by certain notebook computer makers and the subsequent global replacement program by Sony and certain notebook computer makers involving battery packs containing Sony-manufactured battery cells. A portion of the provision totaling 15.7 billion yen was reversed in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 based on the actual results of recalls and replacements as compared to original estimates. In the Game segment, operating losses decreased by 107.8 billion yen to 124.5 billion yen primarily due to a decrease in the operating losses of the PS3 business as a result of successful PS3 hardware cost reductions and increased sales of PS3 software. In the Pictures segment, operating income increased 119.1 percent compared with the previous fiscal year primarily due to the strong performance of prior year films in the home entertainment and television markets as well as the benefit from the sale of a bankruptcy claim against KirchMedia, a former licensee of film and television product, while the prior year was negatively impacted by losses recognized on Sonys equity interest in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. (MGM). As of March 31, 2007, Sony no longer had any book basis in MGM and, accordingly, no additional losses were recorded during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008. In the Financial Services segment, operating income decreased 73.1 percent as compared to the previous fiscal year as a result of deterioration in net valuation gains from convertible bonds and an impairment loss on equity securities in the general account of Sony Life reflecting a significant decline in the Japanese stock market. Operating income in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 included one-time gains primarily from a gain on the sale of a portion of the site of Sonys former headquarters of 60.7 billion yen which was recorded in Corporate, a 15.6 billion yen gain which was recorded in the operating income of the Electronics segment relating to the sale of a portion of Sonys semiconductor operations in Nagasaki, Japan, including machinery and equipment, and a 10.0 billion yen gain on the sale of The Sony Center am Potsdamer Platz in Berlin which was recorded in the operating income of All Other. Operating income in the previous fiscal year included a gain on the sale of a portion of the site of Sonys former headquarters of 21.7 billion yen, of which 2.6 billion yen was recorded within All Other and the remaining amount was recorded in Corporate. Operating income in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 included a gain from the reversal of a portion of a legal provision as a result of the resolution of a legal matter, while a comparable gain was recorded in the previous fiscal year attributed to the reversal of a portion of patent-related provisions. Restructuring In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, Sony recorded restructuring charges of 47.3 billion yen, an increase from the 38.8 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. The primary restructuring activities were in the Electronics segment. Of the total 47.3 billion yen incurred, Sony recorded 12.6 billion yen in personnel-related costs. 45 Table of Contents Restructuring charges in the Electronics segment amounted to 45.6 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, compared with 37.4 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Sony made the decision to exit the LCD rear-projection television business in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 due to the shrinking market for these products. In association with this action, Sony recorded 19.7 billion yen of restructuring charges consisting mainly of inventory write downs. Of this amount, 11.9 billion yen was recorded in cost of sales and 6.7 billion yen was recorded in loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net in the consolidated statements of income. This phase of the restructuring program was completed in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, and the remaining liability balance as of March 31, 2008 was 1.6 billion yen, which was paid during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. In addition to the restructuring efforts described above, Sony has undergone several headcount reduction programs to further reduce operating costs within its Electronics segment. As a result of these programs, Sony recorded restructuring charges totaling 11.0 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, and these charges were included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The remaining liability balance as of March 31, 2008 was 9.4 billion yen and was paid throughout the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. Operating Performance Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2007 2008 Percent change (Yen in billions) Sales and operating revenue 8,295.7 8,871.4 +6.9 % Equity in net income of affiliated companies 78.7 100.8 +28.2 Operating income 150.4 475.3 +216.0 Income before income taxes and minority interest 180.7 567.1 +213.9 Net income 126.3 369.4 +192.4 Sales Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 increased by 575.7 billion yen, or 6.9 percent, to 8,871.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. A further breakdown of sales figures is presented under Operating Performance by Business Segment below. Sales in the analysis of the ratio of cost of sales, including research and development costs, and selling, general and administrative expenses to sales refers only to the net sales and other operating revenue portions of consolidated sales and operating revenue, and excludes financial service revenue. This is because financial service expenses are recorded separately from cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. The calculations of all ratios below that pertain to business segments include intersegment transactions. Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 increased by 400.4 billion yen, or 6.8 percent, to 6,290.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, and decreased from 76.8 percent to 75.6 percent as a percentage of sales. The cost of sales ratio decreased from 78.8 percent to 77.9 percent in the Electronics segment, decreased from 102.8 percent to 93.9 percent in the Game segment, and decreased from 60.3 percent to 58.6 percent in the Pictures segment compared with the previous fiscal year. In the Electronics segment, there was an improvement in the cost of sales ratio for several products, in particular PCs, compact digital cameras and video cameras. The cost of sales ratio in the Game segment improved primarily as a result of PS3 hardware cost reductions and increased sales of PS3 software. In the Pictures segment, the cost of sales ratio decreased compared to the previous fiscal year mainly due to the higher home entertainment and television revenues from prior year films. 46 Table of Contents Personnel-related costs included in cost of sales were 487.8 billion yen, an increase of 30.5 billion yen, primarily recorded within the Electronics segment. Research and development costs (all research and development costs are included within cost of sales) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 decreased by 23.4 billion yen to 520.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of research and development costs to sales was 6.3 percent compared to 7.1 percent in the previous fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 decreased by 74.0 billion yen, or 4.1 percent, to 1,714.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales decreased from 23.3 percent in the previous fiscal year to 20.6 percent. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales decreased from 18.2 percent to 16.2 percent in the Electronics segment compared with the previous fiscal year. This improvement is due to the recording of the provision for charges related to the notebook computer battery pack recalls and subsequent global replacement program in the previous fiscal year and a reversal of the portion of the provision in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 based on the actual results of recalls and replacements as compared to original estimates. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales decreased from 20.0 percent to 15.8 percent in the Game segment and from 35.2 percent to 35.1 percent in the Pictures segment. Personnel-related costs in selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 19.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year mainly within the Electronics and the Pictures segments. Advertising and publicity expenses for the fiscal year decreased by 46.2 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year primarily due to decreased advertising and publicity expenses within the Pictures segment. Gain on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net was 37.8 billion yen, compared with a 5.8 billion yen loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net recorded in the previous fiscal year. The gain recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 is primarily from a gain on the sale of a portion of the site of Sonys former headquarters of 60.7 billion yen and gain on the sale of The Sony Center am Potsdamer Platz in Berlin of 10.0 billion yen. A gain on the sale of a portion of the site of Sonys former headquarters of 21.7 billion yen was recorded in the previous fiscal year. Results of Affiliated Companies Accounted for under the Equity Method Equity in net income of affiliated companies during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 was 100.8 billion yen, an increase of 22.2 billion yen, or 28.2 percent compared to the previous fiscal year. Equity in net income of affiliated companies reported for Sony Ericsson was 79.5 billion yen, a decrease of 5.8 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year, due to higher research and development expenses as a percentage of sales. Sony recorded equity in net income of 10.0 billion yen for SONY BMG, an increase of 5.0 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to a reduction in restructuring costs compared to the previous fiscal year, lower marketing costs, a reduction in overhead costs from continued restructuring, a gain on the sale of an interest in a joint venture of SONY BMG and the favorable impact of currency fluctuations. Sony recorded equity in net income of 7.4 billion yen, a 2.4 billion yen increase compared to the prior fiscal year, for S-LCD, a joint-venture with Samsung for the manufacture of amorphous TFT LCD panels. Sony did not record any equity gain or loss for MGM in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 compared to equity in net loss of 18.9 billion yen recorded in the prior fiscal year. As of March 31, 2007, Sony no longer had any book basis in MGM and, accordingly, no additional losses were recorded during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008. Operating Income Operating income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 increased by 324.9 billion yen, or 216.0 percent, to 475.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The operating income margin increased from 1.8 percent to 5.4 percent. In descending order by yen amount, the Electronics segment, All Other, the Pictures segment and the Financial Services segment contributed to operating income. An operating loss was recorded within the Game 47 Table of Contents segment. For a further breakdown of operating income (loss) for each segment, please refer to Operating Performance by Business Segment below. Other Income and Expenses For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, other income increased by 54.3 billion yen, or 57.0 percent, to 149.4 billion yen, while other expenses decreased by 7.3 billion yen, or 11.2 percent, to 57.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The net amount of other income and other expenses was net other income of 91.8 billion yen, an increase of 61.5 billion yen, compared with the previous fiscal year. The gain on change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees increased by 50.5 billion yen, or 160.4 percent compared to the previous fiscal year, to 82.1 billion yen. This increase is due to the recording of a gain of 81.0 billion yen for the change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees as a result of the global initial public offering of shares of SFH in connection with the listing of shares on the First Section of the TSE in October 2007. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, there was a gain on change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees recorded on the sale of a portion of the stock held in StylingLife Holdings Inc. Interest and dividends in other income of 34.3 billion yen was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, an increase of 6.0 billion yen, or 21.4 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, interest expense totaling 22.9 billion yen was recorded, a decrease of 4.3 billion yen, or 15.9 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. In addition, net foreign exchange income of 5.6 billion yen was recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, compared to a net foreign exchange loss of 18.8 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Net foreign exchange income was recorded due to the value of the yen, especially during the second through fourth quarters of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, appreciating in value against other currencies from the time that Sony entered into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts. These contracts are entered into by Sony to mitigate the foreign exchange rate risk to cash flows that arises from settlements of foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and accounts payable, as well as foreign currency denominated transactions between consolidated subsidiaries. Income before Income Taxes and Minority Interest Income before income taxes and minority interest for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 increased 386.4 billion yen, or 213.9 percent, to 567.1 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year, primarily as a result of the increase in operating income and the gain on the change in interest in subsidiaries and equity investees mentioned above. Income Taxes During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, Sony recorded 203.5 billion yen of income taxes, resulting in an effective tax rate of 35.9 percent, which was lower than the Japanese statutory tax rate. This was mainly due to the impact of the inclusion of equity in net income of affiliated companies into net income before income taxes and minority interest. In the previous fiscal year, the effective tax rate was 29.8 percent, which was lower than the Japanese statutory tax rate as a result of the impact of the inclusion of equity in net income of affiliates into net income before income taxes and minority interest. Minority Interest in Income (Loss) of Consolidated Subsidiaries In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiaries of 5.8 billion yen was recorded compared to minority interest in income of 0.5 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Minority interest in loss was recorded mainly due to the loss recorded at SFH subsequent to the change in Sony Corporations ownership. Sony Corporations ownership percentage in SFH was reduced from 100 percent to 60 percent after the global initial public offering of SFH shares during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008. The operating results 48 Table of Contents of SFH in the second half of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 were negatively impacted mainly by the deterioration in net valuation gains from convertible bonds and an impairment loss on equity securities at Sony Life. Net Income Net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 increased by 243.1 billion yen, or 192.4 percent, to 369.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. As a percentage of sales, net income increased from 1.5 percent to 4.2 percent. Return on stockholders equity increased from 3.8 percent to 10.8 percent. (This ratio is calculated by dividing net income by the simple average of stockholders equity at the end of the previous fiscal year and at the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008.) Basic net income per share was 368.33 yen compared with 126.15 yen in the previous fiscal year, and diluted net income per share was 351.10 yen compared with 120.29 yen in the previous fiscal year. Refer to notes 2 and 22 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Operating Performance by Business Segment The following discussion is based on segment information. Sales and operating revenue in each business segment include intersegment transactions. Refer to note 26 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Operating income increased by 49 Table of Contents 190.5 billion yen, or 75.8 percent, to 441.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year and the operating income to sales ratio increased from 4.1 percent to 6.7 percent. Sales to outside customers on a yen basis increased 9.0 percent compared to the previous fiscal year. Regarding sales to outside customers by geographical area, sales decreased by 2 percent in Japan, but increased by 2 percent in the U.S., by 11 percent in Europe, and by 19 percent in non-Japan Asia and Other Areas. In Japan, sales of products such as CCDs and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors increased while sales of mobile phones produced for wireless customers decreased. In the U.S., sales of products such as LCD rear-projection and CRT televisions decreased while sales of products such as LCD televisions, compact digital cameras and PCs increased. In Europe, sales of products such as LCD televisions and PCs increased while sales of mobile phones produced for wireless customers decreased. In Other Areas, sales of LCD televisions, compact digital cameras and PCs increased while sales of CRT televisions decreased. Performance by Product Category Sales and operating revenue by product category discussed below represent sales to outside customers, which do not include intersegment transactions. Refer to Note 26 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Audio sales increased by 35.7 billion yen, or 6.8 percent, to 558.6 billion yen. Sales of flash memory digital audio players increased as worldwide unit shipments increased by approximately 1.3 million units to approximately 5.8 million units. Sales of home audio, headphones and personal navigation systems also increased. On the other hand, due to a shift in market demand, sales of CD format headphone stereos decreased. Video sales increased by 136.1 billion yen, or 11.9 percent, to 1,279.2 billion yen. Sales of compact digital cameras increased as worldwide unit shipments increased by approximately 6.5 million units to approximately 23.5 million units. Sales of home-use video cameras increased as worldwide unit shipments increased by approximately 250,000 units to approximately 7.7 million units. Sales of Blu-ray Disc recorders and players also increased. On the other hand, sales of DVD recorders and players decreased, with unit shipments of DVD recorders decreasing by approximately 150,000 units to approximately 1.7 million units and unit shipments of DVD players decreasing by approximately 900,000 units to approximately 7.0 million units. Televisions sales increased by 140.1 billion yen, or 11.4 percent, to 1,367.1 billion yen. There was a significant increase in worldwide sales of LCD televisions, as worldwide shipments increased by approximately 4.3 million units, to approximately 10.6 million units. On the other hand, there was a decrease in sales of LCD rear-projection and CRT televisions as Sony decided to exit these businesses due to the shrinking market for these products. Information and Communications sales increased by 149.0 billion yen, or 15.6 percent, to 1,103.2 billion yen. Sales of PCs increased as worldwide unit shipments increased by approximately 1.2 million units to approximately 5.2 million units. Sales of broadcast- and professional-use products increased as a result of favorable sales of high-definition related products. Semiconductors sales increased by 18.3 billion yen, or 8.3 percent, to 237.9 billion yen. The increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of CCDs and CMOS image sensors. Components sales decreased by 2.2 billion yen, or 0.3 percent, to 833.3 billion yen. Sales of lithium-ion batteries and low-temperature polysilicon TFT LCD panels for mobile devices increased. On the other hand, sales of DVD+/-R/RW drives decreased due to a decline in unit selling prices, although unit sales increased in association with an expansion of the market. Other sales increased by 11.2 billion yen, or 2.1 percent, to 552.4 billion yen. Although sales of mobile phones produced for wireless customers in Japan and Europe decreased, sales of the disc manufacturing business increased. In the Electronics segment, cost of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 increased by 372.4 billion yen, or 7.8 percent, to 5,154.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The cost of sales ratio improved by 0.9 percentage points to 77.9 percent compared to 78.8 percent in the previous fiscal year. While the cost of sales ratio of such products as PCs, compact digital cameras and home-use video cameras improved, the cost of 50 Table of Contents sales ratio of products such as LCD televisions deteriorated. Restructuring charges recorded in cost of sales amounted to 19.5 billion yen, an increase of 7.0 billion yen compared with the 12.6 billion yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. Research and development costs decreased 1.6 billion yen, or 0.4 percent, from 440.4 billion yen in the previous fiscal year to 438.7 billion yen. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 34.0 billion yen, or 3.1 percent, to 1,072.2 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Although advertising and marketing expenses and personnel expenses increased for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased as a provision of 51.2 billion yen was recorded in the previous fiscal year for charges related to the notebook computer battery pack recalls and subsequent global replacement program, while a portion of the provision totaling 15.7 billion yen was reversed in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 based on the actual results of recalls and replacements as compared to original estimates. An additional provision was recorded during the fiscal year for free repair expenses relating to Sony products and the products of other companies containing Sony-made CCDs, but this amount was less than in the previous year. Of the restructuring charges recorded in the Electronics segment, the amount recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 1.4 billion yen from 14.0 billion yen in the previous fiscal year to 12.6 billion yen. This 12.6 billion yen was for headcount reductions, including reductions through the early retirement program. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales decreased 2.0 percentage points from the 18.2 percent recorded in the previous fiscal year to 16.2 percent. Loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7.5 billion yen to 31.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. This amount includes a 6.7 billion yen loss on sale, disposal or impairment of assets, net on LCD rear-projection televisions. The amount of operating income recorded in the Electronics segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 increased significantly due to the impact of the provision recorded in the previous fiscal year for charges related to the notebook computer battery pack recalls and subsequent global replacement program, the reversal of a portion of the provision in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, increased sales of the segment and the positive impact of the depreciation of the yen against the euro. Also contributing to the increase in Electronics segment profit was the recording of a 15.6 billion yen gain relating to the sale of a portion of Sonys semiconductor operations in Nagasaki, Japan, including machinery and equipment. Regarding profit performance by product, profitability of products such as LCD televisions worsened due to unit selling price declines while profit increased mainly for PCs and compact digital cameras, which experienced higher sales for system LSIs, which saw an increase in sales of semiconductors for the Game segment, and for home-use video cameras, which experienced increased sales of high value-added models. Manufacturing by Geographic Area Approximately 50 percent of the Electronics segments total annual production during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 took place in Japan, including the production of compact digital cameras, home-use video cameras, LCD televisions, PCs, semiconductors and components such as batteries and Memory Sticks. Approximately 60 percent of the annual production in Japan was destined for other regions. China accounted for approximately 15 percent of total annual production, approximately 70 percent of which was destined for other regions. Asia, excluding Japan and China, accounted for approximately 10 percent of total annual production, with approximately 60 percent destined for Japan, the U.S. and Europe. The Americas and Europe together accounted for the remaining balance of approximately 25 percent of total annual production, most of which was destined for local distribution and sale. Game Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 increased by 267.5 billion yen, or 26.3 percent, to 1,284.2 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. An operating loss of 124.5 billion yen was recorded for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, which was a decrease of 107.8 billion yen from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. By region, although sales decreased slightly in Japan, there was an increase in sales in North America and Europe. 51 Table of Contents Overall hardware sales increased as a result of a significant increase in sales of PS3, as well as an increase in sales of PSP® (PlayStation®Portable) (PSP), for which a new slimmer, lighter model was released. Sales of PS2 decreased compared to the previous fiscal year. Overall software sales increased as a result of an increase in PS3 software sales compared to the previous fiscal year. Total worldwide unit sales of hardware and software for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 were as follows: Worldwide hardware unit sales (increase/decrease year-on-year):* à PS2: 13.73 million units (a decrease of 0.98 million units) à PSP: 13.89 million units (an increase of 4.36 million units) à PS3: 9.24 million units (an increase of 5.63 million units) Worldwide software unit sales (increase/decrease year-on-year):*/** à PS2: 154.0 million units (a decrease of 39.5 million units) à PSP: 55.5 million units (an increase of 0.8 million units) à PS3: 57.9 million units (an increase of 44.6 million units) * For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, the method of reporting hardware and software unit sales has been changed from production shipments to recorded sales. In accordance with this change, the numbers for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 have been restated. ** Including those both from Sony and third parties under Sony licenses. The operating loss decreased significantly compared with the previous fiscal year. Although there was a loss arising from the strategic pricing of PS3 hardware at points lower than its production cost, the operating losses of the PS3 business decreased as a result of successful hardware cost reductions and increased sales of software. The strong performance of the PSP business with the introduction of a new model also contributed to the decrease in the operating loss of the overall Game segment. Due to these reasons, the cost of sales to sales ratio decreased 8.9 percentage points, from 102.8 percent in the previous fiscal year, to 93.9 percent. The ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to sales decreased 4.2 percentage points from 20.0 percent in the previous fiscal year, to 15.8 percent mainly due to decreased advertising and marketing expenses. Pictures Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 decreased by 108.3 billion yen, or 11.2 percent, to 857.9 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating income increased by 31.8 billion yen, or 119.1 percent, to 58.5 billion yen and the operating margin increased from 2.8 percent to 6.8 percent. The results in the Pictures segment consist of the results of Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. (SPE), a U.S.-based subsidiary. On a U.S. dollar basis, sales for the fiscal year in the Pictures segment decreased approximately 9 percent and operating income increased by approximately 142 percent. Sales decreased primarily due to lower worldwide theatrical and home entertainment revenues as fewer films were released in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, as compared to the number of films released in the previous fiscal year. Major films released in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 that contributed to both theatrical and home entertainment revenues included Spider-Man 3 and Superbad. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 release slate decreased approximately 1.2 billion U.S. dollars as compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in revenues from films released in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 was partially offset by an approximately 300 million U.S. dollar increase in home entertainment and television revenues from films of the previous fiscal year (i.e., films that had their initial U.S. theatrical release in the prior fiscal year). Total revenues for the Pictures segment also benefited from the sale of a bankruptcy claim against KirchMedia, a former licensee of film and television product. Television product revenues increased by approximately 29 million U.S. dollars primarily as a result of higher advertising and subscription sales from several international channels. 52 Table of Contents Operating income for the segment increased primarily due to the strong performance of prior year films in the home entertainment and television markets. Operating income from prior year films increased approximately 225 million U.S. dollars, due to the strong performance from a number of films including Ghost Rider, Stomp the Yard and Casino Royale. Current year operating income also benefited from the sale of the bankruptcy claim and the higher television business revenues referred to above, while the operating income of the prior year was negatively impacted by losses recognized on Sonys equity interest in MGM. As of March 31, 2007, Sony no longer has any book basis in MGM and, accordingly, no additional losses were recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008. As of March 31, 2008, unrecognized license fee revenue at SPE was approximately 1.3 billion U.S. dollars. SPE expects to record this amount in the future having entered into contracts with television broadcasters to provide those broadcasters with completed motion picture and television products. The license fee revenue will be recognized in the fiscal year in which the product is made available for broadcast. Financial Services Note that the revenue and operating income at Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank discussed below on a U.S. GAAP basis differ from the results that Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank disclose on a Japanese statutory basis. Financial Services segment revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 decreased by 68.2 billion yen, or 10.5 percent, to 581.1 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Operating income decreased by 61.5 billion yen, or 73.1 percent, to 22.6 billion yen and the operating income margin decreased to 3.9 percent compared with 13.0 percent in the previous fiscal year. At Sony Life, revenue decreased by 81.0 billion yen, or 14.9 percent, to 464.1 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Although revenue from insurance premiums increased due to an increase in insurance-in-force, revenue decreased due to a net loss from investments in the separate account, deterioration in net valuation gains from convertible bonds and an impairment loss on equity securities in the general account reflecting a significant decline in the Japanese stock market this fiscal year. Operating income at Sony Life decreased by 70.1 billion yen, or 85.9 percent, to 11.5 billion yen. This decrease was mainly due to deterioration in net valuation gains from convertible bonds and an impairment loss on equity securities in the general account which more than offset the contribution from increased insurance premium revenue. At Sony Assurance, revenue increased due to higher insurance revenue brought about by a steady expansion in automobile insurance policy in force. Despite higher insurance revenue, operating income decreased due to deterioration in the net loss ratio and expense ratio (the ratio of sales, general and administrative expenses and commissions to net premiums written). At Sony Bank, revenue increased mainly due to foreign exchange valuation gains from part of Sony Banks foreign currency deposits brought about by a significant appreciation of the yen. As a result, operating income significantly increased. At Sony Finance, a leasing and credit financing business subsidiary in Japan, revenue increased overall mainly due to revenue increases from the electronic settlement business and the credit card business. The operating loss at Sony Finance decreased overall primarily due to increased profit at the electronic settlement business and the leasing business, as well as a decrease in losses at the credit card business. 53 Table of Contents Information of Operations Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following charts show Sonys unaudited information of operations for the Financial Services segment alone and for all segments excluding the Financial Services segment. These separate condensed presentations are not required or prepared under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony utilizes this information to analyze its results without the Financial Services segment and believes that these presentations may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding the Financial Services segment are eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below. Fiscal Year Ended March 31 Financial Services segment 2007 2008 (Yen in millions) Financial service revenue 649,341 581,121 Financial service expenses 565,199 558,488 Operating income 84,142 22,633 Other income (expenses), net 9,886 (383 ) Income before income taxes and minority interest 94,028 22,250 Income taxes and other 33,536 11,908 Net income 60,492 10,342 Fiscal Year Ended March 31 Sony without the Financial Services segment 2007 2008 (Yen in millions) Net sales and operating revenue 7,680,578 8,324,828 Costs and expenses 7,694,375 7,974,630 Equity in net income of affiliated companies 78,654 100,817 Operating income 64,857 451,015 Other income, net 27,917 100,479 Income before income taxes and minority interest 92,774 551,494 Income taxes and other 20,663 194,190 Net income 72,111 357,304 Fiscal Year Ended March 31 Consolidated 2007 2008 (Yen in millions) Financial service revenue 624,282 553,216 Net sales and operating revenue 7,671,413 8,318,198 8,295,695 8,871,414 Costs and expenses 8,223,945 8,496,932 Equity in net income of affiliated companies 78,654 100,817 Operating income 150,404 475,299 Other income, net 30,287 91,835 Income before income taxes and minority interest 180,691 567,134 Income taxes and other 54,363 197,699 Net income 126,328 369,435 54 Table of Contents All Other During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, sales within All Other were comprised mainly of sales from SMEJ, a Japanese domestic recorded music business; Sonys U.S.-based music publishing business; So-net, an Internet-related service business subsidiary operating mainly in Japan; and an advertising agency business in Japan. Trademark royalty income from Sony Ericsson is also included in sales and operating income of All Other. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 increased by 27.1 billion yen, or 7.6 percent, to 382.2 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Of total sales, 82 percent were sales to outside customers. In terms of profit performance, operating income for All Other increased by 28.0 billion yen, or 85.3 percent from the previous fiscal year, to 60.8 billion yen. The increase in sales is mainly due to the contribution of sales from Famous Music LLC (Famous Music), a U.S-based music publishing company that was acquired by Sonys U.S.-based music publishing subsidiary Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC (Sony ATV) and consolidated in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, the receipt of a settlement payment related to copyright infringement claims and an increase in sales at SMEJ and So-net. An increase in trademark royalty income from Sony Ericsson also contributed to the increase in sales. Sales at SMEJ increased compared with the previous fiscal year mainly due to an increase in music download sales. Best selling albums that contributed to sales during the fiscal year included ORANGE RANGEs ORANGE and RANGE, Ken Hirais FAKIN POP and YUIs CANT BUY MY LOVE. Sales at So-net increased compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to higher fee revenue from broadband connections, especially fiber-optic. Operating income for All Other increased compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to recording a 10.0 billion yen gain on the sale of The Sony Center am Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, the receipt of a settlement payment related to copyright infringement claims, an increase in trademark royalty income from Sony Ericsson and an increase in operating income at So-net. Operating income at SMEJ increased approximately 4 percent compared with the previous fiscal year, mainly due to an increase in animation DVD sales as well as the above-mentioned increase in music download sales. Part of the gain on the sale of a portion of Sonys former headquarters site in the amount of 2.6 billion yen was included in operating income within All Other in the previous fiscal year. Foreign Exchange Fluctuations and Risk Hedging During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, the average value of the yen was 113.3 yen against the U.S. dollar, and 160.0 yen against the euro, which was 2.4 percent higher against the U.S. dollar and 7.1 percent lower against the euro, respectively, compared with the average of the previous fiscal year. In the Pictures segment, Sony translates into yen the U.S. dollar consolidated results of SPE (a U.S.-based operation that has worldwide subsidiaries). Therefore, analysis and discussion of certain portions of the operating results of SPE are specified as being on a U.S. dollar basis. Results on a U.S. dollar basis are not on the same basis as Sonys consolidated financial statements and do not conform with U.S. GAAP. Sony does not believe that these measures are a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures. However, Sony believes that results presented on a local currency basis provide additional useful information to investors regarding operating performance. Sonys consolidated results are subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations largely because the countries where manufacturing takes place may be different from those where such products are sold. In order to reduce the risk caused by such fluctuations, Sony employs derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, in accordance with a consistent risk management strategy. Such derivatives are used primarily to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows generated by anticipated intercompany transactions and intercompany accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies. SGTS in London provides integrated treasury services for Sony Corporation, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies. Sonys policy is that Sony Corporation and all subsidiaries with foreign exchange exposures should 55 Table of Contents enter into commitments with SGTS for hedging their exposures. Sony Corporation and most of its subsidiaries utilize SGTS for this purpose. The concentration of foreign exchange exposures at SGTS means that, in effect, SGTS hedges most of the net foreign exchange exposure of Sony Corporation and its subsidiaries. SGTS in turn enters into foreign exchange transactions with creditworthy third-party financial institutions. Most of the transactions are entered into against projected exposures before the actual export and import transactions take place. In general, SGTS hedges the projected exposures on average three months before the actual transactions take place. However, in certain cases SGTS partially hedges the projected exposures one month before the actual transactions take place when business requirements such as shorter production-sales cycles for certain products arise. Sony enters into foreign exchange transactions with financial institutions primarily for hedging purposes. Sony does not use these derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes except for certain derivatives in the Financial Services segment. In the Financial Services segment, Sony uses derivatives for ALM and trading. To minimize the adverse effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on its financial results, particularly in the Electronics segment, Sony seeks, when appropriate, to localize material and parts procurement, design, and manufacturing operations in areas outside of Japan. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007 and 2008, these cash flow hedges were fully effective. Foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts and other derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are marked-to-market with changes in value recognized in other income and expenses. The notional amount and the net fair value of all the foreign exchange derivative contracts as of March 31, 2008 were 2,265.5 billion yen and an asset of 22.6 billion yen respectively. Assets, Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Assets Total assets as of March 31, 2009 decreased by 539.2 billion yen, or 4.3 percent, to 12,013.5 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Total assets as of March 31, 2009 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment decreased by 814.0 billion yen, or 11.3 percent, to 6,370.9 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Total assets as of March 31, 2009 in the Financial Services segment increased by 280.0 billion yen, or 5.0 percent, to 5,905.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Current Assets Current assets as of March 31, 2009 decreased by 1,389.0 billion yen, or 27.7 percent, to 3,620.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Current assets as of March 31, 2009 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 995.3 billion yen, or 25.9 percent, to 2,841.4 billion yen. Cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2009 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased 383.7 billion yen, or 40.4 percent, to 565.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This was primarily due to a decrease in operating cash flow as a result of the deterioration in net income (loss), payments for manufacturing equipment in the Electronics segment and the acquisition of Bertelsmanns 50 percent interest in SONY BMG exceeding proceeds received mainly from the sales of semiconductor fabrication equipment in the prior year. Refer to Cash Flows below. Notes and accounts receivable, trade (net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns) as of March 31, 2009, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased 236.3 billion yen, or 21.8 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year-end to 847.2 billion yen. This was primarily due to a decrease in sales in the Electronics segment. Other current assets as of March 31, 2009 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased 375.4 billion yen, or 20.8 percent, to 1,426.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This was due to a decrease in inventory within the Electronics segment and the collection in the current year of a receivable 56 Table of Contents recorded in the previous fiscal year relating to the sale of a portion of Sonys semiconductor operations in Nagasaki, Japan, including machinery and equipment. Inventories as of March 31, 2009 decreased by 208.5 billion yen, or 20.4 percent, to 813.1 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This decrease was primarily due to adjustments in production in the Electronics segment resulting from the decrease in sales. The inventory to cost of sales turnover ratio (based on the average of inventories at the end of each fiscal year and the previous fiscal year) was 1.94 months compared to 1.87 months at the end of the previous fiscal year. Sony considers this level of inventory to be appropriate in the aggregate. Current assets as of March 31, 2009 in the Financial Services segment decreased by 374.0 billion yen, or 31.0 percent, to 831.1 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This was primarily due to the transfer of assets managed at Sony Bank into Japanese government bonds and other marketable securities in the current fiscal year. These assets were managed temporarily in the call loan market due to a rapid increase in deposits at Sony Bank at the end of the previous fiscal year. Investments and Advances Investments and advances as of March 31, 2009 increased by 462.8 billion yen, or 10.7 percent, to 4,798.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Investments and advances as of March 31, 2009 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 179.1 billion yen, or 34.5 percent, to 339.4 billion yen. This was primarily due to the impact of the decrease in investments in affiliated companies resulting from the deterioration of results at Sony Ericsson. Investments and advances as of March 31, 2009 in the Financial Services segment increased by 630.8 billion yen, or 16.3 percent, to 4,510.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This increase was primarily due to investments mainly in Japanese fixed income securities by Sony Life, which increased assets as a result of an expansion of its business. Investments and advances also increased due to a change in assets under management from call loans to Japanese government bonds and other marketable securities, and an increase in mortgage loans at Sony Bank. Also refer to Investments below. Property, Plant and Equipment (after deduction of accumulated depreciation) Property, plant and equipment as of March 31, 2009 decreased by 67.5 billion yen, or 5.4 percent, to 1,175.9 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Property, plant and equipment as of March 31, 2009 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 59.8 billion yen, or 5.0 percent, to 1,145.1 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Capital expenditures (additions to property, plant and equipment) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 decreased by 3.7 billion yen, or 1.1 percent, to 332.1 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. Capital expenditures in the Electronics segment decreased by 62.1 billion yen, or 2.0 percent, to 300.5 billion yen. Of this amount, approximately 80 billion yen was used for capital expenditures in the semiconductor business, including CCDs and CMOS image sensors. Capital expenditures decreased in the Game segment by 0.5 billion yen, or 8.7 percent, to 5.1 billion yen. In the Pictures segment, capital expenditures increased by 3.6 billion yen, or 36.3 percent to 13.5 billion yen. In All Other, which includes Sonys music business, 4.7 billion yen of capital expenditures were recorded, an increase of 1.7 billion yen, or 58.7 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. The decrease in property, plant and equipment as of March 31, 2009 when compared to March 31, 2008 was also due to approximately 13.4 billion yen in impairment losses, primarily due to the downsizing and withdrawal from certain businesses in the Electronics segment. Property, plant and equipment as of March 31, 2009 in the Financial Services segment decreased by 7.7 billion yen, or 20.1 percent, to 30.8 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Capital expenditures in the Financial Services segment decreased by 0.3 billion yen, or 5.0 percent, to 6.1 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. 57 Table of Contents Other Assets Other assets as of March 31, 2009 increased by 451.9 billion yen, or 27.2 percent, to 2,111.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This was primarily due to an increase in intangible assets and goodwill mainly as a result of the consolidation of SONY BMG as a wholly-owned subsidiary from October 1, 2008 and in deferred tax assets, primarily due to an increase in net operating loss carryforwards incurred in Japan and the U.S. Liabilities Total current and long-term liabilities as of March 31, 2009 decreased by 13.9 billion yen, or 0.2 percent, to 8,796.9 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Total current and long-term liabilities as of March 31, 2009 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 363.7 billion yen, or 9.2 percent, to 3,603.7 billion yen. Total current and long-term liabilities in the Financial Services segment as of March 31, 2009 increased by 355.0 billion yen, or 7.1 percent, to 5,339.4 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Current Liabilities Current liabilities as of March 31, 2009 decreased by 212.5 billion yen, or 5.3 percent, to 3,810.9 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Current liabilities as of March 31, 2009 in all segments excluding the Financial Services segment decreased by 383.9 billion yen, or 14.2 percent, to 2,314.6 billion yen. Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt as of March 31, 2009 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased by 92.1 billion yen, or 27.1 percent, to 431.5 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This increase was the result of the issuance of commercial paper (CP), the transfer to the current portion of long-term debt of an 80.0 billion yen syndicated loan which matures in June 2009, and the execution of bank loans, all by Sony Corporation. This increase was partially offset by the redemption of 250 billion yen of convertible bonds that came due during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. Notes and accounts payable, trade as of March 31, 2009 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 360.2 billion yen, or 39.7 percent, to 546.1 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. This was primarily due to a decrease in procurement of raw materials resulting from the decrease in sales in the Electronics and Game segments. Current liabilities as of March 31, 2009 in the Financial Services segment increased by 189.7 billion yen, or 13.9 percent, to 1,552.6 billion yen, mainly due to an increase in deposits from customers at Sony Bank. Long-term Liabilities Long-term liabilities as of March 31, 2009 increased by 198.6 billion yen, or 4.1 percent, to 4,986.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Long-term liabilities as of March 31, 2009 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased by 20.2 billion yen, or 1.6 percent, to 1,289.1 billion yen. In addition, long-term debt as of March 31, 2009 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, decreased by 65.3 billion yen, or 10.0 percent, to 585.6 billion yen. This was primarily due to the transfer to the current portion of long-term debt of an 80.0 billion yen syndicated loan as mentioned above. Long-term liabilities as of March 31, 2009 in the Financial Services segment increased by 165.4 billion yen, or 4.6 percent, to 3,786.8 billion yen. This was primarily due to an increase in policy amount in force at Sony Life. Total Interest-bearing Debt Total interest-bearing debt as of March 31, 2009 increased by 27.1 billion yen, or 2.5 percent, to 1,111.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Total interest-bearing debt as of March 31, 2009 in all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased by 26.7 billion yen, or 2.7 percent, to 1,017.2 billion yen. 58 Table of Contents Stockholders Equity Stockholders equity as of March 31, 2009 decreased by 500.4 billion yen, or 14.4 percent, to 2,964.7 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end. Retained earnings decreased 142.4 billion yen, or 6.9 percent, to 1,917.0 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year-end, primarily due to the recording of 98.9 billion yen in net loss. Stockholders equity decreased due to a decrease in retained earnings, the recording of foreign currency translation and pension liability adjustments of 247.7 billion yen, and 75.1 billion yen, respectively, and dividend payments of 42.6 billion yen. The ratio of stockholders equity to total assets decreased 2.9 percentage points compared to the end of the previous fiscal year, from 27.6 percent to 24.7 percent. Information of Financial Position Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following charts show Sonys unaudited information of financial position for all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, and for the Financial Services segment alone. These separate condensed presentations are not required or prepared under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony utilizes this information to analyze its results without the Financial Services segment and believes that these presentations may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding the Financial Services segment are eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below.

Of the unrealized loss amounts recorded by Sony Life, approximately 8.8 percent related to securities being in an unrealized loss position for periods greater than 12 months at March 31, 2009. Sony Life principally invests in debt securities in various industries. Almost all of these securities were rated BBB or higher by Standard & Poors, Moodys or other rating agencies. The percentage of non-investment grade securities held by Sony Life represents approximately 0.2 percent of Sony Lifes total investment portfolio, while the percentage of unrealized losses that relate to those non-investment grade securities was 4.4 percent of Sony Lifes total unrealized losses as of March 31, 2009. At March 31, 2009, Sony Bank had debt securities which had gross unrealized losses of 26.1 billion yen. Of the unrealized loss amounts recorded by Sony Bank, approximately 64.4 percent related to securities being in an unrealized loss position for periods greater than 12 months at March 31, 2009. Sony Bank principally invests in Japanese government bonds, Japanese corporate bonds and foreign bonds. Almost all of these securities were rated BBB or higher by Standard & Poors, Moodys or other rating agencies. These unrealized losses related to numerous investments, with no single investment being in a material unrealized loss position for periods greater than 12 months. In addition, there was no individual security with unrealized losses that met the test for impairment as the declines in value were observed to be small both in amounts and percentage, and therefore, the decline in value for those investments was still determined to be temporary in nature. 62 Table of Contents For fixed maturity securities with unrecognized losses held by Sony Life as of March 31, 2009 (6.4 billion yen), maturity dates vary as follows:  Within 1 year: 1.8 percent  1 to 5 years: 5.2 percent  5 to 10 years: 1.1 percent  Above 10 years: 91.9 percent For fixed maturity securities with unrecognized losses held by Sony Bank as of March 31, 2009 (26.1 billion yen), maturity dates vary as follows:  Within 1 year: 13.7 percent  1 to 5 years: 59.8 percent  5 to 10 years: 1.6 percent  Above 10 years: 24.9 percent In the ordinary course of business, Sony maintains long-term investment securities, included in securities investments and other issued by a number of non-public companies. The aggregate carrying amount of the investments in non-public companies at March 31, 2009 was 60.4 billion yen. A non-public equity investment is valued at cost if fair value is not readily determinable. If the value is estimated to have declined and such decline is judged to be other-than-temporary, the impairment of the investment is recognized immediately and the carrying value is reduced to its fair value. For an investment where a quoted price is available in an active market, fair value is determined based on unadjusted quoted prices as of the date on which the impairment determination is made. For an investment where no quoted price is available in an active market, fair value is usually determined based on quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or measured through the use of various methodologies such as pricing models, discounted cash flow techniques, or similar techniques that require significant management judgment or estimation of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the investments. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, total realized impairment losses were 7.4 billion yen, 37.1 billion yen and 45.6 billion yen, respectively, of which 6.1 billion yen, 24.0 billion yen and 41.2 billion yen, respectively, were recorded in financial service revenue by the subsidiaries in the Financial Services segment. Realized impairment losses recorded other than by subsidiaries in the Financial Services segment in each of the three fiscal years were reflected in non-operating expenses and primarily relate to certain strategic investments in non-financial services businesses. These investments primarily relate to certain strategic investments in Japan and the U.S. with which Sony has strategic relationships for the purposes of developing and marketing new technologies. Impairment losses were recorded for each of the three fiscal years as certain companies failed to successfully develop and market such technology, resulting in the operating performance of these companies being more unfavorable than previously expected. As a result, the decline in the fair value of these companies was judged as other-than-temporary. None of these impairment losses was individually material to Sony and the impairment losses that were recorded in each of the three fiscal years related to the unique facts and circumstances of each individual investment and did not significantly impact other investments. Sony Life and Sony Banks investments constitute the majority of the investments in the Financial Services segment. Sony Life and Sony Bank account for approximately 78 percent and 21 percent of the investments in the Financial Services segment, respectively. 63 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations, Commitments, and Contingent Liabilities The following table summarizes Sonys contractual obligations and major commitments as of March 31, 2009. The references to the notes below refer to the corresponding notes within the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

These cash payments are based upon assumptions including morbidity, mortality, withdrawals and other factors. Amounts presented in the above table are undiscounted. The sum of the cash payments of 10,769.6 billion yen exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of 3,506.8 billion yen included in the consolidated financial statements principally due to the time value of money (Note 10). ** The total amounts represent the liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. Sony estimates 174 million yen of the liability is expected to be settled within one year. The settlement period for the remaining portion of the liability, which totaled 276.5 billion yen, cannot be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainty associated with the timing of the settlements with the various taxing authorities (Note 21). The following items are not included in either the above table or the total amount of commitments outstanding at March 31, 2009:  The total amount of expected future pension payments is not included as such amount is not currently determinable. Sony expects to contribute approximately 34 billion yen to Japanese pension plans and 64 Table of Contents approximately 17 billion yen to foreign pension plans during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010 (Note 15).  The total unused portion of the line of credit extended under loan agreements in the Financial Services segment is not included as it is not foreseeable what loans will be incurred under such line of credit. The total unused portion of the line of credit extended under these contracts was 247.1 billion yen as of March 31, 2009 (Note 25).  Purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Sony. These obligations specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations do not include contracts that may be cancelled without penalty. Sony enters into arrangements with certain component manufacturers whereby Sony procures goods and services, including product components, for these component manufacturers and is reimbursed for the related purchases. Sonys supply chain management allows for flexible and mutually beneficial purchase arrangements with these manufacturers in order to minimize inventory risk. Consistent with industry practice, Sony purchases processed goods that meet technical criteria from these component manufacturers after issuing to these manufacturers information on Sonys projected demand and manufacturing needs. These purchases are made during the ordinary course of business in order to establish the best pricing and continuity of supply for Sonys production and are not included in the above table as there are typically no binding purchase obligations. The total amount of purchase commitments and other outstanding commitments at March 31, 2009 was 347.5 billion yen (Note 25). This amount includes the following major purchase obligations as shown in the table above:  In the ordinary course of business, Sony makes commitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment. As of March 31, 2009, the outstanding amount of such commitments was 52.9 billion yen.  Certain subsidiaries in the Pictures segment have entered into agreements with creative talent for the development and production of films and television programming as well as agreements with third parties to acquire completed films, or certain rights thereon, and to acquire the rights to broadcast certain live action sporting events. These agreements cover various periods through March 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2009, these subsidiaries were committed to make payments under such contracts of 139.8 billion yen.  Certain subsidiaries in the music business have entered into long-term contracts with recording artists and companies for the production and/or distribution of prerecorded music and videos. These contracts cover various periods mainly through December 31, 2013. As of March 31, 2009, these subsidiaries were committed to make payments of 36.5 billion yen under such long-term contracts.  In April 2005, Sony Corporation entered into a partnership program contract with Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). Through this program Sony Corporation will be able to exercise various rights as an official sponsor of FIFA events including the FIFA World Cuptm* from 2007 to 2014. As of March 31, 2009, Sony Corporation was committed to make payments under such contract of 19.3 billion yen. * FIFA World Cuptm is a registered trademark of FIFA. In order to fulfill its commitments, Sony will use existing cash, cash generated by its operating activities, and intra-group borrowings, where possible. Further, Sony may raise funds through bonds, CP programs and committed lines of credit from banks, when necessary. 65 Table of Contents The following table summarizes Sonys contingent liabilities as of March 31, 2009. Total Amounts of Contingent Liabilities Contingent Liabilities: (Note 25) (Yen in millions ) Loan guarantees to a creditor of the third party investor 29,469 Other 17,612 Total contingent liabilities 47,081 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Sony has certain off-balance sheet arrangements that provide liquidity, capital resources and/or credit risk support. Sony has established several accounts receivable sales programs whereby Sony can sell up to 50.0 billion yen of eligible trade accounts receivable in the aggregate at any one time. Through these programs, Sony can sell receivables to qualified special purpose entities owned and operated by banks. Sony can sell receivables in which the agreed upon original due dates are no more than 190 days after the sales of receivables. These transactions are accounted for as sales in accordance with FAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because Sony has relinquished control of the receivables. Total trade accounts receivable sold during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009 were 152.5 billion yen, 181.4 billion yen and 130.8 billion yen, respectively. Losses from these transactions were insignificant. Although Sony continues servicing the receivables subsequent to being sold, no servicing liabilities are recorded as the costs of collection of the sold receivables are insignificant. A subsidiary of the Financial Services segment has established several receivables sales programs whereby the subsidiary can sell up to 23.0 billion yen of eligible receivables in the aggregate at any one time. Through these programs, the subsidiary can sell receivables to qualified special purpose entities owned and operated by banks. The subsidiary can sell receivables in which the agreed upon original due dates are no more than 180 days after the sales of receivables. These transactions are accounted for as sales in accordance with FAS No. 140, since the subsidiary has relinquished control of the receivables. Total receivables sold during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 and 2009 were 113.8 billion yen and 166.1 billion yen, respectively. Losses from these transactions were insignificant. Although the subsidiary continues servicing the receivables subsequent to being sold, no servicing liabilities are recorded as the costs of collection of the sold receivables are insignificant. Sony has, from time to time, entered into various arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs). In several of the arrangements in which Sony holds a significant variable interest, Sony is the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidates these VIEs. These arrangements include facilities that provide for the leasing of certain property, the financing of film production, the U.S.-based music publishing business and several joint ventures in the recorded music business. In addition, Sony holds a significant variable interest in VIEs in which Sony is not the primary beneficiary and therefore does not consolidate which is described as follows: A subsidiary in the Pictures segment entered into two separate production/co-financing agreements with VIEs to co-finance 19 films that were released over the 31 months ended July 31, 2008. The subsidiary received 570 million U.S. dollars over the term of the agreements to fund the production or acquisition cost of films (including fees and expenses). Additionally, on January 19, 2007, the subsidiary entered into a third production/co-financing agreement with another VIE to co-finance a majority of the films to be submitted through March 2012. The subsidiary has received a commitment from the third VIE that it will fund up to 525 million U.S. dollars on a revolving basis to fund the production or acquisition cost of films (including fees and expenses). As of March 31, 2009, eight films of the subsidiary have been released and approximately 222 million U.S. dollars have been funded by the third VIE. Under all three agreements, the subsidiary is responsible for the marketing and distribution of the product through its global distribution channels. The VIEs shares in the net profits, as defined, of the films after the subsidiary recoups a distribution fee, its marketing and distribution expenses, and third-party participation and residual costs, each as defined. As the subsidiary did not make any equity investment in these three VIEs nor issue any guarantees with respect to the VIEs, the subsidiary does not absorb the majority of the losses or residual 66 Table of Contents returns, and therefore does not qualify as the primary beneficiary for any of the VIEs. As of March 31, 2009, there are no amounts recorded on the subsidiarys balance sheet that relate to any of the VIEs other than the investors earned but unpaid share of the films net profits, as defined. Refer to Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on VIEs. Cash Flows (The fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008) Operating Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, there was net cash inflow of 407.2 billion yen in operating activities, a decrease of 350.5 billion yen, or 46.3 percent compared with the previous fiscal year.. For all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, there was net cash inflow of 112.7 billion yen in operating activities, a decrease of 406.4 billion yen, or 78.3 percent compared to the previous fiscal year. The Financial Services segment had a net cash inflow of 300.1 billion yen from operating activities, an increase of 57.5 billion yen, or 23.7 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. With respect to all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, the major cash inflow factors include a cash contribution from net income (loss), after taking into account depreciation and amortization, and decreases in notes and accounts receivable, trade primarily due to a decrease in sales, both mainly in the Electronics segment during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. These factors exceeded cash outflows, which included decreases in notes and accounts payable, trade mainly in the Electronics and Game segments. The Financial Services segment generated net cash mainly from an increase in revenue from insurance premiums reflecting a steady increase in policy amount in force, primarily at Sony Life. Compared with the previous fiscal year, within all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, net cash provided by operating activities decreased mainly as a result of a decrease in net income (loss), after taking into account depreciation and amortization. Within the Financial Services segment, net cash provided increased mainly due to an increase in revenue from insurance premiums at Sony Life noted above compared with the previous fiscal year. Investing Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, Sony used 1,081.3 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, an increase of 170.9 billion yen, or 18.8 percent .compared with the previous fiscal year. For all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, 487.4 billion yen of net cash was used in investing activities, an increase of 472.5 billion yen, or 3,166.0 percent. compared with the previous fiscal year. The Financial Services segment used 602.4 billion yen in net cash, a decrease of 271.3 billion yen, or 31.1 percent. compared with the previous fiscal year. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, with respect to all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, payments for items such as purchases of manufacturing equipment in the Electronics segment and the acquisition of Bertelsmanns 50 percent interest in SONY BMG exceeded proceeds generated mainly from the sales of semiconductor fabrication equipment. Within the Financial Services segment, payments primarily for investments carried out at Sony Life, as well as for investments and advances carried out at Sony Bank, where operations are expanding, exceeded proceeds mainly from the maturities and sales of marketable securities and collections of advances. Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash used in investing activities increased within all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment. The previous fiscal years net cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of shares in SFH, the sale of The Sony Center am Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, and the sale of a portion of Sonys former headquarters site. Net cash used in investing activities within the Financial Services segment decreased mainly because an increase in investment asset sales exceeded an increase in investments at Sony Life. In all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, net cash provided by operating activities and used in investing activities combined was a net outflow of 374.8 yen billion, a deterioration of 878.9 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year. Financing Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, 267.5 billion yen of net cash was provided by financing activities, a decrease of 238.1 billion yen, or 47.1 percent compared with the previous fiscal year.. For all segments excluding the Financial Services segment, there was a net cash inflow of 9.9 billion yen in financing activities, an increase of 22.0 billion yen compared to a net cash outflow of 12.1 billion yen in the previous 67 Table of Contents fiscal year. This was primarily due to issuances of CP and corporate bonds and borrowings from banks in the current fiscal year, partially offset by the redemption of convertible bonds. In the Financial Services segment, since the increase primarily in policyholder accounts at Sony Life and in deposits from customers at Sony Bank were less than the increases in the previous fiscal year, financing activities generated 260.3 billion yen of net cash, a decrease of 231.4 billion yen, or 47.1 percent compared to the prior fiscal year. Accounting for the above factors and the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates, the total outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2009 was 660.8 billion yen, a decrease of 425.6 billion yen, or 39.2 percent compared with the balance as of March 31, 2008. The outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents of all segments excluding the Financial Services segment was 565.0 billion yen, a decrease of 383.7 billion yen, or 40.4 percent compared with the balance as of March 31, 2008. Within the Financial Services segment, the outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents was 95.8 billion yen, a decrease of 41.9 billion yen, or 30.4 percent compared with the balance as of March 31, 2008. Information of Cash Flows Separating Out the Financial Services Segment (Unaudited) The following charts show Sonys unaudited cash flow information for all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, and for the Financial Services segment alone. These separate condensed presentations are not required or prepared under U.S. GAAP, which is used in Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, because the Financial Services segment is different in nature from Sonys other segments, Sony utilizes this information to analyze its results without the Financial Services segment and believes that these presentations may be useful in understanding and analyzing Sonys consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the Financial Services segment and all other segments excluding the Financial Services segment are eliminated in the consolidated figures shown below.

Of this total, all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, generated 519.1 billion yen of net cash from operating activities, an increase of 213.5 billion yen, or 69.9 percent compared with the previous fiscal year, and the Financial Services segment generated 242.6 billion yen of net cash from operating activities, a decrease of 13.9 billion yen, or 5.4 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. During the fiscal year, a variety of factors had a positive impact on operating cash flow, including the contribution of net income from the Electronics segment after taking into account depreciation and amortization and an increase in insurance premium revenue reflecting a steady increase in insurance-in-force at Sony Life. Partially offsetting these contributions was an increase in inventory primarily within the Electronics segment. Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash provided by operating activities increased during the fiscal year mainly as a result of the increase in net income after taking into account depreciation and amortization. Investing Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, Sony used 910.4 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, an increase of 195.0 billion yen, or 27.3 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. Of this total, all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, used 14.9 billion yen of net cash in investing activities, a decrease of 416.2 billion yen, or 96.5 percent, compared with the previous fiscal year. The Financial Services segment used 873.6 billion yen in net cash, an increase of 596.9 billion yen, or 215.7 percent compared with the previous fiscal year. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, semiconductor fabrication equipment was purchased and Sony ATV acquired Famous Music, a U.S.-based music publishing company. Partially offsetting these uses of net cash were proceeds from the sale of a portion of SFH shares, the sale of The Sony Center am Potsdamer Platz in Berlin and the sale of a portion of the site of Sonys former headquarters. Within the Financial Services segment, payments for investments and advances, carried out primarily at Sony Life and at Sony Bank, where operations are expanding, exceeded proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities, sales of securities investments and collections of advances. Compared with the previous fiscal year, net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 decreased significantly within all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, primarily due to the sale of a portion of SFH shares. On the other hand, net cash used in investing activities within the Financial Services segment increased significantly compared to the previous fiscal year primarily because the increase in payments for investments and advances, carried out primarily at Sony Life and Sony Bank, exceeded the increase in proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities, sales of securities investments and collections of advances compared with the previous fiscal year. 69 Table of Contents In all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, net cash provided by operating and investing activities combined was 504.2 billion yen, an increase of 629.7 billion yen as compared to net cash used of 125.5 billion yen in the previous fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. Financing Activities: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, 505.5 billion yen of net cash was provided by financing activities. Of the total, 12.1 billion yen of net cash was used in financing activities within all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, a decrease of 71.7 billion yen compared to the 59.6 billion yen in net cash generated by financing activities in the previous fiscal year. This was primarily due to the fact that straight bonds were redeemed during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008. In the Financial Services segment, as a result of an increase in policyholder accounts at Sony Life and an increase in deposits from customers in the banking business, financing activities generated 491.7 billion yen of net cash. Accounting for all these factors and the effect of exchange rate changes, the total outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fiscal year increased by 286.5 billion yen, or 35.8 percent, to 1,086.4 billion yen, compared with the end of the previous fiscal year. The total outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents of all segments, excluding the Financial Services segment, increased by 425.9 billion yen, or 81.4 percent, to 948.7 billion yen, and for the Financial Services segment, decreased by 139.3 billion yen, or 50.3 percent, to 137.7 billion yen, compared with the end of the previous fiscal year.

Furthermore, the Financial Services segment is described separately at the end of this section. Liquidity Management and Market Access An important financial objective of Sony is to maintain the strength of its balance sheet, while securing adequate liquidity for business activities. Sony defines its liquidity sources as the amount of cash and cash equivalents (cash balance) (excluding restrictions on capital transfers mainly due to country regulations) and the unused amount of committed lines of credit. Sonys basic liquidity management policy is to secure sufficient liquidity throughout the relevant fiscal year, covering such factors as 50 percent of monthly consolidated sales and repayments on debt that comes due within six months. Funding requirements that arise from maintaining liquidity are principally covered by free cash flow generated from business operations and by the cash balance, however, as needed, Sony has demonstrated the ability to procure funds from the financial and capital markets. In the event financial and capital markets became illiquid, based on its current forecasts, Sony could sustain sufficient liquidity through access to committed lines of credit with financial institutions, together with its cash balance. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, Sonys cash flow from operations deteriorated mainly due to a sharp decline in profitability after September 2008. To maintain a minimum level of cash balance, Sony raised funds mainly from the Japanese CP market towards the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. The recent condition of the Japanese CP market has improved from that of the autumn of 2008, however, in the event Sony has difficulty obtaining financing due to a deterioration in the Japanese CP market, Sony does not anticipate difficulty in maintaining liquidity by utilizing other sources of financing, such as bank loans (including committed lines of credit). Based on its current business forecast, Sony anticipates maintaining the ability to repay all debts maturing within one year with existing cash balances and, if necessary, committed lines of credit. Sony procures funds mainly from the financial and capital markets through Sony Corporation and SGTS, a finance subsidiary in the U.K. Sony Corporation issued domestic straight bonds totalling 257.5 billion yen (37.5 billion yen in December 2008, 220.0 billion yen in June 2009), under a bond shelf registration filed in Japan. Proceeds of these issues have been and will be used for the redemption of corporate bonds and CP. Also, in order to meet working capital requirements, Sony Corporation and SGTS maintain CP programs which have the ability to access the Japanese, the U.S. and European CP markets, subject to prevailing market conditions. As of March 31, 2009, the CP program limit amounts translated into yen was 1,187.6 billion yen in total for Sony Corporation and SGTS, and the total amount of CP issued under these programs, translated into yen was 172.5 billion yen, which was mainly issued in the Japanese CP market. Sony typically raises funds through the aforementioned straight bonds, CP programs and bank loans (including syndicated loans), in the unlikely event Sony could not access liquidity from these sources, and Sony can also draw on committed lines of credit from various financial institutions. In November 2008, Sony increased yen-based 71 Table of Contents committed lines of credit contracted with Japanese financial institutions (increased to 475 billion yen, from 150 billion yen, effective for three years, due November 2011). In December 2008, Sony established a new multi-currency committed line of credit with Japanese financial institutions (in the amount of 1.5 billion U.S. dollars effective for five years, due December 2013). These contracts were aimed at securing sufficient liquidity in a quick and stable manner even in the event of financial and capital markets turmoil seen since September 2008. Sony had a total, translated into yen, of 1,047.3 billion yen in committed lines of credit, none of which had been used as of March 31, 2009. As a part of such committed lines of credit, Sony also had a multi-currency committed line of credit contracted with a syndicate of global banks (translated into yen of 420.4 billion yen), which expired on April 1, 2009. Sony renegotiated these multi-currency committed lines of credit with a reduced commitment amount (translated into yen of 183.7 billion yen) on April 1, 2009. As a result, Sony has a total, translated into yen, of 810.6 billion yen in committed lines of credit as of April 1, 2009. In the event of a downgrade in Sonys credit ratings, even though the cost of some of those borrowings could increase, there are no financial covenants in any of Sonys material financial agreements that would cause an acceleration of the obligation or any impairment on the ability to drawdown on unused facilities. Furthermore, there are no restrictions on the uses of most proceeds except that certain borrowings may not be used to acquire securities listed on a U.S. stock exchange or traded over-the-counter in the U.S. in accordance with the rules and regulations issued by authorities such as the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board. Ratings Sony considers one of managements top priorities to be the maintenance of stable and appropriate credit ratings in order to ensure financial flexibility for liquidity and capital management and continued adequate access to sufficient funding resources in the financial and capital markets. In order to facilitate access to global capital markets, Sony obtains credit ratings from two rating agencies, Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) and Standard and Poors Rating Services (S&P). In addition, Sony maintains a rating from Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I), a rating agency in Japan, for access to the Japanese capital markets. Sonys current debt ratings from each agency as of June 19, 2009 are noted below: Moodys S&P R&I Long-term debt A3 (Outlook: negative) A- (Outlook: negative) AA- (Outlook: negative) Short-term debt P-2 A-2 a-1+ Cash Management Sony manages its global cash management activities mainly through SGTS. The excess or shortage of cash at most of Sonys subsidiaries is invested or funded by SGTS on a net basis, although Sony recognizes that fund transfers are limited in certain countries and geographical areas due to restrictions on capital transactions. In order to pursue more efficient cash management, cash surpluses among Sonys subsidiaries are deposited with SGTS and cash shortfalls among subsidiaries are covered by loans through SGTS, so that Sony can invest excess cash balances and reduce third-party borrowings. Financial Services segment The management of SFH, Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank recognizes the importance of securing sufficient liquidity to cover the payment of obligations that these companies incur in the ordinary course of business. Sony Life, Sony Assurance and Sony Bank maintain a sufficient cash balance and secure sufficient means to meet their obligations while abiding by regulations, such as the Insurance Business Act or the Banking Act of Japan, imposed by the Financial Services Agency (FSA), and other regulatory authorities as well as establishing and operating under company guidelines that comply with these regulations. Cash inflows for Sony Life and Sony Assurance come mainly from policyholders insurance premiums, and Sony Life and Sony Assurance keep sufficient liquidity in the form of investments primarily in various securities. Sony Bank, on the other hand, uses its cash inflows, which come mainly from customers deposits in local or foreign currencies, in 72 Table of Contents order to offer mortgage loans to individuals or to make bond investments, and establish a necessary level of liquidity for the smooth settlement of transactions. SFH currently has an AA- rating from R&I for issuer ratings. Sony Life currently has ratings from four rating agencies: A+ from S&P for insurer financial strength rating, Aa3 from Moodys for insurance financial strength rating, AA from R&I for insurance claims paying ability and AA from the Japan Credit Rating Agency Ltd. for ability to pay insurance claims. Sony Bank obtained an A- rating from S&P for its long-term local/foreign currency issuer ratings, an A-2 rating from S&P for its short-term local/foreign currency issuer rating and an AA- rating from the Japan Credit Rating Agency Ltd. for long-term senior debt rating. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT It is necessary for Sony to continue technological innovation in order to maintain group-wide growth. Sony believes that technology made possible by our research and development activities is key to the differentiation of products in existing businesses and the source of creating value in new businesses. Research and development is focused in four key domains: a common development platform technology for home and mobile electronics, and semiconductor, device, and software technologies, which are essential for product differentiation and for creating value-added products. Research and development costs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 decreased 23.3 billion yen, or 4.5 percent, to 497.3 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of research and development costs to sales (which excludes Financial Services segment revenue) increased from 6.3 percent to 6.9 percent. Expenses in the Electronics segment decreased 14.8 billion yen, or 3.4 percent, to 423.9 billion yen and expenses in the Game segment decreased 4.5 billion yen, or 5.8 percent, to 72.6 billion yen. In the Electronics segment, approximately 68 percent of expenses were for the development of new product prototypes while the remaining 32 percent were for the development of mid- to long-term new technologies in such areas as next generation displays, semiconductors, new materials and software. Consolidated research and development costs for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010 are expected to decrease by 3.5 percent to 480 billion yen. Research and development costs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 decreased 23.4 billion yen, or 4.3 percent, to 520.6 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of research and development costs to sales (which excludes Financial Services segment revenue) decreased from 7.1 percent to 6.3 percent. Expenses in the Electronics segment decreased 1.6 billion yen, or 0.4 percent, to 438.7 billion yen and expenses in the Game segment decreased 20.8 billion yen, or 21.2 percent, to 77.1 billion yen. In the Electronics segment, approximately 65 percent of expenses were for the development of new product prototypes while the remaining 35 percent were for the development of mid- to long-term new technologies in such areas as semiconductors, communications and displays. In the Game segment, research and development costs decreased mainly due to the decline in costs related to PS3. Research and development costs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 increased 12.1 billion yen, or 2.3 percent, to 543.9 billion yen compared with the previous fiscal year. The ratio of research and development costs to sales (which excludes Financial Services segment revenue) decreased from 7.8 percent to 7.1 percent. Expenses in the Electronics segment increased 22.2 billion yen, or 5.3 percent, to 440.4 billion yen, whereas expenses in the Game segment decreased 10.8 billion yen, or 9.9 percent, to 97.9 billion yen. In the Electronics segment, approximately 62 percent of expenses were for the development of new product prototypes while the remaining 38 percent were for the development of mid- to long-term new technologies in such areas as semiconductors, communications and displays. In the Game segment, research and development costs decreased mainly due to the completion of most of the research and development phase related to the PS3. TREND INFORMATION This section contains forward-looking statements about the possible future performance of Sony and should be read in light of the cautionary statement on that subject, which appears on the inside front cover page and applies to this entire document. 73 Table of Contents Issues Facing Sony and Managements Response to those Issues The financial crisis that began with the sub-prime loan problem in 2007 disrupted the global economy and, from fall 2008, the global economic situation grew more severe. The operating environment for Sony also became severe, with decreased demand and intensified pressure on pricing resulting from the slowdown of the global economy, appreciation of the yen, and a significant decline in the Japanese stock market. As a result, both an operating loss and a net loss have been recorded in Sonys consolidated results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. To respond to the severe operating environment, which may last through the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010, Sony is implementing measures, particularly in the electronics business, to reform its operational structure with a priority on speed and profitability. In these areas, in addition to certain short-term measures that Sony has already undertaken, including adjusting production, lowering inventory levels and reducing operational expenses, Sony also intends to curtail or delay portions of its investment plans, downsize or withdraw from unprofitable or non-core businesses, realign Japanese and overseas manufacturing sites, reallocate its workforce, and reduce headcount. Furthermore, in the other businesses, Sony intends to implement restructuring across the Sony Group, as well as substantially reduce advertising and marketing expenses, logistics and other expenses. With these measures, Sony is working to reduce costs throughout the Sony Group by more than 300 billion yen in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010, compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. Sony expects restructuring charges to total approximately 110 billion yen in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010, compared with the 75.4 billion yen recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. In addition, capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 totaled 332.1 billion yen, which was significantly lower than the original forecast. Consolidated capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010 are expected to decrease 25 percent to 250 billion yen primarily within the electronics business. For the electronics business, capital expenditures in the semiconductor business during the fiscal year are expected to decrease by approximately 45 billion yen to approximately 35 billion yen due to a decrease in the amount invested in image sensors. In order to fundamentally improve the operations of its electronics and game businesses, as of April 1, 2009, Sony implemented a major reorganization. Through the strategic integration of the electronics and game businesses, Sony believes it has enhanced the organizational structure designed to produce networked products and services and, along with the establishment of a horizontal platform for software development and another for manufacturing, logistics, and procurement, Sony is striving to deliver to its customers, at a competitive cost and in a timely manner, networked products and services that can communicate seamlessly with a common user interface. Additionally, Sony is implementing the following employment-related measures at Sony Corporation to respond to the significant deterioration of operating results: Remuneration  Corporate Executive Officer and Corporate Executive bonuses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 were substantially reduced. In addition, fixed remuneration was decreased from April 2009.  In particular, the three Representative Corporate Executive Officers as of March 31, 2009 waived their entire bonuses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009.  With regard to management level employees, bonuses were reduced significantly and base salaries were reduced from April 2009. Early Retirement Program  In order to optimize human resources, Sony has implemented an early retirement program supporting employees who take up new opportunities beyond the Sony Group. Below is a description of the issues management believes each business continues to face and an explanation as to how each business is approaching those issues, including the above measures it has taken to reduce costs. 74 Table of Contents Electronics Sony plans to undertake the following cost reduction measures: Realignment of manufacturing sites: By advancing initiatives, including rationalizing its manufacturing operations, shifting and aggregating manufacturing to lower-cost countries and utilizing the services of third-party original equipment and design manufacturers (OEMs and ODMs), Sony has decided to reduce its manufacturing site count by eight, four in Japan and four overseas. With the transfer or closure of these manufacturing sites, Sonys total manufacturing site count will be reduced to 49 by December 31, 2009. Workforce reallocation and headcount reduction: Through measures including the realignment of its manufacturing sites, a review of its development and design structure and the streamlining of its sales and administrative functions, Sony is implementing a company-wide rationalization of its operations, including its headquarters functions. Sony is reallocating and optimizing its workforce through programs including work reassignments and outplacements. As a result of these measures, by March 31, 2010, Sony plans to reduce worldwide headcount within the electronics business by approximately 8,000, out of approximately 160,000 as of September 30, 2008. Concurrently, Sony is also reducing the headcount of its outsourced workforce. Measures being implemented in the LCD Television and Semiconductor businesses include the following: LCD Television Business Manufacturing Operations  Regarding overseas manufacturing sites, Sony postponed investment in production expansion at the Nitra plant in Slovakia, reduced production at the Barcelona plant in Spain, discontinued its operations at the Pittsburgh, PA plant in the U.S. in February 2009, and plans to discontinue operations at the Mexicali plant in Mexico by the end of September 2009.  In Japan, Sony intends to cease television design and manufacturing at Sony EMCS Corporations Ichinomiya Technology Center in June 2009, with its operations to be consolidated at Inazawa Technology Center.  With growth in emerging markets causing more models to be sold at entry-level prices, Sony intends to further the use of OEMs and ODMs in the mid- to long-term, and intends to promote an asset light strategy to increase investment efficiency by achieving a sound balance between investment and returns. Design Operations  Sony is creating global standards for hardware basic design and software and integrating its design and development resources around the world.  Certain aspects of software development have been outsourced to offshore vendors, for example, in India.  Sony is targeting a global headcount reduction of approximately 30 percent across its television design operations and related administrative functions by the end of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010 compared with September 30, 2008. In connection with Sonys strategy for procuring panels, an important issue for improving profitability in the television business, Sony obtains its supply of amorphous thin film transistor (TFT) LCD panels from the 7th and 8th generation production lines at S-LCD. The production lines of the 7th and the first 8th generation have a production capacity of 130,000 substrates and 70,000 substrates of mother glass per month, respectively. Furthermore, S-LCD started operations at its second 8th generation LCD panel production line in June 2009. S-LCD plans to expand the capacity of its second 8th production line to 70,000 substrates of mother glass per month by the end of December 2009. 75 Table of Contents In addition to S-LCD, in order to secure a stable supply of cost-competitive panels in the mid- to long-term, Sony signed a non-binding memorandum of intent with Sharp in February 2008 to establish a joint venture to manufacture amorphous TFT LCD panels and modules on a 10th generation production line. On January 29, 2009, faced with the changes in the world economy, Sony and Sharp amended and extended this non-binding memorandum of intent to confirm their mutual intent to postpone the targeted establishment of the joint venture until March 2010, approximately one year later than the originally scheduled date of April 2009. Sharp and Sony will, through continued discussion of how the two companies can best deploy their resources and expertise, continue to negotiate in good faith and have set June 30, 2009 as the target date by which to enter into a definitive agreement to establish a joint venture. Semiconductor Businesses In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, Sony reviewed its investment policy in the semiconductor business, deciding to continue to focus on the growth area of CCDs and CMOS image sensors while streamlining and downsizing the production equipment and assets of system LSI for the Game business, pursuant to its asset light strategy. As a part of this strategy, in March 2008 Sony sold to Toshiba Corporation (Toshiba) production equipment for high-performance semiconductors such as the Cell Broadband EngineTM processor and the RSX graphics engine for PLAYSTATION®3 (PS3), installed in the Nagasaki Technology Center of Sony Semiconductor Kyushu Corporation. Nagasaki Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, a joint venture, was established by Toshiba, Sony Corporation and Sony Computer Entertainment and commenced operations on April 1, 2008 to produce such high-performance semiconductors with the production equipment made available to the joint venture by Toshiba. In addition, on March 31, 2008, upon the expiration of their contract, Sony and Toshiba terminated Oita TS Semiconductor Corporation, a manufacturing joint venture located within Toshibas Oita Operations. Following the termination of the joint venture, Sony sold the related manufacturing equipment to Toshiba on April 1, 2008. Going forward, Sony intends to expand the asset light strategy implemented in the Game-related system LSI area described above to image sensors. One aspect of this expansion will be to reduce investment expenditures by outsourcing to third parties a portion of its planned increase in manufacturing capacity for CMOS image sensors for use in mobile phones. Game Sony intends to expand the PS3 and PSP platform through an enhanced line-up of software. Sony will strive to expand the business by providing content through both packaged software and utilizing network capabilities, and to improve the profitability of PS3 through hardware cost reduction measures, including reducing the size of key semiconductors and the number of components. At the same time, Sony will aim to improve profitability of the entire game business by actively engaging in the development of non-game content and services, and by expanding its interactive entertainment offerings. Pictures In the pictures business, Sony faces intense competition, rising expenses, including advertising and promotion expenses, a mature home entertainment market, increasingly limited access to third party financing, and a growing trend toward digital piracy. To meet these challenges, Sony is working to produce and acquire a diversified portfolio of motion picture and television product with broad worldwide appeal for distribution in all media and other emerging platforms, including digital download. Music The music industry has operated in a challenging market environment for several years now with the ongoing decline in physical sales not yet offset by the continued growth in the digital market. This trend is expected to continue in the medium term. The growing digital business holds significant potential with the launch of new initiatives and introduction of innovative products in the digital marketplace. Against this market backdrop, 76 Table of Contents Sonys music business continues to invest in and develop new and existing artist talent, and is pursuing growing new business revenue streams such as live concerts, artist management, and sponsorships. Financial Services Sony is confronted by changes in the financial services industry as a result of the deregulation and liberalization of additional insurance premiums, postal privatization, the complete lifting of the ban on the sale of insurance products by banks, and the flexible firewall regulations between banks and securities companies in Japan. Sony also faces macroeconomic changes including Japans declining population, low birthrate and growing proportion of elderly citizens. In response to this changing environment, each of Sonys financial services businesses, which are latecomers to the life insurance, non-life insurance and banking industries, makes use of distinctive, individual industry-specific business models and plans to achieve further business expansion and even higher levels of customer satisfaction. On October 11, 2007, in conjunction with the global initial public offering of shares of SFH, the shares of SFH were listed for trading on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. This offering aimed to achieve the efficient redistribution of management resources within the Sony Group as a whole, and establish SFHs self financing, which is necessary for the further expansion of its financial businesses and independent growth. Following this global offering, SFH remains a consolidated subsidiary with Sony Corporation as the majority shareholder, holding 60 percent of shares issued by SFH. Sony Life has been building an investment portfolio mainly comprised of long-term bonds, in order to manage investment risks and ensure stable mid- to long-term returns. Based on this policy, Sony Life has increased and will increase gradually its investment in long-term bonds during this fiscal year. In addition, to mitigate the increasing risk of a decline in stock prices, Sony Life has reduced the balance of equity assets such as stocks and convertible bonds. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, Sony evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience, future projections and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these evaluations form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Sony considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to its financial condition and results, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. Sony believes that the following represents its critical accounting policies. Investments Sonys investments include debt and equity securities accounted for under both the cost and equity method of accounting. If it has been determined that an investment has sustained an other-than-temporary decline in its value, the investment is written down to its fair value by a charge to earnings. Sony regularly evaluates its investment portfolio to identify other-than-temporary impairments of individual securities. Factors that are considered by Sony in determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred include: the length of time and extent to which the market value of the security has been less than its original cost, the financial condition, operating results, business plans and estimated future cash flows of the issuer of the security, other specific factors affecting the market value, deterioration of credit condition of the issuers, sovereign risk, and whether or not Sony is able to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in market value. In evaluating the factors for available-for-sale securities whose fair values are readily determinable, Sony presumes a decline in value to be other-than-temporary if the fair value of the security is 20 percent or more below its original cost for an extended period of time (generally for a period of up to six months). This criterion is 77 Table of Contents employed as a threshold to identify securities that may have a decline in value that is other-than-temporary. The presumption of an other-than-temporary impairment in such cases may be overcome if there is evidence to support that the decline is temporary in nature due to the existence of other factors which overcome the duration or magnitude of the decline. On the other hand, there may be cases where impairment losses are recognized when the decline in the fair value of the security is not more than 20 percent or such decline has not existed for an extended period of time, as a result of considering specific factors which may indicate the decline in the fair value is other-than-temporary. The assessment of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other-than-temporary is often subjective in nature and involves certain assumptions and estimates concerning the expected operating results, business plans and future cash flows of the issuer of the security. Accordingly, it is possible that investments in Sonys portfolio that have had a decline in value that Sony currently believes to be temporary may be determined to be other-than-temporary in the future based on Sonys evaluation of subsequent information such as continued poor operating results, continuing broad declines in the value of worldwide equity markets and the effect of worldwide interest rate fluctuations. As a result, unrealized losses recorded for investments may be recognized and reduce income in future periods. Valuation of inventory Sony values its inventory based on the lower of cost or market. Sony writes down inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the net realizable value  i.e., estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion and disposal. Sony writes down the value of its inventory when the underlying parts, components or products have become obsolete, when inventory levels exceed the amount expected to be used, or when the value of the inventory is otherwise recorded at a higher value than net realizable value. As a result, if actual market conditions are less favorable than projected and further price decreases are needed, additional inventory write-downs may be required in the future. Impairment of long-lived assets Sony reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of its long-lived assets held and used and long-lived assets to be disposed of whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or asset groups may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group with their estimated undiscounted future cash flows. This review is primarily performed using estimates of future cash flows by product category (e.g. LCD rear-projection televisions) or, in certain cases, by entity. If the carrying value of the asset or asset group is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined using the present value of estimated net cash flows or comparable market values. This approach uses significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, the timing of such cash flows, discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates applied to determine terminal values, determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. Management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value are reasonable; however, changes in estimates resulting in lower future cash flows and fair value due to unforeseen changes in Sonys businesses or assumptions could negatively affect the valuations of long-lived assets. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, Sony recorded impairment charges for long-lived assets totaling 16,762 million yen, which included 3,572 million yen for the impairment of long-lived assets of CRT TV display manufacturing facilities to be held and used in the U.S., East Asia and Southeast Asia in connection with certain restructuring activities in the Electronics segment. Fair value of these assets was determined using estimated future discounted cash flows which were based on the best information available. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, Sony recorded impairment charges for long-lived assets totaling 19,413 million yen, which included 6,457 million for impairment of long-lived assets of LCD rear-projection television manufacturing facilities to be held and used worldwide in connection with certain restructuring activities 78 Table of Contents in the Electronics segment. Fair value of these assets was determined using estimated future discounted cash flows which were based on the best information available. The deterioration of the business climate and its continued financial impact on the Electronics and Game segments in the second half of calendar year 2008 and into early calendar year 2009 was considered a circumstance which indicated that the carrying amounts of the assets or asset groups in those segments may not have been recoverable. As such, Sony tested the long-lived assets of the Electronics and Game segments, which consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment, by comparing carrying values of assets or asset groups with estimated undiscounted future cash flows. Impairment charges as a result of the testing are included in the amounts described below. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, Sony recorded impairment charges for long-lived assets totaling 17,370 million yen which did not include any individually significant charges. These charges also partially related to restructuring activities undertaken, primarily in the Electronics segment. The estimates of undiscounted cash flows for the recoverability testing and discounted cash flows for determining fair value reflected Sonys revised business plans and the deteriorated business climate, particularly the timing and rate of the future business recovery, and required significant judgment. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimates used in the impairment recoverability, Sony applied a hypothetical 10 percent decrease to the estimated undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability tests for each asset or asset group. As of March 31, 2009, a hypothetical 10 percent decrease to those undiscounted cash flows would not have resulted in a material impact on Sonys results of operations or financial position. Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill and certain other intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite life are not amortized and are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and the assets are also tested between the annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of these assets below their carrying amount. Such an event would include unfavorable variances from established business plans, significant changes in forecasted results or volatility inherent to external markets and industries, which are periodically reviewed by Sonys management. Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Reporting units are Sonys operating segments or one level below the operating segments (e.g. Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) Inc. (SMEJ) which is included in All Other or Sonys U.S. based Disc Manufacturing business which is included in the Electronics segment). If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not performed. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. Other intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions could significantly impact whether or not an impairment charge is recognized as well as the magnitude of any such charge. In its impairment review, Sony 79 Table of Contents performs internal valuation analyses or utilizes third-party valuations when management believes it to be appropriate, and considers other market information that is publicly available. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. This approach uses significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, the timing of such cash flows, discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates applied to determine terminal values, determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. Sonys annual test of impairment for goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life coincided with the deterioration of the business climate and its continued financial impact on the Electronics and Game segments in the second half of calendar year 2008 and into early calendar year 2009. For substantially all the reporting units, fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. Except as described below, fair value exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units with goodwill or intangible assets with an indefinite life, and therefore no impairment existed and the second step of the impairment test was not required. As a result, no material impairments of goodwill or intangible assets with an indefinite life were recorded beyond the impairments described below. The expected future cash flow forecast, which reflected Sonys revised business plans and the deteriorated business climate, required significant judgment, particularly regarding the timing and rate of the future business recovery. When testing goodwill for impairment, consideration was given to Sonys market capitalization in relation to the sum of the calculated fair values of the reporting units, including reporting units with no goodwill, and taking into account corporate level assets and liabilities not assigned to individual reporting units as well as a reasonable control premium. Sony believes that the overall recent decrease in market capitalization, which has resulted in the market capitalization falling below the net asset value of Sony, is not representative of a long-term decrease in the value of the underlying reporting units. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, Sony recorded an impairment loss of 7,961 million yen for reporting units in All Other. Of this impairment loss, 7,655 million yen was related to goodwill recorded for Sonys acquisition in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 of Gracenote, Inc. (Gracenote), a company that provides technology and services for digital media identification, enrichment and recommendation. The impairment charge for Gracenote reflects the impact of weakened economic conditions, which resulted in lower growth forecasts for several key markets serviced by Gracenote, including the automotive and mobile communications markets. The valuation of Gracenote also decreased due to the use of a higher discount rate in calculating the present value of future cash flows to reflect higher perceived economic risk due to the economic downturn. The carrying amounts of goodwill by segment as of March 31, 2009 are as follows: Yen in millions Electronics 83,003 Game 123,432 Pictures 107,478 Financial Services 3,020 All Other 127,025 Total 443,958 Management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable; however, in the future, changes in estimates resulting in lower than currently anticipated cash flows and fair value due to unforeseen changes in business assumptions could negatively affect the valuations, which may result in Sony recognizing impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets in the future. Two of the most significant assumptions applied to estimated cash flows involved in the determination of fair value of the reporting units were the discount rates and perpetual growth rates applied to determine terminal values used in the discounted cash flow analysis. The discount rates used in the cash flow models for the goodwill impairment testing for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 considered market and industry data as well as specific risk factors for each reporting unit. The perpetual growth rates for the individual reporting units, for purposes of the terminal value determination, were generally set after an initial three-year forecasted period and were based on historical 80 Table of Contents experience, market and industry data. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the impairment analysis, Sony applied a hypothetical 10 percent decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit. As of March 31, 2009, a hypothetical 10 percent decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit would have resulted in one reporting unit in the Pictures segment failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. This reporting unit had 93,509 million yen of goodwill as of March 31, 2009. Had the second step of the impairment test been applied, an impairment charge may have been necessary. Other than this, a hypothetical 10 percent decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit would not have resulted in a step two test being undertaken for any other reporting unit. Pension benefit costs Employee pension benefit costs and obligations are dependent on certain assumptions including discount rates, retirement rates and mortality rates, which are based upon current statistical data, as well as expected long-term rates of return on pension plan assets and other factors. Specifically, the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets are two critical assumptions in the determination of periodic pension costs and pension liabilities. Assumptions are evaluated at least annually, or at the time when events occur or circumstances change and these events or changes could have a significant effect on these critical assumptions. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods. Therefore, actual results generally affect recognized costs and the recorded obligations for pensions in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Sonys pension obligations and future costs. Sonys principal pension plans are its Japanese pension plans. Foreign pension plans are not significant individually or in the aggregate to total pension plan assets and pension obligations. To determine the benefit obligation of the Japanese pension plans, Sony used a discount rate of 2.2 percent for its Japanese pension plans as of March 31, 2009. The discount rate was determined by using currently available information about rates of return on high-quality fixed-income investments available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefit obligation in consideration of amounts and timing of cash outflows for expected benefit payments. Such available information about rates of returns is collected from published market information and credit rating agencies. The 2.2 percent discount rate represents a 10 basis point decrease from the 2.3 percent discount rate used for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 and reflects current Japanese market interest rate conditions. For Japanese pension plans, a 10 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension costs by approximately 0.8 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, Sony considers the current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on various categories of pension plan assets. Sonys pension investment policy recognizes the expected growth and the variability risk associated with the long term nature of pension liabilities, the returns and risks of diversification across asset classes, and the correlation among assets. The asset allocations are designed to maximize returns consistent with levels of liquidity and investment risk that are considered prudent and reasonable. While the pension investment policy gives appropriate consideration to recent market performance and historical returns, the investment assumptions utilized by Sony are designed to achieve a long term return consistent with the long term nature of the corresponding pension liabilities. For Japanese pension plans, the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets was 4.0 percent and 3.9 percent as of March 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively. The actual return on pension plan assets for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008 and 2009 was an 8.5 percent loss and a 16.2 percent loss, respectively. Actual results that differ from the expected return on pension plan assets are accumulated and amortized as a component of pension costs over the average future service period, thereby reducing the year-to-year volatility in pension costs. As of March 31, 2008 and 2009, Sony had net actuarial losses of 242.1 billion yen and 338.0 billion yen, respectively, including losses related to pension plan assets. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, the net actuarial loss increased due to the difference between the actual rate of return on pension plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. The net actuarial loss reflects the overall unfavorable return on investment over the past several years and will result in an increase in pension costs as they are recognized. 81 Table of Contents The following table illustrates the effect on the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010 of changes in the discount rate and the expected return on pension plan assets, while holding all other assumptions as of March 31, 2009 constant, for Japanese pension plans. Pre-Tax Pension Equity Change in Assumption PBO Costs (Net of Tax) (Yen in billions) 25 basis point increase / decrease in discount rate −/+27.2 −/+2.0 +/−1.2 25 basis point increase / decrease in expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  −/+1.1 +/−0.7 Deferred tax asset valuation Carrying amounts of deferred tax assets require a reduction by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically with appropriate consideration given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets. Managements judgments related to this assessment consider, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses on an individual tax jurisdiction basis, forecasts of future profitability after consideration of uncertain tax positions, excess of appreciated asset value over the tax basis of net assets, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, Sonys experience with operating loss carryforwards not expiring unused, as well as prudent and feasible tax planning strategies which would be employed by Sony, if necessary, to prevent net operating loss carryforwards from expiring unutilized. As a result of losses incurred in recent years, Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. (SCEI), Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc. (SCEA), and Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Limited (SCEE) are each in a three year cumulative pre-tax loss position at March 31, 2009. A cumulative loss position is considered significant negative evidence in assessing the realizability of a deferred tax asset. Sony has concluded that there is sufficient positive evidence to overcome this negative evidence principally through the use of tax planning strategies. The tax planning strategies include transactions among certain businesses with historically strong earnings and the loss businesses as well as the sales of certain assets that could realize the excess of appreciated value over the tax basis of those assets. Sony believes that the tax planning strategies coupled with future earnings forecasts of the historically profitable entities would produce sufficient taxable income in the legal entities in the future to fully realize the deferred tax assets at March 31, 2009 (principally in the U.S. and Japan), notwithstanding that some of the expected profitable businesses incurred losses in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 and are expected to incur losses in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010, as a result of the dramatic changes in worldwide economic conditions, the strengthening of the yen, and restructuring actions undertaken by Sony. Accordingly, no valuation allowance at March 31, 2009 has been recorded. Notwithstanding the above, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be significantly reduced in the future if estimates of future taxable income from the tax planning strategies and forecasted earnings during the tax loss carryforward period are significantly lower than currently estimated due to further deterioration in economic conditions or Sonys failure to achieve its restructuring objectives. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable as it relates to SCEI, SCEA and SCEE take into account the uncertain tax positions related to the more likely than not adjustments for Sonys intercompany transfer pricing. Such transfer pricing is currently under review by the relevant governments as a result of a competent authority request and applications for Bilateral Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) filed in the U.S., the U.K. and Japan. Sony is required to estimate the final outcome of those government to government negotiations in recording its tax positions, including the allocation and amount of deferred tax assets among the various legal entities at March 31, 2009. It is possible that the advance pricing agreement negotiations could result in a different allocation of profits and losses than those estimated by management, and that such allocation could have an adverse 82 Table of Contents impact on the realizability of Sonys deferred tax assets. Sony may record adjustments to its provision for uncertain tax positions, and, accordingly, its valuation allowance assessments, as additional evidence becomes available. The estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets, which is based on current tax laws and rates in effect at March 31, 2009, reflects managements judgment and best estimate of the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in Sonys financial statements and tax returns, the ability to implement various tax planning strategies and, in certain cases, future forecasts, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results, and further market or economic deterioration or failure of management to achieve its restructuring objectives could affect future business results, either of which could affect the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. If future results are less than projected, if APA negotiations result in a different allocation of profits and losses than currently anticipated, if tax planning alternatives are no longer viable or if there is no excess appreciated asset value over the tax basis of the assets contemplated for sale, further valuation allowances may be required in the future to reduce the deferred tax assets to their net realizable value. These factors and other changes that are not anticipated in current estimates could have a material impact on Sonys earnings or financial position in the period or periods in which they are recorded. Film accounting An aspect of film accounting that requires the exercise of judgment relates to the process of estimating the total revenues to be received throughout a films life cycle, subject to the limitations of Statement of Position 00-2, Accounting by Producers or Distributors of Films. Such estimate of a films ultimate revenue is important for two reasons. First, while a film is being produced and the related costs are being capitalized, it is necessary for management to estimate the ultimate revenue, less additional costs to be incurred, including exploitation costs which are expensed as incurred, in order to determine whether the value of a film has been impaired and thus requires an immediate write off of unrecoverable film costs. Second, the amount of film costs recognized as cost of sales for a given film as it is exhibited in various markets throughout its life cycle is based upon the proportion that current period actual revenues bear to the estimated ultimate total revenues. Management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue for each film on several factors including the historical performance of similar genre films, the star power of the lead actors and actresses, the expected number of theaters at which the film will be released, anticipated performance in the home entertainment, television and other ancillary markets, and agreements for future sales. Management updates such estimates on a regular basis based on the actual results to date and estimated future results for each film. For example, a film that has resulted in lower than expected theatrical revenues in its initial weeks of release would generally have its theatrical, home entertainment and television distribution ultimate revenues adjusted downward; a failure to do so would result in the understatement of amortized film costs for the period. Future insurance policy benefits Liabilities for future insurance policy benefits are established in amounts adequate to meet the estimated future obligations of policies in force. These liabilities are computed by the net level premium method based upon estimates as to future investment yield, mortality, morbidity, withdrawals and other factors. Future policy benefits are computed using interest rates ranging from 1.2 percent to 4.8 percent and are based on factors such as market conditions in Japan and expected investment returns. Mortality, morbidity and withdrawal assumptions for all policies are based on either the subsidiarys own experience or various actuarial tables. Generally these assumptions are locked-in throughout the life of the contract upon the issuance of new insurance, although significant changes in experience or assumptions may require Sony to provide for expected future losses. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Sonys future insurance policy benefits. 83 Table of Contents RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Fair value measurements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. FAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value, clarifies the definition of fair value, and expands disclosures about the use of fair value measurements. FAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and does not require any new fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Positions (FSP) No. FAS 157-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13 and FSP No. FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157. FSP No. FAS 157-1 removed certain leasing transactions from the scope of FAS No. 157. FSP No. FAS 157-2 partially delayed the effective date of FAS No. 157 for Sony until April 1, 2009 for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active. FSP No. FAS 157-3 clarifies the application of FAS No. 157 in a market that is not active, and was effective upon issuance. Sony adopted FAS No. 157 on April 1, 2008 with regards to financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The adoption of FAS No. 157 as it relates to financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on Sonys consolidated results of operations and financial position. The adoption of FAS No. 157 as it relates to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in Sonys financial statements on a nonrecurring basis is not expected to have a material impact on Sonys consolidated results of operations and financial position. Fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. FAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, various financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. The fair value measurement election is irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings. Sony adopted FAS No. 159 on April 1, 2008. Sony did not elect the fair value option for any assets or liabilities that were not previously carried at fair value. Accordingly, the adoption of FAS No. 159 had no impact on Sonys consolidated financial statements. However, its effects on future periods will depend on the nature of instruments held by Sony and its elections under the provisions of FAS No. 159. Disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities In March 2008, the FASB issued FAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. FAS No. 161 amends and expands the disclosures required by FAS No. 133 to provide more information about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under FAS No. 133 and its interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. Sony adopted FAS No. 161 for disclosures related to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. Since this standard impacts disclosures only, the adoption of FAS No. 161 has no impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Amendments to the impairment guidance of certain debt securities In January 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. EITF 99-20-1, Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99-20. FSP No. EITF 99-20-1 amends the impairment guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 99-20, Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Interests That Continue to Be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets to make the guidance consistent between EITF Issue No. 99-20 and FAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. FSP No. EITF 99-20-1 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after 84 Table of Contents December 15, 2008, and is applied prospectively. The adoption of FSP No. EITF 99-20-1 did not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Disclosures about transfers of financial assets and variable interest entities In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8, Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities. It amends FAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, to require additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets. It also amends FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 46 (Revised), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities  an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, to require additional disclosures about involvement with variable interest entities (VIEs). Sony adopted FSP No. FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 for disclosures related to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. This standard encourages but does not require comparative disclosures for earlier periods at the initial adoption. Since this standard impacts disclosures only, the adoption of FSP No. FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 did not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Accounting for collaborative arrangements In December 2007, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 07-1, Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements. EITF Issue No. 07-1 defines collaborative arrangements and requires that transactions with third parties that do not participate in the arrangement be reported in the appropriate income statement line items pursuant to the guidance in EITF Issue No. 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent. Income statement classification of payments made between participants of a collaborative arrangement are to be based on other applicable authoritative accounting literature. EITF Issue No. 07-1 is effective for Sony as of April 1, 2009, and requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date. Sony is currently evaluating the impact of adopting EITF Issue No. 07-1. Business combinations In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations, which applies for Sony prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after April 1, 2009. FAS No. 141(R) requires that the acquisition method of accounting be applied to a broader range of business combinations, amends the definition of a business combination, provides a definition of a business, requires an acquirer to recognize an acquired business at its fair value at the acquisition date, and requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination to be measured and recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date, with limited exceptions. The effect of these changes on future periods will depend primarily on the nature and significance of any acquisitions subject to FAS No. 141(R). Also, under FAS No. 141(R), changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense in periods subsequent to the acquisition date. Adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to April 1, 2009 would also apply the provisions of FAS No. 141(R). In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 141(R)-1, Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies, to amend FAS No. 141(R). FSP No. FAS 141(R)-1 addresses the initial recognition, measurement and subsequent accounting for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination, and requires that such assets acquired or liabilities assumed be initially recognized at fair value at the acquisition date if fair value can be determined during the measurement period. If the acquisition-date fair value cannot be determined, the asset acquired or liability assumed arising from a contingency is recognized only if certain criteria are met. For Sony, FSP No. FAS 141(R)-1 is effective for assets acquired or liabilities assumed arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after April 1, 2009. The effect of FSP No. FAS 141(R)-1 will depend on the nature and significance of any acquisitions after the adoption date. 85 Table of Contents Noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements  an amendment of ARB No. 51. FAS No. 160 requires that the noncontrolling interest in the equity of a subsidiary be accounted for and reported as equity, provides revised guidance on the treatment of net income and losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest and changes in ownership interests in a subsidiary and requires additional disclosures that identify and distinguish between the interests of the controlling and noncontrolling owners. Pursuant to the transition provisions of FAS No. 160, Sony will adopt the statement as of April 1, 2009, via retrospective application of the presentation and disclosure requirements. The effects on future periods will depend on the nature and significance of any transactions subject to FAS No. 160. Determination of the useful life of intangible assets In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets, which amends the list of factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of recognized intangible assets under FAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The new guidance applies to (1) intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets and (2) intangible assets acquired in both business combinations and asset acquisitions. Under FSP No. FAS 142-3, entities estimating the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must consider their historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements or, in the absence of historical experience, must consider assumptions that market participants would use about renewal or extension. For Sony, FSP No. FAS 142-3 will require certain additional disclosures in future periods after the effective date of April 1, 2009, and application to useful life estimates prospectively for intangible assets acquired after March 31, 2009. The adoption of FSP No. FAS 142-3 is not expected to have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Equity method investment accounting In November 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 08-6, Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations, which addresses certain effects of FAS Nos. 141(R) and 160 on an entitys accounting for equity-method investments. The consensus indicates, among other things, that transaction costs for an investment should be included in the cost of the equity-method investment (and not expensed) and shares subsequently issued by the equity-method investee that reduce the investors ownership percentage should be accounted for as if the investor had sold a proportionate share of its investment, with gains or losses recorded through earnings. EITF Issue No. 08-6 is effective for Sony as of April 1, 2009 and its effects on future periods will depend on the nature and significance of any transactions subject to EITF Issue No. 08-6. Postretirement benefit plan asset disclosures In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 132(R)-1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets. FSP No. FAS 132(R)-1 requires additional disclosures about plan assets for sponsors of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans including expanded information regarding investment strategies, major categories of plan assets, and concentrations of risk within plan assets. Additionally, FSP No. FAS 132(R)-1 requires disclosures similar to those required under FAS No. 157 with respect to the fair value of plan assets such as the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value and information with respect to classification of plan assets in terms of the hierarchy of the source of information used to determine their value. The disclosures under FSP No. FAS 132(R)-1 are required for annual periods ending after December 15, 2009. Upon initial application, the provisions of FSP No. FAS 132(R)-1 are not required for earlier periods that are presented for comparative purposes. Sony is currently evaluating the additional disclosures required by FSP No. FAS 132(R)-1. Recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments. The FSP is intended to provide greater clarity to investors about the credit and noncredit component of an other-than-temporary impairment event and to more effectively communicate when an 86 Table of Contents other-than-temporary impairment event has occurred. The FSP applies to debt securities only and requires separate display of losses related to credit deterioration and losses related to other market factors. When an entity does not intend to sell a debt security and it is more likely than not that the entity will not have to sell the debt security before recovery of its cost basis, it must recognize the credit component of an other-than-temporary impairment in earnings and the remaining portion in other comprehensive income. In addition, upon adoption of the FSP, an entity is required to record a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning of the period of adoption to reclassify the noncredit component of a previously recognized other-than-temporary impairment from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive income. FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 are effective for Sony as of April 1, 2009. Sony is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the FSP. Determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157-4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly. FSP No. FAS 157-4 provides additional authoritative guidance to assist both issuers and users of financial statements in determining whether a market is active or inactive, and whether a transaction is distressed. FSP No. FAS 157-4 is effective for Sony as of April 1, 2009, and is applied prospectively. The adoption of FSP No. FAS 157-4 is not expected to have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Item 6.

There is no family relationship between any of the persons named above. There is no arrangement or understanding with major shareholders, customers, suppliers, or others pursuant to which any person named above was selected as a Director or a Corporate Executive Officer. Compensation The aggregate amount of remuneration, including bonuses paid and benefits in kind granted by Sony during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 to all Directors and Corporate Executive Officers (refer to Board Practices below) of Sony Corporation who served during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, as a group (20 people), totaled 2,868 million yen. Also, as a part of Sonys incentive compensation arrangements, Sony Corporation issued stock acquisition rights during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. The stock acquisition rights, which represent rights to subscribe for shares of common stock of Sony Corporation, have been granted to the Directors, Corporate Executive Officers, Corporate Executives, Group Executives, and selected employees. The stock acquisition rights cannot be exercised for one year from the date of grant and generally vest ratably up to three years from the date of grant and are generally exercisable up to ten years from the date of grant. A portion of those stock acquisition rights that was granted by Sony during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 to the Directors and Corporate Executive Officers confers rights to purchase a total of 757,600 shares of Sony Corporations Common Stock. The exercise price for yen-denominated stock acquisition rights issued on November 18, 2008 was 2,987 yen per share, and the exercise price for U.S. dollar-denominated stock acquisition rights issued on November 18, 2008 was 30.24 U.S. dollars. Regarding the above compensation plans, refer to Note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Under the current stock-based retirement remuneration (phantom restricted stock plan), which was introduced in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, there was no amount accrued for lump-sum severance indemnities by Sony during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 for participating Directors and Corporate Executive Officers of Sony Corporation as of March 31, 2009, as a group (19 people). Regarding the phantom restricted stock plan, points fixed every year by the Compensation Committee are granted to Directors and Corporate Executive Officers every year during his/her tenure in office and at the time of resignation, the remuneration amount shall be calculated by multiplying Sony Corporations Common Stock price by accumulated points. The resigning Directors and Corporate Executive Officers shall purchase Sony Corporations Common Stock with this remuneration. The aggregate number of points granted to participating Directors and Corporate Executive Officers of Sony Corporation as of March 31, 2009, as a group (17 people) totaled 97,200 points. 94 Table of Contents Board Practices Sony Corporation has adopted a Company with Committees corporate governance system under the Japanese Companies Act (Kaishaho) and related regulations (collectively the Companies Act). Under this system, Sony Corporation has three committees: the Nominating Committee, the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. Under the Companies Act, each committee is required to consist of not less than three Directors, the majority of whom must be outside Directors. Under the committee system, Directors as such have no power to execute the business of Sony Corporation except for limited circumstances as permitted by law. The Board of Directors must elect Corporate Executive Officers (Shikko-yaku), who are responsible for the execution of the business of Sony Corporation. A summary of the governance system adopted by Sony Corporation is set forth below. The Board of Directors determines fundamental management policy and other important matters related to the management of Sony and oversees the performance of the duties of Directors and Corporate Executive Officers. Furthermore, the Board of Directors has the power and authority to appoint and dismiss the members of Sony Corporations three committees and Corporate Executive Officers. Under the Companies Act, all Directors must be elected at the General Meeting of Shareholders from the candidates determined by the Nominating Committee. Under the Companies Act, the term of office of Directors expires at the conclusion of the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held with respect to the last business year ending within one year after their election. Directors may serve any number of consecutive terms although, under the Charter of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation, outside Directors may not be reelected more than five times without the consent of all Directors. Yotaro Kobayashi, Sakie T. Fukushima, Yoshihiko Miyauchi and Yoshiaki Yamauchi were respectively reelected for the sixth term as an outside Director at the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 19, 2009 upon nomination by the Nominating Committee with the consent of all Directors pursuant to the Charter of the Board of Directors. The Nominating Committee, which pursuant to the Charter of the Board of Directors of Sony Corporation consists of five or more Directors, determines the content of proposals to be submitted for approval at the General Meeting of Shareholders regarding the appointment and dismissal of Directors.

As of March 31, 2008, Sony had approximately 180,500 employees, an increase of approximately 17,500 employees from March 31, 2007. The total number of employees increased as a result of a significant increase in employees at manufacturing sites in East Asia and East Europe with an expansion of business in the Electronics segment. As of March 31, 2008, approximately 61,000 employees were located in Japan and approximately 119,500 employees were located outside Japan.

In China, most employees are members of the labor unions. In the U.S., no manufacturing sites have labor unions. In Europe, Sony generally maintains good labor relations with the Work Councils in each country, and, while some employees belong to unions, they are not eligible for union contracts.

Directors Under the Companies Act, Directors have no power to execute the business of Sony Corporation except in limited circumstances as permitted by law. If a Director also serves concurrently as a Corporate Executive Officer, then he or she can execute the business of Sony Corporation in the capacity of Corporate Executive Officer. Under the Companies Act, Directors must refrain from engaging in any business competing with Sony Corporation unless approved by the Board of Directors, and any Director who has a material interest in the subject matter of a resolution to be taken by the Board of Directors cannot vote on such resolution. The amount of remuneration to each Director is determined by the Compensation Committee, which consists of Directors, the majority of whom are 103 Table of Contents outside Directors (Refer to Board Practices in Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees). No member of the Compensation Committee may vote on a resolution with respect to his or her own compensation as a Director or a Corporate Executive Officer. Neither the Companies Act nor Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation make a special provision as to the borrowing powers exercisable by Directors (subject to requisite internal authorizations as required by the Companies Act), their retirement age, or a requirement to hold any shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation. For more information on Directors, refer to Board Practices in Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees. Capital stock (General) Unless indicated otherwise, set forth below is information relating to Sony Corporations capital stock, including brief summaries of the relevant provisions of Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation and Share Handling Regulations, currently in effect, and of the Companies Act and related regulations. On January 5, 2009, a new central book-entry transfer system for shares of Japanese listed companies was established pursuant to the Act Concerning Book-entry Transfer of Corporate Bonds, Shares etc. (Book-entry Transfer Act), and this system is applied to the shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation. Under this system, shares of all Japanese companies listed on any Japanese stock exchange are dematerialized, and shareholders must have accounts at account management institutions to hold their shares unless such shareholder has an account at Japan Securities Depository Center, Inc. (JASDEC). Account management institutions are financial instruments traders (i.e., securities companies), banks, trust companies and certain other financial institutions that meet the requirements prescribed by the Book-entry Transfer Act. Transfer of the shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation is effected exclusively through entry in the records maintained by JASDEC and the account management institutions, and title to the shares passes to the transferee at the time when the transfer of the shares is recorded at the transferees account at an account management institution. The holder of an account at an account management institution is presumed to be the legal holder of the shares recorded in such account. Under the Companies Act and the Book-entry Transfer Act, in order to assert shareholders rights against Sony Corporation, a transferee of shares must have its name and address registered in Sony Corporations register of shareholders. Under the central book-entry transfer system operated by JASDEC, shareholders shall notify the relevant account management institutions of certain information prescribed under the Book-entry Transfer Act or Sony Corporations Share Handling Regulations, including their names and addresses, and the registration on Sony Corporations register of shareholders is made upon receipt by Sony Corporation of necessary information from JASDEC (as described in Record date). On the other hand, in order to assert shareholders rights to which shareholders are entitled regardless of record dates such as minority shareholders rights, including the right to propose a matter to be considered at a General Meeting of Shareholders, except for shareholders rights to request that Sony Corporation purchase or sell shares constituting less than a full unit (as described in Unit share system), JASDEC shall, upon the shareholders request, issue a notice of certain information, including the name and address of such shareholder, to Sony Corporation. Under the Book-entry Transfer Act, the shareholder shall exercise such shareholders right within four weeks after notice has been given. Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation is the transfer agent for Sony Corporations capital stock. As such, it keeps Sony Corporations registers of shareholders in its office at 4-5, Marunouchi 1-chome, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo. Non-resident shareholders are required to appoint a standing proxy in Japan or file notice of a mailing address in Japan. Japanese securities companies and commercial banks customarily act as standing proxies and provide related services for standard fees. The registered holder of deposited shares underlying the American Depositary Shares (ADSs) is the depositary for the ADSs. Accordingly, holders of ADSs will not be able to directly assert shareholders rights against Sony Corporation. 104 Table of Contents (Authorized capital) Under the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation, Sony Corporation may only issue shares of Common Stock. Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation provide that the total number of shares authorized to be issued by Sony Corporation is 3.6 billion shares.

(Distribution of Surplus) Distribution of Surplus  General Under the Companies Act, distributions of cash or other assets by joint stock corporations to their shareholders, so called dividends, are referred to as distributions of Surplus (Surplus is defined in  Restriction on distributions of Surplus). Sony Corporation may make distributions of Surplus to shareholders any number of times per business year, subject to certain limitations described in  Restriction on distributions of Surplus. Distributions of Surplus are required in principle to be authorized by a resolution of a General Meeting of Shareholders, but Sony Corporation may authorize distributions of Surplus by a resolution of the Board of Directors as long as its non-consolidated annual financial statements and certain documents for the last business year present fairly its assets and profit or loss, as required by ordinances of the Ministry of Justice. Distributions of Surplus may be made in cash or in kind in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock held by each shareholder. A resolution of the Board of Directors or a General Meeting of Shareholders authorizing a distribution of Surplus must specify the kind and aggregate book value of the assets to be distributed, the manner of allocation of such assets to shareholders, and the effective date of the distribution. If a distribution of Surplus is to be made in kind, Sony Corporation may, pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors or (as the case may be) a General Meeting of Shareholders, grant a right to the shareholders to require Sony Corporation to make such distribution in cash instead of in kind. If no such right is granted to shareholders, the relevant distribution of Surplus must be approved by a special resolution of a General Meeting of Shareholders (refer to Voting Rights with respect to a special resolution). Under the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation, year-end dividends and interim dividends may be distributed to shareholders appearing in Sony Corporations register of shareholders as of March 31 and September 30 each year, respectively, in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock held by each shareholder following approval by the Board of Directors or (as the case may be) the General Meeting of Shareholders. Sony Corporation is not obliged to pay any dividends unclaimed for a period of five years after the date on which they first became payable. In Japan, the ex-dividend date and the record date for dividends precede the date of determination of the amount of the dividends to be paid. The price of the shares of Common Stock generally goes ex-dividend on the third business day prior to the record date. Distribution of Surplus  Restriction on distribution of Surplus In making a distribution of Surplus, Sony Corporation must, until the sum of its additional paid-in capital and legal reserve reaches one quarter of its stated capital, set aside in its additional paid-in capital and/or legal reserve an amount equal to one-tenth of the amount of Surplus so distributed. The amount of Surplus at any given time must be calculated in accordance with the following formula: A + B + C + D − (E + F + G) In the above formula: A = the total amount of other capital surplus and other retained earnings, each such amount being that appearing on the non-consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the last business year 105 Table of Contents B = (if Sony Corporation has disposed of its treasury stock after the end of the last business year) the amount of the consideration for such treasury stock received by Sony Corporation less the book value thereof C = (if Sony Corporation has reduced its stated capital after the end of the last business year) the amount of such reduction less the portion thereof that has been transferred to additional paid-in capital or legal reserve (if any) D = (if Sony Corporation has reduced its additional paid-in capital or legal reserve after the end of the last business year) the amount of such reduction less the portion thereof that has been transferred to stated capital (if any) E = (if Sony Corporation has cancelled its treasury stock after the end of the last business year) the book value of such treasury stock F = (if Sony Corporation has distributed Surplus to its shareholders after the end of the last business year) the total book value of the Surplus so distributed G = certain other amounts set forth in ordinances of the Ministry of Justice, including (if Sony Corporation has reduced Surplus and increased its stated capital, additional paid-in capital or legal reserve after the end of the last business year) the amount of such reduction and (if Sony Corporation has distributed Surplus to the shareholders after the end of the last business year) the amount set aside in additional paid-in capital or legal reserve (if any) as required by ordinances of the Ministry of Justice. The aggregate book value of Surplus distributed by Sony Corporation may not exceed a prescribed distributable amount (the Distributable Amount), as calculated on the effective date of such distribution. The Distributable Amount at any given time shall be equal to the amount of Surplus less the aggregate of the followings: (a) the book value of its treasury stock; (b) the amount of consideration for any of treasury stock disposed of by Sony Corporation after the end of the last business year; and (c) certain other amounts set forth in ordinances of the Ministry of Justice, including (if the sum of one-half of goodwill and the deferred assets exceeds the total of stated capital, additional paid-in capital and legal reserve, each such amount being that appearing on the non-consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the last business year) all or certain part of such exceeding amount as calculated in accordance with ordinances of the Ministry of Justice. If Sony Corporation has become at its option a company with respect to which consolidated balance sheets should also be considered in the calculation of the Distributable Amount (renketsu haito kisei tekiyo kaisha), Sony Corporation must further deduct from the amount of Surplus the excess amount, if any, of (x) the total amount of stockholders equity appearing on the non-consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the last business year and certain other amounts set forth by ordinances of the Ministry of Justice over (y) the total amount of stockholders equity and certain other amounts set forth by ordinances of the Ministry of Justice appearing on the consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the last business year. If Sony Corporation has prepared interim financial statements as described below, and if such interim financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors or (if so required by the Companies Act) by a General Meeting of Shareholders, then the Distributable Amount must be adjusted to take into account the amount of profit or loss, and the amount of consideration for any of the treasury stock disposed of by Sony Corporation, during the period in respect of which such interim financial statements have been prepared. Sony Corporation may prepare non-consolidated interim financial statements consisting of a balance sheet as of any date subsequent to the end of the last business year and an income statement for the period from the first day of the current business year to the date of such balance sheet. Interim financial statements so prepared by Sony Corporation must be audited by the Audit Committee and the independent auditor, as required by ordinances of the Ministry of Justice. 106 Table of Contents (Stock splits) Sony Corporation may at any time split shares in issue into a greater number of shares at the determination of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). When a stock split is to be made, Sony Corporation must give public notice of the stock split, specifying the record date thereof, at least two weeks prior to such record date. Under the central book-entry transfer system operated by JASDEC, Sony Corporation must also give notice to JASDEC regarding a stock split at least two weeks prior to the relevant record date. On the effective date of the stock split, the numbers of shares recorded in all accounts held by Sony Corporations shareholders at account managing institutions or JASDEC will be increased in accordance with the applicable ratio. (Consolidation of shares) Sony Corporation may at any time consolidate issued shares into a smaller number of shares by the special shareholders resolution (as defined in (Voting Rights)). When a consolidation of shares is to be made, Sony Corporation must give public notice or notice to each shareholder at least two weeks prior to the effective date of the consolidation of shares. Under the central book-entry transfer system operated by JASDEC, Sony Corporation must also give notice to JASDEC regarding a consolidation of shares at least two weeks prior to the effective date of the consolidation of shares. On the effective date of the consolidation of shares, the numbers of shares recorded in all accounts held by Sony Corporations shareholders at account managing institutions or JASDEC will be decreased in accordance with the applicable ratio. Sony Corporation must disclose the reason for the consolidation of shares at a General Meeting of Shareholders. (General Meeting of Shareholders) The Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders of Sony Corporation for each business year is normally held in June of each year in Tokyo, Japan. In addition, Sony Corporation may hold an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders whenever necessary by giving notice thereof at least two weeks prior to the date set for the meeting. Notice of a shareholders meeting setting forth the place, time and purpose thereof must be mailed to each shareholder having voting rights (or, in the case of a non-resident shareholder, to such shareholders resident proxy or mailing address in Japan) at least two weeks prior to the date set for the meeting. Under the Companies Act, such notice may be given to shareholders by electronic means, subject to obtaining consent by the relevant shareholders. The record date for an Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders is March 31 of each year. Any shareholder or group of shareholders holding at least three percent of the total number of voting rights for a period of six months or more may require the convocation of a General Meeting of Shareholders for a particular purpose. Unless such a shareholders meeting is convened promptly or a convocation notice of a meeting which is to be held not later than eight weeks from the day of such demand is dispatched, the requiring shareholder may, upon obtaining a court approval, convene such a shareholders meeting. Any shareholder or group of shareholders holding at least 300 voting rights or one percent of the total number of voting rights for a period of six months or more may propose a matter to be considered at a General Meeting of Shareholders by submitting a written request to Sony Corporation at least eight weeks prior to the date set for such meeting. If the Articles of Incorporation so provide, any of the minimum voting rights or percentages, time periods and number of voting rights necessary for exercising the minority shareholder rights described above may be decreased or shortened. (Voting rights) So long as Sony Corporation maintains the unit share system, a holder of shares constituting one or more units is entitled to one vote for each such unit of stock (refer to (Unit share system) below; currently 100 shares constitute one unit), except that no voting rights with respect to shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation are afforded to Sony Corporation or any corporate or certain other entity more than one-quarter of the total voting rights 107 Table of Contents of which are directly or indirectly held by Sony Corporation. If Sony Corporation eliminates from its Articles of Incorporation the provisions relating to units of stock, holders of capital stock will have one vote for each share they hold. Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation, a resolution can be adopted at a General Meeting of Shareholders by a majority of the number of voting rights of all the shareholders represented at the meeting. The Companies Act and Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation provide, however, that the quorum for the election of Directors shall not be less than one-third of the total number of voting rights of all the shareholders. Sony Corporations shareholders are not entitled to cumulative voting in the election of Directors. Shareholders may cast their votes in writing and may also exercise their voting rights through proxies, provided that the proxies are also shareholders holding voting rights. Shareholders may also exercise their voting rights by electronic means pursuant to the method designated by Sony Corporation. The Companies Act and the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation provide that in order to amend the Articles of Incorporation and in certain other instances, including: (1) acquisition of its own shares from a specific party other than its subsidiaries; (2) consolidation of shares; (3) any offering of new shares at a specially favorable price (or any offering of stock acquisition rights to acquire shares of capital stock, or bonds with stock acquisition rights at specially favorable conditions) to any persons other than shareholders; (4) the exemption of liability of a Director, Corporate Executive Officer or independent auditor with certain exceptions; (5) a reduction of stated capital with certain exceptions; (6) a distribution of in-kind dividends which meets certain requirements; (7) dissolution, merger, consolidation, or corporate split with certain exceptions; (8) the transfer of the whole or a material part of the business; (9) the taking over of the whole of the business of any other corporation with certain exceptions; or (10) share exchange or share transfer for the purpose of establishing 100 percent parent-subsidiary relationships with certain exceptions, the quorum shall be one-third of the total number of voting rights of all the shareholders, and the approval by at least two-thirds of the number of voting rights of all the shareholders represented at the meeting is required (the special shareholders resolutions). (Issue of additional shares and pre-emptive rights) Holders of Sony Corporations shares of capital stock have no pre-emptive rights under its Articles of Incorporation. Authorized but unissued shares may be issued at such times and upon such terms as the Board of Directors or the CEO determines, subject to the limitations as to the offering of new shares at a specially favorable price mentioned under (Voting rights) above. The Board of Directors or the CEO may, however, determine that shareholders shall be given subscription rights regarding a particular issue of new shares, in which case such rights must be given on uniform terms to all shareholders as at a record date of which not less than two weeks prior public notice must be given. Each of the shareholders to whom such rights are given must also be given notice of the expiry thereof at least two weeks prior to the date on which such rights expire. Subject to certain conditions, Sony Corporation may issue stock acquisition rights by a resolution of the Board of Directors or a determination by the CEO. Holders of stock acquisition rights may exercise their rights to acquire a certain number of shares within the exercise period as prescribed in the terms of their stock acquisition rights. Upon exercise of stock acquisition rights, Sony Corporation will be obliged to issue the relevant number of new shares or alternatively to transfer the necessary number of treasury stock held by it. 108 Table of Contents In cases where a particular issue of new shares or stock acquisition rights (i) violates laws and regulations or Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation, or (ii) will be performed in a manner materially unfair, and shareholders may suffer disadvantages therefrom, such shareholders may file an injunction to enjoin such issue with a court. (Liquidation rights) In the event of a liquidation of Sony Corporation, the assets remaining after payment of all debts, liquidation expenses and taxes will be distributed among the holders of shares of Common Stock in proportion to the respective numbers of shares of Common Stock held. (Record date) March 31 is the record date for Sony Corporations year-end dividends, if declared. So long as Sony Corporation maintains the unit share system, shareholders who are registered as the holders of one or more unit of stock in Sony Corporations register of shareholders at the end of each March 31 are also entitled to exercise shareholders rights at the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders with respect to the business year ending on such March 31. September 30 is the record date for interim dividends. In addition, Sony Corporation may set a record date for determining the shareholders entitled to other rights and for other purposes by giving at least two weeks prior public notice. Under the Book-entry Transfer Act, Sony Corporation is required to give notice of each record date to JASDEC at least two weeks prior to such record date. JASDEC is required to promptly give Sony Corporation notice of the names and addresses of Sony Corporations shareholders, the numbers of shares of Common Stock held by them and other relevant information as of such record date. (Acquisition by Sony Corporation of its capital stock) Under the Companies Act and the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation, Sony Corporation may acquire shares of Common Stock (i) from a specific shareholder other than any of its subsidiaries (pursuant to the special shareholders resolution), (ii) from any of its subsidiaries (pursuant to a determination by the CEO), or (iii) by way of purchase on any Japanese stock exchange on which Sony Corporations shares of Common Stock are listed or by way of tender offer (as long as its non-consolidated annual financial statements and certain documents for the last business year present fairly its assets and profit or loss, as required by ordinances of the Ministry of Justice) in either case pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors or, as the case may be, an ordinary resolution of a General Meeting of Shareholders. In the case of (i) above, any other shareholder may make a request to Sony Corporation that such other shareholder be included as a seller in the proposed purchase, provided that no such right will be available if the purchase price or any other consideration to be received by the relevant specific shareholder will not exceed the last trading price of the shares on the relevant stock exchange on the day immediately preceding the date on which the resolution mentioned in (i) above was adopted (or, if there is no trading in the shares on the stock exchange or if the stock exchange is not open on such day, the price at which the shares are first traded on such stock exchange thereafter). The total amount of the purchase price of shares of Common Stock may not exceed the Distributable Amount, as described in (Distribution of Surplus)  Distributions of Surplus  Restriction on distributions of Surplus. Shares acquired by Sony Corporation may be held for any period or may be retired at the determination of the CEO. Sony Corporation may also transfer (by public or private sale or otherwise) to any person the shares held by it, subject to a determination by the CEO, and subject also to other requirements similar to those applicable to the issuance of new shares, as described in (Issue of additional shares and pre-emptive rights) above. Sony Corporation may also utilize its treasury stock for the purpose of transfer to any person upon exercise of stock acquisition rights or for the purpose of acquiring another company by way of merger, share exchange or corporate split through exchange of treasury stock for shares or assets of the acquired company. 109 Table of Contents (Unit share system) The Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation provide that 100 shares constitute one unit of shares of stock. The Board of Directors or the Corporate Executive Officer to whom the authority to make such a determination has been delegated by a resolution of the Board of Directors is permitted to amend the Articles of Incorporation to reduce the number of shares that constitute a unit or to abolish the unit share system entirely. The number of shares constituting one unit cannot exceed 1,000 shares. Under the unit share system, shareholders have one voting right for each unit of stock that they hold. Any number of shares less than one full unit have neither voting rights nor rights related to voting rights. Holders of shares constituting less than one unit will have no other shareholder rights if Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation so provide, except that such holders may not be deprived of certain rights specified in the Companies Act or an ordinance of the Ministry of Justice, including the right to receive distribution of Surplus. A holder of shares constituting less than one full unit may require Sony Corporation to purchase such Shares at their market value in accordance with the provisions of the Share Handling Regulations of Sony Corporation. In addition, the Articles of Incorporation of Sony Corporation provide that a holder of shares constituting less than one full unit may request Sony Corporation to sell to such holder such amount of shares which will, when added together with the shares constituting less than one full unit, constitute one full unit of stock. Such request by a holder and the sale by Sony Corporation must be made in accordance with the provisions of the Share Handling Regulations of Sony Corporation. As prescribed in the Share Handling Regulations, such requests shall be made through an account management institution and JASDEC pursuant to the rules set by JASDEC, without going through the notification procedure required for the exercise of shareholders rights entitled regardless of record dates as described in General. A holder who owns American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) evidencing less than 100 ADSs will indirectly own less than one full unit. Although, as discussed above, under the unit share system holders of less than one full unit have the right to require Sony Corporation to purchase their shares or sell shares held by Sony Corporation to such holders, holders of ADRs evidencing ADSs that represent other than integral multiples of whole units are unable to withdraw the underlying shares of capital stock representing less than one full unit and, therefore, are unable, as a practical matter, to exercise the rights to require Sony Corporation to purchase such underlying shares or sell shares held by Sony Corporation to such holders. As a result, access to the Japanese markets by holders of ADRs through the withdrawal mechanism will not be available for dispositions of shares in lots less than one full unit. The unit share system does not affect the transferability of ADSs, which may be transferred in lots of any size. (Sale by Sony Corporation of shares held by shareholders whose location is unknown) Sony Corporation is not required to send a notice to a shareholder if a notice to such shareholder fails to arrive at the registered address of the shareholder in Sony Corporations register of shareholders or at the address otherwise notified to Sony Corporation continuously for five years or more. In addition, Sony Corporation may sell or otherwise dispose of shares of capital stock for which the location of the shareholder is unknown. Generally, if (i) notices to a shareholder fail to arrive continuously for five years or more at the shareholders registered address in Sony Corporations register of shareholders or at the address otherwise notified to Sony Corporation, and (ii) the shareholder fails to receive distributions of Surplus on the shares continuously for five years or more at the address registered in Sony Corporations register of shareholders or at the address otherwise notified to Sony Corporation, Sony Corporation may sell or otherwise dispose of the shareholders shares at the then market price of the shares by a determination of a Corporate Executive Officer and after giving at least three months prior public and individual notice, and hold or deposit the proceeds of such sale or disposal of shares for such shareholder. Reporting of substantial shareholdings The Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan and its related regulations require any person, regardless of residence, who has become, beneficially and solely or jointly, a holder of more than five percent of the total 110 Table of Contents issued shares of capital stock of a company listed on any Japanese stock exchange or whose shares are traded on the over-the-counter market in Japan to file with the Director General of the competent Local Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance within five business days a report concerning such shareholdings. A similar report must also be filed in respect of any subsequent change of one percent or more in any such holding, with certain exceptions. For this purpose, shares issuable to such persons upon conversion of convertible securities or exercise of share subscription warrants or stock acquisition rights are taken into account in determining both the number of shares held by such holders and the issuers total issued share capital. Any such report shall be filed with the Director General of the relevant Local Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance through the Electronic Disclosure for Investors Network (EDINET) system. Copies of such report must also be furnished to the issuer of such shares. Except for the general limitation under Japanese anti-trust and anti-monopoly regulations against holding of shares of capital stock of a Japanese corporation which leads or may lead to a restraint of trade or monopoly, and except for general limitations under the Companies Act or Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation on the rights of shareholders applicable regardless of residence or nationality, there is no limitation under Japanese laws and regulations applicable to Sony Corporation or under its Articles of Incorporation on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or exercise voting rights on the shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation. There is no provision in Sony Corporations Articles of Incorporation or internal regulations that would have an effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Sony Corporation and that would operate only with respect to merger, acquisition or corporate restructuring involving Sony Corporation. Material Contracts None Exchange Controls The Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act of Japan and its related cabinet orders and ministerial ordinances (the Foreign Exchange Regulations) govern the acquisition and holding of shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation by exchange non-residents and by foreign investors. The Foreign Exchange Regulations currently in effect do not, however, affect transactions between exchange non-residents to purchase or sell shares outside Japan using currencies other than Japanese yen. Exchange non-residents are:  individuals who do not reside in Japan; and  corporations whose principal offices are located outside Japan. Generally, branches and other offices of non-resident corporations that are located within Japan are regarded as residents of Japan. Conversely, branches and other offices of Japanese corporations located outside Japan are regarded as exchange non-residents. Foreign investors are:  individuals who are exchange non-residents;  corporations that are organized under the laws of foreign countries or whose principal offices are located outside of Japan; and  corporations (1) 50 percent or more of whose shares are held, directly or indirectly, by individuals who are exchange non-residents and/or corporations (a) that are organized under the laws of foreign countries or (b) whose principal offices are located outside of Japan or (2) a majority of whose officers, or officers having the power of representation, are individuals who are exchange non-residents. In general, the acquisition of shares of a Japanese company (such as the shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation) by an exchange non-resident from a resident of Japan is not subject to any prior filing requirements. In certain limited circumstances, however, the Minister of Finance may require prior approval of an acquisition of this type. While prior approval, as described above, is not required, in the case where a resident of Japan transfers 111 Table of Contents shares of a Japanese company (such as the shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation) for consideration exceeding 100 million yen to an exchange non-resident, the resident of Japan who transfers the shares is required to report on the transfer to the Minister of Finance within 20 days from the date of the transfer, unless the transfer was made through a bank, securities company or financial futures trader licensed under Japanese law. If a foreign investor acquires shares of a Japanese company that is listed on a Japanese stock exchange (such as the shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation) or that is traded on an over-the-counter market in Japan and, as a result of the acquisition, the foreign investor, in combination with any existing holdings, directly or indirectly holds 10 percent or more of the issued shares of the relevant company, the foreign investor must file a report of the acquisition with the Minister of Finance and any other competent Ministers having jurisdiction over that Japanese company within 15 days from and including the date of the acquisition. In limited circumstances, such as where the foreign investor is in a country that is not listed on an exemption schedule in the Foreign Exchange Regulations, or where that Japanese company is engaged in certain businesses designated by the Foreign Exchange Regulations, a prior notification of the acquisition must be filed with the Minister of Finance and any other competent Ministers, who may then modify or prohibit the proposed acquisition. Under the Foreign Exchange Regulations, dividends paid on and the proceeds from sales in Japan of shares of capital stock of Sony Corporation held by non-residents of Japan may generally be converted into any foreign currency and repatriated abroad. Taxation The following is a summary of the major Japanese national tax and U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership, acquisition and disposition of shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation and of ADRs evidencing ADSs representing shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation by a non-resident of Japan or a non-Japanese corporation without a permanent establishment in Japan. The summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to any particular investor, and does not take into account any specific individual circumstances of any particular investor. Accordingly, holders of shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation are encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the considerations discussed below to their particular circumstances. This summary is based upon the representations of the depositary and the assumption that each obligation in the deposit agreement in relation to the ADSs dated as of June 1, 1961, as amended and restated as of October 31, 1991, as further amended and restated as of March 17, 1995, and in any related agreement, will be performed in accordance with its terms. For purposes of the income tax convention between Japan and the United States (the Treaty) and the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), U.S. holders of ADSs generally will be treated as owning shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation underlying the ADSs evidenced by the ADRs. For the purposes of the following discussion, a U.S. holder is a holder that: (i) is a resident of the U.S. for purposes of the Treaty; (ii) does not maintain a permanent establishment in Japan (a) with which shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation are effectively connected and through which the U.S. holder carries on or has carried on business or (b) of which shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation form part of the business property; and (iii) is eligible for benefits under the Treaty with respect to income and gain derived in connection with shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation. Japanese Taxation The following is a summary of the principal Japanese tax consequences (limited to national taxes) to non-residents of Japan or non-Japanese corporations without a permanent establishment in Japan (non-resident Holders) who are holders of shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation or of ADRs evidencing ADSs representing shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation. 112 Table of Contents Generally, non-resident Holders are subject to Japanese withholding tax on dividends paid by Japanese corporations. Such taxes are withheld prior to payment of dividends as required by Japanese law. Stock splits are, in general, not a taxable event. In the absence of an applicable tax treaty, convention or agreement reducing the maximum rate of Japanese withholding tax or allowing exemption from Japanese withholding tax, the rate of Japanese withholding tax applicable to dividends paid by Japanese corporations to non-resident Holders is generally 20 percent, provided, with respect to dividends paid on listed shares issued by a Japanese corporation (such as the shares of Common Stock of Sony Corporation) to non-resident Holders other than any individual shareholder who holds 5 percent or more of the total shares issued by the relevant Japanese corporation, the aforementioned 20 percent withholding tax rate is reduced to (i) 7 percent for dividends due and payable on or before December 31, 2011, and (ii) 15 percent for dividends due and payable on or after January 1, 2012. As of the date of this document, Japan has income tax treaties, conventions or agreements whereby the above-mentioned withholding tax rate is reduced, in most cases to 15 percent or 10 percent for portfolio investors (15 percent under the income tax treaties with, among other countries, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and 10 percent under the income tax treaties with Australia, France, the U.K. and the United States). Under the Treaty, the maximum rate of Japanese withholding tax that may be imposed on dividends paid by a Japanese corporation to a U.S. holder that does not own directly or indirectly at least 10 percent of the voting stock of the Japanese corporation is generally reduced to 10 percent of the gross amount actually distributed, and dividends paid by a Japanese corporation to a U.S. holder that is a pension fund are exempt from Japanese taxation by way of withholding or otherwise unless such dividends are derived from the carrying on of a business, directly or indirectly, by such pension fund. If the maximum tax rate provided for in the income tax treaty applicable to dividends paid by Sony Corporation to any particular non-resident Holder is lower than the withholding tax rate otherwise applicable under Japanese tax law, or if any particular non-resident Holder is exempt from Japanese income tax with respect to such dividends under the income tax treaty applicable to such particular non-resident Holder, such non-resident Holder who is entitled to a reduced rate of or exemption from Japanese withholding tax on payment of dividends on shares of common stock by Sony Corporation is required to submit an Application Form for Income Tax Convention Regarding Relief from Japanese Income Tax on Dividends (together with any other required forms and documents) in advance through the withholding agent to the relevant tax authority before the payment of dividends. A standing proxy for non-resident Holders of a Japanese corporation may provide this application service. With respect to ADSs, this reduced rate or exemption is applicable if the depositary or its agent submits two Application Forms (one before payment of dividends and the other within eight months after the record date concerning such payment of dividends). To claim this reduced rate or exemption, a non-resident Holder of ADSs will be required to file a proof of taxpayer status, residence and beneficial ownership (as applicable) and to provide other information or documents as may be required by the depositary. A non-resident Holder who is entitled, under an applicable income tax treaty, to a reduced rate which is lower than the withholding tax rate otherwise applicable under Japanese tax law or an exemption from the withholding tax, but failed to submit the required application in advance will be entitled to claim the refund of taxes withheld in excess of the rate under an applicable tax treaty (if such non-resident Holder is entitled to a reduced treaty rate under the applicable income tax treaty) or the full amount of tax withheld (if such non-resident Holder is entitled to an exemption under the applicable income tax treaty) from the relevant Japanese tax authority, by complying with a certain subsequent filing procedure. Sony Corporation does not assume any responsibility to ensure withholding at the reduced treaty rate or to ensure not withholding for shareholders who would be so eligible under any applicable income tax treaty but do not follow the required procedures as stated above. Gains derived from the sale of shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation outside Japan by a non-resident Holder holding such shares or ADSs as portfolio investors are, in general, not subject to Japanese income tax or corporation tax. U.S. holders are not subject to Japanese income or corporation tax with respect to such gains under the Treaty. 113 Table of Contents Japanese inheritance and gift taxes at progressive rates may be payable by an individual who has acquired shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation as a legatee, heir or donee even though neither the individual nor the deceased nor donor is a Japanese resident. Holders of shares of Common Stock or ADSs of Sony Corporation should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of these taxes and, in the case of U.S. holders, the possible application of the Estate and Gift Tax Treaty between the U.S. and Japan. United States Taxation with respect to shares of Common Stock and ADSs The U.S. dollar amount of dividends received (prior to deduction of Japanese taxes) by a U.S. holder of ADSs or Common Stock will be able to be included in income as ordinary income for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits of Sony Corporation as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to certain exceptions for short-term and hedged positions, the U.S. dollar amount of dividends received by an individual prior to January 1, 2011 with respect to the ADSs or Common Stock will be subject to taxation at a maximum rate of 15 percent if the dividends are qualified dividends. Dividends paid on the Common Stock or ADSs will be treated as qualified dividends if Sony Corporation was not, in the year prior to the year in which the dividend was paid, and is not, in the year in which the dividend is paid a passive foreign investment company (PFIC). Based on Sony Corporations audited financial statements and relevant market and shareholder data, Sony Corporation believes that it was not treated as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to its 2008 taxable year. In addition, based on Sony Corporations audited financial statements and Sony Corporations current expectations regarding the value and nature of its assets, the sources and nature of its income, and relevant market and shareholder data, Sony Corporation does not anticipate becoming a PFIC for the 2009 taxable year. The U.S. Treasury has announced its intention to promulgate rules pursuant to which holders of ADSs or Common Stock and intermediaries through whom such securities are held will be permitted to rely on certifications from issuers to treat dividends as qualified for tax reporting purposes. Because such procedures have not yet been issued, it is not clear whether Sony Corporation will be able to comply with them. Holders of ADSs and Common Stock should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of the reduced dividend tax rate in light of the considerations discussed above and their own particular circumstances. Subject to applicable limitations and special considerations discussed below, a U.S. holder of ADSs or Common Stock of Sony Corporation will be entitled to a credit for Japanese tax withheld in accordance with the Tax Convention from dividends paid by Sony Corporation. For purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation, dividends will be foreign source income, and will constitute passive income. Foreign tax credits will not be allowed for withholding taxes imposed in respect of certain short-term of hedged positions and may not be allowed in respect of arrangements in which economic profit, after non-U.S. taxes, is insubstantial. Holders of ADSs and Common Stock should consult their own tax advisors regarding the implications of these rules in light of their particular circumstances. Dividends paid by Sony Corporation to U.S. corporate holders of ADSs or Common Stock will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. In general, a U.S. holder will recognize capital gain or loss upon the sale or other disposition of ADSs or Common Stock equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or disposition and the U.S. holders tax basis in the ADSs or Common Stock. Such capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the ADSs or Common Stock have been held for more than one year on the date of the sale or disposition. The net amount of long-term capital gain recognized by an individual holder after May 5, 2003 and before January 1, 2011 generally is subject to taxation at a maximum rate of 15 percent. The net long-term capital gain recognized by an individual holder before May 6, 2003 or after December 31, 2010 generally is subject to taxation at a maximum rate of 20 percent.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Sonys business is continuously exposed to market fluctuation, such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates or stock prices. Sony utilizes several derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swap agreements and currency swap agreements in order to hedge the potential downside risk on the cash flow from the normal course of business caused by market fluctuation. Sony uses foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts primarily to reduce the foreign exchange volatility risk that accounts receivable or accounts payable denominated in yen, U.S. dollars, euros or other currencies have through the normal course of Sonys worldwide business. Interest rate swap agreements and currency swap agreements are utilized to diversify funding conditions or to reduce funding costs, and in the Financial Services segment, these transactions are used for asset liability management. Sony uses these derivative financial instruments mainly for risk-hedging purposes as described above, and few derivative transactions, such as bond futures and bond options are held or utilized for trading purposes in the Financial Services segment. If hedge accounting cannot be applied because the accounts receivable or accounts payable to be hedged are not yet booked, or because cash flows from derivative transactions do not coincide with the underlying exposures recorded on Sonys balance sheet, then Sony understands that such derivatives agreements should be subject to a mark-to-market evaluation and their unrealized gains or losses are recognized in earnings. In addition, Sony holds marketable securities such as straight bonds, convertible bonds, and stocks in yen or other currencies in the Financial Services segment in order to obtain interest income or capital gain on the financial assets under management. Sony understands that its investments in marketable securities are also subjected to market fluctuation. Sony measures the economic impact of market fluctuations on the value of derivatives agreements and marketable securities by using Value-at-Risk (VaR) analysis in order to comply with Item 11 disclosure requirements. VaR in this context indicates the potential maximum amount of loss in fair value resulting from adverse market fluctuations for a selected period of time and at a selected level of confidence. The following table shows the results of VaR. These analyses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 indicate the potential maximum loss in fair value as predicted by the VaR analysis resulting from market fluctuations in one day at a 95 percent confidence level. The VaR of currency exchange rate risk principally consists of risks arising from the volatility of the exchange rates between the yen and U.S. dollar and between the yen and the euro, the currencies in which a significant amount of financial assets and liabilities and derivative transactions are maintained on a consolidated basis. The VaR of interest rate risk and stock price risk consists of risks arising from the volatility of the interest rates and stock prices against invested securities and derivatives transactions in the Financial Services segment. The net VaR for Sonys entire portfolio is smaller than the simple aggregate of VaR for each component of market risk. This is due to the fact that market risk factors such as currency exchange rates, interest rates, and stock prices are not completely independent, and potential profits and losses arising from each market risk may to some degree be mutually offsetting. 115 Table of Contents The disclosed VaR amounts simply represent the calculated potential maximum loss on the specified date and does not necessarily indicate an estimate of actual or future loss.

Material Modifications to the Rights of Security Holders and Use of Proceeds None Item 15. Controls and Procedures Item 15(a). Disclosure Controls and Procedures Sony has carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of Sonys management, including the Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Sonys disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of March 31, 2009. Disclosure controls and procedures require that information to be disclosed in the reports Sony files or submits under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Sonys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and President, and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely 116 Table of Contents decisions regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon Sonys evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of March 31, 2009, the disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Item 15(b). Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Sonys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Sonys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with applicable generally accepted accounting principles. Sonys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Sony; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of Sony are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Sonys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Sonys management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of Sonys internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2009 an assessment of internal control over financial reporting of Sony Music Entertainment, a wholly-owned subsidiary that was acquired on October 1, 2008. Sony Music Entertainment had total sales of 169.3 billion yen for the period from October 1, 2008 to March 31, 2009 and total assets of 364.9 billion yen that were reflected in Sonys consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009. Sonys management evaluated the effectiveness of Sonys internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2009 based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the evaluation, management has concluded that Sony maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2009. Our independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata, has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2009, presented on page (F-2). Item 15(c). Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm Refer to the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on page (F-2). Item 15(d). Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in Sonys internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Sonys internal control over financial reporting. 117 Table of Contents Item 16. [Reserved] Item 16A. Audit Committee Financial Expert Sonys Board of Directors has determined that Yoshiaki Yamauchi and Fueo Sumita each qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 16A of Form 20-F under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In addition, both are determined to be independent as defined under the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Corporate Governance Standards. Item 16B. Code of Ethics Sony has adopted a code of ethics, as defined in Item 16B of Form 20-F under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The code of ethics applies to Sonys Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, chief accounting officer and persons performing similar functions, as well as to directors and all other officers and employees of Sony, as defined in the code of ethics. The code of ethics is available at http://www.sony.co.jp/SonyInfo/csr/management/compliance/sonyglobalcodeofconduct.pdf Item 16C. Principal Accountant Fees and Services Audit and Non-Audit Fees The following table presents fees for audit and other services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008 and 2009. Fiscal Year ended March 31 2008 2009 Yen in millions Audit Fees(1) 4,463 4,457 Audit-Related Fees(2) 559 323 Tax Fees(3) 5 27 All Other Fees(4) 8 26 5,035 4,833 (1) Audit Fees consist of fees billed for the annual audit services engagement and other audit services, which are those services that only the external auditor can provide. (2) Audit-Related Fees consist of fees billed for assurance and related services, and primarily include benefit plans and acquisition related audit services. (3) Tax Fees primarily consist of fees for tax advice. (4) All Other Fees comprise fees for all other services not included in any of the other categories noted above. Audit Committees Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures Consistent with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules regarding auditor independence, Sonys Audit Committee is responsible for appointing, reviewing and setting compensation, retaining, and overseeing the work of Sonys independent auditor, so that the auditors independence will not be impaired, including overseeing any separate firm that audits the financial statements of any subsidiary if Sonys independent auditor expressly relies on the audit report of such firm. The Audit Committee has established a formal policy requiring pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditor to Sony or any of its subsidiaries. The Audit Committee shall periodically review this policy with due regard for compliance with laws and regulations of host countries where Sony is listed. Prior to the engagement of the independent auditor for the following fiscal years audit, management shall submit an application form to the Audit Committee for comprehensive pre-approval of all recurring services expected to be rendered during that year. In order to obtain comprehensive pre-approval, management shall 118 Table of Contents provide sufficient information regarding each service so that each service can be classified into one of four categories (Audit, Audit-related, Tax, or All Other) as well as information regarding the fees expected to be budgeted for each service. Management shall describe each service in detail and indicate precisely and unambiguously the nature and scope of each particular service. Any additional services not contemplated in the application form shall require the Audit Committees separate pre-approval on an individual basis. The Audit Committee will approve, if necessary, any changes in terms, conditions and fees, resulting from changes in the scope of services to be provided or from other circumstances. The Audit Committee Chair retains pre-approval authority and evaluates items for approval on a request basis. The Audit Committee or its designee shall establish procedures to assure that the independent auditor is aware in a timely manner of the services that have been pre-approved. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, the Audit Committee has continued to include individual tax services, recruiting services and corporate tax service to the list of prohibited services stipulated by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and related regulations to enhance auditor independence. The Audit Committee has carefully checked these services and only permitted exceptional instances where the services had already been pre-approved prior to the effective date and instances in which difficulties were encountered in finding an alternative service provider immediately, or when a brief transitional period has been needed.

Change in Registrants Certifying Accountant Not Applicable. Item 16G. Disclosure About Differences in Corporate Governance The table below discloses the significant ways in which Sonys corporate governance practices differ from those required for U.S. companies under the listing standards of the NYSE. As a foreign private issuer listed on the NYSE, Sony is exempt from most of the exchanges corporate governance standards requirements. For further information on Sonys corporate governance practices and history, please refer to Board Practices in Item 6. Director, Senior Management and Employees. NYSE Standards Sonys Corporate Governance Practices Board Independence. A majority of board directors must be independent. Sony has adopted the Company with Committees system under the Japanese Companies Act and its related regulations (collectively the Companies Act). Japanese law does not require Sony to have a majority of independent (in the meaning given by the NYSE Corporate Governance Standard) directors on its board; rather, it requires Sony to have a majority of outside directors (the definition of the term outside director is summarized below) on each of three statutory committees (the Nominating Committee, the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee). Sonys Charter of the Board of Directors (attached as an exhibit 1.3 to this report) requires its board to consist of between 10 to 20 directors. As of June 19, 2009, 12 of the 15 members of Sonys Board of Directors qualified as outside directors. Director Independence. A director is not independent if such director is (i) a person who the board determines has a material direct or indirect relationship with the company, its parent or a consolidated subsidiary; (ii) a person who, within the last three years, has been an employee of the company or has an immediate family member of an executive officer of the company, its parent or a consolidated subsidiary; (iii) a person who had received, or whose immediate family member had received, during any 12 month period within the last three years, more than US$120,000 per year in direct compensation from the company, its parent or a consolidated subsidiary, other than director and committee fees or deferred compensation for prior services (provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service); (iv) (A) a person who is, or whose immediate family member is, a current partner or employee of a firm that is the companys internal or external auditor; (B) a person whose immediate family member is a partner Outside director is defined in the Japanese Companies Act as: A director(i) who is not a director of the company or any of its subsidiaries engaged in the business operations of the company or such subsidiary, as the case may be, or a corporate executive officer or a general manager or other employee of the company or any of its subsidiaries, and (ii) who has never been a director of the company or any of its subsidiaries engaged in the business operations of the company or such subsidiary, as the case may be, or a corporate executive officer or a general manager or other employee of the company or any of its subsidiaries. Under Japanese law, a directors status as an outside director is unaffected by the directors compensation, his or her affiliation with business partners, or the boards affirmative determination of independence. On the other hand, under Japanese law, a director who has had a career as a management director, corporate executive officer, or other employee of the company or its subsidiaries is by definition not an outside director. 120 Table of Contents NYSE Standards Sonys Corporate Governance Practices of such a firm; (C) a person who has an immediate family member who is a current employee of such a firm and who personally participates in the firms audit, assurance or tax compliance (but not tax planning) practice; or (D) a person who was, or has an immediate family member who was, within the last three years, a partner or employee of such a firm and personally worked on the listed companys audit within that time; (v) a person who is, or whose immediate family member is, or has been within the last three years, employed as an executive officer of another company where any of the listed companys present executive officers at the same time serves or served on that companys compensation committee; or (vi) an executive officer or employee of a company, or has an immediate family member of an executive officer of a company, that makes payments to, or receives payments from, the listed company, its parent or a consolidated subsidiary for property or services in an amount which, in any of the last three fiscal years, exceeds the greater of US$1 million or 2 percent of such other companys consolidated gross revenues. Sonys Charter of the Board of Directors includes a provision requiring that each outside director: (i) Shall not have received directly from Sony Group, during any 12 month period within the last three years, more than an amount equivalent to US$100,000, other than director and committee fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation for prior service (provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service); (ii) Shall not be a director, statutory auditor, corporate executive officer, general manager or an employee of any company whose aggregate amount of transactions with Sony Group, in any of the last three fiscal years, exceeds the greater of an amount equivalent to US$1,000,000, or 2 percent of the annual consolidated sales of such company; and (iii) Shall not be, or shall not have been, a director engaged in the business operation, corporate executive officer, accounting counselor, general manager or an employee of Sony or its subsidiaries*. (* This provision of the Charter is based on the definition of outside director under the Japanese Companies Act.) Executive Sessions. Non-management directors must meet in regularly scheduled executive sessions without management. Independent directors should meet alone in an executive session at least once a year. An outside director, as defined under Japanese law, is equivalent to a non-management director under the NYSE rules because an outside director does not engage in the execution of business operations of the company. Neither Japanese law nor Sonys Charter of the Board of Directors requires non-management directors to meet regularly without management and nothing requires outside directors to meet alone in an executive session at least once a year. Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. A nominating/corporate governance committee of independent directors is required. The committee must have a charter that addresses the purpose, responsibilities (including development of corporate governance guidelines) and annual performance evaluation of the committee. Sonys Nominating Committee consists of at least five directors. Under Japanese law, the Committee is responsible for determining the contents of proposals regarding the appointment and dismissal of directors to be submitted for approval to the shareholders meeting. Unlike listed U.S. companies under NYSE rules, it is not responsible for developing governance guidelines or overseeing the evaluation of the board and management. Under Japanese law, a majority of its members must be outside directors, as defined under Japanese law. Sonys Charter of the Board of Directors requires at least two of the directors on the Committee to be corporate executive officers. Compensation Committee. A compensation committee of independent directors is required. The committee must have a charter that addresses the Sonys Compensation Committee consists of at least three directors. Under Japanese law, a majority of its members must be outside directors, as defined under 121 Table of Contents NYSE Standards Sonys Corporate Governance Practices purpose, responsibilities and annual performance evaluation of the committee. Japanese law. Sonys Charter of the Board of Directors recommends that at least one of the directors on the Committee be a corporate executive officer. The Charter prohibits the CEO and/or the COO (or a person at any equivalent position) from serving on the Compensation Committee. Under Japanese law, the Committee is responsible for, among others, determining the compensation of each director and corporate executive officer. Audit Committee. An audit committee satisfying the independence and other requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. The committee must have at least three members. All members must be independent. The committee must have a charter addressing the committees purpose, an annual performance evaluation of the committee and the duties and responsibilities of the committee. Sonys Audit Committee consists of at least three directors. Under Japanese law, a majority of its members must be outside directors, as defined under Japanese law. In addition, pursuant to Japanese law, no member of the Committee shall be a director of the company or any of its subsidiaries who is engaged in the business operations of the company or such subsidiary, as the case may be, or a corporate executive officer of the company or any of its subsidiaries, or an accounting counselor, general manager or other employee of any of such subsidiaries. Sonys Charter of the Board of Directors also requires each member of the Audit Committee to meet the independence requirements of the applicable U.S. securities laws and regulations, and requires at least one member to meet the audit committee financial expert requirements. Currently, all the members of Sonys Audit Committee are also independent as defined in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, and two members of the Committee are audit committee financial experts. Sonys Charter of the Board of Directors discourages any Audit Committee member from concurrently being a member of other Committees. Equity Compensation Plans. Equity compensation plans require shareholder approval, subject to limited exemptions. Under Japanese law, if Sony wishes to adopt an equity compensation plan under which stock acquisition rights are granted on specially favorable conditions, except where all of its shareholders are granted rights to subscribe for such stock acquisition rights or such stock acquisition rights are gratuitously allocated to all of its shareholders, each on a pro rata basis, then Sony must obtain shareholder approval by a special resolution of a general meeting of shareholders, where the quorum is one-third of the total number of voting rights of all of its shareholders and the approval by at least two-thirds of the number of voting rights of all the shareholders represented at the meeting is required under Sonys Articles of Incorporation. Corporate Governance Guidelines. Corporate governance guidelines must be adopted and disclosed. Sony is required to disclose the status of its corporate governance under Japanese laws and regulations; 122 Table of Contents NYSE Standards Sonys Corporate Governance Practices however, Sony does not have corporate governance guidelines that cover all the requirements described in the NYSE Corporate Governance Standard, as many of the provisions do not apply to Sony. Details of the status are posted on the following website: http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/library/control.html Code of Ethics. A code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers and employees must be adopted and disclosed, along with any waivers of the code for directors or executive officers. Although this provision of the NYSE Corporate Governance Standard does not apply to Sony, Sony has adopted a code of conduct to be observed by all its directors, officers and other employees. The code of conduct is available at http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/csr/management/compliance/code_of_conduct.pdf The codes content covers principal items described in the NYSE Corporate Governance Standard.
