SELECTED ANNUAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION Year Ended December 31, 2014 Year Ended December 31, 2013 Year Ended December 31, 2012 Total Revenues $ - $ - $ - Net Loss (8,669,188 ) (11,422,025 ) (15,196,129 ) Net loss per share, basic and diluted (0.06 ) (0.08 ) (0.12 ) Working capital 32,603,711 46,394,496 4,699,256 Total assets 79,690,498 97,395,105 64,173,530 Total long term liabilities 44,269,904 50,956,860 15,286,041 (1) Working Capital is defined as Current Assets less Current Liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2014, net loss was $8,669,188 compared to $11,422,025 in the year ended December 31, 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2014, Entrée incurred lower operating expenditures primarily due to a combination of lower general and administration expense and higher foreign exchange gains. As at December 31, 2014, working capital was $32,603,711 compared to $46,394,496 as at December 31, 2013. The decrease in working capital is primarily the result of cash used in operations during the period. As at December 31, 2014, total assets were $79,690,498 compared to $97,395,105 as at December 31, 2013. The decrease in total assets over the prior year is primarily the net effect of a decrease in working capital described above. As at December 31, 2014, total long term liabilities were $44,269,904 compared to $50,956,860 as at December 31, 2013. The decrease in long term liabilities over the prior year is largely due to a decrease in deferred income tax liabilities and decreased deferred revenue resulting from unrealized foreign currency translation gains. 86 REVIEW OF OPERATIONS Results of operations are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2014 Year Ended December 31, 2013 Exploration $ 9,018,994 $ 5,808,316 General and administrative 3,936,413 5,510,641 Consultancy and advisory fees 830,623 1,941,130 Impairment of mineral property interests 552,095 437,732 Interest expense 264,869 260,453 Stock-based compensation 251,390 1,422,297 Loss from equity investee 107,907 146,051 Depreciation 65,517 102,941 Fair value adjustment of asset backed commercial paper - (147,564 ) Gain on sale of mineral property interest (28,096 ) (451,892 ) Current income tax expense (recovery) (123,255 ) 319,112 Interest income (295,023 ) (431,596 ) Foreign exchange gain (1,978,854 ) (1,113,728 ) Deferred income tax recovery (3,933,392 ) (2,381,868 ) Net loss $ 8,669,188 $ 11,422,025 Exploration expenditures are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2014 Year Ended December 31, 2013 US $ 7,066,997 $ 3,940,264 Mongolia 1,672,341 1,355,493 Other 315,549 807,235 Total costs 9,054,887 6,102,992 Less stock-based compensation (35,893 ) (294,676 ) Total expenditures, cash $ 9,018,994 $ 5,808,316 UNITED STATES Ann Mason Project, Nevada The Ann Mason Project, located in the Yerington District of Nevada, is one of Entrée’s core advanced assets. With the completion of a positive PEA in 2012, Entrée began evaluating the most efficient and effective way of advancing the Ann Mason Project towards prefeasibility. A prefeasibility drill program was undertaken between August 2014 and late January 2015. Entrée commenced a prefeasibility metallurgy program in the first quarter of 2015 and plans to release an updated resource estimate for the Ann Mason deposit and an updated PEA in the second quarter of 2015. In addition, the Company is considering strategic partnerships, joint ventures and similar arrangements that would help facilitate the development of the project. To date, excluding any capitalized mineral property acquisition costs, Entrée has expended approximately $27.1 million on the Ann Mason Project. 87 From April to July 2013, Entrée completed 993 metres of RC pre-collar drilling and 2,159 metres of core drilling in five holes to test the Ann Mason and Blue Hill deposits and other nearby exploration targets. Holes varied in depth from 502 to 811 metres. At the Ann Mason deposit, core drilling in 2013 was designed to test for extensions of mineralization within the current pit design, primarily along the northeast and northwest margins of the deposit. Three of the five core holes drilled at Ann Mason extended copper mineralization 190 metres to 250 metres northwest and northeast of the deposit. Near the east end of the deposit, hole EG-AM-13-035 intersected 220 metres (from 262 metres depth) averaging 0.30% copper, 0.07 g/t gold and 1.70 g/t silver. Included within the intersection is a higher-grade interval of 100 metres grading 0.43% copper, 0.11 g/t gold and 2.75 g/t silver. Drill holes EG-AM-13-033 and 034, on the northeast side of the deposit, returned 310 metres of 0.21% copper and 46.0 metres of 0.27% copper, respectively and extend copper mineralization up to 250 metres northeast of the current mineral resource. Ann Mason mineralization remains open in several directions and further drilling programs will be needed to test this potential. Two shallow, widely-spaced RC holes (totaling 180 metres) were completed about 500 to 900 metres to the west of Ann Mason to test a new, near-surface oxide copper target. Holes EG-AM-13-038 and 039 encountered narrow intervals of 0.16% to 0.20% oxide copper within strong, quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration. Deeper sulphide potential below these holes remains untested. 2013 drilling at Blue Hill successfully located westward extensions of the current deposit; however, to the east, oxide and mixed mineralization is truncated by the low angle Blue Hill Fault. Although most recent drill holes mainly tested oxide mineralization, two diamond holes (EG-BH-11-019 and 021) were drilled east of the oxide copper zone to test deeper sulphide copper potential. Drilling of the underlying sulphide target remains very widely-spaced, but has identified a target area more than one kilometre in width, which remains open in most directions. Significant molybdenum mineralization was also intersected in two of the drill holes targeting the sulphide mineralization. Hole EG-BH-11-031, located approximately one kilometre east of Blue Hill, intersected a near-surface zone of copper-oxide mineralization assaying an average of 0.28% copper over 13.8 metres from a depth of 22.2 metres. Baseline environmental studies commenced in the second quarter of 2013, and included wildlife, biology, archaeology and cultural surveys and WOUS delineation. These studies were largely complete in early 2014 except for raptor field surveys, final report writing, and a follow-up WOUS submission to the US Corps of Engineers. An amendment to expand Entrée’s existing PlanOp and minor modification of its Permit, were accepted by the NDEP and the BLM in early 2014. An additional bond, in the amount of $31,276, was posted by Entrée in June 2014. Wildlife, vegetation and cultural field surveys and reports were complete by late 2014 and no significant obstacles to the development of Ann Mason were identified. The US Corps of Engineers has verbally approved the WOUS report finding of no wetlands subject to US Corps of Engineers jurisdiction within the Ann Mason Project area but are now waiting for United States Environmental Protection Agency approval. On July 16, 2014, the Company announced the commencement of an approximately $5 million prefeasibility drill program, designed to upgrade the mineral resources contained in the PEA Phase 5 pit from Indicated and Inferred to a mix of Measured and Indicated categories. The infill drill program was completed in late January 2015 and comprised 40 holes and a total of approximately 19,265 metres combined RC pre-collars and core. RC pre-collars were generally restricted to barren, overlying volcanics. Drilling changed to HQ diameter core which was continually sampled over two metre intervals once mineralized rocks of the Yerington batholith were encountered or hole conditions dictated the change to core. Depths of holes ranged from 275 metres to 885 metres, depending on position within the Phase 5 pit, and hole angles varied from -60 to -90 degrees. Samples were submitted to ACME Labs in Reno and Elko for sample preparation and forwarded by ACME to their laboratory in Vancouver for analysis. Prepared standards, blanks and duplicates were inserted at the project site to monitor the quality control of the assay data. Entrée has a chain of custody program to ensure sample security during all stages of sample collection, cutting, shipping and storage. 88 On January 21, 2015, the Company reported assay results from the first 20 holes with the remaining 20 holes being reported on March 10, 2015. Highlights include: · EG-AM-14-041, located near the centre of the deposit, with 390 metres of 0.35% copper; · EG-AM-14-043, located near the centre of the deposit, with 409 metres of 0.35% copper; · EG-AM-14-046, the eastern-most drill hole, with 112.3 metres of 0.34% copper; · EG-AM-14-050, with 176 metres of 0.35% copper; · EG-AM-14-057, with 327.4 metres of 0.38% copper, including 0.42% copper and 0.12 g/t gold over 200 metres; · EG-AM-14-059, with 466 metres of 0.31% copper; · EG-AM-14-065 with 150 metres of 0.38% copper; · EG-AM-14-067, with 377 metres of 0.32% copper; · EG-AM-14-073, on the northeast rim of the deposit, with 102 metres of 0.36% copper; and · EG-AM-14-076, immediately northwest of 043, with 190 metres of 0.34% copper and a separate interval of 180 metres of 0.38% copper. Of the 40 holes, 25 ended in mineralization (copper values greater than the 0.15% copper cut-off). Lower grade holes tend to be located toward the northern-most border of the Phase 5 pit, in areas where strong mineralization was not expected. Only one hole, EG-AM-14-049, drilled along the northernmost border of the Phase 5 pit, failed to return any significant results. The area between the Ann Mason and Blue Hill deposits has seen only wide-spaced, mostly shallow drilling to date and remains a high priority target for future exploration for both additional sulphide and oxide mineralization. South of Ann Mason, soil surveying and mapping suggests potential for near surface oxide copper mineralization which could have a positive impact on the Ann Mason Project. Several other high-priority targets on the Ann Mason Project property require further exploration. These include the Roulette, Blackjack IP and Blackjack Oxide targets and the Minnesota copper skarn target. In the Blackjack area, IP and surface copper oxide exploration targets have been identified for drill testing. The Minnesota skarn target requires further drilling to test deeper IP and magnetic anomalies. The Shamrock and Ann South targets comprise several small-scale historical mines and skarn-related copper showings in the southeast portion of the project. For the year ended December 31, 2014, Ann Mason Project expenditures were $6,950,618 compared to $3,807,805 during the year ended December 31, 2013. The higher expenses in the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted primarily from an increase in drilling activities. Lordsburg, New Mexico On May 2, 2012, Entrée entered into an agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") to purchase a 100% interest in two porphyry copper targets in New Mexico – the Lordsburg property and the Oak Grove property. In September 2013 Entrée abandoned the Oak Grove property and recorded an impairment of mineral property interests of $437,732. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Entrée paid $100,000 and issued 500,000 common shares of the Company. The Lordsburg property is subject to a 2% NSR royalty, which may be bought down to 1% for $1 million if the buydown option is exercised on or before January 1, 2015. The buydown option may be extended to January 1, 2016 or January 1, 2017, in which case the buydown price will be $2 million and $200,000 will be payable for each 12 month extension. The buydown price and extension payments are payable in cash or a combination of cash and common shares at Entrée’s election. The Lordsburg claims cover 2,013 ha adjacent to the historic Lordsburg copper-gold-silver district in New Mexico. Drilling at Lordsburg has been successful in discovering a porphyry copper-gold occurrence in an area previously known only for vein-style gold mineralization. Future drilling will be directed towards expanding the existing drill defined copper and gold zone. No exploration work was completed in 2013 or 2014. The proposed Plan of Operations for Lordsburg has been approved by the BLM and an Application to Conduct Mineral Exploration has been approved by the New Mexico Division of Mining and Minerals. The Lordsburg Plan of Operations/Environmental Assessment and Application to Conduct Mineral Exploration provides for drilling on 65 additional sites and 28.2 acres of surface disturbance. 89 MONGOLIA Lookout Hill – Joint Venture Property In mid-December 2012 a drill hole was collared at the north end of Heruga on the Javhlant licence but directed northwest onto the Oyu Tolgoi licence. In early February 2013, the hole passed onto the Oyu Tolgoi licence at a depth of approximately 1,500 metres and still above the mineralized zone. The hole terminated February 26, 2013 at a depth of 2,067 metres within the Oyu Tolgoi licence. No exploration has been completed by OTLLC on the Joint Venture Property since February 2013 and no work is currently planned for 2015. Since formation, and as of December 31, 2014, the Entrée-OTLLC Joint Venture had expended $26.9 million to advance the Joint Venture Property. Under the terms of the Entrée-OTLLC Joint Venture, OTLLC contributed on Entrée’s behalf the required cash participation amount of $6.4 million, equal to 20% of the $26.9 million incurred to date, plus interest at prime plus 2%. Lookout Hill - Shivee West Entrée has a 100% interest in the western portion of the Shivee Tolgoi mining licence. No work has been completed on Shivee West in the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company does not anticipate significant exploration and development on Shivee West until the current regulatory environment in Mongolia has been stabilized. For the year ended December 31, 2014, Shivee West expenses were $1,672,341 compared to $1,355,493 during the year ended December 31, 2013. The higher expenses in 2014 compared to 2013 resulted from higher legal fees and sales taxes, penalties and interest expenses, partially offset by lower personnel expenses and travel fees. AUSTRALIA Blue Rose Joint Venture Entrée has a 55.32% interest in the Blue Rose copper-iron-gold-molybdenum joint venture property, with Giralia Resources Pty Ltd, now a subsidiary of Atlas Iron Limited (ASX:AGO) ("Atlas"), retaining a 44.68% interest. The property is located in the Olary Region of South Australia, 300 kilometres north-northeast of Adelaide. Magnetite iron formations occur in the southern portion of this 1,000 square kilometre tenement, and a zone of copper oxide mineralization and a gold target (Golden Sophia) are located in the north-central area of the tenement. The joint venture covers tenement EL5129, which was granted on July 19, 2012, for a 3-year term. In September 2010, the joint venture entered into an agreement with Bonython Metals Group Pty Ltd ("BMG"), a private Australian resource company. BMG purchased 100% of the iron ore rights on the joint venture property in exchange for 6% of BMG’s future issued capital. On February 27, 2012, the Federal Court of Australia ordered that BMG be wound up; a liquidator has been appointed. In October 2013, pursuant to an agreement whereby a third party acquired the Blue Rose joint venture’s iron ore rights from BMG, Entrée received the first of two cash payments of A$475,478 plus GST. The third party is currently in breach of this agreement as a consequence of failing to make the second required payment. Soil sampling was completed by the joint venture in August 2011 over the Golden Sophia shallow gold target. The survey confirmed the previous Battle Mountain gold in soil anomaly and defined a new, linear gold anomaly located approximately 700 metres to the northeast. On October 23, 2013, the Blue Rose joint venture filed a Part 9B native title application under the South Australia Mining Act and the Wilyakali and Ngadjuri groups registered as native title claimants. Native title agreements must be concluded with claimants prior to any exploration on the joint venture license. Native title agreements have been signed with the Wilyakali and Ngadjuri groups. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded an impairment of mineral property interests of $552,095. 90 PERU In September 2010, Entrée entered into a conditional agreement with a private Peruvian company whereby Entrée may acquire an initial 70% interest in the Lukkacha property located in Tacna Province of southeastern Peru. The property is situated within 50 kilometres of the international border with Chile, and initiation of work is subject to Entrée obtaining a Supreme Decree allowing it to work on the property. Subject to obtaining the Supreme Decree, Entrée may earn a 70% interest by making cash payments totaling $215,000 and expending a minimum of $1.5 million on exploration, to include a minimum 6,000 metres of diamond drilling, within 24 months. Once Entrée has earned a 70% interest, it may acquire a further 30% interest by paying the vendors $2 million within 24 months. The vendors would retain a 2% NSR royalty, half of which may be purchased at any time for $1 million. The property consists of seven concessions totaling 4,400 ha which cover two large areas of surface alteration, iron oxides and quartz veining approximately 50 kilometres along the structural trend southeast from the giant Toquepala mining operation of Grupo Mexico. The property has never been drilled and represents a unique opportunity for early stage exploration within an under-explored major copper district. Further exploration (geophysics and drilling) is dependent on receipt of the Supreme Decree. As a first step in obtaining the Supreme Decree, a joint military inspection of the property took place on September 12, 2013. The military submitted a favorable written opinion to the General Secretary of the Ministry of Defense on September 15, 2013. During 2014, Entrée held several meetings with the local village to discuss completion and registration of a community economic and land use agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2014, Lukkacha expenses were $78,925 compared to $134,454 during the year ended December 31, 2013. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE For the year ended December 31, 2014, general and administrative expense, excluding foreign exchange gains and losses and before stock-based compensation, was $3,936,413 compared to $5,510,641 during the year ended December 31, 2013 and compared to $4,295,800 during the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease in 2014 was due primarily to decreases in personnel expenses, legal fees and travel expenses compared to 2013. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION For the year ended December 31, 2014, stock-based compensation expense was $251,390 compared to $1,422,297 during the year ended December 31, 2013 and compared to $1,207,878 during the year ended December 31, 2012. During the year ended December 31, 2014, 2,815,000 options were granted with a fair value of $251,390, compared to 7,560,000 options that were granted with a fair value of $1,421,371 during the year ended December 31, 2013, and compared to 1,882,000 options that were granted with a fair value of $1,124,930 during the year ended December 31, 2012. INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE For the year ended December 31, 2014, interest expense was $264,869 compared to $260,453 during the year ended December 31, 2013 (December 31, 2012 - $229,359). Interest expense is due to accrued interest on the OTLLC loan payable. For the year ended December 31, 2014, interest income was $295,023 compared to $431,596 for the year ended December 31, 2013 (December 31, 2012 - $190,449). The Company earns interest income on its invested cash. VALUATION OF LONG-TERM INVESTMENT Equity Method Investment Entrée accounts for its interest in a joint venture with OTLLC as a 20% equity investment. As at December 31, 2014, the Company’s investment in the Entrée-OTLLC Joint Venture was $93,914 (December 31, 2013 - $96,367). The Company’s share of the loss of the Entrée-OTLLC Joint Venture was $107,907 for the year ended December 31, 2014 (December 31, 2013 - $146,051; December 31, 2012 - $1,012,156) plus accrued interest expense of $264,869 for the year ended December 31, 2014 (December 31, 2013 - $260,453; December 31, 2012 - $229,359). The decrease in the loss from equity investee for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to last year was due to decreased exploration expenses incurred by the Entrée-OTLLC Joint Venture in the period. 91 OUTLOOK Entrée is primarily focused on exploring its principal properties in Nevada and Mongolia. In addition, Entrée is engaged in evaluating acquisition opportunities which are complementary to its existing projects, particularly large tonnage base and precious metal targets. These efforts have resulted in the consolidation of the Ann Mason Project in Nevada and the acquisition of the Lordsburg property in New Mexico. The commodities Entrée is most likely to pursue include copper, gold and molybdenum, which are often associated with large tonnage, porphyry related environments. Smaller, higher grade systems will be considered by Entrée if they demonstrate potential for near-term production and cash-flow. Entrée has not generated any revenue from operations since its incorporation and Entrée anticipates that it will continue to incur operating expenses without revenues until the Joint Venture Property in Mongolia is brought into production or it builds and operates a mine on one or more of its other mineral properties. As at December 31, 2014, Entrée had working capital of approximately $32.6 million. Entrée’s average monthly operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014, were approximately $1,054,000, including exploration, general and administrative expenses and investor relations expenses. 92 SELECTED QUARTERLY DATA Three Months Ended December 31, 2014 Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 Three Months Ended June 30, 2014 Three Months Ended March 31, 2014 Exploration $ 4,465,219 $ 2,268,197 $ 757,325 $ 1,564,146 General and administrative 1,183,067 844,646 980,107 1,144,090 Consultancy and advisory fees 133,687 177,194 234,070 285,672 Impairment of mineral property interests - 552,095 - - Depreciation 14,405 16,277 17,160 17,675 Gain on sale of mineral property interest - - (28,096 ) - Foreign exchange loss (gain) (662,619 ) (1,126,822 ) 882,044 (1,071,457 ) Loss from operations (5,133,759 ) (2,731,587 ) (2,842,610 ) (1,940,126 ) Interest income 35,559 79,174 97,064 83,226 Interest expense (67,749 ) (66,735 ) (65,524 ) (64,861 ) Loss from equity investee (28,974 ) (29,369 ) (28,772 ) (20,792 ) Current income tax recovery (expense) (10,124 ) - 246,609 (113,230 ) Deferred income tax recovery (expense) 2,141,233 1,348,919 (332,558 ) 775,798 Net loss $ (3,063,814 ) $ (1,399,598 ) $ (2,925,791 ) $ (1,279,985 ) Loss per share, basic and diluted $ (0.02 ) $ (0.01 ) $ (0.02 ) $ (0.01 ) Three Months Ended December 31, 2013 Three Months Ended September 30, 2013 Three Months Ended June 30, 2013 Three Months Ended March 31, 2013 Exploration $ 1,426,239 $ 1,168,327 $ 1,904,636 $ 1,603,790 General and administrative 1,626,040 1,047,875 1,190,851 2,773,496 Consultancy and advisory fees 309,462 320,567 324,175 986,926 Impairment of mineral property interests - - 437,732 - Depreciation 22,570 24,831 26,704 28,836 Gain on sale of mineral property interest (451,892 ) - - - Foreign exchange loss (gain) (765,656 ) 662,337 (892,725 ) (117,684 ) Loss from operations (2,166,763 ) (3,223,937 ) (2,991,373 ) (5,275,364 ) Interest income 126,664 140,418 100,948 63,566 Interest expense (66,331 ) (65,313 ) (64,553 ) (64,256 ) Gain (loss) from equity investee (29,756 ) (23,049 ) 19,683 (112,929 ) Fair value adjustment of asset backed commercial papers - - 147,564 - Current income tax expense (319,112 ) - - - Deferred income tax recovery 1,331,336 241,279 512,114 297,139 Net loss $ (1,123,962 ) $ (2,930,602 ) $ (2,275,617 ) $ (5,091,844 ) Loss per share, basic and diluted $ (0.01 ) $ (0.02 ) $ (0.02 ) $ (0.04 ) Exploration costs were higher in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to an increase in drilling activity on the Ann Mason Project and higher sales taxes, partially offset by lower personnel and stock-based compensation expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014. General and administrative costs, excluding stock-based compensation changes, were approximately 29% lower in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This decrease is primarily attributable to decreased personnel expenses and legal fees. During the three months ended September 30, 2014, the Company recorded an impairment of mineral property interests of $552,095 on the Blue Rose joint venture property. During the three months ended June 30, 2014, Entrée sold its interest in the Mystique property for proceeds of $28,096, net of taxes. During the three months ended December 31, 2013, Entrée received a cash payment of $451,892 pertaining to an agreement whereby a third party acquired the Blue Rose joint venture iron ore rights. During the three months ended March 31, 2013, the Company incurred consultancy and advisory fees of $936,926 related to the Sandstorm financing package. Loss from equity investee was lower in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 due to decreased expenditures on the Joint Venture Property. During the year ended December 31, 2014, Entrée recorded deferred income tax recovery of $3,933,392 compared to deferred income tax recovery of $2,381,868 during the year ended December 31, 2013. 93 B. Liquidity and Capital Resources To date, Entrée has not generated revenues from its operations, has been dependent on equity and production-based financings for additional funding and is considered to be in the exploration stage. Working capital on hand at December 31, 2014 was $32,603,711. Cash was $33,517,096 at December 31, 2014. On February 15, 2013, the Company closed the approximately $55 million financing package with Sandstorm which will be used to advance the Ann Mason Project, support operations in Mongolia and for general working capital requirements. In the event of a partial expropriation of Entrée’s economic interest, contractually or otherwise, in the Joint Venture Property, which is not reversed during the abeyance period provided for in the Funding Agreement, the Company will be required to return a pro rata portion of the Deposit (the amount of the repayment not to exceed the amount of the Unearned Balance). Under the terms of the Entrée-OTLLC Joint Venture, Entrée elected to have OTLLC debt finance Entrée’s share of costs on the Joint Venture Property, with interest accruing at OTLLC’s actual cost of capital or prime plus 2%, whichever is less, at the date of the advance. As at December 31, 2014, the total amount that OTLLC has contributed to costs on the Company’s behalf, including interest, is $6.4 million.

Trend Information While the Company does not have any producing mines it is directly affected by trends in the metal industry. At the present time global metal prices are extremely volatile. Base metal prices and gold prices, driven by rising global demand, climbed dramatically and approached near historic highs over the past several years. These prices have declined significantly since these recent highs. Overall market prices for securities in the mineral resource sector and factors affecting such prices, including base metal prices, political trends in the countries in which such companies operate, and general economic conditions, may have an effect on the terms on which financing is available to the Company, if available at all. Except as disclosed, the Company does not know of any trends, demand, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or that are reasonably likely to result in, its liquidity either materially increasing or decreasing at present or in the foreseeable future. Material increases or decreases in liquidity are substantially determined by the success or failure of the Company’s exploration programs. The Company’s financial assets and liabilities generally consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, deposits, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and loans payable, some of which are denominated in foreign currencies including United States dollars, Mongolian Tugriks and Australian dollars. The Company is at risk to financial gain or loss as a result of foreign exchange movements against the Canadian dollar. The Company does not currently have major commitments to acquire assets in foreign currencies, but historically it has incurred the majority of its exploration costs in foreign currencies. E. Off-balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements except for the contractual obligation noted below. F. Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations The following table lists, as at December 31, 2014, the Company’s contractual obligations. Entrée is committed to make lease payments totalling $563,021 over its three year office lease in Vancouver, Canada and two office, three warehouse and four accommodation leases in the United States.

The directors were elected by the Company’s shareholders on June 26, 2014 and are elected for a term of one year, which term expires at the election of the directors at the next annual meeting of shareholders. The Board adopted a majority voting policy in May 2013. If the number of shares "withheld" from voting for the election of a nominee is greater than the number of shares voted "for" his or her election, the director must submit his or her resignation to the Chairman of the Board promptly after the shareholders’ meeting. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board (the "CGNC") will consider the resignation and will recommend to the Board whether or not to accept it. After considering the recommendations of the CGNC, the Board will make its decision as to whether to accept or reject the resignation in question and the Company will announce the Board’s decision, including any reasons for the Board not accepting a resignation, within 90 days following the shareholders’ meeting. The policy does not apply if there is a contested director election or where the election involves a proxy battle. The Company’s Board consisted of seven directors as at December 31, 2014.

Family Relationships There are no family relationships between any directors or executive officers of the Company. Arrangements There are no known arrangements or understandings with any major shareholders, customers, suppliers or others, pursuant to which any of the Company’s officers or directors was selected as an officer or director of the Company. Conflicts of Interest There are no existing or potential conflicts of interest among the Company, its directors, officers or promoters as a result of their outside business interests with the exception that certain of the Company’s directors, officers and promoters serve as directors, officers and promoters of other companies, and, therefore, it is possible that a conflict may arise between their duties as a director, officer or promoter of the Company and their duties as a director or officer of such other companies. The directors and officers of the Company are aware of the existence of laws governing accountability of directors and officers for corporate opportunity and requiring disclosures by directors of conflicts of interest and the Company will rely upon such laws in respect of any directors’ and officers’ conflicts of interest or in respect of any breaches of duty by any of its directors or officers. All such conflicts will be disclosed by such directors or officers in accordance with the BCBCA, and they will govern themselves in respect thereof to the best of their ability in accordance with the obligations imposed upon them by law. The majority of the Company’s directors are also directors, officers or shareholders of other companies that are engaged in the business of acquiring, developing and exploiting natural resource properties including properties in countries where the Company is conducting its operations. Such associations may give rise to conflicts of interest from time to time. Such a conflict poses the risk that the Company may enter into a transaction on terms which place the Company in a worse position than if no conflict existed. The directors of the Company are required by law to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interest of the Company and to disclose any interest which they may have in any project or opportunity of the Company. However, each director has a similar obligation to other companies for which such director serves as an officer or director. The Company has no specific internal policy governing conflicts of interest. B. Compensation For the purposes of this Annual Report, "executive officer" of the Company means an individual who at any time during the year was the Chair, or a Vice-Chair or President of the Company; any Vice President in charge of a principal business unit, division or function including sales, finance or production; and any individual who performed a policy-making function in respect of the Company. Set out below are particulars of compensation paid to the following persons (the "Named Executive Officers" or "NEOs"): 1. a chief executive officer ("CEO"); 2. a chief financial officer ("CFO"); 99 3. each of the three most highly compensated executive officers, or the three most highly compensated individuals acting in a similar capacity, other than the CEO and CFO, at the end of the most recently completed financial year whose total compensation was, individually, more than C$150,000 for that financial year; and 4. any individual who would be a NEO under paragraph (3) but for the fact that the individual was neither an executive officer of the Company, nor acting in a similar capacity, at the end of that financial year. As at December 31, 2014, the end of the most recently completed financial year of the Company, the Company had five NEOs. Compensation Discussion and Analysis The Compensation Committee of the Board typically meets in the fall of each year to discuss and determine the recommendations that it will make to the Board regarding management compensation. The general objectives of the Company’s compensation strategy are to (a) compensate management in a manner that encourages and rewards a high level of performance and outstanding results with a view to increasing long-term shareholder value; (b) align management’s interests with the long-term interests of shareholders; (c) provide a compensation package that is commensurate with other comparable mineral exploration companies to enable the Company to attract and retain talent; and (d) ensure that the total compensation package is designed in a manner that takes into account the constraints that the Company is under by virtue of the fact that it is a junior mineral exploration company without a history of earnings, current market and industry circumstances and the Company’s ability to raise capital. In the course of its annual management compensation evaluation, the Compensation Committee considers, among such other factors as it may deem relevant, management’s recommendations with respect to compensation, the extent to which corporate goals have been achieved, the Company’s overall performance, shareholder returns, the value of similar incentive awards to executive officers at comparable companies and the awards given to management in prior years. General corporate goals for 2014 set by management and approved by the Board included resolving outstanding issues related to the Company’s project in Mongolia; increasing corporate development activities through evaluation of merger and acquisition opportunities as well as potential strategic investors for the Ann Mason Project; negotiating strategic acquisitions of additional ground in order to consolidate the Company’s Ann Mason Project in Nevada; and undertaking corporate restructuring in an effort to simplify and reduce costs of maintaining company infrastructure. Specific corporate targets were not defined. The Compensation Committee generally considers three elements of compensation – a base salary for the next financial year, a discretionary cash bonus to reward superior performance and a grant of long-term incentive stock options. Base salary comprises the portion of executive compensation that is fixed, whereas discretionary cash bonuses and option based compensation represent compensation that is "at risk" depending on whether the executive officer is able to meet or exceed his or her applicable performance expectations, and overall performance of the Company. No specific formula has been developed to assign a specific weighting to each of these components. Rather, the Compensation Committee focuses on ensuring that the total compensation package for each NEO meets the general objectives of the Company’s compensation strategy. Base salary is used to provide the NEOs a set amount of money during the year with the expectation that each NEO will perform his or her responsibilities to the best of his or her ability and in the best interests of the Company. Generally, the Compensation Committee makes recommendations regarding each NEO’s base salary for the upcoming year after taking multiple factors into account, including the overall performance of the Company, general market performance and economic outlook, the performance of the NEO, the NEO’s experience level and particular responsibilities and a review of base salaries paid to executive officers of comparable companies. The granting of incentive stock options provides a link between management compensation and the Company’s share price. It also rewards management for achieving results that improve Company performance and thereby increase shareholder value. Stock options are generally awarded to executive officers at the commencement of employment and periodically thereafter. In making a determination as to whether a grant of long-term incentive stock options is appropriate, and if so, the number of options that should be granted, the Compensation Committee will consider: the value in securities of the Company that the Compensation Committee intends to award as compensation; current and expected future performance of the NEO; the potential dilution to shareholders and the cost to the Company; previous grants made to the NEO; option grants made to executive officers of comparable companies; and the limits imposed by the terms of the Company’s Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") and the TSX. The Company considers the granting of incentive stock options to be a particularly important element of compensation as it allows the Company to encourage and reward each NEO’s efforts to increase value for shareholders without requiring the Company to use cash from its treasury. The terms and conditions of the Company’s stock option grants, including vesting provisions and exercise prices, are determined by the Board at the time of grant, subject to the limits imposed by the terms of the Plan. 100 Finally, the Compensation Committee will consider whether it is appropriate and in the best interests of the Company to award a discretionary cash bonus to the NEOs and if so, in what amount. A cash bonus may be awarded to reward extraordinary performance that has led to, among other achievements, strategic property acquisitions or divestitures, achieving corporate development or property exploration milestones, and capital raising efforts. Demonstrations of extraordinary personal commitment to the Company’s interests, the community and the industry may also be rewarded through a cash bonus. The mineral exploration and development business is extremely competitive, and the Company is dependent on individuals with specialized skills and knowledge related to the exploration for and development of mineral prospects, regulatory matters, corporate finance and management. Therefore, it is important that the Company provide competitive compensation to attract and retain such talent. Since 2011, general economic malaise and market decline have been ongoing, with few signs of recovery, and junior exploration companies continue to have difficulty raising capital on favorable terms. The Company’s share price has continued to decline, potentially primarily the result of political uncertainty in Mongolia, continued concerns with economic stability in the Eurozone, and economic uncertainty in China. Accordingly, in order to preserve capital, NEO salaries have generally been held to 2011 levels and discretionary bonuses have not been awarded, despite the fact that certain corporate objectives have been achieved, and many peer companies have increased salaries for, and awarded bonuses to, executive officers. An exception to this was the award of discretionary bonuses to management in February 2013. Following the February 2013 closing of the approximately $55 million financing package with Sandstorm, management proposed to the Compensation Committee that discretionary cash bonuses be awarded to management to reward them for corporate goals achieved between January 2011 and March 2013, including: raising approximately $55 million through the Sandstorm transaction, which provided the Company with strategic flexibility for existing and future business operations; the preparation of a PEA for the Ann Mason deposit, which demonstrates the viability of the deposit for advancement to pre-feasibility; preparing the first resource estimate for the Blue Hill deposit; acquiring additional key ground in order to consolidate the Company’s Ann Mason Project in Nevada; outlining a new gold target on the Company’s Shivee West property in Mongolia; and raising approximately C$16 million through a marketed short form prospectus offering in late 2011. The Compensation Committee evaluated the performance of the NEOs taking into account all of the factors described above. At the conclusion of its management compensation evaluation, the Compensation Committee recommended that discretionary bonuses be awarded to the NEOs (which recommendation was approved by the Board). Management has also annually proposed, and the Compensation Committee has recommended, option grants for directors, officers, employees and consultants of the Company, as a means of rewarding performance without depleting the Company’s treasury. In August 2013, the Compensation Committee retained LaneCaputo Compensation Inc. ("LaneCaputo") to prepare an Executive Compensation Review to assist the Compensation Committee in the review of compensation arrangements for the Company’s senior management team and independent directors and to recommend required changes (if any) to pay elements and strategy to align the Company with current market practices. LaneCaputo benchmarked the compensation arrangements of the Company’s executives and directors against a peer group of mining companies with similar operations. The criteria that were used by LaneCaputo to develop the peer group included relevant peer companies at similar stages of development, operating in the same regional geography, and companies from approximately half of the Company’s market capitalization to roughly double the Company’s market capitalization. Access to capital tends to determine the pay mix to a certain extent, therefore matching the development stages of peer companies is important. The magnitude of executive compensation is also correlated to the size of an organization the executives oversee, therefore organizations with significant enough resources to warrant a prefeasibility study were included. In addition, geographical similarity allows for a more accurate benchmarking of comparable skillsets used to manage domestic versus international operations. The Company has operations in both arenas therefore companies with similar challenges were also included. The following companies were in the peer group developed by LaneCaputo: Almaden Minerals Ltd. Midas Gold Corp. Asanko Gold Inc. NovaCopper Inc. Augusta Resource Corp. Oracle Mining Corp. Chesapeake Gold Corp. Paramount Gold & Silver Corp. Copper Fox Metals Inc. Pilot Gold Inc. Eco Oro Minerals Corp. Quaterra Resources Inc. Exeter Resource Corp. Redhawk Resources Inc. Lumina Copper Corp. Sabina Gold & Silver Corp. MAG Silver Corp. Wildcat Silver Corp. 101 The Compensation Committee met in December 2013 to consider the findings and recommendations of LaneCaputo. In particular, LaneCaputo did not recommend increasing base salaries for any of the NEOs for 2014. LaneCaputo did however recommend that a bonus pool be established, from which discretionary cash bonuses tied to the achievement of goals for 2014 could be awarded to management. The Board accepted the Compensation Committee’s recommendation to establish a pool of C$500,000, which can be increased at the Board’s discretion in the event of exceptional work by management. The pool does not represent a guaranteed bonus for management. The extent to which management has achieved goals for the year will be evaluated by the Compensation Committee and the Board, and the actual amount that will be paid out, if any, will be recommended by the Compensation Committee and approved by the Board in its discretion based upon that evaluation. In late 2014, the Compensation Committee received a proposal from management with respect to NEO compensation for 2015. Management provided updated data from the peer group that LaneCaputo developed (excluding Lumina Copper Corp. and Oracle Mining Corp.) as well as Nevada Copper Corp., NGEx Resources Inc. and SilverCrest Mines Inc. Management’s compensation proposal took note of the continuing halt to development at the Oyu Tolgoi underground mine in Mongolia, the continuing need to preserve capital and thus limit development of Ann Mason, and the Company’s ongoing efforts to identify a beneficial merger and acquisition opportunity. Management’s compensation proposal also took note of the complexity of the issues that management is dealing with, the key milestones and corporate objectives that had been met during 2014, and the fact that NEO salaries have been kept to 2011 levels while some peer companies continue to provide salary increases to their executive officers. The Compensation Committee evaluated the performance of the NEOs, taking into account the factors described above. The Compensation Committee accepted management’s proposal, and recommended to the Board that the NEOs receive salary increases in the order of 3% effective January 1, 2015, but that no discretionary bonuses be awarded from the bonus pool. At the Board meeting held to consider, and ultimately approve, the Compensation Committee’s recommendations, Mr. Crowe voluntarily declined his salary increase. The Board can exercise discretion to award compensation absent attainment of corporate goals or to reduce or increase the size of any award. The Board did not exercise this discretion in 2014 with respect to any NEO. In the course of conducting its annual review of compensation, the Compensation Committee considers the implications and risks associated with the Company’s executive compensation policies, philosophy and practices. As discussed above, the Compensation Committee follows an overall compensation model which ensures that an adequate portion of overall compensation for the NEOs is "at risk" and only realized through the performance of the Company over both the short-term and long-term. The Compensation Committee reviews the model to ensure that there are sufficient features to mitigate the incentive for excessive risk taking. Some of the key risk mitigating features include: · balanced design, between fixed and variable pay and between short-term and long-term incentives; · consistent program design among all executive officers and within the Company as a whole; and · a greater reward opportunity derived from long-term incentives compared to short-term incentives, creating a greater focus on sustained performance over time. The Compensation Committee also had regard to the fact that the CEO retains significant personal shareholdings in the Company and therefore has a direct personal interest in the maximization of shareholder value. The Company does not permit its executive officers or directors to hedge any of the equity compensation granted to them. 102 Compensation Governance The Compensation Committee is composed of Mark Bailey (chair), Gord Glenn, James Harris and Alan Edwards, all of whom are independent directors, applying the definition set out in section 1.4 of National Instrument 52-110 – Audit Committees ("NI 52-110") and under Section 803A of the NYSE MKT Company Guide. Each member of the Compensation Committee has served on various other public company boards, which gives them sufficient direct experience in executive compensation to assist them in making decisions about the suitability of the Company’s compensation practices and policies. For a description of each committee member’s experience, see "Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees A. Directors and Senior Management" above. The Board has adopted a Compensation Committee Charter, which governs the organization of the Compensation Committee and sets out the duties and responsibilities of the chair and the Compensation Committee as a whole. The primary objective of the Compensation Committee is to discharge the responsibilities of the Board relating to compensation and benefits of the executive officers and directors of the Company. The Committee shall consist of three or more directors appointed by the Board, each of whom must be independent. The Committee shall meet as many times as it deems necessary, but not less frequently than one time per year. The CEO may not be present during the Compensation Committee’s voting or deliberations. Responsibilities of the Compensation Committee include: · Reviewing and approving on an annual basis corporate goals and objectives relevant to CEO compensation, evaluating the CEO’s performance in light of those goals and objectives and setting the CEO’s compensation level based on this evaluation. In determining the long-term incentive component of CEO compensation, the Compensation Committee will consider, among such other factors as it may deem relevant, the Company’s performance, shareholder returns, the value of similar incentive awards to chief executive officers at comparable companies and the awards given to the CEO in past years; · Reviewing and approving on an annual basis the adequacy and form of compensation and benefits of all other executive officers and directors, and making recommendations to the Board in that regard; · Making recommendations to the Board with respect to the Plan and any other incentive compensation plans and equity-based plans; · Determining the recipients of, and the nature and size of share compensation awards and bonuses granted from time to time, in compliance with applicable securities law, stock exchanges and other regulatory requirements; and · Approving inducement grants, which include grants of options or stock to new employees in connection with a merger or acquisition, as well as any tax-qualified, non-discriminatory employee benefit plans or non-parallel non-qualified plans, to new employees. The Compensation Committee is acutely aware of the dual responsibility that non-executive directors have for overseeing the Company’s corporate governance and long-term sustainability, as well as its compensation plans. In the course of determining compensation for non-executive directors, the Compensation Committee tries to ensure that non-executive director interests are closely aligned with those of shareholders, and that best practices for corporate governance are observed in the course of structuring non-executive director pay. In particular, the Compensation Committee is committed to structuring director pay in a manner that enables directors to maintain their independence. One of the ways that the Compensation Committee attempts to achieve this is by imposing reasonable limits on independent director participation in the Plan. The Compensation Committee has the authority to retain outside advisors, including the sole authority to retain or terminate consultants to assist the Compensation Committee in the evaluation of compensation of senior management and directors. In August 2013, the Compensation Committee retained LaneCaputo to prepare an Executive Compensation Review to assist the Compensation Committee in the review of compensation arrangements for the Company’s senior management team and independent directors and to recommend required changes (if any) to pay elements and strategy to align the Company with current market practices. The following table shows the aggregate fees billed to the Company by LaneCaputo in the Company’s two most recently completed financial years. 103 2014 (C$) 2013 (C$) Executive Compensation-Related Fees(1) $Nil $32,000 All other fees(2) $Nil $0 Total: $32,000 (1) Aggregate fees billed by LaneCaputo for services related to determining compensation for the Company's directors and executive officers.

The Company selected the Black-Scholes option-pricing model because it is widely used in estimating option based compensation values by Canadian and U.S. public companies. The practice of the Company is to grant all option based awards in Canadian currency, and then convert the grant date fair value amount to United States currency for reporting the value of the grants in the Company’s financials. The conversion rate for each grant is the average of the rates quoted by the Bank of Canada as its noon spot rate of the last day of the three months in the quarter in which the grant is made. The conversion rates for the purpose of the grants in this table are presented below and are based on the applicable conversion rate on the date of grant, each as supplied by the Bank of Canada. (2) The Company does not have a formal annual incentive program, however, bonuses are granted as determined by the Compensation Committee and approved by the Board on an individual basis. The Company does not presently have a pension incentive plan for any of its executive officers, including its NEOs. (3) Mr. Crowe is also a director of the Company. Mr. Crowe does not receive compensation from the Company for acting as a director, and no portion of the total compensation disclosed above was received by Mr. Crowe as compensation for acting as a director. (4) Other Compensation includes amounts paid out for vacation time earned, but not taken. (5) All compensation is negotiated and settled in Canadian dollars. The exchange rate used to convert 2014 compensation to US$ is 1.1601 (2013 – 1.0636; 2012 – 0.9949). 104 The following table provides the exchange rates used to convert the value of the option based awards from Canadian dollars to United States dollars as reported above.

There were no options exercised by the NEOs during the most recently completed financial year. Termination and Change of Control Benefits Gregory Crowe Under the terms of the employment agreement with Mr. Crowe, the Company may terminate Mr. Crowe’s employment immediately at any time prior to the expiry of the term without cause, by providing him with a lump sum payment equal to 24 months’ salary and statutory entitlements (the "Severance Payment"). Mr. Crowe is also entitled to the Severance Payment should the agreement be terminated by Mr. Crowe for Good Reason (defined below) or by Mr. Crowe within 90 days of a Change of Control (defined below) (in each of the three cases, a "Severance Payment Triggering Event"). "Change of Control" is defined as: (i) the acquisition by any "offeror" as defined in Part XX of the Securities Act (Ontario) of beneficial ownership of more than 20% of the outstanding voting securities of the Company, by means of a takeover bid or otherwise; (ii) any consolidation or merger of the Company in which the Company is not the continuing or surviving corporation or pursuant to which shares of the Company would be converted into cash, securities or other property, other than a merger of the Company in which shareholders immediately prior to the merger have the same proportionate ownership of stock of the surviving corporation immediately after the merger; (iii) any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; (iv) the approval by the shareholders of the Company of any plan of liquidation or dissolution of the Company; or (v) the Incumbent Directors cease to constitute a majority of the Board. "Good Reason" means any circumstance in which Mr. Crowe is induced by actions of the Company to terminate his employment other than on a purely voluntary basis, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing shall include: (i) a reduction or diminution in the level of responsibility, title or office of Mr. Crowe; (ii) a reduction in the compensation level of Mr. Crowe, taken as a whole; (iii) forced relocation to another geographic location; or (iv) the failure of the Company or any successor corporation to maintain substantially similar employment terms with Mr. Crowe after a Change of Control as were in existence prior to the Change of Control. 107 "Incumbent Director" means any member of the Board (other than Mr. Crowe) who was a member of the Board prior to the occurrence of the transaction, transactions or elections giving rise to a Change of Control and any successor to an Incumbent Director who was recommended or elected or appointed to succeed an Incumbent Director by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Incumbent Directors then on the Board. If a Change of Control had occurred on December 31, 2014, Mr. Crowe would not have had an immediate benefit. If a Severance Payment Triggering Event were also to have taken place, Mr. Crowe would have been entitled to an immediate payment of approximately $596,710. Mr. Crowe would continue to be bound by confidentiality provisions (indefinitely) and non-competition and non-solicitation provisions for a period of one year following the termination of employment. Bruce Colwill, Mona Forster, Robert Cann, Susan McLeod Under the terms of each of the employment agreements with Bruce Colwill, Mona Forster, Robert Cann and Susan McLeod, the Company may terminate the NEO’s employment at any time without cause by providing the NEO with a lump sum payment equal to 18 month’s salary and the aggregate amount of all other remuneration, bonuses and benefits (including the present cash value of any non-cash remuneration, bonuses or benefits) that the NEO would otherwise have received over the ensuing 18 month period (the "Severance Payment"). Each NEO, other than Ms. McLeod, is also entitled to the Severance Payment should he or she elect to resign with Good Reason (defined below) within one year of a Change of Control (defined below) (the delivery of notice of termination of employment without cause or resignation with Good Reason being, in each case, a "Severance Payment Triggering Event"). Ms. McLeod will also become entitled to the Severance Payment in the event she terminates her employment for Good Reason or she terminates her employment within 90 days of any Change of Control (in Ms. McLeod’s case, the delivery of notice of termination of employment without cause or the expiry of one month’s prior written notice of termination of employment for Good Reason or within 90 days of any Change of Control is a "Severance Payment Triggering Event"). "Change of Control" is defined as: (i) the sale, transfer or disposition of the Company’s assets in complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company; (ii) the Company amalgamates, merges or enters into a plan of arrangement with another company at arm’s length to the Company and its affiliates (the "Group"), other than an amalgamation, merger or plan of arrangement that would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving or resulting entity) more than 50% of the combined voting power of the surviving or resulting entity outstanding immediately after such amalgamation, merger or plan of arrangement; or (iii) any person or combination of persons at arm’s length to the Group acquires or becomes the beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, more than 20% of the voting securities of the Company, whether through the acquisition of previously issued and outstanding voting securities, or of voting securities that have not been previously issued, or any combination thereof, or any other transaction having a similar effect, and such person or combination of persons exercise(s) the voting power attached to such securities in a manner that causes the Incumbent Directors to cease to constitute a majority of the Board. "Good Reason" is defined as the occurrence of any of the following without the NEO’s written consent: (i) a material change (other than a change that is clearly consistent with a promotion) in the NEO’s position or duties, responsibilities, reporting relationship, title or office; (ii) a reduction of the NEO’s salary, benefits or any other form of remuneration or any change in the basis upon which such salary, benefits or other form of remuneration payable by the Company is determined; (iii) forced relocation to another geographic area; (iv) any material breach by the Company of a material provision of the employment agreement; or (v) the failure by the Company to obtain an effective assumption of its obligations hereunder by any successor to the Company, including a successor to a material portion of its business. 108 "Incumbent Director" means any member of the Board who was a member of the Board prior to the occurrence of the transaction, transactions or elections giving rise to a Change of Control and any successor to an Incumbent Director who was recommended or elected or appointed to succeed an Incumbent Director by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Incumbent Directors then on the Board. If a Change of Control had occurred on December 31, 2014, none of the foregoing NEOs would have had an immediate benefit. If a Severance Payment Triggering Event had taken place: · Mr. Colwill would have been entitled to a payment of approximately $357,661 within 10 days of the Severance Payment Triggering Event; · Ms. Forster would have been entitled to a payment of approximately $348,093 within 10 days of the Severance Payment Triggering Event; · Mr. Cann would have been entitled to a payment of approximately $359,067 within 10 days of the Severance Payment Triggering Event; and · Ms. McLeod would have been entitled to a payment of approximately $348,228 immediately upon the Severance Payment Triggering Event, or in the case of delivery of notice of termination of employment without cause, within 10 days of the Severance Payment Triggering Event. Each of the NEOs would continue to be bound by confidentiality provisions (indefinitely) and non-competition and non-solicitation provisions for a period of one year following the termination of employment. Director Compensation Directors’ Fees Annual directors' fees are paid to non-executive directors to compensate them for the time and commitment required to act as directors of the Company, serve on standing committees of the Board, serve on special committees of the Board (if so requested by the Board) and act as Chairman of the Board, Deputy Chairman of the Board or chair of certain standing committees. In August 2013, the Compensation Committee retained LaneCaputo to prepare an Executive Compensation Review to assist the Compensation Committee in the review of compensation arrangements for the Company’s senior management team and independent directors and to recommend required changes (if any) to pay elements and strategy to align the Company with current market practices. LaneCaputo recommended that effective January 1, 2014, the annual base retainer payable to non-executive directors to compensate them for acting as directors of the Company be increased from C$17,250 to C$25,000. This recommendation was adopted by the Compensation Committee and the Board. In 2014, James Harris was paid an additional cash retainer of C$19,750 as compensation for acting as the Deputy Chairman of the Board and C$5,250 for acting as the chair of the CGNC. Gorden Glenn received an additional C$12,500 for acting as the chair of the Audit Committee. Alan Edwards received an additional C$5,250 for acting as the chair of the Technical Committee. Lord Howard was paid a total of C$111,4942 in 2014, which includes the C$25,000 base retainer and additional compensation for acting as the Chairman of the Board. Mr. Bottomer, who was the Company’s Vice President, Business Development until December 31, 2013, was not paid any fees to compensate him for acting as a director in 2014. In late 2014, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that effective January 1, 2015, Mark Bailey receive an additional cash retainer of C$5,250 for acting as the chair of the Compensation Committee. Mr. Harris also voluntarily offered to reduce his additional cash retainer for acting as the Deputy Chairman of the Board by C$5,000 to C$14,750, and Lindsay Bottomer was granted the annual base retainer of C$25,000 to compensate him for acting as a director of the Company. In February 2015, Lord Howard voluntarily offered to reduce his total annual compensation from £60,000 to £40,000 and James Harris, while retaining his role as an independent director, stepped down from his position as Deputy Chairman of the Board, both with effect from March 1, 2015. 2 Lord Howard’s compensation is negotiated and settled in British pounds sterling. The exchange rate used to convert 2014 compensation to C$ is 1.8582. 109 Incentive Stock Options The granting of incentive stock options provides a link between non-executive director compensation and the Company’s share price. It also rewards non-executive directors for achieving results that improve Company performance and thereby increase shareholder value. Incentive stock options are an important component of non-executive director compensation for the Company and other members of its peer group, which aren’t large enough to justify the adoption of more costly deferred share plans or restricted share plans, and which don’t have any revenue making it difficult to pay larger cash retainers. Stock options are generally awarded to non-executive directors when they join the Board and periodically thereafter. In making a determination as to whether a grant of long-term incentive stock options is appropriate, and if so, the number of options that should be granted, the Compensation Committee will consider: the value in securities of the Company that the Compensation Committee intends to award as compensation; current and expected future performance of the director; the potential dilution to shareholders and the cost to the Company; previous grants made to the director; option grants made to non-executive directors of comparable companies; and the limits imposed by the terms of the Plan and the TSX. In December 2014, the Compensation Committee recommended that the Board award incentive stock options to each of the non-executive directors in recognition of the role that the non-executive directors played in providing strategic input and corporate oversight as well as assisting management to meet certain objectives in 2014. The Board approved the Compensation Committee’s recommendations, and in December 2014 awarded to each of the non-executive directors options to purchase 100,000 common shares at an exercise price of C$0.21 for five years. The terms and conditions of the grants, including vesting provisions and exercise prices, were determined by the Board at the time of grant, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Plan. The following table is a summary of all compensation provided to the directors of the Company (other than directors who are also NEOs) for the most recently completed financial year. Name(1) Fees earned (US$) Share-based awards (US$) Option-based awards (US$)(2) Non-equity incentive plan compensation (US$) Pension value (US$) All other compensation (US$) Total (US$) Mark Bailey $21,550 Nil $9,329 Nil Nil $0 $30,879 James Harris $43,100 Nil $9,329 Nil Nil $0 $52,429 Michael Howard $96,107 Nil $9,329 Nil Nil $0 $105,436 Alan Edwards $26,075 Nil $9,329 Nil Nil $0 $35,404 Lindsay Bottomer(3) $0 Nil $9,329 Nil Nil $230,145 $239,474 Gorden Glenn $32,325 Nil $9,329 Nil Nil $0 $41,654 (1) In addition to being a director of the Company, Gregory Crowe is also an NEO. For disclosure regarding Mr. Crowe’s compensation, please refer to the Summary Compensation Table above. (2) The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for determining fair value of stock options issued at the grant date. The Company selected the Black-Scholes option-pricing model because it is widely used in estimating option based compensation values by Canadian and U.S. public companies. The practice of the Company is to grant all option based awards in Canadian currency, and then convert the grant date fair value amount to U.S. currency for reporting the value of the grants in the Company’s financials. The conversion rate for each grant is the average of the rates quoted by the Bank of Canada as its noon spot rate of the last day of the three months in the quarter in which the grant is made. The conversion rates for the purpose of the grants in this table are presented below and are based on the applicable conversion rate on the date of grant, each as supplied by the Bank of Canada. (3) In addition to being a director of the Company, Lindsay Bottomer was employed until December 31, 2013 as the Company’s Vice President, Business Development. Mr. Bottomer did not receive fees from the Company in 2014 for acting as a director. He received option-based awards of $9,329. Mr. Bottomer’s severance payment ($209,562) and vacation pay ($20,583) resulting from his retirement on December 31, 2013 are reported as Other Compensation. 110 The following table is a summary of all option-based awards to the directors of the Company (other than directors who are also NEOs) that were outstanding at the end of the most recently completed financial year.

Prior to January 1, 2014, Mr. Bottomer’s option-based awards were not received from the Company for acting as a director. 111 The following table is a summary of all value vested or earned during the most recently completed financial year for the directors of the Company (other than directors who are also NEOs). Name(1) Option-based awards – Value vested during the year (US$)(2) Share-based awards – Value vested during the year (US$) Non-equity incentive plan compensation – Value earned during the year (US$) Mark Bailey $0(3) Nil Nil James Harris $0(3) Nil Nil Michael Howard $0(3) Nil Nil Alan Edwards $0(3) Nil Nil Lindsay Bottomer $0(3) Nil Nil Gorden Glenn $0(3) Nil Nil (1) In addition to being a director of the Company, Gregory Crowe is an NEO.

(2) Value vested during the year is calculated by subtracting the exercise price of the option (being no less than the market price of the Company’s common shares on the date of grant) from the market price of the Company’s common shares on the date the option vested (being the closing price of the Company’s shares on the TSX on the last trading day prior to the vesting date). (3) 100,000 options were awarded on December 23, 2014 at an exercise price of C$0.21. $0 vested because all of the stock options vested in full on the award date. No options were exercised by directors during the most recently completed financial year. Management Contracts Management functions of the Company are substantially performed by directors or executive officers of the Company and not, to any substantial degree, by any other person with whom the Company has contracted. Interest of Informed Persons in Material Transactions Since the commencement of the Company’s most recently completed financial year, no informed person of the Company, proposed director of the Company, or any associate or affiliate of any informed person or proposed director, had any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction or any proposed transaction which has materially affected or would materially affect the Company or any of its subsidiaries. C. Board Practices The Board is currently comprised of seven directors. The size and experience of the Board is important for providing the Company with effective governance in the mining industry. The Board’s mandate and responsibilities can be effectively and efficiently administered at its current size. The Board has functioned, and is of the view that it can continue to function, independently of management as required. Directors are elected for a term of one year at the annual general meeting. The current directors were elected by the Company’s shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on June 26, 2014. The Board adopted a majority voting policy in May 2013. If the number of shares "withheld" from voting for the election of a nominee is greater than the number of shares voted "for" his or her election, the director must submit his or her resignation to the Chairman of the Board promptly after the shareholders’ meeting. The CGNC will consider the resignation and will recommend to the Board whether or not to accept it. After considering the recommendations of the CGNC, the Board will make its decision as to whether to accept or reject the resignation in question and the Company will announce the Board’s decision, including any reasons for the Board not accepting a resignation, within 90 days following the shareholders’ meeting. The policy does not apply if there is a contested director election or where the election involves a proxy battle. The Board has considered the relationship of each director to the Company and currently considers five of the seven directors to be independent directors because they are independent of management and free from any interest and any business or other relationship which could reasonably be expected to interfere with the director’s ability to act with a view to the best interest of the Company, other than interests and relationships arising solely from shareholdings. Lindsay Bottomer and Gregory Crowe are not independent by virtue of the fact that they are, or have within the last three years been, executive officers of the Company. 112 Procedures are in place to allow the Board to function independently. At the present time, the Board has experienced directors that have made a significant contribution to the Company’s success, and are satisfied that it is not constrained in its access to information, in its deliberations or in its ability to satisfy the mandate established by law to supervise the business and affairs of the Company. Committees meet independent of management and other directors. Disclosure of Corporate Governance Practices National Instrument 58-101 - Disclosure of Corporate Governance Practices ("NI 58-101") requires each reporting issuer to disclose its corporate governance practices on an annual basis. The Company’s approach to corporate governance is set forth below. Board of Directors Section 1.4 of NI 52-110 and NYSE MKT Company Guide Section 803A set out the standard for director independence. Under Section 1.4 of NI 52-110 and NYSE MKT Company Guide Section 803A, a director is independent if he has no direct or indirect material relationship with the Company. A material relationship is a relationship which could, in the view of the Board, be reasonably expected to interfere with the exercise of a director’s independent judgment. Section 1.4 of NI 52-110 and NYSE MKT Company Guide Section 803A also set out certain situations where a director will automatically be considered to have a material relationship with the Company. As at December 31, 2014, the Board was comprised of seven directors. Applying the definition set out in section 1.4 of NI 52-110 and NYSE MKT Company Guide Section 803A, a majority (five of the seven members) of the Board are independent. The members who are independent are Mark Bailey, James Harris, Lord Howard, Alan Edwards and Gorden Glenn. Gregory Crowe and Lindsay Bottomer are not independent by virtue of the fact that Mr. Crowe is an executive officer of the Company and Mr. Bottomer was an executive officer of the Company until December 31, 2013. To the extent that the Board considers it to be necessary or advisable, a Board meeting will include an in camera session, at which non-independent directors and members of management are not in attendance. Since the beginning of the Company’s most recently completed financial year, there have been two in camera sessions. Lord Howard, an independent director, serves as non-executive Chairman of the Board, and is responsible for ensuring that the Board discharges its responsibilities in an effective manner and that the Board understands the boundaries between Board and management responsibilities. The Board has developed a written position description for the Chairman in order to delineate the Chairman’s role and responsibilities. The Chairman of the Board is primarily responsible for leading the Board in the performance of its duties and ensuring the Board’s agenda will enable it to successfully carry out its duties. As Chairman, Lord Howard also serves as an "ex officio" member of each Board committee. More specifically, the Chairman of the Board is responsible for: (a) monitoring and reporting to the Board regarding the effectiveness of the Board, as well as individual members, in discharging its and their responsibilities; (b) in consultation with the President and CEO and, where appropriate, with other Board members, determining Board and shareholder calendars and agendas; (c) leading the Board's periodic assessment of the job done by the CEO and his management team; (d) taking the lead in the Company’s adherence to the highest standards of corporate governance; (e) facilitating an open flow of information between management and the Board; and (f) presiding at meetings of the Board and the shareholders. Position Description for CEO The Board has adopted a written position description for the CEO, which sets out his specific duties and responsibilities. Generally, the CEO, who must be appointed by the Board and is directly accountable to the Board, is responsible for management of the day to day operation of the business of the Company and has primary accountability for the profitability and growth of the Company. 113 Employment Contract with Gregory Crowe The Company employs Mr. Gregory Crowe as President and CEO under an employment agreement dated November 1, 2003, as amended. The agreement was for an initial term of two years, and is subject to automatic renewal for additional one year periods, unless notice is provided by the Company six months in advance of the end of the term. Mr. Crowe is required to provide the Company with one month’s prior written notice in the event he wishes to resign. The Company may terminate Mr. Crowe’s employment at any time without cause by providing him with a lump sum payment equal to 24 months’ salary and statutory entitlements and by causing any stock options awarded to Mr. Crowe, which have not yet vested, to vest immediately. Mr. Crowe will be entitled to the same lump sum amount in the event he elects to terminate his employment within 90 days following a change of control or as a result of conditions that amount to constructive dismissal. See "Termination and Change of Control Benefits" above. Otherwise, the Company does not have any service contracts with any directors. Orientation and Continuing Education Board turnover is relatively rare. As a result, the Board provides ad hoc orientation for new directors. The CGNC is responsible for encouraging and facilitating continuing education programs for all directors. The CGNC will also ensure that each director understands the role of the Board, its committees and its directors, and the basic procedures and operations of the Board. Board members are also given access to management and other employees and advisors, who can answer any questions that may arise. Ethical Business Conduct The Board has adopted a written Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code") for its directors, officers, employees and consultants, a copy of which may be obtained on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. The CGNC is responsible for assisting the Board in dealing with conflict of interest issues as contemplated by the Code, reviewing and updating the Code periodically, ensuring that management has established a system to enforce the Code and reviewing management’s monitoring of the Company’s compliance with the Code. Under the Code, members of the Board are required to disclose any conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest to the entire Board as well as any committee on which they serve. Directors are to excuse themselves from participation in any decision of the Board or a committee thereof in any matter in which there is a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest. However, if the Board determines that a potential conflict of interest cannot be cured, the individual will be asked to resign from their position with the Company. Directors are also required to comply with the relevant provisions of the BCBCA regarding conflicts of interest. The Board is also committed to best practices in making timely and accurate disclosure of all material information and providing fair and equal access to material information. The Board has adopted a written Corporate Disclosure and Trading Policy to ensure that the Company and its directors, officers, employees and consultants satisfy the legal and ethical obligations related to the proper and effective disclosure of corporate information and the trading of securities with that information. Standing Committees The Board has four standing committees, namely the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Technical Committee. Their mandates and memberships are outlined below. Audit Committee The Audit Committee meets with the CEO and CFO of the Company and the independent auditors to review and inquire into matters affecting financial reporting, the system of internal accounting and financial controls and procedures and the audit procedures and audit plans. The Audit Committee also recommends to the Board the auditors to be appointed, subject to shareholder approval. In addition, the Audit Committee reviews and recommends to the Board for approval the annual financial statements, the annual report and certain other documents required by regulatory authorities. The Audit Committee is composed of Gorden Glenn (chairman), Mark Bailey and James Harris, all of whom are independent (as defined in NI 52-110 and NYSE MKT Company Guide Section 803(B)(2)(a)(i)) and financially literate (as defined in NI 52-110 and NYSE MKT Company Guide Section 803(B)(2)(a)(iii)). The Board has also assessed the qualifications of Mr. Glenn, and has determined that Mr. Glenn is independent, financially literate and qualifies as a financial expert (as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K under the U.S. Exchange Act). 114 The Board has adopted a written position description for the chair of the Audit Committee. The chair is generally responsible for overseeing the Audit Committee in its responsibilities as outlined in the Audit Committee Charter. The chair’s duties and responsibilities include presiding at each meeting of the Audit Committee, referring specific matters to the Board in the case of a deadlock on any matter or vote, receiving and responding to all requests for information from the Company or the independent auditors, leading the Audit Committee in discharging its tasks and reporting to the Board on the activities of the Audit Committee. The Company’s Annual Information Form for its financial year ended December 31, 2014 dated March 30, 2015 (the "AIF"), and submitted on Form 6-K to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on EDGAR, contains additional disclosure regarding the Audit Committee. Please refer to the section of the AIF entitled "Standing Committees of the Board" for further information. Compensation Committee The primary objective of the Compensation Committee is to discharge the responsibilities of the Board relating to compensation and benefits of the executive officers and directors of the Company. The Board has adopted a written position description for the chair of the Compensation Committee. The chair is generally responsible for overseeing the Compensation Committee in its responsibilities. The chair’s duties and responsibilities include presiding at each meeting of the Compensation Committee, leading the Compensation Committee in discharging its tasks and reporting to the Board on the activities of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee is comprised of four directors, each of whom, in the judgement of the Board, meets the independence requirements of applicable securities legislation and policies for compensation committee members. The members of the Compensation Committee are: Mark Bailey (chairman), Alan Edwards, Gorden Glenn and James Harris. Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee The members of the CGNC are: James Harris (chairman), Alan Edwards and Gorden Glenn. The primary objective of the CGNC is to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by: (a) developing and recommending to the Board corporate governance guidelines for the Company and making recommendations to the Board with respect to corporate governance guidelines; (b) reviewing the performance of the Board, Board members, Board committees and management; and (c) identifying individuals qualified to become Board and Board committee members and recommending such nominees to the Board for election or appointment. Pursuant to the written CGNC Charter, all members must have a working familiarity with corporate governance practices. The CGNC may form and delegate authority to subcommittees when appropriate, and must meet not less frequently than one time per year. The Board has adopted a written position description for the chair of the CGNC. The chair is generally responsible for overseeing the CGNC in its responsibilities. The chair’s duties and responsibilities include ensuring the independence of the Board in the discharge of its responsibilities, presiding at each meeting of the CGNC, leading it in discharging its tasks and reporting to the Board on its activities. Nomination of Directors The CGNC examines the size and composition of the Board and recommends adjustments from time to time to ensure that the Board is of a size and composition that facilitates effective decision making. It also identifies and assesses the necessary and desirable competencies and characteristics for Board membership and regularly assesses the extent to which those competencies and characteristics are represented on the Board. The CGNC identifies individuals qualified to become members of the Board, actively seeks out such individuals when there is a vacancy or when so directed by the Board, and makes recommendations to the Board for the appointment or election of director nominees and for membership on other committees of the Board. 115 Assessments The CGNC regularly reviews the time required from non-executive directors to perform their functions and assesses whether they are satisfying those time requirements. It receives comments from all directors as to the Board’s performance, is responsible for overseeing the execution of a process assessing the effectiveness of the Board and the Board committees as a whole, with particular reference to the Mandate of the Board and appropriate committee charters, where applicable. It is required to report annually to the Board on such assessments. Technical Committee The members of the Technical Committee consist of Alan Edwards (chairman), Mark Bailey, Gorden Glenn, Lindsay Bottomer and Gregory Crowe. Mr. Edwards is a mining engineer, and Mssrs. Bailey, Glenn, Bottomer and Crowe are geologists. Neither Mr. Crowe, the President and Chief Executive of the Company, nor Mr. Bottomer is an independent director. The mandate of the Technical Committee is to exercise all the powers of the Board (except those powers specifically reserved by law to the Board itself) during intervals between meetings of the Board pertaining to the Company’s mining properties, programs, budgets, and other related activities and the administration thereof. The primary objective of the Technical Committee is to review and make recommendations to the Board regarding the approval of budgets, exploration programs and other activities related to the Company’s mining properties. The Board has adopted a Technical Committee Charter, which provides that the Technical Committee must have at least three members, at least one of whom is independent, and all of whom are engineers or geoscientists, or otherwise have sufficient expertise to comprehend and evaluate technical issues associated with the Company’s mining properties. The Technical Committee must meet at least two times per year. The Board has adopted a written position description for the chair of the Technical Committee, who should be independent.

Memorandum and Articles of Association The Company is continued under the laws of British Columbia and is governed by the BCBCA. The Notice of Articles and Articles of the Company (together, the "Articles") do not address the Company’s objects and purposes and there are no restrictions on the business the Company may carry on in the Articles. The Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares without par value. Each common share is entitled to one vote. All common shares of the Company rank equally as to dividends, voting power and participation in assets. No common shares have been issued subject to call or assessment. There are no pre-emptive or conversion rights and no provision for exchange, exercise, redemption and retraction, purchase for cancellation, surrender or sinking or purchase funds. Provisions as to modification, amendments or variation of such rights or such provisions are contained in the BCBCA and the Company’s Articles. A director or senior officer who has, directly or indirectly, a material interest in an existing or proposed material contract or transaction of the Company may not vote in respect of any such proposed material contract or transaction. The directors may from time to time in their discretion authorize and cause the Company to: (a) borrow money in such amount, in such manner, on such security, from such sources and upon such terms and conditions as they think fit; (b) guarantee the repayment of money borrowed by any person or the performance of any obligation of any person; (c) issue bonds, debentures, notes and other debt obligations either outright or as continuing security for any indebtedness or liability, direct or indirect, or obligation of the Company or of any other person; and (d) mortgage, charge (whether by way of a specific or floating charge), grant a security interest in or give other security on the undertaking or on the whole or any part of the property and assets of the Company, both present and future. There are no age considerations pertaining to the retirement or non-retirement of directors. A director is not required to hold a share in the capital of the Company as qualification for his office but shall be qualified as required by the BCBCA, to become or act as a director. A director may hold any office or appointment with the Company (except as auditor of the Company) in conjunction with his office of director for such period and on such terms (as to remuneration or otherwise) as the Board may determine. The Company must reimburse each director for the reasonable expenses that he may incur in and about the business of the Company. If a director performs any professional or other services for the Company that in the opinion of the directors are outside the ordinary duties of a director or shall otherwise be specially occupied in or about the Company’s business, he may be paid remuneration to be fixed by the Board, or, at the option of such director, by ordinary resolution, and such remuneration may be either in addition to or in substitution for any other remuneration that he may be entitled to receive. Subject to the provisions of the BCBCA, the Company may indemnify any person. The Company must, subject to the provisions of the BCBCA, indemnify a director, officer or alternate director or a former director, officer or alternate director of the Company or a person who, at the request of the Company, is or was a director, alternate director or officer of another corporation, at a time when the corporation is or was an affiliate of the Company or a person who, at the request of the Company, is or was, or holds or held a position equivalent to that of, a director, alternate director or officer of a partnership, trust, joint venture or other unincorporated entity (in each case, an "eligible party"), and the heirs and personal representatives of any such eligible party, against all judgments, penalties or fines awarded or imposed in, or an amount paid in settlement of, a legal proceeding or investigative action (whether current, threatened, pending or completed) in which such eligible party or any of the heirs and personal representatives of such eligible party, by reason of such eligible party being or having been a director, alternate director or officer or holding or having held a position equivalent to that of a director, alternate director or officer, is or may be joined as a party or is or may be liable for or in respect of a judgment, penalty or fine in, or expenses related to the proceeding. All of the authorized common shares of the Company are of the same class and, once issued, rank equally as to dividends, voting powers, and participation in assets. Holders of common shares are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be acted upon by the shareholders. Holders of common shares are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared from time to time by the Board, in its discretion, out of funds legally available therefore. 122 Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders of common shares are entitled to receive pro rata the assets of the Company, if any, remaining after payments of all debts and liabilities. No shares have been issued subject to call or assessment. There are no pre-emptive or conversion rights and no provisions for redemption or purchase for cancellation, surrender, or sinking or purchase funds. Provisions as to the modification, amendment or variation of such shareholder rights or provisions are contained in the BCBCA and the Articles. Unless the BCBCA or the Company's Articles otherwise provide, any action to be taken by a resolution of the shareholders may be taken by an ordinary resolution or by a vote of a majority or more of the shares represented at the shareholders' meeting. The BCBCA contains provisions which require a "special resolution" for effecting certain corporate actions. Such a "special resolution" requires a two-thirds vote of shareholders rather than a simple majority for passage. The principle corporate actions that require a "special resolution" include: a. transferring the Company's jurisdiction from British Columbia to another jurisdiction; b. giving financial assistance under certain circumstances; c. certain conflicts of interest by directors; d. disposing of all or substantially all of the Company's undertakings; e. certain alterations of share capital; f. altering any restrictions on the Company's business; and g. certain reorganizations of the Company. There are no restrictions on the repurchase or redemption of common shares of the Company while there is any arrearage in the payment of dividends or sinking fund installments. There is no liability to further capital calls by the Company. There are no provisions discriminating against any existing or prospective holder of securities as a result of such shareholder owning a substantial number of shares. No right or special right attached to issued shares may be prejudiced or interfered with unless the shareholders holding shares of the class or series of shares to which the right or special right is attached consent by a separate special resolution of those shareholders. There are no limitations on the rights to own securities. There is no provision of the Company’s Articles that would have an effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company and that would operate only with respect to a merger, acquisition or corporate restructuring involving the Company (or any of its subsidiaries). Shareholder ownership must be disclosed to Canadian securities administrators and the TSX by any shareholder who owns more than 10% of the Company’s outstanding common shares. C.
