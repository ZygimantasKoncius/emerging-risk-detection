Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in other documents we file with the SEC are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K. We note that factors set forth below, individually or in the aggregate, may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. The outsourcing trend in the preclinical and clinical stages of drug discovery and development may decrease, which could slow our growth. Over the past several years, some areas of our businesses have grown significantly as a result of the increase in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies outsourcing their preclinical and clinical research support activities. We believe that due to the significant investment in facilities and personnel required to support drug development, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies look to outsource some or all of those services. By doing so, they can focus their resources on their core competency of drug discovery, while obtaining the outsourced services from a full-service provider like us. While industry analysts expect the outsourcing trend to continue for the next several years, a decrease in preclinical and/or clinical outsourcing activity could result in a diminished growth rate in the sales of one or more of our expected higher-growth areas and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our customer contracts are generally terminable on little or no notice. Termination of a large contract or multiple contracts could adversely affect our sales and profitability. Our operations and financial results could be significantly affected by these risks. A reduction in research and development budgets at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may adversely affect our business. Our customers include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Our ability to continue to grow and win new business is dependent in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on research and development and to outsource the products and services we provide. Fluctuations in the research and development budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, spending priorities and institutional budgetary policies. Our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in life sciences research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as by academic institutions, government laboratories or private foundations. Similarly, economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries, including funding for biotechnology companies generally, also affect our business. A reduction or delay in government funding of research and development may adversely affect our business. A portion of net sales in our RMS segment is derived from customers at academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is partially dependent on both the level and timing of funding from government sources, such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and similar domestic and international agencies. Government funding of research and development is subject to the political process, which is inherently unpredictable. Our sales may be adversely affected if our customers delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals. Also, government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the NIH and other government agencies that fund research and development activities. NIH funding has remained fairly flat in recent years and a reduction in government funding for the 15 NIH or other government research agencies could adversely affect our business and our financial results. Changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical or biotechnological industries, including potential health care reform, could decrease the need for the services we provide. Governmental agencies throughout the world, but particularly in the United States, strictly regulate the drug development process. Our business involves helping pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, among others, navigate the regulatory drug approval process. Accordingly, many regulations, and often new regulations, are expected to result in higher regulatory standards and often additional revenues for companies that service these industries. However, some changes in regulations, such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures, or an increase in regulatory requirements that we have difficulty satisfying or that make our services less competitive, could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for our services. In addition, if regulatory authorities were to mandate a significant reduction in safety testing procedures which utilize laboratory animals (as has been advocated by certain groups), certain segments of our business could be materially adversely affected. In recent years the U.S. Congress and state legislatures have considered various types of health care reform in order to control growing health care costs. We are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future, if any. Similar reform movements have occurred in Europe and Asia. Implementation of health care reform legislation that contains costs could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs. This could adversely affect research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to us both in the United States and abroad. In addition, new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability, increase our costs or limit our service offerings. Furthermore, if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursements for pharmaceutical products, our customers may spend less, or reduce their growth in spending on research and development. Our standard customer agreements contain customer-determined termination and service reduction provisions, which may result in less contract revenue than we anticipate. Generally, our agreements with our customers provide that the customers can terminate the agreements or reduce the scope of services under the agreements with little or no notice. Customers may elect to terminate their agreements with us for various reasons, including: the products being tested fail to satisfy safety requirements; unexpected or undesired study results; production problems resulting in shortages of the drug being tested; the customer's decision to forego or terminate a particular study; or the loss of funding for the particular research study. If a customer terminates a contract with us, we are entitled under the terms of the contract to receive revenue earned to date as well as certain other costs and, in some cases, penalties. Cancellation of a large contract or proximate cancellation of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business (particularly our PCS segment) and, therefore, may adversely affect our operating results. Many of our contracts are fixed price and may be delayed or terminated or reduced in scope for reasons beyond our control, or we may under price or overrun cost estimates with these contracts, potentially resulting in financial losses. Many of our contracts provide for services on a fixed price or fee-for-service with a cap basis and, accordingly, we bear the financial risk if we initially under-price our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates. In addition, these contracts may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon notice. Cancellations may occur for a variety of reasons, and often at the discretion of the customer. The loss, reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple 16 contracts could materially adversely affect our business, although our contracts frequently entitle us to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects, as well as all fees earned by us up to the time of termination. Some contracts also entitle us to a termination fee. Contaminations in our animal populations can damage our inventory, harm our reputation for contaminant-free production, result in decreased sales and cause us to incur additional costs. Our research models and fertile chicken eggs must be free of certain adventitious, infectious agents such as certain viruses and bacteria because the presence of these contaminants can distort or compromise the quality of research results and could adversely impact human or animal health. The presence of these infectious agents in our animal production facilities and certain service operations could disrupt our contaminant-free research model and fertile egg production as well as our animal services businesses including transgenic services, harm our reputation for contaminant-free production and result in decreased sales. Contaminations typically require cleaning up, renovating, disinfecting, retesting and restarting. Such clean-ups result in inventory loss, clean-up and start-up costs, and reduced sales as a result of lost customer orders and credits for prior shipments. In addition to microbiological contaminations, the potential for genetic mix-ups or mismatings also exists and may require the restarting of the applicable colonies. While this does not require the complete clean-up, renovation and disinfection of the barrier room, it would likely result in inventory loss, additional start-up costs and possibly reduced sales. In addition, contaminations expose us to risks that customers will request compensation for damages in excess of our contractual indemnification requirements. In addition, there exists a risk that contaminations from models that we produce may affect our customer's facilities, with similar impact to them. In some cases, we may be responsible for animals carrying human susceptible diseases, and in the case of contamination, there is possible risk of human exposure. All such contaminations described above are unanticipated and difficult to predict and could adversely impact our financial results. We have made significant capital expenditures designed to strengthen our biosecurity and have significantly improved our operating procedures to protect against such contaminations; however, contaminations may still occur. Our business is subject to risks relating to operating internationally. A significant part of our net sales is derived from operations outside the United States. Our international revenues, which include revenues from our non-U.S. subsidiaries, have represented approximately one-half our total net sales in recent years. We expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future. There are a number of risks associated with our international business, including: foreign currencies we receive for sales and which we record as expenses outside the United States could be subject to unfavorable exchange rates with the U.S. dollar and reduce the amount of revenue (and increase the amount of expenses) that we recognize and cause fluctuations in reported financial results; certain contracts, particularly in Canada, are frequently denominated in currencies other than the currency in which we incur expenses related to those contracts and where expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which contracts are priced, fluctuations in the relative value of those currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations; general economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate; potential international conflicts, including terrorist acts; potential trade restrictions, exchange controls and legal restrictions on the repatriation of funds into the United States; 17 difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations, including risks of violations of local laws or the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by employees overseas or the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; the difficulties of compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations; unfavorable labor regulations in foreign jurisdictions; longer accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries; and import and export licensing requirements. Upgrading and integrating our business systems could result in implementation issues and business disruptions. We currently are engaged in a project to replace many of our numerous legacy business systems at our different sites globally with an enterprise wide, integrated enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The process of planning and preparing for such an integrated, wide-scale implementation is extremely complex and we are required to address a number of challenges including data conversion, system cutover and user training. Problems in any of these areas could cause operational problems during implementation including delayed shipments, missed sales, billing and accounting errors and other operational issues. There have been numerous, well-publicized instances of companies experiencing difficulties with the implementation of ERP systems which resulted in negative business consequences. In the course of our planning, we have actively considered the risks of implementation and taken measures to manage the risks, including: incorporating specific steps to mitigate potential risks into our project plan; engaging outside consultants who specialize in ERP implementations to provide assistance and advice on minimizing implementation problems; using industry standard methodologies and practices; and instituting monitoring processes into the project and our preparations for implementations in order to avoid unnecessary risks. Despite these steps to manage risk, there is still a possibility that implementation may occur which could materially and adversely effect us. Negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business. The products and services which we provide our customers are essential to the drug discovery and development process, and are almost universally mandated by law. Notwithstanding, certain special interest groups categorically object to the use of animals for valid research purposes. Historically, our core research model activities with rats, mice and other rodents have not been the subject of significant animal rights media attention. However, research activities with animals have been the subject of adverse attention, impacting the industry. This has included occasional on-site demonstrations at facilities operated by us. Any negative attention or threats directed against our animal research activities in the future could impair our ability to operate our business efficiently. Several of our product and service offerings are dependent on a limited source of supply, which if interrupted could adversely affect our business. We depend on a limited international source of supply of large animal models required in our product and service offerings. Disruptions to their continued supply may arise from health problems, export or import restrictions or embargoes, foreign government or economic instability, severe weather conditions, increased competition amongst suppliers for models, disruptions to the air travel system or other normal-course or unanticipated events. Any disruption of supply could harm our business if we cannot remove the disruption or are unable to secure an alternative or secondary supply source on comparable commercial terms. 18 We may be unable to build out our facilities as anticipated. To support our customers' growing demand for drug discovery and development services, including increased strategic focus on outsourcing services and programs, we are engaged in a substantial capacity expansion program, with $227 million spent on capital expenditures in 2007 and another $220-240 million allocated for capital expenditures in 2008. Included in our 2008 capital plan are the following: our new U.S. PCS facility in Nevada, expansions at our Canada, Ohio and Scotland PCS facilities, the construction of a new PCS facility in China, and the construction of our new RMS facility in Maryland. We cannot assure you that any or all of these facilities, or any particular phase of such facilities, will be constructed on the anticipated timetable or on budget. Any material delay in bringing these facilities on-line, or substantial increase in costs to complete these facilities, could materially and adversely affect us. In addition, the costs of these capacity expansion programs may have an adverse impact on our operating margins, particularly within our PCS business. Any failure by us to comply with applicable regulations and related guidance could harm our reputation and operating results. Any failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities. This could harm our reputation, our prospects for future work and our operating results. For example, if we were to fail to verify that informed consent is obtained from participants in connection with a particular Phase I clinical trial, the data collected from that trial could be disqualified and we might be required to redo the trial at no further cost to our customer, but at substantial cost to us. Furthermore, the issuance of a notice of observations or a warning from the FDA based on a finding of a material violation by us of good clinical practice, good laboratory practice or good manufacturing practice requirements could materially and adversely affect us. In addition, regulations and guidance worldwide concerning the production and use of laboratory animals for research purposes continues to be updated. Notably, there has been a recent updating of guidance in Europe that will be implemented over a period of several years on a country-by-country basis. Similarly, guidance has been and continues to be developed for other areas that impact the biomedical research community including transportation and the use of disinfectants. In the United States, an updating of guidance used by the National Institutes of Health and by certain oversight agencies has been recently funded, and it is expected that over the next 3 years, standards will be updated for the care and use of laboratory animals in all aspects of our US business units. These new guidelines could cause us increased costs attributable to additional facilities, the need to add personnel to address new processes, as well as increased administrative burden, and the upgrading of existing facilities. The drug discovery and development services industry is highly competitive. The drug discovery and development services industry is highly competitive. We often compete for business not only with other drug discovery and development companies, but also with internal discovery and development departments within our larger clients, who may have greater resources than ours. We also compete with universities and teaching hospitals. We compete on a variety of factors, including: reputation for on-time quality performance; reputation for regulatory compliance; expertise and experience in specific areas; scope and breadth of service and product offerings; broad geographic availability; price/value; 19 technological expertise and efficient drug development processes; quality of facilities; financial stability; size; ability to acquire, process, analyze and report data in an accurate manner; and ability to manage Phase I clinical trials both domestically and internationally. If we do not compete successfully, our business will suffer. Increased competition might lead to price and other concessions that might adversely affect our operating results. The drug discovery and development services industry has continued to see a trend towards consolidation, particularly among the biotechnology companies, who are targets for each other and for larger pharmaceutical companies. If this trend continues, it is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies and contract research organizations generally, with respect to both clients and acquisition candidates. In addition, while there are substantial barriers to entry for large, global competitors with broad-based services, small, specialized entities considering entering the contract research organization industry will continue to find lower barriers to entry, and private equity firms may determine that there are opportunities in acquiring and rolling up these companies, thus further increasing possible competition. Furthermore, in recent years both Charles River and our competitors, particularly in the preclinical services area, have been investing in capital projects to increase capacity. An ongoing challenge for all participants is balancing capacity growth and market demand. If capacity has been increased too much, pressure to lower prices or to take on lower-margin studies and projects may occur. These competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of our services and could adversely affect our financial results. We could be adversely affected by tax law changes in Canada and the United Kingdom. We have substantial operations in Canada and the United Kingdom which currently benefit from favorable corporate tax arrangements. We receive substantial tax credits in Canada from both the Canadian federal and Quebec governments and benefits from tax credits and accelerated tax depreciation allowances in the United Kingdom. Any reduction in the availability or amount of these tax credits or allowances would be likely to have a material adverse effect on profits, cash flow and our effective tax rate. Impairment of goodwill may adversely impact future results of operations. We have intangible assets, including goodwill and other identifiable and indefinite-lived acquired intangibles on our balance sheet due to our acquisitions of businesses. As of December 29, 2007, we had recorded goodwill and other intangibles of $1.3 billion on the consolidated balance sheet. The initial identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition involve use of management judgments and estimates. These estimates are based on, among other factors, input from accredited valuation consultants, reviews of projected future income cash flows and statutory regulations. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions might have increased or decreased the estimated fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets and potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations. 20 We perform an annual review of goodwill to determine if an impairment exists. Goodwill is considered impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Assessing the impairment of goodwill involves making assumptions and judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of our reporting units. Our assessment is derived from cash flow projections and various key assumptions, strategies, opportunities and risks that are incorporated in our internal strategic review process. We also analyze our market capitalization as compared to a discounted cash flow analysis. We performed annual impairment tests in 2007 and concluded the goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset balances were not impaired. The results of that impairment review are as of a point in time and changes in future business strategy or market conditions could significantly impact the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of these assets in subsequent years. Goodwill will not be amortized, but will be reviewed for impairment by us at least annually. If the future growth and operating results of the acquired businesses are not as strong as anticipated, goodwill may be impaired. To the extent goodwill is impaired, its carrying value will be written down to its implied fair value and a charge will be made to our earnings. Such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Contract research services create a risk of liability. In contracting to work on drug development trials, as a contract research organization we face a range of potential liabilities which may include: errors or omissions in reporting of study detail in preclinical or Phase I clinical studies that may lead to inaccurate reports, which may potentially advance studies absent the necessary support or inhibit studies from proceeding to the next level of testing; litigation risk, including resulting from our errors or omissions, associated with the possibility that the drugs/compounds of our clients that were included in drug development trials we participated in may cause illness, personal injury or have other negative side effects to clinical study participants or other persons (including death); general risks associated with operating a Phase I clinical business, including negative consequences from the administration of drugs to clinical trial participants or the professional malpractice of Phase I medical care providers; risks associated with our possible failure to properly care for our customers' property, such as research models and samples, study compounds, records, work in progress, or goods and materials in transit, while in our possession; risks that models in our breeding facilities or in facilities that we run may be infected with diseases that may be harmful and even lethal to themselves or humans despite preventive measures contained in our company policies for the quarantine and handling of imported animals; and errors and omissions during a trial that may undermine the usefulness of a trial or data from the trial. We attempt to mitigate these risks through a variety of methods. Nonetheless, it is impossible to completely eradicate such risks. In our RMS business, we mitigate these risks to the best of our abilities through our regimen of animal testing, quarantine, and veterinary staff vigilance, through which we seek to control the exposure of animal related disease or infections. In our PCS business, we attempt to reduce these risks by contract provisions entitling us to be indemnified or entitling us to a limitation of liability; insurance maintained by our clients, investigators, and by us; and various regulatory requirements we must follow in connection with our business. 21 In both our RMS and PCS businesses, contractual indemnifications generally do not protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions, such as negligence or misconduct. We could be materially and adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim which is not covered by a contractual indemnification provision or in the event that a party who must indemnify us does not fulfill its indemnification obligations or which is beyond the level of our insurance coverage. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such insurance coverage on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to attract suitable participants for our Phase I clinical trials, our business might suffer. The Phase I clinical research studies we run rely upon the ready accessibility and willing participation of subjects. Participants generally include people from the communities in which the studies are conducted, including our Phase I clinics in Edinburgh, Scotland and Tacoma, Washington, which such communities to date have provided a substantial pool of potential subjects for research studies. Our Phase I clinical research activities could be adversely affected if we were unable to attract suitable and willing participants on a consistent basis. New technologies may be developed, validated and increasingly used in biomedical research that could reduce demand for some of our products and services. For many years, groups within the scientific and research communities have attempted to develop models, methods and systems that would replace or supplement the use of living animals as test subjects in biomedical research. Some companies have developed techniques in these areas, including vaccine development, that may have scientific merit. In addition, technological improvements to existing or new processes, such as imaging technology, could result in a refinement in the number of animal research models necessary to conduct the required research. It is our strategy to participate in some fashion with any non-animal test method as it becomes validated as a research model alternative or adjunct in our markets. However, we may not be successful in commercializing these methods if developed, and sales or profits from these methods may not offset reduced sales or profits from research models. Alternative research methods could decrease the need for research models, and we may not be able to develop new products effectively or in a timely manner to replace any lost sales. The drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation, and we might be involved in costly intellectual property lawsuits. The drug discovery and development industry has a history of patent and other intellectual property litigation and these lawsuits will likely continue. Accordingly, we face potential patent infringement suits by companies that have patents for similar products and methods used in business or other suits alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights. Legal proceedings relating to intellectual property could be expensive, take significant time and divert management's attention from other business concerns, whether we win or lose. If we do not prevail in an infringement lawsuit brought against us, we might have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages, and we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license to use technology on unfavorable terms. We may not be able to successfully develop and market new services. We may seek to develop and market new services that complement or expand our existing business or service offerings. If we are unable to develop new services and/or create demand for those newly developed services, our future business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected. Our debt level could adversely affect our business and growth prospects. At December 29, 2007, we had approximately $510.0 million of debt. This debt could have significant adverse effects on our business, including making it more difficult for us to obtain additional 22 financing on favorable terms; requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest on this debt; limiting our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities; and making us more vulnerable to rising interest rates. If we are not successful in selecting and integrating the businesses and technologies we acquire, our business may suffer. During the past seven years, we have expanded our business through several acquisitions. We plan to continue to acquire businesses and technologies and form alliances. However, businesses and technologies may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable. We risk spending time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or alliance partners, but not completing transactions. Even if completed, acquisitions and alliances involve numerous risks which may include: difficulties and expenses incurred in assimilating and integrating operations, services, products or technologies; difficulties in developing and operating new businesses, including diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; potential losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of acquired companies that are not covered by the indemnification we may obtain from the seller; risks of not being able to overcome differences in foreign business practices, language and other cultural barriers in connection with the acquisition of foreign companies; the presence or absence of adequate internal controls and/or significant fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies; and difficulties in achieving business and financial success. In the event that an acquired business or technology or an alliance does not meet our expectations, our results of operations may be adversely affected. We could experience a breach of the confidentiality of the information we hold or of the security of our computer systems. We operate large and complex computer systems that contain significant amounts of customer data. As a routine element of our business, we collect, analyze and retain substantial amounts of data pertaining to the preclinical and the clinical studies we conduct for our customers. Unauthorized third parties could attempt to gain entry to such computer systems for the purpose of stealing data or disrupting the systems. We believe that we have taken adequate measures to protect them from intrusion, but in the event that our efforts are unsuccessful we could suffer significant harm. Our contracts with our customers typically contain provisions that require us to keep confidential the information generated from these studies. In the event the confidentiality of such information was compromised, we could suffer significant harm. We depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel, which would harm our business. Our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other members of management. James C. Foster, our Chief Executive Officer since 1992 and Chairman since 2000, has held various positions with us for over 30 years. We have no employment agreement with Mr. Foster or other members of our management. If Mr. Foster or other members of management do not continue in their present positions, our business may suffer. Because of the specialized scientific nature of our business, we are highly dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. While we have an 23 excellent record of employee retention, there is still strong competition for qualified personnel in the veterinary, pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields. Therefore, we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business. The loss of the services of existing personnel, as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific, technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner, could harm our business. Our quarterly operating results may vary, which could negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Our results of operations in any quarter may vary from quarter to quarter and are influenced by such factors as: the number and scope of ongoing customer engagements, the commencement, postponement, progress, completion or cancellation of customer contracts in the quarter, changes in the mix of our products and services, the extent of cost overruns, holiday patterns of our customers, budget cycles of our customers, the timing and charges associated with completed acquisitions and other events, and exchange rate fluctuations. We believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results. Nonetheless, fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect the market price of our common stock Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments There are no unresolved comments to be reported in response to Item 1B.
