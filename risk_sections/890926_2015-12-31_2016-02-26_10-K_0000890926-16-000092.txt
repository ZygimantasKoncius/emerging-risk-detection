Item 1A. Risk Factors______________________________________________________________________________________________________We rely on our management team and our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain qualified personnel or successfully develop and/or recruit their replacements.Our success depends, in part, on the skills, working relationships and continued services of our management team and other key personnel, any of whom could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. The unexpected departure of key personnel could adversely affect the conduct of our business. In such event, we would be required to obtain other personnel to manage and operate our business. In addition, we will be required to replace the knowledge and expertise of our workforce as our workers retire. In either case, there can be no assurance that we would be able to develop or recruit suitable replacements for the departing individuals; that replacements could be hired, if necessary, on terms that are favorable to us; or that we can successfully transition such replacements in a timely manner. Failure to effectively implement our succession planning efforts and to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving members of our management team and other key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Without a properly skilled and experienced workforce, our costs, including productivity costs and costs to replace employees may increase, and this could negatively impact our earnings. We face risks associated with our acquisition of Clayton and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Clayton acquisition.As a result of our acquisition of Clayton and our entry into our Services business, we are exposed to certain risks that may negatively affect our financial results, including, among others, the following:•Our Services revenue is dependent on a limited number of large customers that represent a significant proportion of our Services total revenues. Radian Guaranty also does business with many of these significant customers. In the event of a dispute between a significant customer and either of our business segments, the overall customer relationship for Radian could be negatively impacted. The loss or reduction of business from one or more of these significant customers could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.•While Clayton is not a defendant in litigation arising out of the financial crisis involving the issuance of RMBS in connection with which it has provided services, it has been in the past, and may again be in the future, subpoenaed by various parties to provide documents and information related to such litigation, and there can be no assurance that Clayton will not be subject to future claims against it, whether in connection with such litigation or otherwise. It is possible that our exposure to potential liabilities resulting from our Services business, some of which may be material or unknown, could exceed amounts we can recover through indemnification claims.Our goodwill and other intangible assets were established primarily in connection with our acquisition of Clayton. Goodwill is an asset representing the estimated future economic benefits arising from the assets we have acquired that were not individually identified and separately recognized, and includes the value of expected future cash flows of Clayton, Clayton’s workforce, expected synergies with our other affiliates and other unidentifiable intangible assets. Goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite useful life and is subject to review for impairment annually, or more frequently, whenever circumstances indicate potential impairment. The value of goodwill is primarily supported by revenue projections, which is driven primarily by transaction volume. Intangible assets, other than goodwill, primarily consist of customer relationships, technology, trade name and trademarks, client backlog and non-competition agreements. The calculation of the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangibles requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective in nature, such as attrition rates, discount rates, future expected cash flows and market conditions. In particular, future expected cash flows include estimated transaction volumes that are not currently contracted, as well as volume projections associated with non-agency RMBS securitizations, for which current market conditions are not favorable. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. If actual results differ from our assumptions, we may not realize the full value of our goodwill and other intangible assets.For these and other reasons there can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits from the transaction will be realized fully or at all. If we fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Clayton acquisition, we may not realize the full value of our goodwill and other intangible assets related to the acquisition, in which case we may be required to write down or write off all such goodwill and other intangible assets. Such an impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 64Item 1B.Unresolved Staff Comments.None.
