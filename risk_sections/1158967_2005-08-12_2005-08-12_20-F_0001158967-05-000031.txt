D. Risk Factors. If any of the risks described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. Our customer base is highly concentrated, and our sales would suffer if one or more of our significant customers substantially reduce or cancel orders for our products We are dependent on a limited number of large customers for a substantial portion of our net sales. Sales to our largest customer, Seagate, were approximately 16%, 14% and 8% of total net sales for the year ended March 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Sales to our six largest customers represented approximately 41%, 41% and 29% of our net sales for the years ended March 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. On January 6, 2003, the storage technology businesses of Hitachi Ltd. and IBM were combined to form Hitachi Global Storage Technologies. The new company was the third largest manufacturer of hard disk drives in the world. As a result of this development, our customer base has become more highly concentrated. Our customer base is also highly concentrated in our other product markets such as brushless DC motors, fans, machinery, electronic and optical components and other products. Our accounts receivable are likewise concentrated. Six customers represented ¥19.7 billion, or 39%, ¥23.6 billion, or 24% and ¥33.6 billion, or 30% of our gross accounts receivable at March 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. As a result of customer concentration, our net sales could be significantly impacted in the event of: • a significant reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from one or more of our significant customers; • a decision by one or more significant customers to select products manufactured by a competitor, or its own internally developed components, for inclusion in future product generations; or • financial difficulties affecting one or more significant customers. We expect that, for the foreseeable future, sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our net sales. If current customers do not continue to place orders, we may not be able to replace these orders with orders from new customers, and this would significantly impact our business, operating results and financial condition. 6 Table of Contents Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and Information. We depend on the computer industry for sales of our products, and our business may be adversely affected by a decline in the computer market Our precision motor and fan products are components used primarily in computer systems. A substantial portion of our net sales in turn depends on sales of computers and computer peripherals that incorporate our products. Revenues from hard disk drive spindle motors accounted for 42.2%, 38.5% and 24.5% of our net sales for the years ended March 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Although we have been diversifying our products and entering into new markets, such as motors for use in household appliances, automobiles and home entertainment equipment, we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of products for use in computers and computer peripherals. The markets for computers and computer peripherals are cyclical and have been characterized by: • rapid technological change; • frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles; • significant price competition and price erosion; • fluctuating inventory levels; • alternating periods of over-capacity and capacity constraints due, in part, to cyclical and seasonal market patterns; • variations in manufacturing costs and yields; and • significant expenditures for manufacturing equipment and product development. The computer market grew substantially in the late 1990s and then experienced a significant downturn from which it is only now beginning to recover. The downturn was characterized by lower product demand and accelerated reductions of product prices. These conditions prompted restructuring of operations by hardware manufacturers, including makers of hard disk drives, including our customers. Such restructurings involving our customers may result in our customers seeking to reduce costs and inventories, which could in turn reduce our margins or sales volumes. These customers may also switch to suppliers other than us. Such restructuring or similar moves by hard disk drive manufacturers in the future could have a material negative impact on our results of operations if we are unable to increase sales to other hard disk drive manufacturers or increase sales of spindle motors for non-desktop use. The rate of decline in average selling price accelerates when, as is currently the case in the hard disk drive industry, competitors lower prices to absorb excess capacity, liquidate excess inventories, restructure or attempt to gain market share. During an industry downturn, manufacturers may abruptly stop purchasing additional inventory from suppliers such as us. And because many of our customers have adopted just-in-time inventory management processes, we often maintain up to one months inventory at or near the customers production facility, a practice which may force us to absorb excess inventories when growth slows. Our inventory was ¥17.0 billion at March 31, 2003, ¥45.2 billion at March 31, 2004 and ¥49.0 billion at March 31, 2005. Our inventory at March 31, 2004 compared to March 31, 2003 substantially increased due primarily to the consolidationof new subsidiaries such as Nidec Copal Corporatio n, Nidec Copal Electronics Corporation and Sankyo Seiki Mfg. Co., Ltd. Maintaining inventory increases our capital requirements and costs, complicates our inventory management strategies and makes it more difficult to match manufacturing plans with customer demand, thereby increasing the risk of inventory obsolescence and price erosion during periods of reduced demand, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 7 Table of Contents Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and Information. We are facing downward pricing pressure in our main product markets, and price declines could reduce our revenues and gross margins We expect downward pricing pressure in our main product markets to continue. The hard disk drive industry, in particular, is characterized by rapidly declining average selling prices over the life of a product even for those products which are competitive and timely to-market. Our average selling price for hard disk drive spindle motors fell by approximately 8%, 9% and 9% during the years ended March 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. In general, the average selling price for a given product in the hard disk drive market decreases over time as increases in the supply of competitive products and cost reductions occur and as technological advancements are achieved. There is also intense price competition among hard disk drive manufacturers and, as a result, our principal customers pressure us to lower the prices of our spindle motors. Falling prices reduce our margins, cause operating results to suffer and may make it difficult for us to maintain profitability. If we are not able to achieve such cost reductions, develop new customized products or increase our unit sales volume, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. If our third party suppliers experience capacity constraints or production failures, our production could be significantly harmed We rely on third party suppliers for some of the materials and equipment used in our manufacturing processes, including connectors, electric circuit unit assemblies and ball bearings. Even though we are decreasing our reliance on ball bearing suppliers as a result of the shift to fluid dynamic bearing spindle motors, our production capacity would nevertheless be limited if one or more of these materials were to become unavailable or available in reduced quantities or if we were unable to find alternative suppliers. If our source of materials and supplies were unavailable for a significant period of time, our operating results would be adversely affected. We face aggressive competition both in the spindle motor market and in the markets into which we are attempting to expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations Our major competitors in the area of hard disk drive spindle motors have increased their production capacity in recent periods, which has resulted in intensified competition and a reduction in prices. This trend of severe competition is likely to intensify as our competitors offer very competitive prices in order to grab larger market shares. It is also possible that ball bearing or other subcomponent manufacturers will try to enter the spindle motor market. In the area of mid-size motors for automobiles and household appliances, some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, service and support resources than we do and may have substantially greater name recognition, manufacturing expertise and capability and longer standing customer relationships than we do. To remain competitive in our core business area of spindle motors and to increase our competitiveness in other motor markets in which we are attempting to expand our business, we believe that we must maintain a substantial investment in research and development and expand our manufacturing capability, marketing, sales efforts and customer service and support. We must also develop new products and enhance our existing products in a timely manner. We may not compete successfully in all or some of our markets in the future, and we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments. We may not make the technological advances necessary to maintain our competitive position so that our products will receive industry acceptance. We anticipate that we may have to adjust prices on many of our products to stay competitive, and our profit margins may fall. In addition, technological changes, manufacturing efficiencies or development efforts by our competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or uncompetitive. Our failure to maintain our competitive position could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 8 Table of Contents Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and Information. We may be unable to commercialize customized products that satisfy customers needs in a timely manner and in sufficient quantities, which could damage our reputation and reduce sales Many of our customers work directly with component suppliers such as us to design and build customized products for specific needs. A significant portion of our contracts with these customers require us to provide customized products within a set delivery timetable. If we are unable to commercialize new product lines including design, manufacture and delivery of customized products, we may not be able to meet our customers product needs or timetables. Although we have not had such problems in the past, any future failure to meet significant customer requirements could damage our reputation and impede our ability to expand our business in markets for these products. We could experience losses or damage to our reputation if any of the end-products in which our motors or other products are incorporated malfunction, causing damage to persons, property or data Our small precision motors and other products are a key component in many consumer electronics devices, particularly data storage devices such as hard disk drives. Widespread malfunction of such devices could lead to consumer dissatisfaction, recalls and, potentially, lawsuits. If such problems are caused by or attributed or alleged to be attributed to defects in our motors or their design, we might be drawn into disputes with our customers, our reputation could be damaged and our results of operations might be adversely affected by lost sales or costs associated with recalls or defending ourselves against legal claims. We may suffer such losses or damage regardless of whether our products were defective. Our operating results may fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations in sales and operating results from one quarter to the next. As a result, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful, and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Our operating results may be subject to significant quarterly fluctuations as a result of the following principal factors: • fluctuations in product demand as a result of the cyclical and seasonal nature of the industries in which our motor and drive technology products are sold and used, including the computer industry; • translation effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the results of our overseas subsidiaries; • the availability and extent of utilization of our manufacturing capacity; • changes in our product or customer mix; • entry of new competitors; • cancellation or rescheduling of significant orders, which can occur on short notice; • deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products or enhancements; • component and raw material costs and availability, particularly with respect to components obtained from sole or limited sources; and • natural and man-made disasters, including earthquakes, warfare and acts of terrorism, in Japan or elsewhere. 9 Table of Contents Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and Information. Moreover, a large portion of our operating expenses, including equipment depreciation, rent, salaries, capital leases and interest payments, are relatively fixed and difficult to reduce or adjust. Reductions in our unit sales will not typically correspond with reductions in these relatively fixed costs. Therefore, such reductions in our unit sales will generally result in reduced or negative margins for our products. Any or all of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our recent growth has been based in part on acquisitions, and our future growth could be adversely affected if we make acquisitions that turn out to be incompatible with our existing business or unsuccessful, or if we are unable to find suitable acquisition targets We have achieved much of our growth by acquiring other companies that have provided us with complementary technologies and product lines. To the extent that we are unable to make successful acquisitions, we may not be able to continue to expand our product range and our growth rates could be adversely affected. Critical to the success of our acquisitions is the ordered, efficient integration of acquired businesses into our organization, which has in the past required, and may continue to require, significant resources. There can be no assurance that our investments will generate the operational and financial returns we expect. The success of future acquisitions will depend upon factors such as: • our ability to manufacture and sell the products of the businesses acquired; • continued demand for these acquired products by our customers; • our ability to integrate the acquired businesses operations, products and personnel; • our ability to retain key personnel of the acquired businesses; and • our ability to extend our financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures to acquired businesses. Failure to succeed in acquisitions, or an inability to find suitable acquisition targets, could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition. Our growth places strains on our managerial, operational and financial resources Our future success depends on our ability to expand our organization in line with the growth of our business, including the integration of recently added subsidiaries within the Nidec group. However, our growth has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources. Our recent acquisitions and any further growth by us or our subsidiaries or affiliates, or an increase in the number of our strategic relationships, will increase this strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources. This strain may inhibit our ability to achieve the rapid execution necessary to successfully implement our business plan. 10 Table of Contents Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and Information. We could be harmed by litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights We have patent protection on certain aspects of our technology and also rely on trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, as well as contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary rights. We face the following risks: • we could incur substantial costs in defending against claims of infringement of the intellectual property of others and such claims could result in damage awards against us, in orders to pay for the use of previously unrecognized third-party intellectual property or in injunctions preventing us from continuing aspects of our business, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. • our protective measures may not be adequate to protect our proprietary rights; • other parties, including competitors with substantially greater resources, may independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology, and we may be required to pay royalties to license intellectual property of those parties; • patents may not be issued pursuant to our current or future patent applications, and patents issued pursuant to such applications, or any patents we own or have licenses to use, may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged; • the rights granted under any such patents may not provide competitive advantages to us or adequately safeguard and maintain our technology; • we could incur substantial costs in seeking enforcement of our patents against infringement or the unauthorized use of our trade secrets, proprietary know how or other intellectual property by others; and • the laws of foreign countries in which our products are manufactured and sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of Japan and the United States, and such laws may not be enforced in an effective manner. For specific information relating to two intellectual property disputes that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, see Item 4.B. Business OverviewLegal Proceedings. Because our sales to overseas customers are denominated predominantly in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to exchange rate risks that could harm our results of operations Sales to customers outside Japan accounted for 64.4%, 61.0% and 63.6% of our consolidated net sales during the years ended March 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. A significant portion of our overseas sales is denominated in currencies other than the Japanese yen, primarily the U.S. dollar. As a result, appreciation of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar will generally have a negative effect on our operating income and net income. We experience volatility in our results of operations as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when or result of operations of subsidiaries operating in currencies other than the yen are consolidated into our financial statements, which are reported in yen. We also experience foreign exchange risk to the extent that our sales and expenses or those of our subsidiaries are denominated in different currencies. In order to mitigate against this risk, in recent years we have attempted to offset a portion of our foreign currency revenue by matching the currency of revenue with the currency of expense. For example, if revenue for a particular product is in U.S. dollars, we attempt to purchase the supplies and resources used to produce that product in U.S. dollars. We also enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge portions of our transactional exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies as compared to the Japanese yen. Nevertheless, we remain exposed to the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations. 11 Table of Contents Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and Information. We rely on monthly financial data from operating segments that are not prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis and are not comparable between segments, which potentially reduces the usefulness of this data to us in making management decisions. We assess our performance and make operating decisions based on financial information received from the fourteen operating segments that we report in our consolidated financial statements: Nidec Corporation, Nidec Electronics (Thailand) Co., Ltd., Nidec (Dalian) Limited, Nidec Taiwan Corporation, Nidec Singapore Pte. Ltd., Nidec Philippines Corporation, Sankyo Seiki Mfg. Co., Ltd., Nidec Copal Corporation, Nidec Tosok Corporation, Nidec Copal Electronics Corporation, Nidec Shibaura Corporation, Nidec-Shimpo Corporation, Nidec Power Motor Corporation and Nisshin Kohki Co., Ltd. This segmental information is prepared in accordance with the accounting principles in each segments respective country of domicile. For example, Nidec Corporations operating profit or loss is determined using Japanese GAAP while Nidec Singapore Pte. Ltd. applies Singaporean accounting principles. Therefore, our segmental data has not been prepa red under U.S. GAAP on a basis that is consistent with the consolidated financial statements or on any other single basis that is consistent between segments. In addition, year-end closing adjustments and other items are not included in segment totals. These aspects of our segment data could make it more difficult for us to evaluate the relative performance of individual segments and our overall operations in a timely manner, as compared with segment data compiled on a uniform U.S. GAAP basis. We rely on production in developing countries which may become politically or economically unstable and face risks affecting international operations We produce and sell a large percentage of our products at locations in the following developing countries: China, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. In particular, we are growing increasingly reliant on our production bases in China, where we continue to move manufacturing operations in order to take advantage of more competitive production and supply costs. These countries are still in the process of developing their economic, social and other infrastructures and are susceptible to various uncertainties. The political, social and economic situations of these countries may not continue to provide an environment in which we would be able to continue to manufacture our products cost-efficiently or at all. The governmental authorities of those areas may impose regulations or restrictions that would make it difficult, impractical or impossible, whether economically, legally or otherwise, for us to conduct our business there. Dependence on overseas production, especially in developing countries, and managing international operations expose us to a number of additional risks associated with foreign commerce, including the following: • economic slowdown or downturn in the relevant industries in foreign markets; • international currency fluctuations; • general strikes or other disruptions in working conditions; • political instability (recently for example, terrorist activities); • trade restrictions or changes in tariffs; • outbreaks, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or avian flu, that inhibit international or regional commerce • the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations; • generally longer receivables collection periods; • unexpected changes in or imposition of new legislative or regulatory requirements; 12 Table of Contents Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and Information. • relatively limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; • potentially adverse taxes; and • any or all of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may become subject to more stringent environmental regulations in the future Our operations and manufacturing processes are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations in Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore, Japan, the United States and other countries in which we have production facilities. These regulations may become more stringent over time. In such a case, the amount of capital expenditures and other expenses which might be required to complete remedial actions and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws could increase and be significant, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely on our founder, President and CEO, Mr. Shigenobu Nagamori, the loss of whom could have a material adverse effect on our business Our continued success will depend to a significant extent on the efforts and abilities of our founder and current President and CEO, Mr. Shigenobu Nagamori. Mr. Nagamori is actively engaged in our management and determines our strategic direction, especially with regard to acquisition activity. While we are in the process of establishing a management structure designed to reduce our dependence on Mr. Nagamori, his sudden departure or reduced attention to us could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and operating results. For our business to continue effectively, we will need to attract and retain qualified personnel Our business depends on the continued employment of our senior management, engineering and other technical personnel, many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace. To maintain our current market position and support future growth, we will need to hire, train, integrate and retain significant numbers of additional highly skilled managerial, engineering, manufacturing, sales, marketing, support and administrative personnel. Competition worldwide for such personnel is extremely intense, and there can be no assurance that we and our affiliates will be able to attract and retain such additional personnel. A substantial number of our shares of common stock are eligible for future sale, and the sale of these shares may cause our stock price to decline, even if our business is doing well As of March 31, 2005, there were 71,236,861 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, including 11,706,942 shares beneficially owned by our President and CEO, Mr. Shigenobu Nagamori, representing 16.4% of the outstanding shares. These shares and, generally, the shares owned by other shareholders, can be disposed of on the Osaka Securities Exchange Co., Ltd., the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc. and otherwise in Japan. Additional sales of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities. Also, in the future, we may issue securities to raise cash for additional capital expenditures, working capital, research and development or acquisitions. For example, we issued 5,600,000 shares to raise cash during the fiscal yea r ended March 31, 2005. We may also pay for interests in additional subsidiary or affiliated companies by using cash, common stock or both. We may also issue securities convertible into our common stock. Any of these events may dilute your ownership interest in us and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. 13 Table of Contents Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and Information. Japans unit share system imposes restrictions in holdings of our common stock that do not constitute whole units Pursuant to the Commercial Code of Japan relating to joint stock corporations and certain related legislation, our Articles of Incorporation provide that 100 shares of our stock constitute one unit. The Commercial Code imposes significant restrictions and limitations on holdings of shares that constitute less than a whole unit. In general, holders of shares constituting less than a unit do not have the right to vote, institute derivative actions or examine our accounting books and records. The transferability of our shares constituting less than one unit is significantly limited. Under the unit share system, holders of shares constituting less than a unit have the right to require us to purchase their shares. However, holders of ADSs that represent other than multiples of whole units cannot withdraw the underlying shares representing less than one unit and, therefore, they will be unable to exercise the right to requi re us to purchase the underlying shares. As a result, holders of ADSs representing shares in lots of less than one unit may not have access to the Japanese markets to sell their shares through the withdrawal mechanism. Rights of shareholders under Japanese law may be more limited than under the laws of other jurisdictions Our Articles of Incorporation, Regulations of the Board of Directors and the Japanese Commercial Code govern our corporate affairs. Legal principles relating to such matters as the validity of corporate procedures, directors and officers fiduciary duties and shareholders rights may be different from those that would apply if we were a non-Japanese company. Shareholders rights under Japanese law may not be as extensive as shareholders rights under the laws of other countries or jurisdictions within the United States. You may have more difficulty in asserting your rights as a shareholder than you would as a shareholder of a corporation organized in another jurisdiction. In addition, Japanese courts may not be willing to enforce liabilities against us in actions brought in Japan which are based upon the securities laws of the United States or any U.S. state. A holder of our ADSs will have fewer rights than a shareholder has and will have to act through the depositary to exercise those rights The rights of the shareholders under Japanese law to take actions including voting their shares, receiving dividends and distributions, bringing derivative actions, examining the companys accounting books and records and exercising appraisal rights are available only to holders of record. Because the depositary, through its custodian agent, is the record holder of the shares underlying the ADSs, only the depositary can exercise those rights in connection with the deposited shares. The depositary will make efforts to vote the shares underlying ADSs as instructed by the ADS holder and will pay to ADS holders the dividends and distributions collected from us. However as an ADS holder you will not be able to bring a derivative action, examine our accounting books and records or exercise appraisal rights in your capacity as ADS holder. Because of daily price range limitations under Japanese stock exchange rules, you may not be able to sell your shares of our common stock at a particular price on any particular trading day, or at all Stock prices on Japanese stock exchanges are determined on a real-time basis by the equilibrium between bids and offers. These exchanges are order-driven markets without specialists or market makers to guide price formation. To prevent excessive volatility, these exchanges set daily upward and downward price fluctuation limits for each stock, based on the previous days closing price. Although transactions may continue at the upward or downward limit price if the limit price is reached on a particular trading day, no transactions may take place outside these limits. Consequently, an investor wishing to sell at a price above or below the relevant daily limit may not be able to sell his or her shares at such price on a particular trading day, or at all. 14 Table of Contents Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and Information. Foreign exchange fluctuations may affect the dollar value of our ADSs and dividends payable to holders of our ADSs Market prices for our ADSs may fall if the value of the yen declines against the U.S. dollar. In addition, the U.S. dollar amount of cash dividends and other cash payments made to holders of our ADSs would be reduced if the value of the yen declines against the U.S. dollar. It may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or our Directors or Corporate Auditors or to enforce against us or these persons judgments obtained in United States courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States We are a limited liability, joint-stock corporation incorporated under the laws of Japan. Most of our Directors and Corporate Auditors reside in Japan. All or substantially all of our assets and the assets of these persons are located in Japan and elsewhere outside the United States. It may not be possible, therefore, for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or these persons or to enforce against us or these persons judgment obtained in United States courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. Our Japanese counsel, Tokyo Aoyama Aoki Law Office, has advised us that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Japan, in original actions for enforcement of judgments of United States courts, of liabilities predicated solely upon the federal securities laws of the United States. 15 Table of Contents Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and Information. Special Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements This annual report contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about our business, our industry and capital markets around the world. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties.
