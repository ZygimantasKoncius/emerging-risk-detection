Item 1A Risk Factors - Continued Customers May Default on the Repayment of Loans. The Banks customers may default on the repayment of loans, which may negatively impact the Companys earnings due to loss of principal and interest income. Increased operating expenses may result from the allocation of management time and resources to the collection and work-out of the loan. Collection efforts may or may not be successful causing the Bank to write off the loan or repossess the collateral securing the loan which may or may not exceed the balance of the loan. The Companys Controls and Procedures May Fail or Be Circumvented. Management regularly reviews and updates the Companys internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, no matter how well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the Companys controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations and financial conditions.
