Risk Factors." We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue recognition, including price protection, rebates and other customer programs; and Valuation allowance and accrued liabilities, including sales returns and other allowances, inventory reserves, warranty accruals, the allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred tax asset valuation allowances. Revenue Recognition Product Revenues We derive revenues from sales of our digital media products, which are comprised of flash memory devices, through our retail channels and from sales of digital media accessories and other components 52 through our OEM channel. We sell our products to distributors, retailers, OEMs and end users. We use significant management judgments and estimates in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period. Our policy is to recognize revenue from sales to our customers when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customers, when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. With respect to sales to OEMs and end users, we do not grant return rights, price protection or other sales incentives. Accordingly, we recognize product revenue upon delivery if our revenue recognition criteria described above are met. With respect to sales to distributors and retailers (collectively referred to herein as "resellers"), we grant significant return rights, price protection and pricing adjustments subsequent to initial product shipment. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2004, for resellers where we were able to reasonably estimate the level of product returns and sales incentives, we recognized revenue upon shipment ("ship-to" basis) and, at the time revenue was recorded, we recorded estimated reductions to product revenues based upon our customer sales incentive programs and the historical experience of the product returns, and the impact of the special pricing agreements, price protection, promotions and other volume-based incentives. In order to make such estimates, we analyzed historical returns, current economic conditions, customer demand and other relevant specific customer information. For resellers where we were unable to reasonably estimate the level of product returns or other revenue allowances, revenue and cost of product revenues were deferred until these resellers either sold the product to their customers or a time period that is reasonably estimated to allow these resellers to sell the product to their customers had elapsed. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2004, we determined that due to the high volatility of prices in the retail market during the period, we were no longer able to reasonably estimate the level of revenue allowances and product returns, and accordingly, we became unable to determine the selling price of our product at the time the sale took place. As a result, effective October 1, 2004, for all our resellers, revenue and cost of product revenues are deferred until these resellers either sell the product to their customers or a time period that is reasonably estimated to allow these resellers to sell the product to their customers has elapsed. At no point do we recognize revenues or cost of product revenues while deferring product margin. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer and distributor incentive programs and offerings, including price protection, promotions, co-op advertising, and other volume-based incentives and expected returns. Additionally, we have incentive programs or rebates that require us to estimate, based on historical experience, the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Marketing development programs are either recorded as a reduction to revenue or as an addition to marketing expense in compliance with the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, of the Financial Standards Accounting Board, or FASB, on Issue 01-09. License and Royalty Revenues We recognize license revenue when we have a signed license agreement, the technology has been delivered, there are no remaining significant obligations under the contract, the fee is fixed or determinable and non-refundable and collectibility is reasonably assured. If we agree to provide support to the licensee under the agreement we recognize license fees ratably over the period during which the support is expected to be provided independent of the payment schedule under the license agreement. When royalties are based on the volume of products sold that incorporate our technology, revenue is recognized in the period license sales are reported. We actively enforce our patented technologies and aggressively pursue third parties that are utilizing our intellectual property without a license or who have under-reported the amount of royalties 53 owed under license agreements with us. As a result of such activities, from time to time, we may recognize royalty revenues that relate to infringements that occurred in prior periods. These royalty revenues may cause revenues to be higher than expected during a particular reporting period and may not occur in subsequent periods. Differences between amounts initially recognized and amounts subsequently determined as an adjustment to those amounts are recognized in the period such adjustment is determined as a change in accounting estimate. Valuation Allowances and Accrued Liabilities Valuation of Inventory Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost includes materials, labor and other overhead costs. Determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments, including average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods. We primarily utilize estimated selling prices for measuring any potential declines in market value below cost. Any write-down of inventory to reduce carrying value to lower of cost or market value is charged to cost of product revenues. We perform comprehensive, detailed quarterly analyses of our inventory to identify all excess and slow moving products to be written off based on current forecasts, which takes into account our knowledge of and expectations of industry and product developments. We estimate any write-downs to inventory to reduce its carrying value to its lower of cost or market value based on current and expected selling prices over the period that the related inventory is expected to be sold. Inventory write-downs are recorded as cost of product revenues. Changes to increase the inventory valuation reserve for lower of cost or market provision or excess and obsolete inventory provision are charged to cost of product revenues. At the point of this loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. If this lower-costed inventory is subsequently sold, the related allowance is matched to the movement of related product inventory, resulting in lower costs and higher gross margins for those products. During 2003, 2004 or 2005, the effect of the sale or disposition of previously written down inventory on our gross margin percentage was not significant. We operate in an industry that is characterized by intense competition, supply shortages or oversupply, rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, declining average selling prices and rapid product obsolescence. If actual product demand or selling prices are less favorable than we estimate, we may be required to take additional inventory write-downs. Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes, which involve estimating our actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes, such as deferred revenue. These differences have resulted in a net deferred tax asset. Our judgment is required to assess the likelihood that the net deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income. We have determined that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realizable. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been recorded against the net deferred tax asset. In the event management determines that it has become more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be made, which would increase income and additional paid in capital in the period such determination is made. As of December 31, 2005, we had a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $96.3 million of which $21.2 million is attributable to stock option plans, the benefit from which will be credited to additional paid in capital when recognized. 54 Other Valuation Allowances and Accrued Liabilities We maintain accruals and allowances for returns, warranty and sales related discounts such as price protection, market development funds and cooperative marketing programs and rebates. We provided for returns, warranty and sales related discounts amounting to $55.1 million, $120.8 million, and $100.0 million during 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively. At December 31, 2004 and 2005, we had related accruals and allowances of $56.3 million, and $47.3 million, respectively. Price protection, market development funds and cooperative marketing programs, rebates and other discounts are provided for at the time the associated revenue is recognized. If market conditions were to change adversely, we may take actions to increase our customer incentive offerings, which could result in increased accruals and allowances for these programs. Historically, warranty expenses have not been material. In the event that a problem is identified that would result in the need to replace a product or products on a large scale, such an event will result in charges that would be recorded in the determination of net income (loss) in the period in which the additional cost is identified and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. In the second quarter of 2005, in collaboration with Canon, we identified a lost image condition found to be rare and specific to select Canon cameras when used with CompactFlash cards, including our own. To ensure compatibility, we offered to rework our Professional 80x CompactFlash cards and Canon offered a camera firmware update to address issues experienced with other cards for customers who experienced the problem with the identified Canon cameras. We and Canon continue to work together to ensure compatibility across product lines. The total estimated cost to rework the affected products is expected to be approximately $0.9 million, all of which was provided for in the second quarter of 2005. Aggregate costs incurred to rework the affected products have been $0.3 million through December 31, 2005. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. At December 31, 2004, and 2005, we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $1.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, an increase in the allowance may be required. Results of Operations In view of the rapidly changing nature of our market and our operating history, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our revenues and other operating results are not necessarily meaningful, and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance. Our historic revenue growth rates are not necessarily indicative of our future growth. 55 Revenues, Cost of Product Revenues and Gross Margin The following table sets forth revenues, cost of product revenues and gross margin amounts from our consolidated statements of operations: Year ended December 31, 2003 Year ended December 31, 2004 Year ended December 31, 2005 % Change 2003 to 2004 % Change 2004 to 2005 Retail $ 349,030 $ 623,903 $ 639,965 78.8 % 2.6 % OEM 45,532 50,702 196,721 11.4 % 288.0 % Product revenues 394,562 674,605 836,686 71.0 % 24.0 % License and royalty revenues 17,703 7,066 16,037 (60.1 )% 127.0 % Total net revenues 412,265 681,671 852,723 65.3 % 25.1 % Cost of product revenues 306,817 644,857 755,170 110.2 % 17.2 % Gross margin 105,448 36,814 97,553 (65.1 )% 165.0 % Product gross margin $ 87,745 $ 29,748 $ 81,516 (66.1 )% 174.0 % The following table sets forth revenues, cost of product revenues and gross margin amounts from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of total net revenues: Year ended December 31, 2003 Year ended December 31, 2004 Year ended December 31, 2005 Retail 84.7 % 91.5 % 75.0 % OEM 11.0 % 7.5 % 23.1 % Product revenues 95.7 % 99.0 % 98.1 % License and royalty revenues 4.3 % 1.0 % 1.9 % Total net revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of product revenues 74.4 % 94.6 % 88.6 % Gross margin 25.6 % 5.4 % 11.4 % The following table sets forth cost of product revenues and product gross margin amounts from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of product revenues: Year ended December 31, 2003 Year ended December 31, 2004 Year ended December 31, 2005 Retail 88.5 % 92.5 % 76.5 % OEM 11.5 % 7.5 % 23.5 % Product revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of product revenues 77.8 % 95.6 % 90.3 % Gross product margin 22.2 % 4.4 % 9.7 % Revenues Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004 Revenues through our retail channel increased $16.1 million in 2005 compared to 2004 as we experienced a 44.3% decline in our average gross selling price per megabyte of digital media, which was partially offset by a 74.3% increase in megabytes sold. The increase in megabytes sold was due to the 54.2% increase in the average capacity per digital media unit sold in the retail and OEM channels 56 along with a 13.0% increase in digital media units sold in 2005 compared with 2004. Revenues from our OEM channel increased $146.0 million to $196.7 million, in 2005 compared to $50.7 million in 2004. During 2005, our product revenue related to sales to resellers decreased to 76.5% as a percentage of our total product revenue as a result of our focus on profitability, compared to 92.5% of our revenues in 2004. We expect that the average capacity and number of units of digital media sold will continue to increase in 2006 and that the average gross selling price per megabyte of our digital media will decline between 40% to 45% during the whole of 2006. We expect a decrease in our sales of other components in the first quarter of 2006. In 2005, we derived 62.8%, 13.7%, 2.8% and 20.7% of our product revenues from sales to customers in North America, Europe, Japan and the rest of the world, respectively. In 2004, we derived 65.5%, 22.6%, 3.0% and 8.9% of our product revenues from sales to customers in North America, Europe, Japan and the rest of the world, respectively. During 2005, gross revenues from one customer, Walmart, represented approximately 20% of our gross revenues. We generate license and royalty revenues primarily from our agreements with licensees under which we license the use of our intellectual property. Our license and royalty revenues increased to $16.0 million in 2005 from $7.1 million in 2004, primarily due to increased volumes under our current license agreements with Sony and Samsung and our expanded licensing agreement with Samsung. During October 2005, we entered into an agreement that extended the term of the original Samsung license agreement for five years through March 2011 and significantly expanded the scope of the original license agreement to cover Samsung products that were not previously included in the original license. As a result, we received significant licensing payments during the fourth quarter of 2005 and in the first quarter of 2006. As these payments relate to additional rights granted during the term of the original license agreement, these payments will not recur after the first quarter of 2006. The payments received under this agreement are being recognized over a 3 year period beginning in November 2005. This period corresponds to the estimated period over which we expect to provide support to the licensee. We will continue to seek new licensing opportunities in 2006 and beyond. We expect license and royalty revenue in 2006 to be in the rage of $18 to $25 million. Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003 Starting in the fourth quarter of 2004, we determined that due to the recent high volatility of prices in the retail market, we were no longer able to reasonably estimate the level of revenue allowances and product returns, and accordingly, we became unable to determine the selling price of our products at the time the sale took place. As a result, effective October 1, 2004, for all of our resellers, revenues and the cost of product revenues were deferred until these resellers either sold the product to their customers or a time period that was reasonably estimated to allow these resellers to sell the product to their customers had elapsed. The change in the timing of recognizing revenue related to all resellers on a sell-through basis, some of which were previously recognized on a sell-to basis, had the initial one-time effect of reducing net revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 by $63.6 million. Increased sales of our flash memory products in the retail channel were the major factor for the significant growth in our product revenues in 2004. Increased sales into the retail market continued to introduce an element of seasonality to our business. For example, retail sales were very strong in both the fourth quarters of 2003 and 2004 due to seasonal consumer demand during the holidays. We experienced a 78.8% increase in retail channel revenue in 2004 compared with 2003 due to increased demand. In the OEM channels we increased 11.4%over 2003 revenues. In 2004, we derived 65.5%, 22.6%, 3.0% and 8.9% of our product revenues from sales to customers in North America, Europe, Japan and the rest of the world, respectively. In 2003, we derived 57 72.2%, 17.2%, 4.7% and 5.9% of our product revenues from sales to customers in North America, Europe, Japan and the rest of the world, respectively. During 2004, gross revenues from one customer, Wal-Mart (including Sam's Club), represented greater than 15% of our gross revenues. We generate license and royalty revenues primarily from our agreement with Samsung under which we license the use of our intellectual property. Our license and royalty revenues decreased from $17.7 million in 2003 to $7.1 million in 2004 due to license and royalty revenues from Samsung becoming variable in April 2004 as we generated minimal variable-based royalties in 2004 under this agreement. Cost of Product Revenues Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004 Cost of product revenues increased during 2005 compared to 2004 primarily as a result of a 74.3% increase in megabytes sold and was partially offset by a 46.4% decline in the cost per megabyte of digital media sold in 2005 compared to 2004. Cost of product revenues also includes the write down of fixed assets of $1.0 million in 2005, the write-down of inventories totaling $31.0 million in 2005 compared to $17.4 million in 2004, to net realizable value. Cost of product revenues in 2005 benefited from a one time negotiated cost settlement with a supplier which resulted in a benefit of $10.8 million. We value our inventory at the lower of cost or market. We factor in expected average sale prices and market data to arrive at our net realizable value. End of life analysis is done based on a six month forecast of product usage, and write downs are taken as appropriate. We cannot predict future adjustments which may need to be taken if forecasts change or pricing pressure continues. Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003 The increase in cost of product revenues was primarily the result of both a 54.4% increase in the number of digital media units sold due to increased demand and a 45.5% increase in the average capacity per digital media unit sold. In addition, costs of revenues in 2004 were impacted by an increase in inventory valuation reserve of $17.4 million. These factors were partially offset by a 30.3% decline in the average cost per megabyte of digital media sold in 2004 compared to 2003. Gross Margin Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004 The increase in gross margin to 11.4% for 2005 compared to 5.4% for 2004 was primarily due to the 5.3 percentage point increase in gross product margin to 9.7% in 2005 compared to 4.4% in 2004. This improvement was primarily the result of the 46.4% decline in the cost per megabyte of digital media sold in 2005 compared to 2004, which was partially offset by the 44.3% decline in our average gross selling price per megabyte of digital media. The growth in revenue from sales of controllers, digital media accessories and other components contributed to the increased gross margin improvement. Gross margin for 2005 was negatively impacted by the write-down of inventories by $31.0 million or 3.6 percentage points compared with $17.4 million or 2.6 percentage points for 2004. Additionally, gross margin for 2005 includes the impact of a one-time negotiated cost settlement with a supplier in the second quarter of 2005, which resulted in a benefit reflected in gross margin of $10.8 million, or 1.3 percentage points. Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003 The decrease in gross margin percentage for product revenues was primarily the result of the 44.2% decline in the average gross selling price per megabyte of digital media sold partially offset by the 30.3% decline in average cost per megabyte of digital media unit sold. Gross margin in 2004 was 58 also impacted by the increase in inventory valuation reserve of $17.4 million and the sale of inventories that had previously been written off by approximately $0.6 million in 2004. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth operating expense data from our consolidated statements of operations (in thousands, except percent changes): Year ended December 31, 2003 Year ended December 31, 2004 Year ended December 31, 2005 % Change 2003 to 2004 % Change 2004 to 2005 Research and development $ 8,148 $ 10,530 $ 13,051 29.2 % 23.9 % Sales and marketing 32,623 67,000 68,273 105.4 % 1.9 % General and administrative 20,056 32,281 44,120 61.0 % 36.7 % Total operating expenses $ 60,827 $ 109,811 $ 125,444 80.5 % 14.2 % The following table sets forth operating expenses from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of total net revenues: Year ended December 31, 2003 Year ended December 31, 2004 Year ended December 31, 2005 Research and development 2.0 % 1.5 % 1.5 % Sales and marketing 7.9 % 9.9 % 8.0 % General and administrative 4.9 % 4.7 % 5.2 % Total operating expenses 14.8 % 16.1 % 14.7 % Research and Development The increase in research and development expenses for 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to the $1.0 million increase in outside services and project materials and $0.9 million increase in compensation expenses as a result of hiring additional personnel to support new product development initiatives, and an increase of $0.3 million in depreciation. The increase in research and development expenses for 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to the $1.5 million increase in compensation expenses as a result of hiring additional personnel and $1.0 million in project materials to support existing products and new product development initiatives including controllers for new flash memory types and form factors as well as new flash products. Sales and Marketing The increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to an increase of $5.5 million in compensation expenses due to increased headcount, increase in occupancy costs of $0.5 million and increased travel and entertainment costs of $0.5 million. These amounts were partially offset by a decrease of $2.5 million in marketing development fees, $1.4 million in commission costs, and $1.9 million in advertising and tradeshow expenses. The increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2004 compared to 2003 was due to increased sales, which resulted in increases of $12.8 million in freight and fulfillment expenses, $7.8 million in market development expenses, and $6.3 million in compensation expenses. The increase in compensation expenses was due to both increased headcount and increased variable selling expenses. In addition, there were increases of $3.1 million in advertising expenses, $2.3 million in promotional and other marketing costs, $0.8 million in travel expenses, $0.4 million in outside service expenses, and $0.4 million in project materials and sample expenses. 59 General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative expenses for 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to an increase of $3.1 million in compensation expenses as a result of hiring additional key personnel, $6.5 million in increased legal fees, of which $0.9 million was in settlement of a class action lawsuit and the remainder related to our patent infringement litigation, $0.9 million in increased accounting fees primarily as a result of costs associated with regulatory requirements related to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and audit costs. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to an increase of $5.9 million in legal expenses in connection with our ongoing litigation and a $2.9 million increase in costs associated with regulatory requirements related in part to compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The increase was also due to increases of $0.5 million in compensation expenses, $0.5 million in computer expenses, $0.4 million in outside service expenses, $0.4 million in outside shareholder cost, $0.4 million in insurance expense and $0.3 million in travel expenses. Income Taxes The following table sets forth income tax data from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of total net revenues (in thousands, except percent changes): Year ended December 31, 2003 Year ended December 31, 2004 Year ended December 31, 2005 % Change 2003 to 2004 % Change 2004 to 2005 Income taxes $ 4,186 $ 1,353 $ 5,473 (67.7 )% 304.5 % Income tax expense for 2005 relates primarily to foreign withholding taxes of $3.8 related to license and royalty payments and foreign withholding taxes of $1.8 million on a payment received from a supplier. Income tax expense for 2004 includes $0.3 million related to federal and state income taxes and $1.1 million in foreign income taxes (including $0.2 million related to income derived from foreign license revenue). Income tax expense for 2003 includes $2.5 million related to state income taxes, which resulted primarily from the State of California's decision during the third quarter of 2002 to retroactively suspend the state income tax net operating loss deduction for a two-year period, $1.0 million in foreign income taxes and $0.7 million in federal alternative minimum taxes. At December 31, 2005, for federal, state, and foreign income tax reporting purposes we had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $160 million, $104 million, and $2 million, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. At December 31, 2005, we had federal research credits and state research credits of approximately $2.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively, available to offset future taxes. The federal operating loss and research credit carry forwards will begin to expire in 2011 if not utilized. The state operating loss carry forwards begin to expire in 2006 if not utilized. The state research credits have no expiration date. The foreign operating loss carry forward will begin to expire in 2010, if not utilized. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company. In the event we have a change in ownership, as defined in the Tax Reform Act, utilization of the carry forwards could be restricted. 60 Other Income and Expense The following table sets forth other income and expense data from our consolidated statements of operations: Year ended December 31, 2003 Year ended December 31, 2004 Year ended December 31, 2005 % Change 2003 to 2004 % Change 2004 to 2005 Other income (expense): Interest and other expense $ (429 ) $ (961 ) $ (4,675 ) 124.0 % 386.5 % Interest and other income 580 855 2,182 47.4 % 155.2 % Foreign exchange gain (loss) (674 ) (1,074 ) (331 ) 59.3 % (69.2 )% Total other income (expense) $ (523 ) $ (1,180 ) $ (2,824 ) (125.6 )% 139.3 % Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004 In 2005, interest and other expense consisted primarily of interest on our convertible notes payable ($3.4 million), miscellaneous taxes and interest on short-term borrowings ($0.9 million). Interest and other expense for 2004 consisted primarily of interest on short-term borrowings ($0.4 million) and miscellaneous taxes. Interest and other income for 2005 increased compared to 2004, due to increased cash and cash equivalent balances resulting primarily from the proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes and higher interest rates. Foreign exchange loss, net decreased $0.8 million to $0.3 million in 2005 compared to $1.1 million in 2004. These losses were primarily attributable to our sales activity into European and Japanese markets, which exposed us to fluctuations in foreign currencies including the British pound, Euro and Japanese yen. During both 2005 and 2004 we entered into designated foreign currency exchange forward contracts to mitigate these exposures. Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003 Interest and other expense for 2004 and 2003 consisted primarily of interest on short-term borrowings and miscellaneous taxes. The increase in interest and other expense for 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to higher bank debt and bank fees in 2004 compared to 2003. Interest and other income for 2004 and 2003 consisted primarily of interest on our cash balances and on short-term investments. The increase in interest and other income for 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to higher average cash balances in 2004 compared to 2003. The net foreign exchange loss for 2004 and 2003 was primarily attributable to our sales activity into European and Japanese markets, which exposed us to fluctuations in foreign currencies including the British pound, Euro and Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar in each of the periods. During both 2004 and 2003, we entered into designated foreign currency exchange hedging contracts to mitigate these exposures. 61 Quarterly Results of Operations The following table sets forth quarterly statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. This quarterly information has been derived from our unaudited financial statements and, in the opinion of management, includes all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods covered. The quarterly data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period.

In addition, the fourth quarter of 2004 cost of product revenues includes inventory valuation adjustments of $15.8 million. 2.In the second quarter of 2005, cost of product revenues includes a benefit of $10.8 million in connection with a one-time negotiated cost settlement with a supplier. 3.In the fourth quarter of 2004 and 2005 cost of product revenues includes increases in inventory valuation reserves of $12.5 million and $14.2 million, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table is a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: Year ended December 31, 2003 Year ended December 31, 2004 Year ended December 31, 2005 Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (16,247 ) $ (115,750 ) $ 58,820 Net cash used in investing activities (2,095 ) (16,304 ) (614 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 86,655 43,515 84,046 62 The following table sets forth our days sales outstanding and inventory turns per year: 2003 2004 2005 Days sales outstanding (net of change in deferred revenue) 40 49 38 Inventory turns per year 8 7 7 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 included non-cash charges of $41.1 million and a net decrease in operating asset and liability accounts of $53.9 million. Non-cash charges were comprised primarily of the $31.0 million provision to record inventory at net realizable value where selling price declines along with excess and obsolete inventories required write-downs of our inventories. Other non-cash charges include $4.7 million of depreciation and amortization, $3.8 million in allowances, sales returns, discounts and doubtful accounts, and $1.0 million loss on disposal of fixed assets. Changes in operating asset and liability accounts for the period included a $61.1 million decrease in account receivable, a $47.0 million decrease in accounts payable, a $27.8 million decrease in inventories, a $4.6 million increase in deferred license revenue and product margin, a $3.3 million increase in accrued liabilities and a $4.1 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets. The decrease in accounts receivable, reflected in the decrease in our day sales outstanding ("DSO"), was primarily due to shorter than average payment terms associated with our OEM sales and the payments received in the fourth quarter of 2005 in connection with license and royalty revenues. We anticipate that DSO in 2006 will range between 40 to 50 days. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to decreased receipts of inventory and the timing of payment for such inventories in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to the fourth quarter of 2004. These same factors resulted in decreased inventory levels at the end of 2005 compared with inventory levels at the end of 2004. The increase in accrued liabilities was due primarily to the increase in sales related rebates, price protection and other sales incentives offset by the decrease in accrued freight and fulfillment of $4.4 million due to improved cost structure and improved logistics management and the decrease in accrued rebates payable of $6.5 million due to improved rebate program management. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets was primarily due to the timing of settlement of value added tax receivables and lower prepayments for inventory due to lower purchases of inventory. Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 included a net increase in operating asset and liability accounts of $64.0 million, which was partially offset by non-cash charges of $23.7 million comprised of recording $17.4 million of inventory valuation reserves primarily due to applying declining selling prices to the relatively high levels of inventory held at the end of the year, $3.2 million of increases in allowance for sales returns, discounts and doubtful accounts, $2.4 million of depreciation and amortization, $0.7 million of tax benefits related to stock plans and amortization of short term investment premium. Changes in working capital for the period included a $91.5 million increase in inventory, a $82.3 million increase in accounts receivable and a $6.7 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets. The increase in our inventory was due primarily to the increased levels of inventory required to satisfy demand for our products and the increase in consigned inventory balances of $3.2 million at December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to increased shipments of our products during 2004 and the increase in our DSO from 40 days during 2003 to 49 days in 2004 due to providing certain significant customers with 60 day payment terms during 2004. The increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was primarily due to deferred freight and fulfillment costs, increased value added tax receivables and increased prepayments made for inventory purchases and the increased balance of value added tax prepayments due to increased shipments to our European and Japanese subsidiaries. These changes in working capital were offset by a $76.5 million increase in accounts payable, a $30.1 million increase in accrued liabilities and a $9.9 million increase in deferred license revenue and product margin. The increase in accounts payable was due primarily to significantly increased inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of 2004 compared to the fourth quarter of 2003. The increase in accrued liabilities was due primarily to the increase in provisions for market development funds of $6.7 million, legal fees of $5.1 million, rebates of $11.7 million and freight and fulfillment costs of $4.0 million. The increases in 63 these provisions were primarily the result of increased gross product revenues during 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in deferred license revenue and product margin was primarily due to recording revenue from all of our retail customers on a sell-through basis beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared to 2003 when revenue for certain of our retail customers was recorded on a sell-to basis as discussed in this report under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsRevenue Recognition." Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 included net increases in working capital of $70.0 million, which were partially offset by non-cash charges of $13.9 million. Changes in working capital for the period included a $78.1 million increase in inventory, a $51.7 million increase in accounts receivable, a $15.4 million decrease in deferred license revenue and product margin and a $3.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets. The increase in our inventory was due primarily to the increased levels of inventory required to satisfy demand for our products and the increase in consigned inventory balances of $15.2 million at December 31, 2003. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to increased shipments of our products during 2003 and partially offset by an improvement in our DSO. The decrease in deferred license revenue and product margin was primarily due to amortization of deferred license revenue related to our Samsung, Sony and Olympus license agreements. The increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was primarily due to increased prepayments made for inventory purchases and the increased balance of value added tax prepayments due to increased shipments to our European and Japanese subsidiaries. These changes in working capital were offset by a $58.1 million increase in accounts payable and a $20.6 million increase in accrued liabilities. The increase in accounts payable was due primarily to increased inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of 2003. The increase in accrued liabilities was due primarily to the increase in provisions for market development funds of $6.5 million, price protection of $6.0 million and rebates of $2.5 million. The increases in these provisions were primarily the result of increased gross product revenues during 2003. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was the result of selling $9.7 million of short-term investments, which was partially offset by purchases of $4.0 million in short-term investments and $6.4 million of purchases of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was the result of purchases of short-term investments of $25.9 million, which was partially offset by proceeds from the sale and maturity of short-term investments of $18.0 million. Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2003 was the result of purchases of property and equipment. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was the result of receiving $66.3 million of net proceeds from the issuance of convertible promissory notes and $3.6 million from purchases under our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options, and $14.7 million of net borrowings under our credit facilities with Wells Fargo Bank and Wells Fargo Foothill described below, including $0.6 million of financing costs related to our bank credit facility with Wells Fargo Foothill. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily the result of drawing $40.0 million under our credit facility with Wells Fargo as described below and net proceeds of $3.1 million from stock option exercises and sales under our employee stock purchase program. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was primarily the result of raising $90.1 million of net proceeds in September 2003 through the sale of approximately 5.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of $16.50 per share in a public offering and $11.1 million from net proceeds from stock option exercises, sales under our employee stock purchase program and reduction of notes receivable from stockholders. These sources of cash were partially offset by $14.6 million from the repayment of notes payable under our credit facility. Restricted cash represents cash and cash equivalents used to collateralize standby letters of credit related to purchasing agreements with our suppliers. In April 2004, we entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank. Our credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank enabled us to borrow up to $40.0 million under a revolving line of credit note, 64 which we did on October 19, 2004. Subsequently, on February 28, 2005, we entered into a three-year asset based revolving credit facility arranged and agented by Wells Fargo Foothill, with a maximum loan commitment of $80.0 million. The actual amount available for borrowing depends upon the value of our North American accounts receivable base. On December 28, 2005, we borrowed $54.7 million under this line of credit, and the annual interest rate for borrowings under this line was 7.5%, determined using the bank's prime rate. This amount was repaid on January 3, 2006. Pursuant to the credit agreement with Wells Fargo Foothill, we must comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants. The affirmative covenants include a restriction on capital expenditures of up to $3.5 million in any fiscal year and a requirement that we report losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, commonly referred to as "EBITDA," of not more than a loss of $22.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2005, a loss of not more than $18.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, a loss of not more than $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and a loss of not more than the loss in the immediately preceding period for any trailing twelve month period thereafter. However, as of December 31, 2005, we were not subject to the foregoing affirmative covenants because our qualified cash under the agreement was in excess of $40 million, and there were no known financial covenant defaults under the agreement. We were, however, in default of one of the financial reporting affirmative covenants. Subsequent to December 31, 2005, we provided the required financial reporting information and Wells Fargo Foothill has waived the default. The negative covenants with which we must comply include, among others, limitations on indebtedness; liens; distribution or disposal of assets; changes in the nature of our business; investments; mergers or consolidations with or into third parties; restriction on payment of dividends; transactions with affiliates; and modifications to material agreements in a manner materially adverse to the lender. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, our obligations under the credit facility may become immediately due and payable. Events of default include, among others, our failure to pay our obligations under the credit facility when due; our failure to comply with any covenant set forth in the credit agreement; the attachment or seizure of a material portion of our assets; an insolvency proceeding is commenced by or against us; we are restrained from conducting any material part of our business; any judgment in excess of $250,000 is filed against us and not released, discharged, bonded against or stayed pending an appeal within 30 days; breach of any material warranty in the credit agreement; breach or termination of a material contract; or the acceleration of, or default in connection with, any indebtedness involving an aggregate amount of $250,000 or more. On March 30, 2005, we issued $60 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior convertible notes due April 1, 2010 in a private offering (the "Notes"). On May 27, 2005 we issued an additional $10 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes upon the exercise by the purchasers of their option to purchase such Notes under the same terms as the initial issuance. The Notes are unsecured senior obligations, ranking equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness, and senior in right of payment to any future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes. As a result of these issuances, we received net proceeds of $66.3 million. The Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock any time at the option of the holders of the Notes at a price equal to approximately $6.68 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, which represents a 30% premium over our closing price of $5.14 on March 29, 2005. The indenture governing the Notes (the "Indenture") provides that no holder of the Notes has the right to convert any portion of the Notes to the extent that, after giving effect to such conversion, such holder (together with such holder's affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of our common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion. Interest on the Notes will be payable on March 31 and September 30 of each year, beginning on September 30, 2005. The Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, for cash at our option beginning on April 1, 2008 at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus accrued but 65 unpaid interest, if any, up to but excluding the redemption date; provided, however, that we may only exercise such redemption right if our common stock has exceeded 175% of the conversion price of the Notes for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date upon which we deliver the notice of redemption. Upon redemption, we will be required to make a payment equal to the net present value of the remaining scheduled interest payments through April 1, 2010. Upon the occurrence of a "fundamental change," as defined in the Indenture, the holders of the Notes will have: the option to receive, if and only to the extent the holders convert their Notes into our common stock, a make-whole premium of additional shares of common stock equal to the approximate lost option time value, if any, plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, up to but excluding the conversion date; or the right to require us to purchase for cash any or all of its Notes at a repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, up to but excluding the repurchase date. The conversion rate of the Notes will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, including the following: We declare certain dividends or distributions; We effect a stock split or combination; We offer certain rights or warrants to all or substantially all our stockholders; and We purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to a tender or exchange offer under certain circumstances. Upon the occurrence of an "event of default," as defined in the Indenture, the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes or the trustee for the Notes under the Indenture shall have the right to cause the principal amount of the Notes to become due and payable immediately. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or our reorganization, the principal amount of the Notes shall automatically become due and payable immediately. On a change in control in which less then 90% of the consideration consists of shares of capital stock or American Depository Shares that are (A) listed on, or immediately after the transaction or event will be listed on, the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange, or (B) approved, or immediately after the transaction will be approved, for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market or the Nasdaq SmallCap Market and as result of such transaction or transactions the Notes become convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such publicly traded securities, the holders of the Notes will be entitled to additional consideration (the "Make-Whole Premium") equal to the principal amount of the note to be converted divided by $1,000 and multiplied by the applicable number of shares of common stock ranging from 1.37 shares to 44.90 shares depending on the stock price on the effective date of the change of control and the effective date. We currently believe that we have sufficient cash and availability under our asset based credit facility to meet our operating, capital and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in executing our business plan, achieving profitability or maintaining our existing customer base. Our cash needs are also dependent on the credit terms extended to us by our suppliers, particularly Samsung, which supplies the majority of our flash memory, as well as other suppliers. If our suppliers do not provide us with credit terms that are appropriate to meet our needs, we may have to seek alternate suppliers or additional financing. To the extent that we do not generate sufficient revenues and reduce the cost of revenues or reduce the cost of discretionary expenditures and, as a result, cash, short term investments and available credit is insufficient to satisfy liquidity requirements, additional cash may be needed to finance operating and 66 investing needs. However, depending on market conditions, any additional financing needed may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Commitments We purchase the majority of our flash memory from Samsung pursuant to a supply agreement that has been extended through March 24, 2011. Samsung has guaranteed a certain allocation of its flash memory production capacity to us. Under the supply agreement, our purchases are priced based on an agreed upon methodology and Samsung provides us with intellectual property indemnification for the products we purchase from them. Either party can terminate the supply agreement in the event of the other party's breach of the agreement or bankruptcy. We are not obligated to purchase minimum volumes of flash memory from Samsung. We also have a supply agreement with UMC under which we purchase controllers. The purchase commitment for such controllers is generally restricted to a forecasted time horizon based on a rolling forecast of our anticipated purchase orders. This agreement is in effect through December 2006. We have also entered into a supply agreement with SMI, whereby SMI supplies us with controllers for certain of our digital media products. We are obligated to provide rolling forecasts to SMI and SMI has agreed to maintain a buffer stock to meet our needs. SMI also provides us with standard warranty and indemnity protections. This agreement runs through September 2007 and may be terminated by either party in the event of the other party's bankruptcy or breach of the agreement. We depend on third party subcontractors for assembly and testing of our digital media products. We do not have long-term agreements with these subcontractors. Instead, we procure services from these subcontractors on a per-order basis. These third party subcontractors typically purchase certain components to be used in the manufacture and assembly of our digital media products. If we were to not use these components, these subcontractors may claim that the cost of these products is our responsibility. The following table outlines our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2005: Payments due by period (in thousands) Total amount committed Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years After 5 years Contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Short-term bank borrowings $ 54,723 $ 54,723 $  $  $  Senior Convertible Notes Principal 70,000   70,000  Interest 16,734 3,937 7,875 4,922  Open purchase orders with vendors and suppliers* 17,491 17,491    Operating leases 5,791 1,413 2,447 844 1,087 Standby letters of credit 5,000 5,000    Total contractual obligations and commercial commitments $ 169,739 $ 82,564 $ 14,260 $ 71,828 $ 1,087 *At any given point in time, in the normal course of business, we place cancelable purchase orders with our vendors and suppliers. We enter into partnerships programs with companies for branded products. As part of these programs, we may have royalty programs based on sales, with targets in the agreements. If these targets 67 are not met, the recourse may be termination of these programs, depending on the wording of the contract. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations as described above. We, at times, have reimbursed partners for purchases made on our behalf, where contemplated usage has not occurred. At December 31, 2005, we have accrued $2.6 million for such purchases. We may have additional liabilities for such arrangements in the future. Indemnifications We are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically these obligations arise in connection with sales contracts and license agreements under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against any losses incurred as a result of a claim by any third party with respect to our products. We also typically agree to pay any costs incurred in defense of any such claim. The terms of the indemnification obligations are generally perpetual from the effective date of the agreement. In certain cases, there are limits and exceptions to our potential liability for indemnification relating to intellectual property infringement claims. We cannot estimate the amount of potential future payments, if any, that we might be required to make as a result of these agreements. To date, the amounts required to defend indemnification claims have been insignificant. Accordingly, we have not accrued any amounts for these indemnification obligations. We have agreements whereby our directors and officers are indemnified for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is serving at our request in such capacity. The maximum amount of future payment we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have a directors' and officers' insurance policy that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of our insurance policy coverage, we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. Accordingly, we did not record any liabilities for these agreements. Warranties We provide warranties that range from one year for digital music players and the xD Picture Card to lifetime warranties for our professional products. Warranty costs are the costs to rework or scrap returned inventories. During the second quarter of 2005, in collaboration with Canon, we identified a lost image condition found to be rare and specific to select Canon cameras when used with CompactFlash cards, including our own. To ensure compatibility, we offered to rework our Professional 80x CompactFlash cards and Canon offered a camera firmware update to address issues experienced with other cards for customers who experienced a problem with the identified Canon cameras. We and Canon continue to work together to ensure compatibility across product lines. The total estimated cost to rework the affected products is expected to be approximately $0.9 million, all of which was provided for in the second quarter of 2005. Aggregate costs incurred to rework the affected products during the second and third quarter of 2005 were approximately $0.3 million. Prior to this event, warranty expenses were not material. Recent Accounting Developments In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payments", ("SFAS No. 123(R)"). SFAS No. 123(R) requires employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans to be accounted for under the fair value method, and eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, and 68 allowed under the original provisions of SFAS No. 123. SFAS No. 123(R) requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value, which is amortized to expense over the service periods. The requirements of SFAS No. 123(R) are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. SFAS No. 123(R) allows for either prospective recognition of compensation expense or retrospective recognition, which may be back to the original issuance of SFAS No. 123 or only to interim periods in the year of adoption. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.107, "Share-Based Payments," ("SAB 107"). SAB107 expresses views of the staff regarding the interaction between SFAS No. 123(R) and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides the staff's views regarding the valuation of share-based payment arrangements for public companies. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123(R). Based on options outstanding which have been granted through December 31, 2005, we estimate that additional compensation expense will range from $5.0 million to $7.0 million in 2006 (in addition to the expense recognition of the unamortized December 31, 2005 stock-based compensation balance of $9.4 million) due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). This estimated impact excludes the effect of any new options granted or terminations taking place subsequent to December 31, 2005. The overall impact on our consolidated financial statements will be dependent on the option-pricing model used to compute fair value and the inputs to that model such as volatility and expected life. Accordingly, actual stock-based compensation expense may differ materially from our current estimates. In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") Nos. FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, "The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments," which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired, whether that impairment is other-than-temporary, and the measurement of an impairment loss. This FSP also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. The FSP is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of this FSP in the first quarter of 2006 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections: a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3" ("SFAS No. 154"). SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application for voluntary changes in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to do so. Retrospective application refers to the application of a different accounting principle to previously issued financial statements as if that principle had always been used. SFAS No. 154's retrospective application requirement replaces APB No 20's ("Accounting Changes") requirement to recognize most voluntary changes in accounting principle by including in net income (loss) of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 defines retrospective application as the application of a different accounting principle to prior accounting periods as if that principle had always been used or as the adjustment of previously issued financial statements to reflect a change in the reporting entity. SFAS No. 154 also redefines "restatement" as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error. The requirements of SFAS No. 154 are effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 and will only impact the consolidated financial statements in periods in which a change in accounting principle is made. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153 ("SFAS No. 153"), "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assetsan amendment of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 29" ("APB No. 29" or the "Opinion"). The guidance in APB No. 29, "Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions", is based on the principle that gains or losses on exchanges of nonmonetary assets may be recognized based on the differences in the fair values of the assets exchanged. The guidance in that Opinion, however, included certain exceptions to that principle which allowed the asset received to be recognized at the book value of the asset surrendered. SFAS No. 153 amends APB No. 29 to eliminate the exception for 69 nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for "exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance". A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. The provisions of SFAS No. 153 should be applied prospectively, and are effective for us for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring from the third quarter of 2005. Earlier application is permitted for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in our first quarter of 2005. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting of Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations" ("FIN 47"). FIN 47 clarifies that an entity must record a liability for a "conditional" asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of 2005 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costsan amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin ("ARB") No. 43, Chapter 4" ("ARB No. 43, Chapter 4"). SFAS No. 151 amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, "Inventory Pricing," to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). Paragraph 5 of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 previously stated that "...under some circumstances, items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges...." SFAS No. 151 requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of "so abnormal." In addition, this Statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 is effective for us for inventory costs incurred beginning in 2006. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Risk. We sell our products primarily to customers in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, the Asia Pacific region, Canada, Europe and Japan. Most of our sales are currently denominated in U.S. dollars. Although the amount of our sales denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars have declined during 2005, we anticipate an increasing amount of our sales will be denominated in British pounds, Canadian dollar, Euro, and the Japanese yen. Foreign currency denominated revenues were approximately 28.3% and 17.4% of our total product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2005, respectively. We purchase our products and the materials and services to build our products primarily from vendors in Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, China, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan and Singapore. Most of these costs are currently denominated in U.S. dollars. Although the amount of our product costs denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars has declined during 2005, we anticipate an increasing amount of our costs could be denominated in the Euro, Japanese yen, pound sterling and possibly other currencies. Foreign currency denominated costs were approximately 6.4% and 2.4% of our cost of product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2005, respectively. As a result, it is possible that our future financial results could be directly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and the prices of our products would become more expensive in a particular foreign market if the value of the U.S. dollar rises in comparison to the local currency, which may make it more difficult to sell our products in that market. Conversely, the prices of our products would become less expensive in a particular foreign market if the value of the U.S. dollar falls in comparison to the local currency, which may make it easier to sell our products in that market. We will continue to face foreign currency exchange risk in the future. Therefore, our financial results could be directly affected 70 by weak economic conditions in foreign markets. These risks could become more significant as we expand business outside the U.S. or if we increase sales in non-U.S. dollar denominated currencies. We have adopted and implemented a hedging policy to mitigate these potential risks. We use forward contracts to mitigate the exposures associated with certain net foreign currency asset or liability positions. However, we cannot assure you that any policies or techniques that we have implemented, or may implement in the future, will be successful or that our business and financial condition will not be harmed by exchange rate fluctuations. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. During 2005, we entered into hedges on intercompany payables denominated in the British pound and Japanese yen. During 2005, the foreign currency exposures on our net asset and liability positions were not fully hedged. For the year ended December 31, 2004, gain on our foreign currency net asset and liability positions was $4.1 million, which was offset by net losses on hedging transactions of $5.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2005, losses on our foreign currency net asset and liability positions were $5.4 million and were offset by gains on hedging transactions of $5.1 million. As of December 31, 2005, we held forward contracts with an aggregate notional value of $40.5 million to hedge the risks associated with forecast British pound and Japanese yen denominated assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2005, our aggregate exposure to non-U.S. dollar currencies, net of currency hedge contracts, was approximately $30.0 million. If, at December 31, 2005, we applied an immediate 10% adverse move in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to these exposures, we would incur a foreign exchange loss of approximately $3.0 million. Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we earn on our investments and the amount of interest expense we pay on borrowings under our line of credit and senior convertible notes. The risk associated with fluctuating interest rates impacts all of our investments because of the short duration of the investments and our borrowings under our line of credit. Accordingly, our interest rate risk is primarily related to our short-term investments, which amounted to $2.0 million at December 31, 2005. Our interest rate risk is related only to our $54.7 million of borrowings under our line of credit facility with Wells Fargo Foothill at December 31, 2005. We do not plan to use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. We plan to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk and market risk. We plan to mitigate default risk by investing in investment-grade securities. We have historically invested in investment-grade, short-term securities that we have held until maturity to limit our market risk. All of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at December 31, 2005. Actual results may differ materially. 71 ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 1. INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following financial statements are filed as part of this Report: Page Report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent registered public accounting firm 73 Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2004 and 2005 76 Consolidated Statements of Operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 77 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 78 Consolidated Statement of Stockholders' Equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 79 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 80 2. INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES The following financial statement schedule is filed as part of this report and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements: Schedule Page II Valuation and Qualifying Accounts 119 72 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lexar Media, Inc.: We have completed integrated audits of Lexar Media, Inc.'s 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below. Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Lexar Media, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Internal control over financial reporting Also, we have audited Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, because the Company did not maintain effective controls: (i) to ensure revenue and deferred revenue were accurately recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or (ii) over the existence and valuation of inventory, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management's assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 73 external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management's assessment at December 31, 2005. Revenue recognition. The Company did not maintain effective controls to ensure revenue and deferred revenue accounts were accurately recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Specifically, the Company did not maintain effective controls to accurately: (i) account for all price reductions and promotional commitments, including rebate programs offered to customers; (ii) record deferred revenue based on actual sales price and inventory movements; (iii) record revenue and inventory adjustments for returns of product by customers; and (iv) record concessions provided to certain customers as a reduction of revenue from such customers. Accounting for Inventory. The Company did not maintain effective controls over the existence and valuation of inventory. Specifically, the Company did not maintain effective controls to: (i) accurately track, confirm and reconcile inventory movements to ensure the timely recognition of cost of product revenues; (ii) ensure the existence of inventory and the appropriate valuation of returned inventory; (iii) identify and accurately adjust inventory excess and slow moving products or components and record necessary write-downs of inventory to lower of cost or market; and (iv) accurately accrue for the obligation to purchase inventory at costs in excess of net realizable value. These control deficiencies resulted in audit adjustments to revenues, accounts receivable, cost of product revenues, deferred revenue, sales related accruals, and inventory and inventory valuation reserves and related accruals in the Company's 2005 consolidated financial statements. Additionally, these control deficiencies could result in the misstatement of the aforementioned accounts that would result in a material misstatement to the Company's annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, management has determined that these control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2005 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, management's assessment that Lexar Media, Inc. did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the COSO. 74 Also, in our opinion, because of the effects of the material weaknesses described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Lexar Media, Inc. has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the COSO. /s/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose, California March 16, 2006 75 LEXAR MEDIA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Overview Lexar Media, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the Company) was incorporated in the state of Delaware and its common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol LEXR. The Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets high-performance digital media, as well as other flash based storage products for consumer and professional markets that utilize digital media for the capture and retrieval of digital content for the digital photography, consumer electronics, computer, industrial and communications markets. Its digital media products include a variety of flash memory cards with a range of speeds, capacities and special features to satisfy the various demands of different users of flash cards. To address the growing market for compact digital data and media storage solutions, its digital media products also include its JumpDrive products, which are high-speed, portable USB flash drives for consumer applications that serve a variety of uses, including floppy disk replacement. In addition, the Company markets and sells controllers and other components to other manufacturers of flash storage media as well as digital media accessories and a variety of connectivity products that link its media products to PCs and other electronic host devices. The Company also licenses its technology to certain third parties. Many of the CompactFlash, Memory Stick and JumpDrive products that the Company manufactures incorporate its patented controller technology. Other flash cards, including the Secure Digital Card and some of its JumpDrive products, incorporate third party controllers that the Company purchases and combines with flash memory from its suppliers, which are then assembled into a flash card by its manufacturing partners. A third category of products, including the xD Picture Card, are products that the Company does not currently manufacture, but purchases and resells. A flash memory controller determines, among other things, the manner in which data is written to, and read from, the flash memory and is important in determining the overall performance of the flash card. The Company's flash memory controller technology can be applied to a variety of consumer electronic applications, such as digital music players, laptop computers, personal digital assistants, telecommunication and network devices and digital video recorders. In order to extend its technology into these markets, the Company has selectively licensed its product and technology to third parties in business sectors such as data communications, telecommunications, industrial, computing and embedded markets. The Company sells its digital media and connectivity products to end-users primarily through mass market, photo and OEM channels. The mass-market channel includes national, international and regional retailers and select corporate accounts. The Company also uses a direct sales force, as well as distributors, value-added resellers and independent sales representatives, and its website, www.lexar.com. The Company currently sells its products in the United States, Europe, Asia and other parts of the world, either directly, through its wholly owned subsidiaries located in Japan and the U.K., or through international distributors. The Company contracts with an independent foundry and assembly and testing organizations to manufacture its flash card products. This allows the Company to focus on its design efforts, minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures and gain access to advanced manufacturing capabilities. In August 2000, the Company completed its initial public offering, raising net proceeds of $53.3 million. In December 2002 and again in September 2003, the Company completed public offerings, raising net proceeds of $27.7 million and $90.1 million, respectively. In April and May, the 80 Company raised net proceeds of $66.3 million from issuing senior notes convertible into its common stock. NOTE 2SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Financial Statement Presentation The consolidated financial statements of the Company include its accounts and the accounts of its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts in the prior years' financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2005 presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on its consolidated statements of operations or stockholders' equity. Foreign Currency Translation The Company considers the local currency to be the functional currency for its international subsidiaries. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive loss. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to unsold inventories by certain nonreporting distributors and resellers, price protection, customer programs and incentives, product returns, doubtful accounts, inventory valuation reserves, warranty expenses, investments, intangible assets, income taxes and related valuation allowances, contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. These estimates and assumptions may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as the Company's operating environment changes. These changes are included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known. Differences between amounts initially recognized and amounts subsequently determined as an adjustment to those amounts are recognized in the period such adjustment is determined as a change in accounting estimate. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 81 Restricted Cash Restricted cash represents cash and cash equivalents used to collateralize standby letters of credit related to purchasing agreements with the Company's suppliers. Cash restricted under standby letters of credit amounted to $5.0 million at both December 31, 2004, and 2005. Short-Term Investments Short-term investments consist of taxable commercial paper, U.S. government agency obligations, and corporate and municipal notes and bonds with high-credit quality ratings. The Company classifies its entire investment portfolio as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and periodically reevaluates such designation. Debt securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value. Unrecognized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities are included in equity until their disposition. As of December 31, 2005, the amount of unrecognized gain related to the Company's available-for-sale investment portfolio was approximately $8,000. If realized gains and losses and declines in value are judged by management to be other than temporary on available-for-sale securities, then the cost basis of the security is written down to fair value and the amount of the write-down is included in current net income (loss). The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Fair value of available-for-sale securities is based upon quoted market prices. Gross realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005. The Company's short-term investments at December 31, 2005 consisted of highly liquid corporate debt securities of approximately $1.0 million and U.S. auction rate government obligations of approximately $1.0 million. The Company's short-term investments at December 31, 2004 included U.S. government obligations of approximately $4.0 million and corporate debt securities of approximately $3.7 million. Concentration of Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. The Company's cash and cash equivalents are maintained at leading U.S., European and Japanese financial institutions. Deposits in these institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on these deposits. The Company's accounts receivable are derived from revenues earned from customers located primarily in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Asia and Japan. The Company performs credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and, generally, requires no collateral from its customers. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectibility of accounts receivable. One customer accounted for 20% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2004. Two customers accounted for 24% and 11% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2005. Revenues from two customers represented 12% and 11% of the Company's gross revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003. Revenues from one customer represented 16% of the Company's gross revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004. Revenues from one customer represented 20% of the Company's gross revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005. Certain components necessary for the manufacture of the Company's products are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. The Company operates in an industry characterized by intense competition, supply shortages or oversupply, rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, declining average prices and rapid product obsolescence. 82 Fair Value of Financial Instruments Carrying amounts of certain of the Company's financial instruments, including cash equivalents, short-term investments, forward currency contracts, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short term bank borrowings, approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using standard costs that approximate actual cost under the first-in, first-out method. Appropriate allowances are made to reduce the value of inventories to net realizable value where this is below cost. This may occur where the Company determines that inventories may be slow moving, obsolete or excess or where the selling price of the product is expected to be insufficient to cover product costs and selling expenses. Allowances, once established, are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 1 to 5 years, as follows: Useful Life Computer and other equipment 1-3 years Engineering equipment 5 years Software 3 years Furniture, fixtures and improvements 5 years Depreciation expense related to the Company's property and equipment was $1.4 million in 2003, $2.3 million in 2004, and $4.1 million in 2005. In 2005, the Company wrote-off $827,000 in obsolete tooling equipment and changed the estimated useful of the remaining tooling equipment from 3 years to 2 years resulting in an additional amortization expense of $485,000 in the year. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Costs for internal use software are accumulated over the time it takes to develop the software and depreciation begins upon the first production use of the software. Software Development Costs Costs incurred in the research, design and development of products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established. To date, the establishment of technological feasibility of the Company's products and general release substantially coincided. As a result, the Company has not capitalized any software development costs since such costs have not been significant. Revenue Recognition Product Revenues The Company derives revenues from sales of its digital media products, which are comprised of flash memory devices, through its retail channels and from sales of digital media accessories and other components through the Company's OEM channel. The Company sells its products to distributors, retailers, OEMs and end users. The Company uses significant management judgments and estimates in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period. 83 The Company's policy is to recognize revenue from sales to its customers when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customers, when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. With respect to sales to OEMs and end users, the Company does not grant return rights, price protection or other sales incentives. Accordingly, the Company recognizes product revenue upon delivery if the Company's revenue recognition criteria described above are met. With respect to sales to distributors and retailers (collectively referred to herein as "resellers"), the Company grants, significant return rights, price protection and pricing adjustments subsequent to initial product shipment. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2004, for resellers where the Company was able to reasonably estimate the level of product returns and sales incentives, the Company recognized revenue upon shipment ("ship-to" basis) and, at the time revenue was recorded, the Company recorded estimated reductions to product revenue based upon its customer sales incentive programs and the historical experience of the product returns, and the impact of the special pricing agreements, price protection, promotions and other volume-based incentives. In order to make such estimates, the Company analyzed historical returns, current economic conditions, customer demand and other relevant specific customer information. For resellers where the Company was unable to reasonably estimate the level of product returns or other revenue allowances, revenue and cost of product revenues were deferred until these resellers either sold the product to their customers or a time period that is reasonably estimated to allow these resellers to sell the product to their customers had elapsed. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company determined that due to the high volatility of prices in the retail market during the period, the Company was no longer able to reasonably estimate the level of revenue allowances and product returns, and accordingly, the Company became unable to determine the selling price of its product at the time the sale took place. As a result, effective October 1, 2004, for all its resellers, revenue and cost of product revenues are deferred until these resellers either sell the product to their customers or a time period that is reasonably estimated to allow these resellers to sell the product to their customers has elapsed. At no point does the Company recognize revenues or cost of product revenues while deferring product margin. The Company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer and distributor incentive programs and offerings, including price protection, promotions, co-op advertising, and other volume-based incentives and expected returns. Additionally, the Company has incentive programs or rebates that require it to estimate, based on historical experience, the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Marketing development programs are either recorded as a reduction to revenue or as an addition to marketing expense in compliance with the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, of the Financial Standards Accounting Board, or FASB, on issue 01-09. License and Royalty Revenues The Company recognizes revenue when it has a signed license agreement, the technology has been delivered, there are no remaining significant obligations under the contract, the fee is fixed or determinable and non-refundable and collectibility is reasonably assured. If the Company agrees to provide support to the licensee under the agreement it recognizes license fees ratably over the period during which support is expected to be provided independent of the payment schedule under the license agreement. When royalties are based on the volume of products sold that incorporate the Company's technology, revenue is recognized in the period license sales are reported. The Company actively enforces its patented technologies and aggressively pursues third parties that are utilizing its intellectual property without a license or who have under-reported the amount of royalties owed under license agreement with it. As a result of such activities, from time to time, the Company may recognize royalty revenues that relate to infringements that occurred in prior periods. 84 These royalty revenues may cause revenues to be higher than expected during a particular reporting period and may not occur in subsequent periods. Differences between amounts initially recognized and amounts subsequently determined as an adjustment to those amounts are recognized in the period such adjustment is determined as a change in accounting estimate. Research and Development Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred. Accounting for Stock-based Compensation The Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion ("APB") No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation ("FIN") No. 44, "Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25" and FIN No. 28, "Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans," and comply with the disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," and SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure." Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is based on the difference, if any, between the estimated fair value of its common stock on the date of grant and the exercise price. SFAS No. 123 defines a "fair value" based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument. The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") 96-18, "Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services" and values awards using the Black Scholes option pricing model as of the date at which the non-employees performance is complete. The Company recognizes the fair value of the award as a compensation expense as the non-employees interest in the instrument vests. Pro forma information regarding net income (loss) per share as if its stock options, employee stock purchase plan and the restricted stock issuances had been determined based on the fair value as of the 85 grant date consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148, are as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts): Years Ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 As reported: Net income (loss) $ 39,912 $ (75,530 ) $ (36,188 ) Add: Compensation expense included in reported net income, net of taxes 497   Less: Pro forma compensation expense determined under the fair value method, net of taxes (15,376 ) (25,191 ) (26,294 ) Pro forma net income (loss) $ 25,033 $ (100,721 ) $ (62,482 ) Net income (loss) per common share  basic as reported $ 0.57 $ (0.96 ) $ (0.45 ) Net income (loss) per common share  basic pro forma $ 0.35 $ (1.28 ) $ (0.78 ) Net income (loss) per common share  diluted as reported $ 0.49 $ (0.96 ) $ (0.45 ) Net income (loss) per common share  diluted pro forma $ 0.31 $ (1.28 ) $ (0.78 ) In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payments", ("SFAS No. 123(R)"). SFAS No. 123(R) requires employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans to be accounted for under the fair value method, and eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, and allowed under the original provisions of SFAS No. 123. SFAS No. 123(R) requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value, which is amortized to expense over the service periods. The requirements of SFAS No. 123(R) are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. SFAS No. 123(R) allows for either prospective recognition of compensation expense or retrospective recognition, which may be back to the original issuance of SFAS No. 123 or only to interim periods in the year of adoption. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.107, "Share-Based Payments,"("SAB 107"). SAB107 expresses views of the SEC staff regarding the interaction between SFAS No. 123(R) and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides the SEC staff's views regarding the valuation of share-based payment arrangements for public companies. On December 7, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the acceleration of the vesting of unvested stock options outstanding as of December 7, 2005 with an exercise price equal to or greater than $9.50 per share which were held by the Company's employees, including officers and employee directors. As a result of the Board's action, these unvested stock options became fully vested and exercisable effective as of December 7, 2005, rather than becoming exercisable at the later dates when such options would have otherwise vested in the normal course. The Company's stock options have generally vested over a four-year period. In order to preserve the long-term incentive characteristic of these stock options, the Company has imposed certain sale restrictions on the shares underlying these accelerated options. Specifically, the option holder may not sell, transfer, encumber or reduce economic risk through "hedging" or similar arrangements with respect to any shares acquired upon the exercise of an accelerated option until on or after the date such options would have otherwise vested in the normal course. The intent of these selling restrictions is to restrict the option holders' ability to sell shares except in a manner consistent with the standard schedule under which the Company's stock options have customarily vested. 86 The decision to accelerate the vesting of these stock options was made primarily to reduce compensation expense that otherwise would be recorded in future periods following the Company's adoption in the first quarter of 2006 of SFAS No. 123(R) Starting January 1, 2006, the Company must recognize compensation expense over the applicable vesting period related to awards that are granted on or after January 1, 2006, and related to the unvested portion of awards granted prior to January 1, 2006. Additionally, the Company believes this decision to accelerate the vesting of these stock options further enhances the Company's focus on stockholder return and is in the best interest of the Company's stockholders. The pro forma compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2005, includes $8.3 million related to the acceleration of the vesting of 2.7 million options with a weighted average exercise price of $10.99. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123(R); however, it believes the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will result in an additional expense ranging from $5.0 million to $7.0 million in 2006 (in addition to the expense recognition of the unamortized December 31, 2005 stock-based compensation balance of $9.4 million) based on options outstanding which have been granted through December 31, 2005. This estimated impact excludes the effect of any new options granted or terminations taking place subsequent to this date. The overall impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements will be dependent on the option-pricing model used to compute fair value and the inputs to that model such as volatility and expected life. Accordingly, the actual stock based compensation expense may differ materially from the Company's estimates. The pro-forma disclosures of the impact of SFAS No. 123 provided above may not be representative of the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123(R). In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123, the fair value of each option or ESPP share is estimated using the following assumptions at the date of grant: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2003 2004 2004 2005 2005 ESPP ESPP ESPP Weighted average fair value per option $ 6.57 $ 1.59 $ 6.60 $ 2.05 $ 3.76 $ 1.91 Risk free interest rate 2.10 % 2.94 % 3.51 % 1.70 % 3.75 % 3.05 % Expected life (years) 3.6 1.75 4.11 0.8 4.04 1.25 Expected stock price volatility 92 % 88 % 92 % 87 % 91 % 88 % Dividend yield       Advertising and Market Development Costs Advertising and market development costs were charged to operations as incurred. Advertising and market development costs amounted to $38.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 of which $24.3 million was offset against revenue in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 01-09, "EITF 01-09", and $14.6 million was charged as an operating expense. Advertising and market development costs amounted to $34.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 of which $15.4 million was offset against revenue in accordance with EITF 01-09, and $19.3 million was charged as an operating expense. Advertising and market development costs amounted to $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 of which $11.3 million was offset against revenue in accordance with EITF 01-09, and $9.0 million was charged as an operating expense. Consideration generally given by the Company to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of selling price, and therefore, a reduction of revenue. However, if the Company receives an identifiable benefit in return for the consideration given to its customer that is sufficiently separable from its sales to that customer, such that the Company could have paid an independent company to receive that benefit; and the Company can reasonably estimate the fair value of that benefit, then the consideration is characterized as an expense. The Company estimates the fair value of the benefits it receives by 87 tracking the advertising done by its customers on its behalf and calculating the value of that advertising using a comparable rate for similar publications. Deferred Taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the computation of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that the Company has estimated is more likely than not to be realized. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a company during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2003 was attributable solely to the effects of foreign currency translation. Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2004 was attributable to foreign currency translation and unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities. Accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2005 was attributable to foreign currency translation and unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities. Shipping and Handling Costs Certain shipping and handling costs are included in selling and marketing costs in the statements of operations. These costs were $8.3 million in 2003, $21.5 million in 2004, and $21.7 million in 2005. Shipping and handling fees charged to customers are included in revenues. The Company defers the shipping and handling costs associated with shipments for which revenue has not yet been recognized. Deferred shipping and handling costs of $3.0 million and $1.2 million are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2005, respectively. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Intangible assets consist of goodwill and purchased patents. Patents are being amortized on a straight-line basis to operations over three years. The Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS No. 142"), on January 1, 2002. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer being amortized. Instead, goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment. Product Warranties The Company provides warranties that range from one year for digital music players and the xD Picture Card to lifetime warranties for its professional products. The Company's liability is limited at its option to replacement or rework of the product, plus any freight and delivery costs, or to refund the purchase price less any rebates. The Company usually provides a replaced or reworked product rather than a refund or credit to meet warranty obligations. This policy is necessary to protect its distributors, to improve customer satisfaction, and for competitive reasons. Additionally, it is the custom in Japan and Europe to provide this benefit. In the second quarter of 2005, in collaboration with Canon, the Company identified a lost image condition found to be rare and specific to select Canon cameras when used with certain CompactFlash cards, including its own. To ensure compatibility, the Company offered to rework its Professional 80x CompactFlash cards and Canon offered a camera firmware update to address issues experienced with other cards for customers who experienced the problem with the identified Canon cameras. The 88 Company and Canon continue to work together to ensure compatibility across product lines. The total estimated cost to rework the affected products is expected to be approximately $0.9 million, all of which was provided for in the second quarter of 2005. Aggregate costs incurred to rework the affected products at December 31, 2005 were approximately $0.3 million. Prior to this event, warranty expenses were not material. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 Balance as of the beginning of the period $ 70 $ 1,083 Provision for warranty liability for sales made during the period 1,712 1,733 Warranty costs during the period (699 ) (1,733 ) Balance as of the end of the period $ 1,083 $ 1,083 NOTE 3BALANCE SHEET DISCLOSURES (in thousands): Inventories consisted of the following: As of December 31, 2004 2005 Raw materials $ 16,981 $ 31,103 Controllers 9,848 4,969 Flash memory products 147,909 78,918 Ancillary products 2,917 2,065 $ 177,655 $ 117,055 Flash memory products included inventory on consignment at the Company's customers of $22.9 million and $21.5 million at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2005, respectively.

The Company accrues these expenses at the time the associated product revenue is recognized as sales and marketing expenses. However, to the extent that the fair market value of such promotional activities is not determined through independent valuation, the expense is recorded as a reduction in revenues. Deferred license revenue and product margin consisted of the following: As of December 31, 2004 2005 Deferred license revenue $ 691 $ 16,173 Deferred product margin 23,241 13,063 Deferred license revenue and product margin 23,932 29,236 Less: Amount classified as current liabilities 23,759 25,236 Deferred license revenue, net of current portion $ 173 $ 4,000 NOTE 4NET INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE (in thousands, except per share data): Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by giving effect to all dilutive potential common 90 shares, including options, warrants and senior convertible notes. The numerator and denominator used in the calculation of historical basic and diluted net income (loss) per share is as follows (in thousands, except per common share amounts): Years Ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 Numerator: Net income (loss) $ 39,912 $ (75,530 ) $ (36,188 ) Denominator for net income (loss) per common sharebasic: Weighted average common shares outstanding 70,674 78,869 80,119 Weighted average unvested common shares subject to repurchase (117 )   Denominator for net income (loss) per common sharebasic 70,557 78,869 80,119 Net income (loss) per common sharebasic $ 0.57 $ (0.96 ) $ (0.45 ) Denominator for net income (loss) per common sharediluted: Denominator for net income (loss) per common sharebasic 70,557 78,869 80,119 Incremental common shares attributable to exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants (assuming proceeds would be used to purchase common stock) 11,118   Weighted average unvested common shares subject to repurchase 117   Denominator for net income (loss) per common sharediluted 81,792 78,869 80,119 Net income (loss) per common sharediluted $ 0.49 $ (0.96 ) $ (0.45 ) Antidilutive Securities Securities listed below have not been included in the computations of diluted net income (loss) per share for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004, and 2005, because the inclusion of these securities would be anti-dilutive (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 Weighted average shares under options for common stock 101 18,258 20,980 Weighted average shares under senior convertible notes   7,708 Weighted average shares under warrants for common stock  41 16 NOTE 5OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION The Company follows SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," ("SFAS No. 131") During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company determined that its revenues and operations had grown and diversified such that the Company could now determine two distinct operating segments 91 driven by its revenue stream: (1) Retail and (2) OEM. In addition, the Company has license and royalty revenues. The Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), as defined by SFAS No. 131, is the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. The CODM allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about its revenue and cost of revenue. The Company does not identify or allocate operating expenses or assets by operating segment, nor does the CODM evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. Operating segments do not record intersegment revenue, and, accordingly, there is none to be reported. The Company does not allocate interest and other income, interest expense or taxes to operating segments. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for the Company as a whole.

On May 27, 2005 the Company issued an additional $10.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes upon the exercise by the purchasers of their option to purchase such Notes under the same terms as the initial issuance. The Notes are unsecured senior obligations, ranking equally in right of payment with all of the Company's existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness, and senior in right of payment to any future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes. The Notes are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock any time at the option of the holders of the Notes at a price equal to approximately $6.68 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, which represented a 30% premium over the closing price of the Company's common stock of $5.14 on March 29, 2005. The indenture governing the Notes (the "Indenture") provides that no holder of the Notes has the right to convert any portion of the Notes to the extent that, after giving effect to such conversion, such holder (together with such holder's affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the Company's common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion. Interest on the Notes is payable on March 31 and September 30 of each year, beginning on September 30, 2005. 93 The Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, for cash at the Company's option beginning on April 1, 2008 at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, up to but excluding the redemption date; provided, however, that the Company may only exercise such redemption right if its common stock has exceeded 175% of the conversion price of the Notes for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date upon which the Company delivers the notice of redemption. Upon redemption, the Company will be required to make a payment equal to the net present value of the remaining scheduled interest payments through April 1, 2010. Upon the occurrence of a "fundamental change," as defined in the Indenture, the holders of the Notes will have: the option to receive, if and only to the extent the holders convert their Notes into its common stock, a make-whole premium of additional shares of common stock equal to the approximate lost option time value, if any, plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, up to but excluding the conversion date; or the right to require the Company to purchase for cash any or all of its Notes at a repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, up to but excluding the repurchase date. The conversion rate of the Notes will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, including the following: the Company declares certain dividends or distributions; the Company effects a stock split or combination; the Company offers certain rights or warrants to all or substantially all its stockholders; the Company purchases shares of its common stock pursuant to a tender or exchange offer under certain circumstances. Upon the occurrence of an "event of default," as defined in the Indenture, the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes or the trustee for the Notes under the Indenture shall have the right to cause the principal amount of the Notes to become due and payable immediately (except in certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or the Company's reorganization, in which case the principal amount of the Notes shall automatically become due and payable immediately). On a change in control in which less then 90% of the consideration consists of shares of capital stock or American Depository Shares that are (A) listed on, or immediately after the transaction or event will be listed on, the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange, or (B) approved, or immediately after the transaction will be approved, for quotation on the Nasdaq National Market or the Nasdaq SmallCap Market and as result of such transaction or transactions the Notes become convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such publicly traded securities, the holders of the Notes will be entitled to additional consideration (the "Make-Whole Premium") equal to the principal amount of the note to be converted divided by $1,000 and multiplied by the applicable number of shares of common stock ranging from 1.37 shares to 44.90 shares depending on the stock price on the effective date of the change of control and the effective date. Total cash proceeds from these issuances of the Notes aggregated $66.3 million, net of issuance costs of $3.7 million. The issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the Notes to April 1, 2010. 94 NOTE 7SHORT TERM BANK BORROWINGS: In April 2004, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank which enabled the Company to borrow up to $40.0 million under a revolving line of credit note. All advances under this revolving line of credit note were secured by the Company's accounts receivable and other rights to payment, general intangibles, inventory, equipment and proceeds of the foregoing. The Company used the proceeds from this loan to fund working capital requirements. On February 28, 2005, the Company entered into a three-year asset based revolving credit facility arranged and agented by Wells Fargo Foothill with a maximum loan commitment of $80.0 million which replaced the previous facility. The actual amount available for borrowing depends upon the value of the Company's North American accounts receivable base. At December 31, 2005 the amount available to us under this facility was $54.7 million of which the Company borrowed $54.7 million. This facility was fully repaid subsequent to December 31, 2005. Borrowings under this facility bear interest at the Company's choice of one of two floating rates: either an annual rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.75 to 2.25 percentage points, depending on availability under the facility and the amount of its unrestricted cash, or an annual rate equal to the bank's prime rate plus 0.25 to 0.75 percentage points, depending on availability under the facility and the amount of its unrestricted cash. At December 31, 2005, the annual interest rate for borrowings under the facility was 7.5 percent determined using the bank's prime rate. The asset based credit facility with Wells Fargo Foothill is secured by substantially all of the Company's property and assets (other than leased real property), including, but not limited to, inventories, accounts receivable, equipment, chattel paper, documents, instruments, deposit accounts, cash and cash equivalents, investment property, commercial tort claims and all proceeds and products thereof. The Company did not, however, grant a security interest in its intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, copyrights, trademarks, patents and related rights, although the Company did grant a negative pledge on all such intellectual property rights. In addition, the Company pledged 65% of the common stock of each of its foreign subsidiaries as collateral to secure the asset-based facility. Pursuant to the credit agreement with Wells Fargo Foothill, the Company must comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants. The affirmative covenants include a restriction on capital expenditures of up to $3.5 million in any fiscal year and a requirement that the company reports losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, commonly referred to as "EBITDA," of not more than a loss of $22.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2005, a loss of $18.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, a loss of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and a loss of not more than the loss in the immediately preceding period for any trailing twelve month period thereafter. However, as of December 31, 2005, the Company was not subject to the foregoing affirmative covenants because its qualified cash under the agreement was in excess of $40 million, the Company had raised capital in excess of $50 million since entering into the credit facility, and there were no uncured known defaults under the agreement. The Company was, however, in default of one of the financial reporting affirmative covenants. Subsequent to December 31, 2005, the Company provided the required financial reporting information and Wells Fargo Foothill has waived the default. The negative covenants with which the Company must comply include, among others: limitations on indebtedness; liens; distribution or disposal of assets; changes in the nature of its business; investments; mergers or consolidations with or into third parties; restriction on payment of dividends; transactions with affiliates; and modifications to material agreements in a manner materially adverse to the lender. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the Company's obligations under the credit facility may become immediately due and payable. Events of default include, among others, the Company's failure to pay its obligations under the credit facility when due; the Company's failure to perform any covenant set forth in the credit agreement; the attachment or seizure of a material portion of its assets; an insolvency proceeding is commenced by or against the Company; the Company is restrained from conducting any material part of its business; any judgment in excess of $250,000 is filed against the 95 Company and not released, discharged, bonded against or stayed pending an appeal within 30 days; breach of any material warranty in the credit agreement; breach or termination of a material contract; or the acceleration of, or default in connection with, any indebtedness involving an aggregate amount of $250,000 or more. NOTE 8HEDGING: The Company has foreign subsidiaries that operate and sell its products in various global markets. As a result, the Company is exposed to risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the functional currencies of its subsidiaries and other currencies. At any point in time, the Company might use various hedging instruments, primarily forward contracts, to mitigate the exposures associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The Company records its hedges of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities at fair value, with the related gains or losses recorded in foreign exchange gain (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The foreign exchange gains and losses on these contracts were substantially offset by transaction losses and gains on the underlying balances being hedged. In addition, at December 31, 2005, the Company had foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities that were not hedged. Net foreign exchange losses for years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 were approximately $0.7 million, $1.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2005, the Company held forward contracts for yen and pound sterling with aggregate notional values of $59.5 million and $40.1 million, respectively. NOTE 9INCOME TAXES: The components of income (loss) before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2003 through December 31, 2005 are as follows (in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 United States $ 42,323 $ (76,817 ) $ (24,822 ) Foreign 1,775 2,640 (5,893 ) Income (loss) before income taxes $ 44,098 $ (74,177 ) $ (30,715 ) Income tax expense for 2005 relates primarily to foreign withholding taxes of $3.8 million related to license and royalty payments received and foreign withholding taxes of $1.8 million on a payment received from a supplier. Income tax expense for 2004 includes $0.3 million related to federal and state income taxes and $1.1 million in foreign income taxes (including $0.2 million related to income derived from foreign license revenue). Income tax expense for 2003 includes $2.5 million related to state income taxes, which resulted primarily from the State of California's decision during the third quarter of 2002 to retroactively suspend the state income tax net operating loss deduction for a two-year period, $1.0 million in foreign income taxes and $0.7 million in federal alternative minimum taxes. 96 The tax effects of temporary differences, including amounts related to stock options, that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented below (in thousands): As of December 31, 2004 2005 Deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities: Net operating loss carryforwards $ 57,413 $ 61,724 Depreciation and amortization 753 901 Research credit carryforwards 2,818 3,445 Stock compensation 471 451 Deferred license revenue and product margin 7,490 10,607 Reserves and accruals 11,878 19,168 80,823 96,296 Less: valuation allowance (80,823 ) (96,296 ) $  $  The Company has established a 100% valuation allowance since currently it is more likely than not that no benefit will be realized for its deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance increased by $31.5 million in 2004 and $15.5 million in 2005. At December 31, 2005, the valuation allowance includes approximately $21.2 million, which is attributable to stock option plans, the benefit from which will be credited to additional paid in capital when recognized. Total income tax expense differs from the expected tax expense as a result of the following: December 31, 2003 2004 2005 Federal statutory tax rate 35.0 % (35.0 )% (35.0 )% State tax expense, net of federal benefit 3.8 % 0.1 % 0.0 % Foreign tax 2.3 % 2.2 % 17.9 % Net operating losses and other deductions not benefited (33.1 )% 34.5 % 35.0 % Federal alternative minimum tax 1.5 % 0.0 % 0.0 % 9.5 % 1.8 % 17.9 % At December 31, 2005, for federal, state and foreign income tax reporting purposes the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $160.0 million, $104.0 million, and $2.0 million, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. At December 31, 2005, the Company had federal research credits and state research credits of approximately $2.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively, available to offset future taxes. The federal operating loss and research credit carry forwards will begin to expire in 2011 if not utilized. The state operating loss carry forwards will begin to expire in 2006, if not utilized. The state research credits have no expiration date. The foreign operating loss carry forward will begin to expire in 2010, if not utilized. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company. In the event the Company has a change in ownership, as defined in the Tax Reform Act, utilization of the carry forwards could be restricted. 97 NOTE 10STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY: Preferred Stock The Company is authorized to issue 10 million shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2005 there was no preferred stock issued or outstanding. The Board of Directors has the authority to issue the preferred stock in one or more series and to fix rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, and the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. Common Stock Warrants The following warrants to purchase common stock were outstanding at December 31, 2004 (in thousands, except per share amounts): Date Issued Exercise Price Number of Shares (Common Stock Equivalents) Black-Scholes Value Per Share Reason Number of Shares Outstanding at December 31, 2003 and 2004 May-July 2000 $ 3.09 644 $ 4.712 Bridge financing 24 June-Sept. 2000 $ 8.00 345 $ 6.470 Bridge financing 17 41 All unexercised outstanding warrants expired on May 31, 2005.

The fair value of the shares retired to effect the net purchases ranged from $5.44 to $21.10 per share (weighted average$13.74) of common stock. No warrants were exercised in 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2005, warrants for the purchase of 24,271 shares at $3.09 per share of common stock were exercised on a net basis resulting in the issuance of 9,478 shares of common stock. The fair value of the shares retired to effect the net purchases was $5.07 per share of common stock. NOTE 11STOCK OPTION PLANS: The 1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan The Company's1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan is divided into three separate equity programs: the option grant program, the stock issuance program and the stock bonus program. Under the Plan, the exercise price per share of the stock options granted to employees, members of its Board of Directors or consultants may not be less than 85% (110% for a 10% stockholder) of the fair market value on the option grant date. Incentive options may only be granted to employees and the exercise price per share could not be less than 100% of the fair market value per share of its common stock on the option grant date. Each option is exercisable as determined by the Board of Directors for all of the option shares and has a maximum term of ten years from the date of the grant. The Company has the right to repurchase, at the time of cessation of employment, at the exercise price paid per share any unvested shares, as established by its Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had reserved 690,467 shares for options remaining outstanding under the Plan, all of which were fully vested. The 2000 Equity Incentive Plan On January 21, 2000, the Company's Board of Directors adopted the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan subject to stockholder approval. The 2000 Equity Incentive Plan became effective on the date of the 98 Company's initial public offering and was amended in April 2004. The Plan is the successor to its 1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan. The 2000 Equity Incentive Plan authorizes the award of options, restricted stock awards and stock bonuses. The exercise price of incentive stock options must be at least equal to the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The exercise price of incentive stock options granted to 10% or greater stockholders must be at least equal to 110% of the fair market value of its common stock on the date of grant. The exercise price of nonqualified stock options must be at least equal to 85% of the fair market value of its common stock on the date of grant. The Company initially reserved 8,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance under this plan was increased to include shares of its common stock reserved under the 1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan that were not issued or subject to outstanding grants on the date of its initial public offering. The number of shares reserved for issuance under this plan is further increased to include: any shares of common stock issued under the 1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan that are repurchased by the Company at the original purchase price; any shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of options granted under the 1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan that expired or became unexercisable without having been exercised in full. In addition, under the terms of the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan, the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plan increase automatically on January 1 of each year by an amount equal to 5% of the total outstanding shares of common stock as of the immediately preceding December 31. The Board of Directors or its Compensation Committee may reduce the amount of the increase in any particular year. The 2000 Equity Incentive Plan will terminate on January 20, 2010, unless the Board of Directors terminates it earlier. Stock option activity under the 1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan and the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan for the period from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2005 is summarized below (in thousands, except per share amounts): Options Outstanding Shares Available for Grant Number of Shares Exercise Price Weighted Average Exercise Price Balances, January 1, 2003 1,278 16,660 $ 0.08-8.00 $ 2.416 Additional shares reserved 3,318  Options granted (5,250 ) 5,250 3.45-23.65 10.591 Options exercised  (4,463 ) 0.08-8.00 2.187 Options canceled 748 (748 ) 0.92-8.00 1.961 Balances, December 31, 2003 94 16,699 0.08-23.65 5.070 Additional shares reserved 3,902  Options granted (4,150 ) 4,150 5.13-18.20 9.773 Options exercised  (960 ) 0.20-11.20 1.984 Options canceled 325 (325 ) 0.92-20.30 9.322 Balances, December 31, 2004 171 19,564 0.08-23.65 6.149 Additional shares reserved 3,962  Options granted (2,493 ) 2,493 2.68-8.48 5.734 Options exercised  (1,193 ) 0.08-8.00 1.521 Options canceled 1,106 (1,106 ) 0.92-20.30 10.095 Balances, December 31, 2005 2,745 19,759 $ 0.20-23.65 $ 6.155 99 The 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan On January 21, 2000, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which became effective on the first business day on which price quotations for its common stock were available on the Nasdaq National Market. The employee stock purchase plan is designed to enable eligible employees to purchase shares of its common stock at 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of such shares at the beginning of an offering period or the end of each six-month segment within such an offering period. The Company initially reserved 1,000,000 shares under this plan for grants to employees. In addition, under the terms of the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the number of shares of its common stock reserved for issuance under the plan increase automatically on January 1 of each year by an amount equal to 1% of its total outstanding shares of common stock as of the immediately preceding December 31.

Samsung has guaranteed a certain allocation of its flash memory production capacity to the Company. Under the supply agreement, purchases are priced based on an agreed upon methodology and Samsung provides the Company with intellectual property indemnification for the products the Company purchases from Samsung. Either party can terminate the supply agreement in the event of the other party's breach of the agreement or bankruptcy. The Company is not obligated to purchase minimum volumes of flash memory from Samsung. The Company also has a supply agreement with UMC under which the Company purchases semiconductor wafers used by the Company in the manufacture of controllers. The purchase commitment for such wafers is generally restricted to a forecasted time horizon based on a rolling forecast of our anticipated purchase orders. This agreement expires on December 31, 2006 unless the agreement is extended. If the Company does not extend the agreement, the Company intends to continue to purchase wafers from UMC on a purchase order basis. We have also entered into a supply agreement with SMI, whereby SMI supplies us with controllers for certain of our digital media products. We are obligated to provide rolling forecasts to SMI and SMI has agreed to maintain a buffer stock to meet our needs. SMI also provides us with standard warranty and indemnity protections. This agreement runs through September 2007 and may be terminated by either party in the event of the other party's bankruptcy or breach of the agreement. The Company depends on third party subcontractors for assembly and testing of its digital media products. The Company does not have long-term agreements with these subcontractors. Instead, the Company procures services from these subcontractors on a per-order basis. These third party 101 subcontractors typically purchase certain components to be used in the manufacture and assembly of its digital media products. If the Company was to not use these components, these subcontractors may claim that the cost of these products is the Company's responsibility. The Company enters into partnerships programs with companies for branded products. As part of these programs, the Company may have royalty programs based on sales, with targets in the agreements. If these targets are not met, the recourse may be termination of these programs, depending on the terms of the contract. The Company has entered into an exclusive multi-year agreement with Kodak under which the Company will manufacture and distribute a full range of branded memory cards. The management of the Kodak business could adversely affect the Company's revenues and gross margins if the Company is, among other things, unable to: properly manage the distribution and use of the brand; control the sales and marketing expenses associated with launching the brand in new channels; plan for anticipated changes in demand; effectively leverage the brand to achieve premium pricing and grow market share; maintain the market share position of the Lexar brand; and appropriately allocate resources to support a dual branding strategy. In the future, a meaningful portion of the Company's revenue may be derived from sales of digital media under the Kodak brand. The Company has a number of obligations that the Company must fulfill under its agreement with Kodak to keep the license exclusive and to keep it in effect. These obligations include compliance with Kodak guidelines and trademark usage, customer satisfaction, and the requirement that the Company meets market share goals and target minimum royalty payments. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has not met these targets. As a result, Kodak may in the future have the right to make the Company's license non-exclusive or to terminate the Company's license in its entirety. If the Company was to lose the rights to sell products under the Kodak brand, its financial results could be significantly negatively impacted. NOTE 14CONTINGENCIES: Indemnifications The Company is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which the Company may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically these obligations arise in connection with sales contracts and license agreements under which the Company customarily agrees to hold the other party harmless against any losses incurred as a result of a claim by any third party with respect to its products. The Company also typically agrees to pay any costs incurred in defense of any such claim. The terms of the indemnification obligations are generally perpetual from the effective date of the agreement. In certain cases, there are limits and exceptions to its potential liability for indemnification relating to intellectual property infringement claims. The Company cannot estimate the amount of potential future payments, if any, that the Company might be required to make as a result of these agreements. To date, the amounts required to defend indemnification claims have been insignificant. Accordingly, the Company did not accrue any amounts for these indemnification obligations. The Company has agreements whereby its directors and officers are indemnified for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is serving at its request in such capacity. The maximum amount of future payment the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, the Company has a directors' and officers' insurance policy that reduces its exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of its 102 insurance policy coverage, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. Accordingly, the Company did not record any liabilities for these agreements. Litigation with Toshiba The Company is involved in three separate lawsuits with Toshiba as follows: Lexar Media, Inc. v. Toshiba Corporation, Toshiba America, Inc. and Toshiba America Electronics Corporation On November 4, 2002, the Company filed a lawsuit in Santa Clara County Superior Court against Toshiba Corporation, Toshiba America, Inc. and Toshiba America Electronics Corporation ("TAEC") alleging theft of trade secrets and breach of fiduciary duty. The Company later filed an amended complaint to add violation of California Business and Professions Code Section 17200 and to drop without prejudice claims against Toshiba America, Inc. The basis of the Company's allegations were that since the Company's inception in 1996, and including the period from 1997 through 1999 when Toshiba was represented on its Board of Directors, Toshiba had access to and was presented with details of its strategy as well as its methods of achieving high performance flash devices that Toshiba has now incorporated into its flash chips and flash systems. Trial began on February 7, 2005, and after a six-week trial, on March 23, 2005 the jury found that Toshiba Corporation and TAEC misappropriated the Company's trade secrets and breached their fiduciary duty to the Company. The jury awarded the Company $255.4 million in damages for Toshiba's misappropriation of trade secrets. The jury also awarded the Company $58.7 million in damages for Toshiba's breach of fiduciary duty, $58.7 million in damages for TAEC's breach of fiduciary duty and $8.2 million in prejudgment interest for breach of fiduciary duty. The jury also found Toshiba and TAEC's breach of fiduciary duty was oppressive, fraudulent or malicious which supported an award of punitive damages. On March 25, 2005, the jury awarded an additional $84.0 million in punitive damages. The total of these awarded damages is over $465.0 million. On October 5, 2005, the Superior Court of the State of California entered a Statement of Decision in which it found that Toshiba engaged in unfair or unlawful competition, thereby violating California Business and Professions Code Section 17200. However, the Court declined the Company's request to enter an injunction against Toshiba flash memory products that incorporate its trade secrets and further declined to order any additional monetary relief. On December 2, 2005, the Court issued an order granting defendants' motion for a new trial on the economic and monetary awards for misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of fiduciary duty. The Court denied defendants' motion for a new trial on all other grounds and also denied the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The effect of the Court's order is that the jury's damage award of approximately $465 million has been set aside and interest will not accrue on this amount. Both defendants and the Company have appealed the Court's December 2, 2005 order. Defendants have appealed from those portions of the order that denies them a new trial on liability and denies their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The Company has appealed from that portion of the order that grants defendants a new trial on damages. Defendants have also protectively cross-appealed from the judgment, meaning that should the order granting a new trial on damages be set aside, the Court of Appeals would need to address aspects of the judgment that defendants challenge in that context. In all events, because of the parties' cross appeals from the new trial order, the Court of Appeals will address both damages and liability issues presented by the jury's verdict. If the briefing goes as expected, the Company expects that the Court of Appeals will hold argument on the appeals in the third or fourth quarter of 2007. There are a number of possible dispositions of the appeal, including an across-the-board affirmance of the order granting a new 103 damages trial and denying defendants' motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. If this occurs, and if the Supreme Court does not grant review of the Court of Appeal's decision, the new damages trial would likely take place in the Santa Clara County Superior Court in 2008. If the Supreme Court granted review, however, the appellate proceedings would likely not conclude until 2010, with a new damages trial possible thereafter. Toshiba Corporation v. Lexar Media, Inc.; Lexar Media, Inc. v. Toshiba Corporation On November 1, 2002, Toshiba Corporation filed a lawsuit seeking declaratory judgment that Toshiba does not infringe the Company's U.S. Patent Nos. 5,479,638; 5,818,781; 5,907,856; 5,930,815; 6,034,897; 6,040,997; 6,134,151; 6,141,249; 6,145,051; 6,172,906; 6,202,138; 6,262,918; 6,374,337; and 6,397,314 or that these patents are invalid. This suit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Toshiba does not seek monetary damages or an injunction in this action. The Company believes that Toshiba's claims are without merit and are contesting this lawsuit vigorously. On November 21, 2002, the Company filed an answer and counterclaim in which the Company alleged that Toshiba infringes its U.S. Patent Nos. 5,818,781; 5,907,856; 5,930,815; 6,034,897; 6,040,997; 6,134,151; 6,172,906; 6,202,138; and 6,374,337. The Company sought an injunction and damages against Toshiba. On December 20, 2002, Toshiba filed its first amended complaint in which Toshiba dropped its allegations that our patents are unenforceable. On February 28, 2003, the Company filed an answer and our first amended counterclaim against Toshiba for infringement of our U.S. Patent Nos. 5,479,638; 5,818,781; 5,907,856; 5,930,815; 6,034,897; 6,040,997; 6,134,151; 6,141,249; 6,145,051; 6,172,906; 6,202,138; 6,262,918; 6,374,337; and 6,397,314. The Company is seeking damages as well as an injunction against Toshiba for its products that the Company alleges infringe our patents, including its flash memory chips, flash cards and digital cameras. Claim construction in our litigation against Toshiba was held in August 2004. The Court issued a claim construction ruling on January 24, 2005. The Company believes that the claim construction ruling favorably construes the claims of the Company's patents. This case has been coordinated for discovery purposes with the Company's litigation against Pretec Electronics Corporation ("Pretec"), PNY Technologies, Inc. ("PNY"), Memtek Products, Inc. ("Memtek") and C-One. Discovery has now commenced as to all defendants. The Lexar patents at issue in the first phase of the litigation will be Lexar's U.S. Patent Nos. 5,479,638 entitled "Flash Memory Mass Storage Architecture Incorporation Wear Leveling Technique"; 6,145,051 entitled "Moving Sectors Within Block of Information in a Flash Memory Mass Storage Architecture"; 6,397,314 entitled "Increasing The Memory Performance Of Flash Memory Devices By Writing Sectors Simultaneously To Multiple Flash Memory Device"; 6,202,138 entitled "Increasing The Memory Performance Of Flash Memory Devices By Writing Sectors Simultaneously To Multiple Flash"; 6,262,918 entitled "Space Management For Managing High Capacity Nonvolatile Memory"; and 6,040,997 entitled "Flash Memory Leveling Architecture Having No External Latch." The parties have now mutually dismissed with prejudice all claims regarding U.S. Patent No. 6,172,906. On June 8, 2005, the Court issued a scheduling order that bifurcated discovery and trial issues relating to infringement from those relating to willfulness and damages. The current schedule anticipates that discovery will be completed in the second calendar quarter of 2006. The Court has indicated that it expects to hold a further status conference in the second half of 2006 at which time it will rule on the timing and sequence of trial in the various actions. The Company expects that a trial will take place in one of the patent actions in late 2006 or the first half of 2007. 104 Toshiba Corporation v. Lexar Media, Inc. On January 13, 2003, Toshiba Corporation filed a lawsuit against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that the Company infringes Toshiba's U.S. Patent Nos. 5,546,351; 5,724,300; 5,793,696; 5,946,231; 5,986,933; 6,145,023; 6,292,850; and 6,338,104. On February 7, 2003, Toshiba Corporation filed an amended complaint and now alleges that the Company infringes Toshiba's U.S. Patent Nos. 5,546,351; 5,724,300; 5,793,696; 5,946,231; 5,986,933; 6,094,697; 6,292,850; 6,338,104; and 5,611,067. In this action, Toshiba Corporation seeks injunctive relief and damages. Toshiba's patents appear to primarily relate to flash components that the Company purchases from vendors who provide the Company with indemnification. On March 5, 2003, the Company filed an answer in which it is seeking a judgment that it does not infringe these patents or that they are invalid or unenforceable. The Company believes that Toshiba's claims are without merit and intend to contest this lawsuit vigorously. Discovery in this case has commenced. This case has been coordinated with the other patent litigation currently pending. As discussed above, the current schedule anticipates that discovery will be completed in the second calendar quarter of 2006. The Court has indicated that it expects to hold a further status conference in the second half of 2006 at which time it will rule on the timing and sequence of trial in the various actions. The Company expects that a trial will take place in one of the patent actions in late 2006 or the first half of 2007. At this time, The Company is unable to reasonably estimate the possible range of loss for this proceeding and, accordingly, has not recorded any associated liabilities in its consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2005. Litigation Against Fuji, Memtek and PNY On July 11, 2002, the Company filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against Fuji Photo Film USA ("Fuji"), Memtek and PNY for patent infringement. The Company alleged that the defendants infringe its U.S. Patent Nos. 5,479,638; 5,907,856; 5,930,815; 6,034,897; 6,134,151; 6,141,249; 6,145,051; and 6,262,918. The Company sought injunctive relief and damages against all defendants. On November 4, 2002, the Company filed an amended complaint against Fuji. In the amended complaint, the Company alleges that Fuji infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 5,479,638; 6,141,249; 6,145,051; 6,262,918; and 6,397,314 through the sale of its flash memory products and digital cameras. The Company is seeking injunctive relief and damages against Fuji, Memtek and PNY are no longer parties to this particular action. On December 9, 2002, Fuji filed an answer in which they sought declaratory relief that they do not infringe the five patents named in the suit as well as the Company's U.S. Patent Nos. 5,907,856; 5,930,815; 6,034,897; and 6,134,151. On January 8, 2003, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas ordered this case transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California where it is now pending. In a second amended complaint, the Company added counterclaims for infringement on the additional patents for which Fuji has sought declaratory relief, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,907,856; 5,930,815; 6,034,897; and 6,134,151. Discovery in this case has commenced. This case has been coordinated with the other patent litigation currently pending. As discussed above, the current schedule anticipates that discovery will be completed in the second calendar quarter of 2006. The Court has indicated that it expects to hold a further status conference in the second half of 2006 at which time it will rule on the timing and sequence of trial in the various actions. The Company expects that a trial will take place in one of the patent actions in late 2006 or the first half of 2007. 105 On September 16, 2005, Fuji filed a lawsuit against the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging that certain of the Company's flash cards infringe Fuji's U.S. Patent No.'s 5,303,198; 5,386,539; and 5,390,148. In this action, Fuji seeks injunctive relief and damages. On February 14, 2006, the Court granted the Company's motion to transfer this case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California where it is now pending. The Company believes that Fuji's claims are without merit and intend to contest this lawsuit vigorously. At this time, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the possible range of loss for this proceeding and, accordingly, has not recorded any associated liabilities in its consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2005. Litigation Against Pretec, PNY, Memtek and C-One On December 22, 2000, the Company sued Pretec and PNY for patent infringement. The Company sued Pretec and PNY on the basis of four patents: U.S. Patent Nos. 5,818,781; 5,907,856; 5,930,815; and 6,145,051. The suit is pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The Company is seeking injunctive relief and damages against all defendants. On April 13, 2001, the Company filed an amended complaint in its litigation with Pretec and PNY, naming Memtek as an additional defendant. On June 26, 2001, the Court allowed the Company to file its second amended complaint in our litigation with Pretec and PNY, naming C-One as an additional defendant and adding the Company's U.S. Patent No. 5,479,638 against all of the defendants. In this action the Company alleges that PNY and the other defendants infringe our U.S. Patent Nos. 5,479,638, 5,818,781, 5,907,856, 5,930,815 and 6,145,051. This suit is pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The Company is seeking injunctive relief and damages against all of the defendants. Discovery in this case has commenced. This case has been coordinated with the other patent litigation currently pending. As discussed above, the current schedule anticipates that discovery will be completed in the second calendar quarter of 2006. The Court has indicated that it expects to hold a further status conference in the second half of 2006 at which time it will rule on the timing and sequence of trial in the various actions. The Company expects that a trial will take place in one of the patent actions in late 2006 or the first half of 2007. Litigation With Willem Vroegh On February 20, 2004, an individual, Willem Vroegh, sued the Company, along with Dane-Elec Memory, Fuji, Eastman Kodak Company, Kingston Technology Company, Inc., Memorex, PNY, SanDisk Corporation, Verbatim Corporation, and Viking InterWorks, alleging that the description of the capacity of the parties' flash memory cards is false and misleading under California Business and Professions Code Sections 17200 and 17500. The plaintiff has also asserted allegations for breach of contract, common law claims of fraud, deceit and misrepresentation; as well as a violation of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act, California Civil Code Sec. 175, all arising out of the same set of facts. Plaintiff seeks restitution, disgorgement, compensatory damages and injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. In February 2006, the Company and other defendants entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs, subject to approval by the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco, pursuant to which the defendants agreed to: (i) provide class members with either: (A) a cash refund equal to 5% of the purchase price for each flash memory device purchased; or (B) a 10% discount towards the purchase of a new flash memory device; and (ii) make disclosures on future packaging about the useable capacity of the defendants' flash memory devices and (iii) pay up to $2,400,000 in the 106 aggregate in attorneys' fees and expenses to plaintiffs' counsel. As of December 31, 2005, the Company estimated its portion of the attorney's fees and expenses along with its estimate of the cost of the rebate or discount programs to the Company, in connection with the settlement. Stockholder Litigation In March 2006, following the announcement of the Company's agreement for the Company to be acquired by Micron Technology, Inc. in a stock-for-stock merger, the Company, along with its directors, were named as defendants in several lawsuits purporting to be class actions in the Superior Court for the State of California for the County of Alameda. Those actions are brought allegedly on behalf of a class of plaintiffs who are holders of our stock and assert claims that the defendants engaged in self-dealing and breached their fiduciary duties by agreeing to the merger. One of the suits also names Micron as a defendant. The claims are based on allegations that, among other things, the consideration to be paid to stockholders in the proposed merger is unfair and inadequate. Plaintiffs seek, among other things, a declaration that the defendants have breached their fiduciary duties, injunctive relief (including enjoining the consummation of the transaction or rescinding the transaction if consummated), unspecified compensatory and/or rescissory damages, fees and costs, and other relief. At this time, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the possible range of loss for these stockholder litigation matters and, accordingly, has not recorded any associated liabilities on its consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2005. NOTE 15RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS: During the first quarter of 2004, the Company's Executive Vice President, Engineering and Chief Technology Officer, repaid in cash an aggregate of approximately $0.5 million in outstanding principal and interest due under promissory notes held by the Company related to stock option exercises by such stockholder. NOTE 16RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payments", ("SFAS No. 123(R)"). SFAS No. 123(R) requires employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans to be accounted for under the fair value method, and eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, and allowed under the original provisions of SFAS No. 123. SFAS No. 123(R) requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value, which is amortized to expense over the service periods. The requirements of SFAS No. 123(R) are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. SFAS No. 123(R) allows for either prospective recognition of compensation expense or retrospective recognition, which may be back to the original issuance of SFAS No. 123 or only to interim periods in the year of adoption. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.107, "Share-Based Payments," ("SAB 107"). SAB107 expresses views of the SEC staff regarding the interaction between SFAS No. 123(R) and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides the SEC staff's views regarding the valuation of share-based payment arrangements for public companies. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123(R). Based on options outstanding which have been granted through December 31, 2005, the Company estimates that additional compensation expense will range from $5.0 million to $7.0 million in 2006 (in addition to the expense recognition of the unamortized December 31, 2005 stock-based compensation balance of $9.4 million) due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). This estimated impact excludes the effect of any new options granted or termination taking place subsequent to December 31, 2005. The overall impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements will be dependent on the option-pricing model used to compute fair value and the inputs to that model such as volatility and expected life. Accordingly, actual stock-based compensation expense may differ materially from the Company's current estimates. 107 In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") Nos. FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, "The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments," which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired, whether that impairment is other-than-temporary, and the measurement of an impairment loss. This FSP also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. The FSP is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company does not expect the adoption of this FSP in the first quarter of 2006 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections: a Replacement of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3" ("SFAS No. 154"). SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application for voluntary changes in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to do so. Retrospective application refers to the application of a different accounting principle to previously issued financial statements as if that principle had always been used. SFAS No. 154's retrospective application requirement replaces APB No 20's ("Accounting Changes") requirement to recognize most voluntary changes in accounting principle by including in net income (loss) of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 defines retrospective application as the application of a different accounting principle to prior accounting periods as if that principle had always been used or as the adjustment of previously issued financial statements to reflect a change in the reporting entity. SFAS No. 154 also redefines "restatement" as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error. The requirements of SFAS No. 154 are effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 and will only impact the consolidated financial statements in periods in which a change in accounting principle is made. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153 ("SFAS No. 153"), "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assetsan amendment of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 29" ("APB No. 29" or the "Opinion"). The guidance in APB No. 29, "Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions", is based on the principle that gains or losses on exchanges of nonmonetary assets may be recognized based on the differences in the fair values of the assets exchanged. The guidance in that Opinion, however, included certain exceptions to that principle which allowed the asset received to be recognized at the book value of the asset surrendered. SFAS No. 153 amends APB No. 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for "exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance". A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. The provisions of SFAS No. 153 should be applied prospectively, and are effective for the Company for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring from the third quarter of 2005. Earlier application is permitted for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in the Company's first quarter of 2005. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting of Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations" ("FIN 47"). FIN 47 clarifies that an entity must record a liability for a "conditional" asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 in the fourth quarter of 2005 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costsan amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin ("ARB") No. 43, Chapter 4" ("ARB No. 43, Chapter 4"). SFAS No. 151 amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, "Inventory Pricing," to clarify the accounting for 108 abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). Paragraph 5 of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 previously stated that "... under some circumstances, items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges...." SFAS No. 151 requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of "so abnormal." In addition, this Statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 is effective for the Company for inventory costs incurred beginning in 2006. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. NOTE 17SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On March 8, 2006, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement with Micron Technology, Inc. and a wholly owned subsidiary of Micron. The merger agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions provided in the merger agreement, Micron's subsidiary will merge with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation of the merger. As a result of the merger: (i) the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Micron; and (ii) each outstanding share of the Company's common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.5625 shares of Micron common stock and Micron will assume stock options held by employees of the Company at the closing date with a per share exercise price of $9.00 or lower. 109 ITEM 9 CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not applicable. ITEM 9A CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 require public companies to maintain "disclosure controls and procedures," which are defined as a company's controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, based on their evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, concluded that, as a result of the material weaknesses discussed below in "Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting," our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that the foregoing objectives are achieved. Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 based upon the criteria issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. As of December 31, 2005, management determined the following material weaknesses existed in the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Revenue recognition: We did not maintain effective controls to ensure revenue and deferred revenue accounts were accurately recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Specifically, we did not maintain effective controls to accurately: (i) account for all price reductions and promotional commitments, including rebate programs offered to customers; (ii) record deferred revenue based on actual sales price and inventory movements; (iii) record revenue and inventory adjustments for returns of product by customers; and (iv) record concessions provided to certain customers as a reduction of revenue from such customers. 110 Accounting for Inventory: We did not maintain effective controls over the existence and valuation of inventory. Specifically, we did not maintain effective controls to: (i) accurately track, confirm and reconcile inventory movements to ensure the timely recognition of cost of product revenues; (ii) ensure the existence of inventory and the appropriate valuation of returned inventory; (iii) identify and accurately adjust inventory excess and slow moving products or components and record necessary write-downs of inventory to lower of cost or market; and (iv) accurately accrue for the obligation to purchase inventory at costs in excess of net realizable value. These control deficiencies resulted in audit adjustments to revenues, accounts receivable, cost of product revenues, deferred revenue, sales related accruals, and inventory and inventory valuation reserves and related accruals in our 2005 consolidated financial statements. Additionally, these control deficiencies could result in a misstatement to the aforementioned accounts that would result in a material misstatement to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, management has determined that these control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses. Because of these material weaknesses, management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. Our management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2005, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management's Remediation Initiatives We have taken the following steps toward remediation of the material weaknesses identified above: Revenue recognition: We have taken the following remediation actions to ensure revenue and deferred revenue are accurately recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles: Instituted controls to review sales related accruals in more detail by customer and incentive program; Enhanced information technology systems to automate controls and procedures; and Continued to increase training and awareness to sales and marketing representatives on our processes and procedures. Accounting for inventory: We have taken the following remediation actions to improve our internal control over the existence and valuation of inventory: Performance of monthly reconciliations of inventory movements and period end inventory on hand to information obtained from our subcontractors and resellers; Performance of additional and more frequent inventory observations to validate the existence of inventory recorded in our financial reporting systems; Increased management oversight of the analysis and review of inventory valuation reserves; and 111 Enhanced information technology systems to automate controls and procedures. We believe that these corrective actions, taken as a whole, when fully implemented, will mitigate the control deficiencies identified above. However, we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these actions and will make any changes that management determines appropriate.
